0,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 04:25PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Makes Upbeat Start to Week as Trade Optimism Triggers Rally,"Investing.com - Wall Street closed higher Monday on trade optimism as the U.S. and China resumed talks and a jump in consumer discretionary stocks, led by Amazon, also lifted sentiment.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.42%. The S&P 500 added 0.67%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.26%.
Wall Street made an upbeat start to the week as the U.S. and China resumed trade talks, raising investor hopes that both parties could hash out a deal during the 90-day trade-war ceasefire, which ends on March 1.
U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross told CNBC that he believes there's a ""very good chance"" the U.S. will get ""a reasonable settlement"" that addresses all of the key issues.
The talks were reportedly held at a vice ministerial level and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, a top economic adviser to Chinese President Xi Jinping, made an unexpected appearance at the meetings on Monday, Reuters reported, citing a person familiar with the discussions.
The U.S. has slapped tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, about half the value of U.S. imports from the country. China has retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion worth of American exports.
Beyond trade, consumer discretionary stocks led the market higher, supported by a surge in Amazon.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) closed 3.4% higher as Pivotal Research Group said the e-commerce giant's stock has further room to advance, slapping a $1,920 price target on the company's shares, about 18% above the stock's closing price.
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) also supported the consumer discretionary sector as investors welcomed Starboard Value's 1.7% investment in the company, as well as it plans to improve performance.
Energy continued its recovery from a slump last month, propping up the broader market on rising oil prices as the market absorbed OPEC supply cuts, while data pointing to a fall in Cushing stockpiles also supported sentiment.
Tech caught a bid on a surge in Neflix after the streaming giant dominated the Golden Globes, picking up five awards, the most of any network or streaming service, sending its shares soaring 6%.
Among other FANG stocks, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shrugged off another bearish call from Wall Street.
Facebook pared intraday losses to close flat even as Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser reaffirmed his “sell” rating on the company’s stock and warned Facebook’s problems are ""likely to worsen"" in 2019.
On the corporate front, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rallied 5.4% as construction of its new manufacturing plant in China got underway.
Initial construction work is expected to be completed this summer and Model 3 production estimated by the end of the year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a series of tweets.
Top S&P 500 Gainers and Losers Today:
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), up 8.3%,  Nektar Therapeutics  (NASDAQ:NKTR), up 7.8%, and Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), up 7.7%, were among the top S&P 500 gainers for the session.
Pacific Gas & Electric (NYSE:PCG), down 22.4%, Lamb Weston (NYSE:LW), down 6.6%, and  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT), down 6.5%, were among the worst S&P 500 performers of the session."

The ministry told Reuters in a statement the figure, reported on Monday by the Valor Economico newspaper, was only one of several proposals passed to the transition team of President Jair Bolsonaro by his predecessor Michel Temer. The final amount has not yet been decided, the ministry said.
The report that $14 billion had been agreed to settle the dispute helped boost the common shares of Petrobras, as the company is known, as much as 5.5 percent. Common shares closed Monday 3.3 percent up and preferred rose 1.6 percent, against a 0.15 percent decline in the benchmark Bovespa index.
Settling on a figure would be a major step forward in the long-running dispute and help Petrobras cut its sizeable net debt, which stood at $73 billion as of the third quarter.
At times during negotiations, Petrobras has claimed that it is owed as much as $30 billion, while parts of the government has said Petrobras owed money to the state.
On Wednesday, Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque said he expected the dispute to be resolved within 100 days, and that Petrobras was the creditor in the dispute. The amount Petrobras was owed and the form of payment was still under discussion, he added.
A dispute over the area in question dates back to 2010, when the Brazilian government granted Petrobras the right to extract 5 billion barrels of oil and gas in the offshore Santos Basin. The government received additional shares in Petrobras in return, based on oil prices at the time. 
The volume of oil in the area is now estimated to be much larger, however, and the cash-strapped government wants to sell the rights to extract the extra oil. The choice reserves cannot be auctioned until the government and Petrobras resolve a dispute over the 2010 transaction.
Among other things, the contract stipulated that costs would be reviewed after the area was declared commercially viable in 2014, which has led to years of sparring as oil prices have fluctuated.

ROME/MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's government is set to approve a decree to provide state guarantees for bonds issued by Banca Carige (MI:CRGI) after administrators at the troubled bank held a series of meetings earlier on Monday on the lender's rescue, sources told Reuters.
The sources said the cabinet was scheduled to meet at 9.00 p.m. (2000 GMT) on Monday to sign off on the legislation.
The European Central Bank (ECB) last week selected three commissioners to try to save the Genoa-based bank after the Malacalza family, Carige's biggest stakeholder, blocked a share issue that was part of an industry-financed scheme to stave off a collapse. 
Italy's FITD depositors protection fund bought a 320 million euro ($366 million) hybrid bond late last year to help Carige to reach a required total capital threshold.
Carige, however, failed to gain shareholder backing for an up to 400 million euro new share issue that would have been guaranteed by the bond's conversion into equity.
Earlier on Monday the administrators met Treasury Minister Giovanni Tria before going on to meet top managers at FITD but no details of what was discussed were released.
A person familiar with the matter said the meeting with FITD would broach the possibility of lowering the bond's interest payments.
Carige was not immediately available for a comment.
COUPON RAISED
Carige's failure to approve the capital increase triggered a stepping up of the coupon to 16 percent from 13 percent. That represents 51 million euros in annual interest, further stretching the loss-making bank's finances.
Maccarone said a reduction in the coupon would require a complex approval process and is unlikely.
The fund's contributors are other Italian lenders that came to Carige's rescue when the sector is under pressure from slowing economic growth and rising borrowing costs under the country's Eurosceptic government. 
Carige or supervisory authorities can decide to convert the bond into equity if the bank's core capital falls below minimum requirements, a document on Carige website shows.
The bank's capital ratio stood at 10.8 percent at the end of September - above an ECB minimum threshold of 9.63 percent, though the ECB will soon set a new threshold for Carige for 2019.
Raffaele Lener, one of the three commissioners running Carige, said in a newspaper interview published on Monday that the bank had to negotiate ""a different solution"" with the fund given the current situation with the bond.
The UILCA union threatened a strike if commissioners failed to provide ""answers and commitments"" at a meeting on Tuesday.
""We won't accept empty promises. We don't rule out a strike and a protest in Rome ... if a solution is not found,"" UILCA head Massimo Masi said in a statement.
MERGER HOPES?
Lener also told la Repubblica's Affari&Finanza supplement that the bank would need to seek approval from market watchdog Consob for a resumption in trading of Carige shares and bonds, which are currently suspended. 
He said the suspension was an issue for the bank's image and liquidity but a capital increase may not be necessary if the bank can quickly find a merger partner or manage to overhaul its business.
The ECB has told Carige to consider a merger with a stronger peer.
However, bankers say that Carige, which has sold off its best assets in recent years, is overly exposed to the depressed local economy and has little appeal for potential buyers.
In a move that could help with a potential sale, state-owned bad debt firm SGA has had preliminary contact with Carige to buy the bank's impaired loans, a source familiar with the matter has told Reuters.
""It could be a solution ... that has advantages for everyone,"" Lener said in his newspaper interview.

8,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 03:20PM ET</span>",Canada auto union head to meet with GM on Tuesday,"TORONTO (Reuters) - The head of Canada's auto union said on Monday he was set to meet with General Motors Co (N:GM) executives in Detroit on Tuesday to discuss the automaker's Oshawa, Ontario, assembly plant, scheduled to shut down in December 2019.
Unifor, the union that represents workers at the plant, has vowed to block its closure.
""I have no idea if it's going to be positive or negative,"" Jerry Dias, national president, said in an interview. ""I'm optimistic it will be positive, but I'm not even going to try to guess what they're going to tell us tomorrow.""
After meeting with GM executives in Detroit on Dec. 20, Dias told reporters the automaker would respond to the union's proposals by Monday.
Dias said he did not think Chief Executive Mary Barra would be at the Tuesday meeting. 
He said one option would be to extend operations for nine months, when regular contract talks are scheduled to begin: ""That gives us all time to figure out a long-term solution,"" he said.
The Oshawa shutdown is part of a broad restructuring announced in November. GM also plans to close four U.S. plants, eliminating a total of about 15,000 jobs in North America.
Barra promised in early December to keep an ""open mind"" about another affected plant, Ohio's Lordstown Assembly. 

GM has said the Oshawa closure affects 2,973 assembly line jobs. The company employs 8,150 in Canada.

Brokers and traders have complained for years about what they say are unjustifiably high fees charged by the big U.S. stock exchanges for data on stock trades. The news of the new exchange on Monday pushed down the share prices of the parent companies of the NYSE and Nasdaq.
""The announcement is the latest salvo in the on-going fee battle between exchanges and other market participants, and one which should be taken seriously at least from the perspective of the potential earnings pressure on existing exchanges,"" said Nathan Flanders of Fitch Ratings.
In a joint statement on Monday, the companies creating the new exchange said it would look to increase competition, improve operational transparency, reduce fixed costs and simplify equity trading in the United States. Data fees are one of the biggest costs for brokers.
The venture will be called Members Exchange, or MEMX, and will be funded and controlled by nine institutions: Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC),  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp, E*TRADE Financial Corp, TD Ameritrade Holdings Corp, UBS, Virtu Financial, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity and Citadel.
This is not the first time that industry giants have taken on the established exchanges. A decade ago, a group including Citi,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch backed a low-cost exchange called BATS. Around the same time, other industry heavyweights launched an exchange called Direct Edge with a similar goal of slashing trading costs. The two exchanges quickly gained market share, later merged and are now owned by Cboe Global Markets.
Banks tried a similar move in Europe by setting up Turquoise to trade cross-border shares as a stick to persuade incumbent exchanges to cut data fees. Turquoise partly succeeded in its aim, but ended up being bought by the London Stock Exchange.
Last year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked stock exchanges to do a better job justifying their fees for public market data. It also repealed two data price changes last May for public feeds for Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange-listed securities for the first time. 
MEMX, which plans to offer a simple trading model with basic order types and the latest technology, will also represent the interests of its founders' collective client base of retail and institutional investors.
It will offer ""lower pricing on market data, and connectivity and transaction fees,"" it said.
The big three U.S. exchanges have faced criticism for surging fees for services like data feeds that brokers use to monitor movements in stock prices.
Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) owns the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq is run by Nasdaq Inc and the other exchange is Cboe.
Shares of ICE were down 2.6 percent and those of Nasdaq Inc were 2.8 percent lower. 
In early 2019 MEMX will file an application with the SEC seeking approval to operate as a national securities exchange, according to the statement.
The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) hit back against criticism of bourses on Monday, saying price feeds would not exist but for the role they play.
""The price at which information is licensed is accordingly a commercial matter for each individual consumer and exchange. The WFE stands ready to assist any regulators who are concerned about the role and nature of market data,"" the WFE said.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) fueled a second straight session of gains on Wall Street on Monday, with the resumption of U.S.-China trade talks helping ease concerns that have pummeled the market in recent months.
The benchmark S&P 500's (SPX) advance added to a 3.4 percent surge on Friday, when strong U.S. jobs data eased worries over economic health and the Federal Reserve calmed nerves over interest rate hikes crimping growth.
Fears of a global slowdown have led to a sharp pullback in the markets over the last few months and in analysts' estimates for corporate growth. But after hitting a 20-month low on Christmas Eve, the S&P has gained over 9 percent.
China has the ""good faith"" to work with the United States to resolve trade frictions, China's foreign ministry said, while U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said he saw ""a very good chance that we will get a reasonable settlement"" as the two countries started their first face-to-face talks since a 90-day truce was agreed in December.
""The main thing is the administration's implied progress on talks with China. That's something that market sees as very important,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.
Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors rose. The biggest gain was logged by the consumer discretionary index (SPLRCD), which jumped 2.64 percent, led by a 3.2 percent rise in Amazon. That made Amazon Wall Street's most valuable company at $794 billion, eclipsing Microsoft's market capitalization, which reached $789 billion following a 0.85 percent rise in its stock. 
They and other high-profile technology and consumer stocks have rebounded after falling sharply in the final quarter of 2018.
Much of Monday's upbeat sentiment was an extension of the previous session's rally. 
""The news on Friday was positive, and market participants are now acting more confident, and that is feeding on itself,"" said Tom Martin, a portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta. 
The S&P energy index (SPNY) gained 1.5 percent as oil prices climbed about 3 percent on support from OPEC production cuts. [O/R]
The Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX), which includes many companies dependent on China for revenue, jumped 2.36 percent.
At 2:13 pm ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 0.65 percent at 23,584.85 points, while the S&P 500 (SPX) had gained 0.90 percent to 2,554.7.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 1.28 percent to 6,825.16.
Utilities (SPLRCU) was the only sector down, dragged lower by PG&E Corp's (N:PCG) 22 percent slump. Reuters reported that the California utility is exploring filing for bankruptcy protection related to potential liabilities from wildfires.
With earnings season approaching, investors expect a slowdown in fourth-quarter profit growth and they will scrutinize forecasts for signs of further weakness.
Analysts now estimate S&P 500 companies to increase their fourth-quarter earnings per share by 15 percent. That compares to expectations of 20 percent growth three months ago, according to Refinitiv IBES data. The estimate for 2019 profit growth has fallen to about 7 percent from 10 percent.
 Dollar Tree Inc  (O:DLTR) jumped 5 percent after activist investor Starboard Value LP called on the retailer to sell its underperforming Family Dollar business and proposed replacing a majority of its board.
Loxo Oncology Inc (O:LOXO) surged 66 percent after Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY) said it would buy the cancer drug developer for about $8 billion.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.17-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

17,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 02:13PM ET</span>",U.S. top court declines to take up Fiat Chrysler hacking case,"By Tina Bellon
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear Fiat Chrysler's appeal in a class action lawsuit over allegations that its Jeeps and other trucks are vulnerable to hacking, one of the first legal cases involving automotive cyber security risks.
The court's action paves the way for an October trial in the litigation centering on the question of whether truck buyers can sue over hypothetical future injuries without having been actual victims of cyber security attacks on their vehicles. Fiat Chrysler has received widespread support from industry groups in the dispute.
Three car owners from Illinois, Michigan and Missouri in 2015 sued the U.S. subsidiary of the Italian-controlled carmaker and Harman International Industries (D:HAR), a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co that manufactures the Uconnect infotainment system installed in various Ram, Dodge, Jeep and Chrysler trucks. 
According to the lawsuit, cyber criminals are able to gain access to the infotainment system, allowing them to take over safety-critical functions such as acceleration, braking, steering and ignition. 
The plaintiffs allege that both companies knew about the defects for years, saying cyber security researchers revealed the vulnerabilities as early as 2011. The issue received attention when a 2015 article by technology magazine Wired showed researchers hacking a Jeep Cherokee while it was driving. 
The consumers have said that, had the defects been disclosed, they never would have purchased the vehicles in the first place or paid less for them. They also said the defects reduce their vehicles' resale value. 
Fiat Chrysler and Harman have denied the allegations, calling the lawsuit meritless and saying the plaintiffs lack the necessary legal standing to bring the case.
Fiat Chrysler in a statement said it looked forward to presenting its case at trial.
""None of the more than 200,000 class members in this lawsuit have ever had their vehicles hacked, and the federal safety regulators at NHTSA (the U.S. National Highway Safety Administration) have determined that FCA US has fully corrected the issues raised by the plaintiffs,"" the company said. 
The vulnerabilities were fixed in a 2015 recall, when Fiat Chrysler issued free software updates for the roughly 1.4 million affected trucks. The NHTSA determined the issue to have been fully addressed. 
But U.S. District Judge Michael Reagan in East St. Louis, Illinois, who oversees the litigation, in 2017 denied the companies' request to dismiss the lawsuits. 

Reagan certified classes of consumers for claims of fraudulent concealment, unjust enrichment and violation of various state and federal consumer protection laws. Reagan originally scheduled a jury trial for March, but due to scheduling conflicts on Monday moved the trial to October.

Dassault said it had taken orders for 42 Falcon jets last year, staying just ahead of deliveries, after the cancellation of five jets linked to the now-abandoned Falcon 5X program.

On the morning of Wednesday December 26, the first trading day after the Christmas Day holiday, the ES (e-mini March S&P 500)) plunged to a new three-month corrective low at 2316.75, a full 21.4% beneath its September 21 high. In the hours thereafter, ES reversed strongly to the upside, from an acute oversold condition, and with a bit of prompting from the POTUS.
In my closing commentary in our member room at MPTrader.com, I wrote: “Today, the besieged bulls finally got some payback after weeks of downside, and days of relentless late-session selling pressure. After an iffy start to the session, today turned out to be just the opposite of the prior 4 days, exhibiting a bullish intraday profile and strength during the last 20 minutes of trading. Indeed, the last few minutes of trading morphed from prior day’s long liquidation events into FOMO -- Fear of Missing Out -- on a powerful upside reversal day that should have momentum tailwinds to the upside ...
“Technically, there should be enormous near-term tailwinds generated by today's key upside reversal that point to a challenge of the upper channel boundary at 2540, into the 2560/70 overshoot target zone before this rally is exhausted.”
See chart that accompanied my commentary.
In the aftermath of the Christmas Upside Reversal, last week ES (e-Mini March S&P) traversed a range from 2438.50 to 2539.25, or 100.75 S&P points (4.1%), and all of it occurred on Friday after Jay Powell acquiesced to the wounded easy money masses, appearing to become a kindler, gentler and more investor-sensitive Fed Chairman. 
The Powell Thrust propelled ES up through the aforementioned upper channel boundary at 2540, confirming my expectations for momentum tailwinds in the aftermath of the powerful December 26 Bullish Engulfing Candle (aka Key Upside Reversal Day). 
Did the Powell Pop expend the remaining upside momentum from December 26? And if not, where might ES go from here? In that Friday’s 100 S&P point up-day also represented a Bullish Engulfing Candle (aka Key Upside Reversal Day) -- the second in the past 7 sessions -- I am expecting follow-through strength that has as its next target zone 2580-2600, as noted on our latest chart.
See latest chart.
Reuters: Wall Street takes a breather Monday after Friday's rally.
Let’s notice that each of the major upside reversals (Dec. 26 and Jan. 4) coincided with a very supportive statement from a heavyweight political figure or Federal Reserve official.
On the first occasion (paraphrasing), President Trump told the press that he thought the (20%) stock market sell-off was a great buying opportunity.
On the second occasion, Fed Chair Powell told investors what they wanted to hear—that the Fed would become much more sensitive to and dependent on data from both the real economy and the stock market. At this time, real economic data and stock prices are telling the Fed to exert more patience before continuing to raise rates again in 2019.
 
Whether President Trump is proven to be a lucky market timer like President Obama was in March 2009 remains to be seen. What is proven, however, is that without an accompanying very accommodative Federal Reserve policy to support and motivate investors, presidential prognostications about a bullish turn in the equity markets are destined for the trash heap. 
Since late in the Fall, a tightening Fed presided over a 20% market correction amounting to 630.25 ES (S&P futures) points, while the combination of a POTUS Buy recommendation and Fed Chair Jay Powell’s communications designed to ease frazzled nerves (without easing rates) has scored a recovery of 222.50 points, or just 35% of the entire Sept.-Dec. decline.
Meanwhile, Quantitative Tightening (Fed reducing its $ trillion balance sheet by $50 billion per month, expiring mortgage backed securities and Treasury bonds) remains on “auto-pilot” until Jay Powell and Company decide it should be modified or curtailed. The Fed reduced its balance sheet by $420 billion during 2018 and is expecting to reduce it by another $600 billion during 2019! The Fed remains in tightening posture, regardless of Powell’s pronouncements this past Friday.
With the next FOMC policy meeting, statement, and press conference scheduled for January 29th and 30th, we are unlikely to hear from Fed Chair Jay Powell again for at least three weeks, but we will definitely hear from President Trump, probably more frequently this coming year than in the past (if that is possible), owning to the proximity of the 2020 election. 
If bullish equity index price action continues to coincide with or depend on extraneous positive POTUS and or Fed headlines, then for this week, potentially positive (or negative) market catalysts will have to emanate from progress in the US-China trade talks (or not), and resolution of the government shutdown (or not).
Although a new earnings season begins this week, possible directional catalysts will have to wait until Wednesday for results from Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), KB Home (KBH) and  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN).
Right now, my technical set-up and momentum work on ES point still-higher, into the 2580-2600 target zone where I will be expecting the recovery rally off of the Dec. 25 low at 2316.75 to exhibit both pattern completion and upside momentum exhaustion.
In the absence of some sort of bullish catalyst that triggers additional nearer term upside progress that propels ES towards 2650/60, my work continues to warn me to treat strength as a fleeting (though powerful) counter trend rally within the dominant downtrend established after the September high. 
For the start of the new week, only a decline in ES that breaks below 2490/95 support will be a significant warning signal that the recovery rally is over prior to reaching my optimal next upside target of 2580-2600, and that the dominant bear trend already is reasserting itself. ES closed at 2529.50. 
I closely monitor ES price action and chart pattern development via multiple updates and chart posts, among other names and indices all throughout the trading day for subscribers in the MPTrader.com room.
Have a closely risk-managed, and profitable trading week. "
28,By Money Show,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 01:15PM ET</span>","In Trader's Market, Shorten Time Frames, Hedge. Take Profits Early","This time is different as we are living in a new world where the stock market is more like Texas weather than a vehicle for price discovery and investing, writes Dr. Joe Duarte. Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) are moving higher and may gather some steam.
Volatility is certainly here to stay as the Dow Jones Industrial Average traveled over 1300 points on a closing basis in a mere two trading sessions last week. For those who slept through the spectacular events, things started to unravel when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) delivered a stark warning about its upcoming quarterly results on January 3. The market promptly crashed and burned delivering a 600-point decline putting the bears in “I told you so” heaven.
On January 4, a huge beat on the new jobs section of the monthly Employment report and a cordial sounding Fed Chairman Powell who noted that the central bank was going “to adjust policy quickly and flexibly” combined to kick start what seemed to be a dead cat bounce which turned into a real stock rally, at least for a day.
That was then
No matter what they say, this market now trades one day at a time, sometimes one headline at a time, making it difficult for anyone who has even a few days for a trading time frame.
What does it all mean? Well for one thing, the Fed admitted that it’s willing to pause on its path toward more rate increases for a period of time. So, for a day that was good news. Of course, Powell’s remarks don’t necessarily mean that the Fed will stop raising interest rates altogether, but it does suggest that the Fed may know something about a bank or two that may be in some trouble and they are hoping to keep things from getting worse. And since he’s back on the talk circuit on Thursday, we may have more fireworks, unless someone else beats him to the headline circus.
Furthermore, the currency markets had a flash crash last week, which suggests that the market may now be reaching a significant potential fracture point beyond stock prices. If this dynamic develops, we could see something similar to the 1998 Thai Baht and the 1999 Ruble crises. Anyone who lived through those events should shudder given the fact that a stock market crash is like comparing a lit match to the nuclear explosion that could materialize if a major currency crisis is further inflamed and fueled by algo trading.
Moreover, the Fed may have noticed that we live in a new world where even as they move at the speed of a dormant glacier, information travels, and algos trade at the speed of light. Indeed, this incongruence between the Fed’s clock and that of robot traders leaves the markets at the mercy of the algos leaving while the central bank scrambles.
Market breadth tries to recover
The New York Stock Exchange Advance Decline line (NYAD) is trying to recover from the drubbing it took over the last three months. Because this indicator remains the most reliable market trend gauge since the 2016 election, its actions remain paramount to understanding what may come next in the stock market.
Currently NYAD has bounced and has climbed above its 20-day moving average which suggests that the short-term trend in the market has reversed. Also encouraging is the combination of both the RSI and ROC indicators moving above 50 and 0 their midpoints, a sign of a possible reversal of the recent down side momentum. Of course, if this configuration of indicators fails to hold up, all bets are off.
Indexes bounce
Despite the selling on January 3, the December 24, 2018 selloff in the S&P 500 (SPX) had all the hallmarks of a capitulation selling climax: extraordinary volume, a huge break below the lower Bollinger Band, and a feeling that the world was coming to an end. Thus, the ensuing rally has not been as surprising as it might have been otherwise.
But the rally has yet to be fully convincing as SPX failed to close above its 20-day moving average to end last week, although NYAD did close above its 20-day line.
A similar picture emerges when we look at the Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX) where the 20-day moving average remains an area of key resistance.
It’s a trader’s market
The new market reality is all about increased volatility, rapidly development of new trends, and heavy sector rotation.
From a trading standpoint, the extremely oversold chip stocks such as Applied Materials (AMAT) and Micron Technology (MU) are moving higher and may gather some steam.
This, along with some base formation in commodities and a bit of a move in select emerging markets is what’s working at the moment. But of course, it may not be what works in a few days. It is a trader’s market.
Therefore, it makes sense to look for trading opportunities more broadly than usual, perhaps in unfamiliar territories, in terms of sectors and geography. It also makes sense to shorten trading time frames, to take early profits, use tight stops and reduce position size while always keeping an eye on the exit. Finally, keeping a very close eye on opportunities to hedge is also a useful survival skill these days.
Disclosure: I own MU and AMAT as of this writing

Todd Salamone of Schaeffer's is presenting at MoneyShow Orlando.
“While bulls hope a bottom is in and a V-rally is on the horizon, there are multiple resistance levels overhead that could be viewed as potential hesitation points if last week's rally continues... The first significant resistance area is at 2,507 -- the SPX’s close the day of the Dec. 19 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) rate hike. The second resistance level is at 2,546 -- the close one day prior to the hike... suffice it to say that an area of strong potential resistance is between the 2,500 century mark and the 2,550 half-century mark.”
-- Monday Morning Outlook, December 31, 2018
Last Monday, after the S&P 500 Index (SPX - 2,531.94) and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY (NYSE:SPY) - 252.39) dodged weekly closes beneath their historically important 160-week moving averages and put up impressive post-Christmas rallies, I concluded that the price action was encouraging but the bulls were not out of the woods.
Specifically, I pointed out that multiple technical resistance levels were overhead after a near 20% SPX decline that began in September. The first resistance level was around 2,507, the SPX’s close the day of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) rate hike on Dec. 19 -- and which we now know roughly coincided with 2018’s end-of-year close, lending even more significance to this level.
Since then, 2019 has gotten off to a rough start, with the SPX selling off from its FOMC-day and 2018 closing levels on Wednesday morning, only to reverse and close roughly flat on the day. But a weaker-than-forecast ISM manufacturing index reading, along with a weak forecast by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), sent stocks sharply lower on Thursday, as investors fretted about slower growth related to, among other things, icy trade relations with China.
In fact, slowing growth has clearly been on the mind of investors, as the SPX lost more than 9% in the month of December, coincident with a sharp rise in the number of investors who expect the Fed to remain on hold or lower interest rates in 2019 -- even as the Fed communicated on Dec. 19 that it expects to hike rates two times this year.
A chart of CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) data that appeared in The Wall Street Journal on Jan. 4 gives you a flavor for how much investors soured on growth prospects for 2019 in the month of December. The proportion of investors expecting the Fed not to raise rates further in 2019 jumped significantly last month, from around 30% to near 100%, even as the FOMC was projecting two more rate hikes for this year as of mid-December. The poor ISM reading stoked fears that the Fed is gearing up to make a huge mistake in 2019.
“With the muted inflation readings that we’ve seen, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves... We will be prepared to adjust policy quickly and flexibly and to use all of our tools to support the economy should that be appropriate to keep the expansion on track... there is no pre-set path for policy... If we came to the view that the balance sheet normalization or any other aspect of normalization was part of the problem, we wouldn't hesitate to make a change.”
-- Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, January 4, 2019
Friday was a different day with new information for investors to consume -- and bulls can be thankful for this. First, stocks rallied strongly as nonfarm payrolls increased by 312,000, soaring above expectations that ranged from an increase of 175,000-190,000. Earnings growth also surpassed expectations, and data-dependent, in the moment traders bid stocks higher, adding to bullish momentum fueled by news that China had cut its reserve requirement ratio, as slowing China growth has weighed on growth prospects here.
As if the China and payrolls news was not enough to feed a buying frenzy, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, speaking in Atlanta, further soothed investors, who perceived his comments as more dovish than in mid-December. Said another way, whereas investors perceived that there was not an outstanding “Powell put” in December, Friday’s remarks gave investors an impression that there is indeed a Powell put, a perception that is needed during times of uncertainty and heightened volatility.
Friday’s rally was enough to push the SPX above its 2018 close of 2,506.85, which roughly coincides with its closing level from Dec. 19, when the FOMC last hiked rates. However, the rally was not enough to push the SPX above 2,546, its close on the eve of the rate hike, which is situated around the round 2,550 half-century mark.
Moreover, the early 2018 lows around 2,580 that, when breached in December, saw the proverbial bottom fall out, represent yet another resistance level that must be taken out before a V bottom can be taken seriously or considered sustainable. Plus, those early 2018 lows are situated a round 10% above the December closing low -- which is another reason 2,580 takes on importance from a short-term perspective, as a profit-taking mentality is likely to surface among short-term traders.
“The SPX’s half-century 2,350 level marked last week's low and is therefore a potential -- if not critical -- support level for bulls if a pullback is on the immediate horizon.”
-- Monday Morning Outlook, December 31, 2018
From a longer-term perspective, the SPX 2,350 level remains important if the advance proves short-lived. But if you are looking for another area of potential support in the short term, the round 2,500 level on the SPX is just under 2018's year-end close and the Dec. 19 close, and thus offers a potential level of support.
I am finding the action in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX - 21.38) interesting in these last two weeks. The Christmas Eve closing high was 36.07, just 1 point below the 52-week closing high of 37.32 in February. The VIX has imploded since Christmas Eve by about 40%. Bulls would like to see the VIX get below 18.30, which is double the 2018 closing low and roughly half last month's intraday high.
Also, 18.36 is the site of the VIX’s 100-day moving average, which was supportive on a pullback in March and acted as resistance from May-September. The crossover in October was indicative of higher volatility ahead, and a VIX pullback in early December saw the lows at this moving aver"

Buying Gold Dips,"Momentum carried into the open last night with the S&P trading to a high of 2551.75 but this slowly dissipated into the morning. The same three headwinds remain. Bill Baruch, president and founder of Blue Line Futures, previews E-mini S&P, Gold, Crude, Forex.
E-mini S&P (March)
Last week’s close: Settled at 2531.25, up 83.50.
Fundamentals: On Friday, the S&P (SPX) closed at the highest level since December 18. As we stated here Friday morning, sentiment got a healthy start overnight on news the People’s Bank of China will broadly cut their Reserve Requirement Ratio on January 15 and lower-level trade representatives from the U.S. and China will begin meeting today in Beijing.
Nonfarm Payroll then blew-out expectations posting an increase in wages of 0.4% in December with a creation of 312,000 jobs. Typically, a number this strong would put pressure on risk-assets as it encourages the Federal Reserve to tighten policy at a faster pace. However, Thursday night, the CME’s FedWatch Tool had the probability for the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged in March at 85.4% with a 14.6% chance they cut. That probability is now 98.9% and 1.1% this morning. Given this favors the outside chance of a cut in March over another hike, the strong wage number did not deter the healthy risk-appetite. Fed Chair Powell’s comments added a tailwind, he said there will be flexibility in rates and signaled the Fed is not on auto-pilot.
Momentum carried into the open last night with the S&P trading to a high of 2551.75 but this slowly dissipated into the morning. Despite news that the trade talks got off to a good start with the unexpected attendance of Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, there is still little to no fresh substance.
Furthermore, the same headwinds remain.
First, the government shutdown enters its third week.
Second, in November and December we constantly wrote how traders must not underestimate the effects of a souring Brexit is negotiation. With talks now back in the picture, the March deadline for a hard Brexit will certainly weigh on sentiment.
Lastly, economic growth is in serious question. We touched on it in last night’s Tradable Events this Week. Nonfarm Payroll was a massive number but last week U.S. ISM Manufacturing posted the slowest growth since November 2016. Eurozone Manufacturing PMI was at three-year lows and the Composite read five-year lows. Let’s also not forget that Chinese Manufacturing PMI contracted. This morning, German Factory Orders came in worse than expected at -1.0%. Although, German and Eurozone Retail Sales were healthy, Factory Orders echoes the trade war. It looks like U.S Factory Orders will be postponed and become the latest data casualty to the government shutdown. ISM Non-Manufacturing will be a crucial number. Atlanta Fed President Bostic speaks at 12:40 pm EDT.
Technicals: Price action is near unchanged this morning after paring early gains from last night. The important technical theme to understand right here more than anything is that ...
Crude Oil (February)
Last week’s close: Settled at 47.96, up 0.87 on Friday and 2.63 on the week.
Fundamentals: Crude continues its recovery from the lowest level since June 2017 on a healthier risk environment coupled with news last week that OPEC production fell 530,000 bpd in December. The market was also oversold and although growth concerns persist, a repositioning of longs is carrying Crude back near the $50 mark. Today’s session high comes in at 49.47 but as it nears that psychological mark, without fresh bullish news Friday’s EIA data could begin to weigh on the tape. Let’s not forget that despite news China plans to cut its RRR and trade talks restarted this week that EIA inventory data on Friday showed a composite build of 16.426 mb. Furthermore, Cushing added storage for the 14th time in 15 weeks; Crude cannot fully recovery until we begin seeing consistent drawdowns in bloated inventories.
Technicals: Price action is off to a great start but runs into major three-star resistance at ... 
Gold (February)
Last week’s close: Settled at 1285.8, down 9.0 on Friday and up 2.8 on the week.
Fundamentals: What if we told you that Nonfarm Payroll blew the doors off expectations with an Average Hourly Earnings increase of 0.4% and a creation of 312,000 jobs and Gold is trading higher this morning than it was prior to the number? Well you should not be too surprised because we told you right here on Friday that a strong number would hit Gold but there is an opening between the report at 8:30 am EDT and Fed Chair Powell’s panel at 10:15 am EDT that would present a strong buying opportunity. Gold is holding ground tremendously well, however, ISM Non-Manufacturing is out. During a week in which many economic reports could be postponed due to the government shutdown and on the heels of the ISM Manufacturing whiff, this read is absolutely crucial. Although we are Bullish in Bias Gold for the foreseeable future and find dips a buying opportunity, a strong read here given the proximity to the psychological $1300 mark would likely weigh on the tape into Wednesday.
Technicals: Gold did not give the perfect price for buyers to step in on Friday as it only went to a low of 1278.1, however, we had first key support at ...

The here and now continues to drift into a bearish winter drizzle as the there and then of 2018 hangs over the market blurring any forecasts for sunshine and growth.
There are always surprises to consider in the space between now and then with technology the first risk for bears while the forces of demographics and fear of radical change block the bulls. This is a market stuck waiting for something new and different.
The illogical inconsistencies roll on – with oil up 2% and European equities lower even as the news overnight was mixed. Retail sales better, German factory orders worse, Australian and Japan PMI reports weaker while German construction better.
The Sentix report on investor sentiment captures the present mess best with global downturns and dire warnings on policy makers to respond. The central bank reaction function remains the key doubt driving fears for 2019. The trust of the market in Powell’s new found “patience and flexibility” and renewed focus on financial conditions may change like the time.
There is a feedback loop inherent in data-dependency, which kills volatility. The role of the USD weakness in the present situation can’t be ignored. The U.S./China trade talks have started this week with a rush of “good faith” and hope for further reversion to market norms with emerging markets the clear winners so far in 2019. However, today’s capital flows don’t mean future easy returns.
The euro/U.S. dollar (EUR/USD) relationship and the role of ECB vs. FOMC policy responses will be central in the week and month ahead.
Fed speakers will lead this week along with the U.S. need for capital with the 3-10-30-year bond sales. The risk of a EUR breaking 1.1470 and running to 1.1650 entices but the reality of the future rests on Draghi and his replacement as they deal with their own QE unwind.

Starboard touted two areas of Dollar Tree, in which it was looking to unlock value: A possible sale of the underperforming Family Dollar business and a tweak to Dollar Tree's pricing model.
Analysts at Buckingham Research said the announcement ""will, at a minimum, put a floor on the stock,"" and added that ""value creation and improving performance are likely outcomes (for Dollar Tree) over the intermediate future.""

The utility is considering the move for some or all of its businesses, Reuters reported on Friday.
PG&E did not respond to a request for comment. 
The company's roughly $18 billion in bonds also fell on Monday, with over 80 percent of the issues trading down. 
Its largest bond, a $3 billion note due in March 2034 with a coupon of 6.05 percent <694308GE1=>, fell to a record-low bid price of 91.5 cents on the dollar and its yield rose to nearly 7 percent.
Its yield spread over comparable Treasury debt, a measure of the additional compensation investors demand for holding PG&E bonds rather than a safer government bond, widened to a record 4.3 percentage points.
It was the most actively traded corporate debt issue on the day, according to MarketAxess, while a PG&E December 2027 bond was the fourth most active.
Credit ratings for PG&E and its Pacific Gas & Electric unit were downgraded by the three main ratings agencies in mid-November. They now sit at one notch above junk-bond territory.
Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.
A bankruptcy claim, however, may not hurt the bonds in the long term. PG&E's enterprise value, a measure of the company's worth that includes debt, is $32 billion, which would cover the $25 billion to $30 billion in claims from fires in the last two years without impairing the bonds. 
Sources had told Reuters that a bankruptcy filing is not certain and the company could receive financial help through legislation that would let it pass on to customers costs associated with fire liabilities. 
But that is just a possibility, they said.
""Without adequate political and regulatory support, we cannot rule out a Chapter 11 filing,"" Christopher Turnure analyst at J.P. Morgan said in a note. 
However, Guggenheim Partners analyst Shahriar Pourreza said bankruptcy will not be the best option as PG&E is too big an utility in California. 
""Legislation is the way forward as it will allow to keep the utility alive and mitigate any negative impact one can get from the bankruptcy,"" Pourreza said. 
The utility said on Friday it is also looking for new directors for its holding company and its unit Pacific Gas and Electric Co.

Shares of the company were trading down at $19.01 in early afternoon trading, their lowest since mid-November.

35,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 12:50PM ET</span>",Argentina Wants MSCI to Upgrade Local Shares to Emerging Status,"(Bloomberg) -- Despite last year’s currency crisis and economic contraction, Argentina still expects its stock market will return to the foreign investors’ radar in 2019.
Bolsas y Mercados Argentinos SA, or BYMA, the operator of the largest stock exchange in the country, has started a new plan to convince the index provider MSCI Inc. to include local stocks in the ""emerging"" category from its current ""frontier"" level.
""We must pray for the macro to improve and have more liquidity,"" says, Ernesto Allaria, BYMA’s president.
On June 20 last year, MSCI said that starting in May, Argentine shares listed abroad will be considered as ""emerging"", increasing the possibility that these securities will be acquired by large global institutional funds. The following day, Argentina’s trading volume rose to ARS2,973 million, from an average of ARS1,000 million in the previous month. But since then the average trading daily volume fell, reaching to ARS430 million in December, exposing the limited liquidity of the local market.
BYMA will try again to have the local common shares added into the Emerging MSCI index, so that the local market can also capture the positive effects of the upgrade.
The strategy is to advance with three additional steps:
1. Imitate Peru
""We started a path to talk more with the MSCI and make sure that all of our developments are known by foreign investors,"" said Alejandro Berney, BYMA CEO. ""This road is similar to what Peru did and it was successful,"" he said.
Faced with the threat of losing the ""emerging"" MSCI index status and begin to be considered a ""frontier"", Peru implemented an aggressive international strategy. The government engaged in roadshows with institutional investors ""to identify what were the necessary measures to strengthen liquidity and implement them,"" said Daniel Cordova, the head of Equity Research, at Credicorp Capital Peru.
BYMA believes two initiatives implemented last year, such as short selling and securities lending, were not taken into account by MSCI in its June decision.
2. Eliminate intermediaries
BYMA is in talks with international banks such as Citibank, Santander (MC:SAN) and HSBC, so these institutions can settle the buy-sell operations of clients overseas. The move seeks to prevent foreign investors from making cash transfers through agents or local brokers that they consider risky or with reduced patrimony.
""This makes the liquidation environment less risky for all investors, the foreigner is very demanding and especially in markets with small brokers,"" Berney said. BYMA’s idea is to have the banks acting as clearing providers.
3. Shortening times
In a second stage, BYMA also wants to achieve the buy-sell of shares against the total payment at the time of the transaction -on delivery versus payment-, instead of being ""netted"" to the end of the day. By doing so, foreign investors will transfer their money only when the shares are actually entered into the clearing system, reducing the operational risk.
""These are tools and standards that we know must be fulfilled so foreign investors will have the same choices they get in international markets,"" said Ingrid Collazo, the head of custody at Citibank in Argentina, an institution that plans to sign an agreement with BYMA soon. ""Technically, the conditions meet the criteria required to be emerging, the biggest difficulty is the political uncertainty generated by an electoral year,"" she added.

46,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 12:32PM ET</span>",European shares fall as economic growth concerns derail rally,"LONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell back on Monday, after rebounding at the end of last week, as lingering worries about the euro zone economy, Brexit and the U.S. government shutdown offset hopes for a truce between Washington and Beijing over trade.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index closed down 0.15 percent, erasing some of Friday's stellar gains after strong U.S. jobs data and dovish comments from the Federal Reserve chief.
Optimism about easing friction between the United States and China had also lifted the mood, helping the index to its biggest daily gain since June 2016.
The swift swing into negative territory on Monday morning illustrated the fragility of the gains as other worries returned to the fore.
The biggest gainers in Friday's strong rally were some of Monday's laggards, with healthcare (SXDP) and food and beverage stocks (SX3P) falling 0.8 and 1.1 percent respectively. The weaker U.S. dollar also weighed on those companies with large international revenues.
Blowout U.S. data and Fed comments had ""calmed some nerves"" and provided some psychological support to the market, said Lars Kreckel, global equity strategist at Legal & General Investment Management. 
On Friday, Fed chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank was not on a preset path of interest rate hikes and that it would be sensitive to the downside risks markets were pricing in.
""We're not seeing the overheating of the U.S. economy that we were worried about,"" said Kreckel.
Still, European equities remain out of favor, particularly after business surveys last week pointed to slower growth. 
On Friday, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's ""Bull & Bear"" gauge of market sentiment had fallen to 1.8, a level the U.S. bank's strategists described as ""extreme bear"" territory that had triggered a ""buy"" signal for equities.
Sectors sensitive to the trade tensions were among the few gainers on Monday, with basic resources stocks (SXPP) up 1 percent and technology up 1.5 percent.
Chipmakers were also recovering from heavy losses last week after Apple's shock revenue warning. 
AMS (S:AMS) which supplies the iPhone maker, rose 9.6 percent to the top of the STOXX 600 after announcing a partnership with Chinese software maker Face++ to produce new 3D facial recognition features for smartphones.
""Face++ is considered a very solid software platform for 3D sensing and for hardware company like AMS the bottleneck is partly software and the partnership helps them to close this gap,” said Veysel Taze, analyst at ODDO BHF.
AMS shares lost almost a quarter of their value on Thursday. 
Broker research moved other stocks, with Dutch payments firm  Adyen  (AS:ADYEN) rising 6.2 percent after BAML upgraded it, while Wirecard (DE:WDIG) was up 2.4 percent after BAML also backed it.
On the downside,  Centrica  (L:CNA) fell 4.4 percent after a Jefferies downgrade.
A JP Morgan downgrade pushed tyre makers and auto parts makers Pirelli (MI:PIRC),  Michelin  (PA:MICP) and Gestamp (MC:GEST) lower, adding further gloom to the industry knocked by regulation and slowing Chinese sales.
The bank said it reckons the European autos are unlikely to re-rate in the first half of the year.

Cigarette makers  British American Tobacco  (L:BATS) and Imperial Brands (L:IMB) fell 4.2 percent and 5 percent respectively following a downbeat note on the sector from Cowen analysts, who downgraded both stocks to ""market perform"".

68,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 11:30AM ET</span>","Cruiser Capital targets Ashland directors, including chairman","BOSTON (Reuters) - Cruiser Capital Advisors said on Monday it wants to replace four directors at chemical company Ashland Global Holdings, including the board chairman. 
The New York-based hedge fund aims to remove Ashland Chief Executive Bill Wulfsohn from his position as board chair and is also targeting three other directors who are members of the company's governance and nominating committee.
""Should Bill Wulfsohn hold both the Chairman and CEO jobs?,"" the hedge fund wrote in a letter on Monday. It said Wulfsohn has been paid $43 million over four years even as the company has missed operational targets and its stock price has faltered.
Ashland urged shareholders to ignore the hedge fund and vote for its slate at its Feb. annual meeting, arguing that it listens to investors' suggestions on board members and adds them when appropriate.
A growing number of investors, including hedge funds, are flexing their muscle by pushing to remove board members. But targeting a board chairman is still a relatively unusual move, industry analysts said.
Cruiser, which owns a 2.5 percent stake in Covington, Kentucky-based Ashland, has been pushing management for months to improve its margins. It said again on Monday that it thinks the company could be worth more than $125 a share if improvements are made. 
The stock price opened at $72.31 on Monday and has fallen 12.72 percent in the last three months.
The two sides have also sparred over board members for some time.
Cruiser is urging investors to elect Bill Joyce, Allen Spizzo, Carol Eicher and Pat Gottschalk to the board. 
Ashland asked shareholders to re-elect all directors, including Wulfsohn, and called 2018 ""a year of great progress for Ashland's value creation plan."" It said it is adding Craig Rogerson, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Hexion, to its slate.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday handed a defeat to Merck & Co (N:MRK) by refusing to hear its appeal of a ruling that it had dishonestly obtained patent rights and could not collect a $200 million verdict against rival drugmaker  Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD) in a dispute involving blockbuster hepatitis C drugs.
A jury awarded Merck $200 million in 2016 after finding Gilead's Hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni infringed two of its patents, but a judge later ruled the patents unenforceable because of a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath by one of its in-house lawyers.
Merck had urged the Supreme Court to place limits on the doctrine of ""unclean hands"" that can prevent plaintiffs from winning lawsuits if they acted in bad faith.
Hepatitis C, estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans, is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to liver failure. Injection drug use is among the causes of the infection. 
Direct-acting anti-viral medications like Gilead's Sovaldi and Harvoni have revolutionized treatment of hepatitis C, with cure rates of more than 90 percent. Merck holds patents that it has said cover a compound that is the foundation for all major antiviral treatments for chronic hepatitis C.
A federal court jury in San Jose, California awarded Merck $200 million in 2016 after finding Sovaldi and Harvoni infringed two of its patents.
A judge threw out the verdict later that year, ruling that in the process of applying for one of the patents, Merck used confidential information it obtained in 2004 while discussing a possible partnership with Pharmasset Inc, a company Gilead bought in 2011.
The judge also said a Merck in-house lawyer testified untruthfully in a deposition and at trial about his participation in a confidential call with Pharmasset personnel.
Merck's litigation against Gilead has included several reversals of fortune.

In 2016, a jury in Delaware said Gilead infringed a related patent and ordered it to pay Merck $2.54 billion in royalties, the largest verdict ever in a patent case. But a judge threw out the verdict in February 2018, ruling that Merck's patent was invalid because it was not sufficiently detailed in its wording.

87,By Business Insider,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 10:17AM ET</span>","Amazon will soar more than 20% as it becomes a 'third force' in advertising behind Google and Facebook, analyst says"," Amazon — one of the world's largest retailers — is big, but it's not nearly done expanding, according to an analyst who sees the stock surging this year.
""Despite its current massive size, we see Amazon’s opportunities as mostly unconstrained based on a successful track record of capitalizing on consumer and IT department spending,"" Brian Wieser, senior analyst at Pivotal Research, said in a note to clients late Sunday.
Wieser, known for  correctly forecasting troubles for Snap and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), initiated the firm's coverage on the stock with a ""buy"" rating and a year-end price target of $1,920, implying a rally of about 22% from Friday's closing price of $1,575.39.
Amazon is particularly well-positioned in its advertising business, which is growing faster than any other revenue stream, according to Wieser. The e-commerce giant generated an estimated $9 billion in advertising revenue in 2018, Wieser said, the bulk of which ran in the US.
""At around 10% of the global total in 2023, Amazon will easily be the 'third force' in digital advertising after Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook, although it will still be substantially smaller than the $215bn in annual revenue we expect Google to generate or the $59bn we expect to see from Facebook.""

Notably, the analyst said brick-and-mortar stores are becoming increasingly important to Amazon.
""Platforms such as Amazon are likely to increasingly rely on physical locations as much as traditional retailers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) will increasingly rely on their digital platforms to sell products and provide customers with related information.""
Other analysts think Amazon might need to bolster its physical presence to succeed in the long run. Gene Munster, a widely followed tech analyst at Loup Ventures,  told Business Insider last month that Amazon acquiring Target makes sense for just that reason.
Wieser's target is far from the most optimistic on Wall Street — the highest target among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is $2,450, from D.A. Davidson — and his target suggests the stock won't recapture its September all-time high of $2,050.50.
Still, his view is in line with the vast majority of Wall Street. Of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, 94% rate Amazon a ""buy,"" 4% carry a ""hold"" rating, and 2% rate the stock a ""sell."" 
Risks to Wieser's bull case include threats related to regulation, competition, and ""general economic trends.""
Amazon was up about 2% in early Monday.

88,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 10:16AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse settles New York state RMBS lawsuit,"ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) has settled a 2012 New York state lawsuit alleging misconduct over residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), with a source familiar with the deal saying the bank would pay much less than prosecutors had originally sought. 
The settlement, which was made last week, takes Credit Suisse a step closer to wrapping up an expensive chapter linked to the financial crisis a decade ago, although some civil claims remain unresolved. 
""Credit Suisse is pleased to have settled this legacy case,"" the bank said in a statement, confirming the deal, though not what it is paying in the pact with the New York State Attorney General's office.
The source told Reuters on Monday the latest figure the Swiss bank must pay related to U.S. mortgage-backed securities is in the low, two-digit millions of dollars, confirming a weekend report in Swiss newspaper Ostschweiz am Sonntag.
In what had been an $11 billion complaint filed in November 2012, then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman accused Credit Suisse of misrepresenting the quality of loans underlying mortgage-backed securities it sold in 2006 and 2007. 
The New York AG's office could not be reached for comment.
Credit Suisse shares were down 0.1 percent at 1145 GMT, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Banking Index was down 0.5 percent.
Schneiderman had contended Credit Suisse's inappropriate marketing of defective bonds resulted in heavy investor losses when the global financial crisis struck.
In June 2018, however, New York State's highest court limited the scope of the case, saying the claims were subject to a three-year statute of limitations, not six years as Schneiderman had wanted.
In a previous settlement of charges by the U.S. Department of Justice, Credit Suisse agreed to pay $5.3 billion in fines and consumer relief after the Zurich-based bank acknowledged home loans it pooled into the securities did not meet underwriting guidelines. The bank now says the total sum may come to half that. [https://reut.rs/2VzMkxO]
Numerous other banks have paid billions to resolve federal and state RMBS-related claims, including JP Morgan, Citi, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and UBS. 

Last May, Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) agreed to pay $4.9 billion to settle a U.S. mortgages investigation. In March, it reached a $500 million settlement with New York.

89,By Business Insider,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 10:14AM ET</span>",PG&E is tanking after report says it's considering filing for bankruptcy protection," Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) was getting hit hard Monday, down more than 18% at $19.93 a share, after a report out late Friday said it was considering filing for bankruptcy protection.
The embattled California utility faces billions of dollars in liabilities as a result of wildfires over the past two years, and  could seek protection for some or all of its businesses, Reuters reports, citing people familiar with the matter. 
Despite the news, UBS analyst Daniel Ford raised his price target from $26 to $29, saying it assumes PG&E is ""not liable for Tubbs and reflects a higher $15.1B net liability ($11.3B prior) for 2017 and 2018 due to the Camp fire but a lower cost of funding (7.5% versus 9.0% WACC).""
PG&E shares have plunged nearly 50% since November 8, when the  deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history broke out.  The utility said it was having trouble with its transmission lines when the blaze erupted, and that it may be responsible.
Following the blaze, the company's problems have been piling up. 
In mid-November, people who lost their homes in the fire  sued the company, alleging it was a ""direct and legal result of the negligence, carelessness, recklessness, and/or unlawfulness.""
And a month later, The California Public Utilities Commission  opened a proceeding into the company falsifying safety documents for natural gas pipelines between 2012 and 2017. 
Also in December,  PG&E requested a 12% rate hike in 2020 to help fund a community wildfire safety program, insurance liabilities, and core gas and electric operations."

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] has signed a deal with little-known U.S. energy firm Erepla that is part-owned by a prominent Florida Republican to help increase the socialist-run country's plummeting crude oil output, the company said. 
Erepla Services LLC, part-owned by Republican Harry Sargeant III and which Delaware state records show was only registered two months ago, said it plans to invest up to $500 million to increase production at three Venezuelan oil fields in exchange for a portion of the crude produced.
The arrangement faces significant hurdles including obtaining an exemption from Trump administration sanctions that block U.S. companies from providing financing to the government of President Nicolas Maduro or Venezuelan state firms. 
It is a further sign that Venezuela is tapping inexperienced firms to stem massive declines in crude output as more established oil companies steer clear of the troubled country due to concerns about U.S. sanctions and overall dysfunction.
Erepla said that the agreement will ""revitalize oil production"" at the Tia Juana Lago and Rosa Mediano fields in the western Lake Maracaibo region and in the Ayacucho 5 bloc, in the eastern heavy-oil Orinoco Belt.
The company added that the deal gives it ""enhanced managerial participation"" in the projects and will be responsible for procurement, a key difference from long-established joint ventures between PDVSA and oil majors like  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX), where PDVSA has full operational control.
It said Erepla would be ""responsible for the entirety of the investment."" A spokesman declined to elaborate on how it would raise the funds.
Neither PDVSA nor the Oil Ministry responded to a request for comment.
The Erepla spokesman confirmed media reports that Sargeant, who has served as finance chairman of the Florida Republican Party and currently runs asphalt trading and shipping firm Global Oil Management Group, is a part-owner of Erepla. 
The spokesman declined to say what size stake Sargeant has in the company.
The deal is the first new partnership between PDVSA and a private company since Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo in August announced a set of ""joint service agreements"" with 14 little-known companies that did not appear to have experience operating oilfields and PDVSA.
Those contracts were similar to ones rolled back under late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, who expanded the state's role in the OPEC country's energy industry. 
Output has continued to stagnate since the deals were signed, dropping to 1.46 million barrels per day in November from more than 2 million at the end of last year, according to OPEC figures, in a sign of the company's struggles under military rule.
COMPLYING WITH SANCTIONS
Washington has levied several rounds of sanctions on Venezuelan that block U.S. citizens from providing financing to Maduro's government without placing explicit restrictions on commerce or investment.
But because PDVSA is perennially cash-strapped, agreements to boost production usually involve partner companies putting up significant amounts of up-front funding that could run afoul of sanctions.
Erepla said it had applied to the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which implements sanctions, for a ""Specific License affirming the agreement."" The Treasury Department, which is affected by the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Consulted on how a company with no evident oil-field experience would be in a position to take on the project, the Erepla spokesman said the firm's ""ownership includes serious and significant oilfield production capabilities as well as heavy oil refining ability."" 
Maduro, who has deepened Venezuela's relationships with U.S. adversaries like Russia and China, often accuses the United States of plotting to overthrow him and steal the OPEC nation's oil wealth.
The deal has been criticized by hardline Chavez supporters, who say it cedes too much control to a foreign company.

""This is the worst giveaway in the history of our country's oil industry,"" former Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez wrote in a blog post on Sunday. ""Maduro and Quevedo will have to be held to account for giving away assets belonging to all Venezuelans and ceding our sovereignty over managing our oil.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British carmaker  Aston Martin  (L:AML) has triggered contingency plans to cope with a potentially disorderly Brexit, including hiring a new supply chain chief and preparing to fly in components as well as use ports other than Dover. 
Britain, the world's fifth largest economy, is due to leave the European Union in just over 80 days but a negotiated withdrawal agreement looks set to be voted down by UK lawmakers next week, making a ""no deal"" exit - and disruption to trade - more likely.
Britain's car industry, which employs over 850,000 people and is one of the country's rare manufacturing success stories, has warned that leaving the world's biggest trading bloc without a deal would add costs and could halt output due to snarl-ups.
Aston Martin Chief Executive Andy Palmer said the luxury automaker, which outlined its contingency plans in October, had no choice but to authorize them at a board meeting in December. 
""I don't think we've been in a position in the last two years where we've been further apart from understanding where we're going to end up,"" Palmer told Reuters, declining to put a figure on the ""accumulating"" cost of the plans. 
""We program a car to align and order all the parts for those cars twelve weeks in advance. You don't need to do the maths to know that therefore takes us across the Brexit period."" 
""We have to prepare for the worst case scenario.""
Aston Martin, the preferred drive of fictional secret agent James Bond, joins a growing list of companies readying for a no deal Brexit. Data last week showed manufacturers ramping up stocks in preparation for potential border delays.
Aston is signing deals with supplier DHL to allow for the use of ports other than Dover - Britain's busiest and so most likely to be disrupted by any customs delays - and has authorized its supply chain team to make air freight bookings. 
The government has said it will prioritize the movement of key supplies such as medicines if the flow of goods is hit after Brexit, so it is unclear what would happen to other items.
""We don't have any assurances,"" said Palmer. ""One assumes if you're putting parts onto a standard chartered plane, no one's going to kick you off.""
POLITICIANS NOT DOING THEIR DUTY
Aston Martin, which built more than 6,000 top-end models last year at its central English plant in Gaydon, its only factory, is also holding a stock of cars in Germany.
""It's an inventory to some extent that we put in place during the course of 2018 ... and depending on what happens in the next few weeks, may or may not increase,"" Palmer said. 
Carmakers fear their just-in-time production will grind to a halt if there are delays imposed after Brexit, but different manufacturers face different challenges.
Volkswagen Group (DE:VOWG_p), Britain's favorite carmaker accounting for over 20 percent of sales, builds only 11,000 Bentleys in the country, while Ford (N:F) counts Britain as its third-largest market but makes no cars there. 
Meantime Nissan (T:7201), which builds around half a million cars at its northern English Sunderland plant, and Toyota (T:7203) export the overwhelming majority of their British-built vehicles to the rest of the EU.
While mass-market brands are most worried about potential trade tariffs, smaller, high-end players such as Aston and McLaren believe their affluent customers could absorb extra costs and are more concerned about customs checks and delays. 
Aston has hired John Griffiths, who has worked for Nissan and aerospace firm Rolls-Royce (LON:RR), as interim vice president for supply chain, in a role Palmer said ""there was a nagging need (for) which has been confirmed with Brexit.""
Palmer criticized politicians on both sides of the Channel.
""Both the European and the UK politicians are not discharging the duty for which they are put in place which is basically to plan and bring certainty to allow the country to thrive,"" he said.
As carmakers prepare for multiple Brexit eventualities, they are also dealing with stricter emissions rules and a slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy, China, which has hit a variety of firms including Apple (O:AAPL).
While some automakers have reported falling demand, Aston, which has seen its share price fall by more than a third since it listed in October, said it had a record 2018.

""There has not been any downflow since those (Q3) numbers so in fact, broadly speaking, the opposite as we launched (sports cars) DBS and Vantage into China,"" said Palmer.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Smaller banks in the United Arab Emirates are facing regulatory pressure to merge after the fallout from a property downturn forced the state to lead a bailout of Invest Bank (AD:INVB) last month. 
UAE has 50 commercial banks including 22 local lenders, a number seen as too high in a country of about 9.5 million people. Saudi Arabia, which has a population of 32 million, has 12 banks and is set to lose two of those if announced mergers are successfully concluded. 
After two of the UAE's biggest lenders, First Gulf Bank and National Bank of Abu Dhabi, merged in 2017 to become First Abu Dhabi Bank (AD:FAB), three more lenders are in talks to combine, led by Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (AD:ADCB).
Analysts expect mergers in the sector to accelerate given a slowing economy, slide in house prices, robust accounting standards and tougher competition. 
""There will be pressure on the bigger banks to absorb smaller lenders,"" said Sabah al-Binali, CEO of Abu Dhabi-based investment firm Universal Strategy. 
""People were expecting mergers from an economic point of view, but what you are seeing now is perhaps a greater regulatory push to strengthen balance sheets.""
Smaller banks in the UAE, which are mostly family owned, have lost market share to the top four lenders, which now control around 65 percent of banking sector loans, according to Fitch. Despite that, their owners have resisted mergers, partly due to differences over who would control the combined entity. 
But one banker, who has been advising banks on M&A, said there are more merger conversations happening in a sign that owners are becoming more open to consolidation.
""We are party to a number of such conversations and instigating a number of those,"" the banker said. 
NOT SO GENEROUS 
In 2009 the UAE rescued its largest banks with billions of dollars of fresh equity without forcing losses on shareholders. 
Nine years on, with those lenders well capitalized, authorities are tightening the screws on smaller banks, but without the generosity shown to the larger players. 
The Sharjah government proposed to buy Invest Bank shares for just 0.70 dirhams ($0.19) each, against the last traded price of 2.40 dirhams, after the central bank ordered it to take losses that wiped out its capital base.
""The central bank has become much more involved with all of the banks in ensuring (they) have a sustainable business model and the risks they are taking can withstand downside shocks,"" said the banker. 
A second banker said the central bank had been closely scrutinizing distressed assets and challenging banks on their classification assumptions for such assets, especially in the real estate sector. 
The central bank did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
HIGHER EXPOSURE 
Mik Kabeya, assistant vice president at rating agency Moody's, said smaller banks tended to have higher exposure to small and mid-sized corporates, which have been disproportionately affected by the relatively soft economy.
He added that there was a need for scale to meet sizeable investment requirements related to compliance, digitalization and new accounting standards. 
The central bank is becoming increasingly strict with the banks in terms of maintaining minimum capital, liquidity and loan loss reserve levels, said Redmond Ramsdale, senior director, financial institutions at Fitch Ratings. ""Real estate and contracting sectors are a large sectorial exposure across all UAE banks. This is putting pressure on asset quality metrics for all banks.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Global investors are shoring up portfolios against economic downturn, with plans to cut allocation to publicly listed equities in 2019 in favor of assets such as private equity and real estate, according to the results of a BlackRock survey.
Over half the 230 institutions managing $7 trillion of inevitable assets surveyed by BlackRock plan to decrease allocation to public equities this year, up from 35 percent in 2018, the survey, released on Monday, showed.
Global stocks suffered their worst year in over a decade in 2018, with trepidation surrounding economic slowdown, trade tension and rising interest rates infecting the market in the second half of the year. Markets have been similarly volatile at the start of 2019.
Equities appear to be especially in disfavor in the United States and Canada, with 68 percent of investors there planning to reduce allocations, versus 27 percent in continental Europe, the survey showed. 
Underpinning this rebalancing is concern that the economic cycle is turning, as cited by 56 percent of clients. 
While strong economic data in the United States and a dovish message from U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell on Friday have helped to alleviate some worries, the U.S. and Canada-based investors were most concerned about rising U.S. interest rates, BlackRock said.
This represented just over half of those surveyed (52 percent), while geopolitical instability and trade tensions were citied as bigger concerns by European and Asian accounts. 
BlackRock said private assets and fixed income are likely to be the main beneficiaries of the shift in sentiment in 2019, as investors search for uncorrelated sources of returns. 
As such, 54 percent of those surveyed intend to increase exposure to real assets, 47 percent planned to boost private equity allocations and 40 percent chose real estate.
Flows to fixed income are expected to increase to 38 percent, from 29 percent a year earlier. Within this asset class, private credit is set to benefit -- 56 percent of those surveyed globally planned to increase allocations to the sector. 
Cash too will be a key part of portfolios though BlackRock highlighted regional differences. Of Asia-Pacific accounts, 33 percent planned to increase cash holdings while 27 percent of continental European accounts aimed to decrease cash.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's most globally high-profile and successful carmaker, Geely, is forecasting flat sales this year, a sharp slowdown from 2018 as the country's giant auto market struggles with slowing economic growth and more cautious consumers. 
Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (HK:0175), the main listed unit of the Geely empire which owns Volvo Cars and Proton, posted sales growth of 20 percent in 2018. 
That was despite a slide in sales at a host of other carmakers and forecasts that last year was the first in decades to see a fall in sales in China’s overall car market. 
The gloomy forecast for 2019 highlights how the year is likely to be tough for all carmakers, including General Motors (N:GM) and Great Wall Motor (SS:601633). 
Geely said in a filing that despite its growth last year, it had missed a sales target of 1.58 million cars by around 5 percent. 
Its sales started to slow in the last quarter of 2018, with a 44 percent drop in December alone, according to monthly sales data filings.
Some other domestic and international firms have flagged a sharp drop in demand in China at the end of last year, including Apple Inc (O:AAPL), which cut its global sales forecast due to Chinese weakness. 
Geely’s chairman Li Shufu said in a new year’s address that the year ahead was pivotal. 
“We must lay the foundation for our survival, otherwise we may soon face a period of demise,"" he said in the address posted on Geely's social media last year. 
China's auto market likely contracted last year for the first time since at least 1990, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said last month, citing economic shifts, weakness in smaller cities and “international reasons” - which could refer to the Sino-U.S trade war. 

The industry body expects around 28 million vehicle sales in 2019, roughly level with 2018.

113,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 07:20AM ET</span>","Too Early to Throw in the Towel on U.S. Stocks, JPMorgan Says","(Bloomberg) -- Don’t give up on U.S. equities just yet, say JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). strategists.
For many investors the U.S. cycle appears long in the tooth, but the record high buybacks, the region’s earnings growth that exceeds the rest of the world, and the accelerating revenue all favor U.S. stocks, the strategists, led by Mislav Matejka, said in a note.
U.S. equities just had their worst year since the financial crisis in 2008 as investors turned cautious amid trade tensions with China and rising concerns that growth may be peaking. But JPMorgan analysts remain optimistic on U.S. stocks with an overweight recommendation within developed markets as they expect the robust economy to support equities.
The earnings growth for S&P 500 companies this year is seen at 7.7 percent, compared with 24 percent in 2018, according to a Bloomberg survey. Last year’s profit boom was fueled by the U.S. tax reform and promoted a rally in equities through the end of September before investors turned negative.
The sell-off in U.S. equities in the fourth quarter sank valuations to 2013 lows. The S&P 500 Index has attempted a recovery in the first trading sessions of 2019 -- with mixed results so far.
“One should not extrapolate U.S. growth slowdown all the way into recession, though, as jobless claims, and labor market more broadly, remain well behaved,” the JPMorgan strategists said. “China is progressively increasing stimulus.”
In addition, the fact that the U.S. is not decoupling anymore from the rest of the world has a “silver lining” as a compromise on trade is becoming much more likely, they said.
Globally, JPMorgan prefers developing-market stocks, to those in developed economies, on lower valuations and the possibility that the U.S. Federal Reserve might slow the pace of rate increases.

Developing-nation assets roared ahead on Monday, continuing Friday’s theme, as traders took their cue from China’s move last week to release more cash into the financial system and speculation that the Federal Reserve will pause interest-rate increases this year.
Indonesia’s rupiah at one point registered its biggest gain since 2015, driving the MSCI EM Currency Index to its highest level since July, while a gauge of stocks clocked up its best two-day advance in two months. Russian and Nigerian dollar bonds were among the biggest winners in the debt markets as oil rallied a sixth day.
“The Goldilocks scenario turned to tatters during 2018,” Piotr Matys, an emerging-market foreign-exchange strategist at Rabobank in London, wrote in a report Monday. “However, it seems that this expression has been dusted off from the lexicon of financial markets following comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday, who gave severely battered investors what they wanted to hear.”
Powell said Friday policy makers are “listening carefully” to markets, denting the dollar and boosting the allure of riskier investments. The global economic outlook also received a boost from a better-than-expected U.S. jobs report. Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China said it would lower the required reserve ratio for lenders by 1 percentage point, potentially releasing about $117 billion of liquidity.
While bears will point to how quickly the gains at the start of last year evaporated, bulls say developing-nations assets are close to a pivot point. Bank of America’s Bull & Bear Indicator, a gauge that told investors to sell right before emerging markets tanked a year ago, last week flashed its first buy signal for risky assets since the Brexit vote in June 2016.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). upgraded developing-nation shares, calling them its ""preferred value play,"" and BlackRock said attractive valuations offer a positive backdrop for the asset class.
Risk Premium
The largest emerging-market equity exchange-traded fund had its biggest gain in more than two months Friday, while the risk premium on sovereign debt narrowed by the most since November 2016, according to data compiled by JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).
True, two days of U.S.-China trade talks starting Monday are hanging over markets, though Mitul Kotecha, a senior strategist at TD Securities in Singapore, says there are good reasons for both sides to want a breakthrough.
“Against the backdrop of market pressure in the U.S., the U.S. will want to arrive at a deal, while China, faced with slowing growth, will similarly want to come away from the table with some success. This makes a deal of sorts more likely,” he said.

The Pure Alpha Strategy, which has been run since 1991, gained 14.6 percent, after fees, a person familiar with the numbers said on Sunday evening. Over its lifetime, the strategy has returned an average 12 percent a year.
Many hedge funds are still compiling their returns for last year, but early data from Hedge Fund Research show the average fund lost 6.7 percent.
Bridgewater ranks as the world's biggest hedge fund and oversees $160 billion. It has earned roughly $50 billion for its investors over its lifetime, according to data from LCH Investments.
For some time, top Bridgewater executives have been sounding warning bells about growth, expressing concern long before more investors began worrying about the pace of central bank interest rate hikes and the strength of the economy that helped trigger a sharp market decline in past months.
Greg Jensen, one of Bridgewater's co-chief investment officers, told Reuters late last year: ""The biggest theme developing is that you are going to have significantly weaker growth, near-recession-level growth in 2019, based on our measures, and the markets are generally not pricing that in.""

Nucor is also benefiting from higher steel prices for domestic producers due to tariffs imposed on imports by the Trump administration last year. 
The new mill, which is expected to be fully operational in 2022, would produce 1.2 million tons a year of steel plate products and create about 400 full-time jobs, the company said. 
""Tax reform, continued improvements to our regulatory approach and strong trade enforcement are giving businesses like ours the confidence to make long-term capital investments here in the United States,"" Chief Executive Officer John Ferriola said in a statement.

Nucor currently operates plate mills in North Carolina, Alabama and Texas.

The blue-chip Dow futures were flat by 6:55 AM ET (10:55 GMT), S&P 500 futures dipped 0.13%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 0.3%.
Two days of trade talks between the U.S. and China got underway in Beijing on Monday, with investors hoping the two sides can strike a comprehensive trade deal before the end of a 90-day truce in the trade war.
Washington and Beijing have until March 1 to make a deal, after which U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to ramp up tariffs to 25%, from 10%, on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.
The prolonged trade spat between the world’s two largest economies has given rise to fears over an economic slowdown in China following a recent string of weak economic data and fueled concerns over the impact on the broader global economy after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) issued a revenue warning last week.
Political risks also weighed on investor sentiment, with U.S. lawmakers still unable to reach an agreement to end a government shutdown.
U.S. markets rebounded Friday, with the Dow surging more than 700 points after a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report and following comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who indicated the central bank would be patient and flexible on monetary policy this year.
Powell said the Fed is not on a preset path of interest rate hikes and that it will be sensitive to the downside risks markets are pricing in.
Despite Friday's stronger than expected U.S. December jobs data, many analysts believe the world's largest economy is losing momentum and further rate hikes are the last thing it needs.
On the data front, ISM non-manufacturing figures for December are due to be released at 10:00 AM ET and are expected to show a modest decline.

LONDON (Reuters) - A set of strong employment data in the United States, decisive action from the Chinese central bank and dovish messages from U.S. Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell combined to push world stocks further off recent lows on Monday. 
The resumption of talks between the United States and China on tariffs also helped bring back some optimism to a market battered in recent weeks by trade tensions and a weakening global growth outlook. 
European shares held on to Friday's strong gains after a stellar opening for Asian bourses, pushing MSCI's world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, to its highest level in 2-1/2 weeks. It is now 6 percent higher than its December trough. 
""It is a reminder that central banks still have some firepower to deal with lower growth prospects, and perhaps what we are also getting some return of liquidity as investors return from the holidays and the ability to think things through,"" said Investec economist Philip Shaw. 
He warned, however, that there is continued uncertainty about global growth, trade talks between the United States and China and U.S. monetary policy. 
""There are a number of questions that remain unanswered,"" Shaw said. 
On Friday, U.S. non-farm payrolls data showed the world's largest economy added 312,000 net new jobs in December, while wages rose at a brisk annual pace of 3.2 percent, both way above expectations.
This, along with a 100 basis point cut in China's bank reserve requirement ratios and comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell that the U.S. central bank would be flexible in its approach in 2019, has been the main driver for the recovery.
The boost to stock markets saw them recapture all the year’s losses and push into positive territory for 2019 so far, with Wall St's main indices closing up more than 3 percent by the close on Friday.  
After gains of more than 2 percent in Shanghai and HK on Friday before the U.S. jobs data and Powell's comments, both markets added almost 1 percent more on Monday. Japan’s Nikkei reversed Friday’s plunge to gain 2.4 percent.
European stocks were more or less flat across the board, though mining stocks (SXPP) surged 1.1 percent after the reserve requirement ratio cut from China boosted metals prices, especially steel and iron ore.
This renewed optimism saw U.S. Treasury yields rise off recent lows, and two-year yields move back above the federal funds rate to 2.485 percent.
That is nearly 50 bps below the November peak, however, suggesting there is still plenty of nervousness around growth prospects for the U.S. economy. 
""Clearly markets are now pricing in the risk of a cut in 2019,"" said Shaw of Investec. ""That's a big shift given until relatively recently when we've been focusing on rate hikes."" 
BUYING THE DIP? 
Some of the stocks recovery may be attributed to investors buying stocks once again in the belief that the market had bottomed out or had overshot in pricing in global risks. 
In any case, Friday was a strong session for Wall Street, with the Dow (DJI) recording gains of 3.29 percent, while the S&P 500 (SPX) jumped 3.43 percent and the Nasdaq (IXIC) 4.26 percent.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) researchers expect a bounce in equity markets in 2019. 
""If, as we expect, global economies slow down in 2019 but avoid recession, and U.S. interest rates peak, there is likely to be a risk rally,"" they said in a note. 
Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said that with 2,055 of 2,767 U.S. and global companies in a bear market, it might be time to buy.
""Our Bull & Bear Indicator has fallen to an 'extreme bear' reading, triggering the first 'buy' signal for risk assets since June 2016,"" they wrote in a note.
The U.S. dollar -- which served as a safe haven in 2018 -- fell broadly, with the euro edging up to $1.1442 (EUR=) and the dollar index (DXY) easing 0.3 percent to 95.90. 
The currency could not even hold early gains on the yen, lapsing back to 108.21 .
Gold benefited from the diminished risk of U.S. rate hikes and rose half a percent to $1,291.12 , just off a six-month high.

Oil prices firmed after Brent bounced about 9.3 percent last week. The crude benchmark (LCOc1) rose 118 cents on Monday to $58.24 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures (CLc1) gained 93 cents to $48.89.

""We have taken immediate steps to support the investigation led by local law enforcement officials and protect the relevant information,"" BASF said.
BASF said in an email to Reuters on Monday that an unspecified number of other suspects in the case are former BASF employees. It declined to provide any estimate on losses.
The case comes amid fears among German officials and executives about industrial espionage involving Europe's largest manufacturing nation.

128,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 05:10AM ET</span>",Ex-Goldman Sachs banker denied bail in Malaysia pending extradition to U.S.,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A Malaysian court on Monday refused bail to former Goldman Sachs (N:GS) banker Roger Ng, pending his extradition to the United States where he faces charges related to suspected money laundering of funds siphoned off from state fund 1MDB. 
Ng has been detained in Kuala Lumpur since Nov. 1, shortly after the U.S. Department of Justice announced charges against him, another Goldman Sachs official Tim Leissner, and Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho over the alleged theft of billions of dollars from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). 
Leissner, a former partner for Goldman Sachs in Asia, pleaded guilty to conspiring to launder money and violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, while Low has denied wrongdoing and remains at large.
Malaysian prosecutors have filed separate criminal charges against the three, as well as an application to extradite Ng to the United States.
Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing.
Defense lawyer Tan Hock Chuan last week requested that Ng be released on bail on medical grounds, pending the outcome of the extradition proceeding. 
Judge Edwin Paramjothy Michael Muniandy, however, dismissed the request on Monday saying there was insufficient evidence that Ng was not fit enough to remain in custody. 
The judge said the court also considered Ng a serious flight risk, given the gravity and high-profile nature of the cases against him in Malaysia and the United States. 
""With the likelihood that the respondent will abscond, I'm of the considered view that the respondent's presence (in court) cannot be secured by the setting of bail or the setting of any condition to the granting of bail,"" he said. 
Tan said he would appeal the judge’s ruling and that a reply against Ng's extradition would be filed by Feb. 15. 
According to prosecutors, Goldman Sachs generated about $600 million in fees for its work with 1MDB, which included three bond offerings in 2012 and 2013 that raised $6.5 billion.
Leissner, Ng and others received large bonuses in connection with that revenue.
Goldman Sachs has denied wrongdoing saying certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to the bank about the proceeds of bond sales. 
The Malaysian government has said it is seeking up to $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman Sachs over its dealings with 1MDB.
The U.S. Justice Department has estimated that a total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level 1MDB fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014, including some of the funds that Goldman Sachs helped raise.
The 1MDB scandal erupted in 2015, and led to last year's electoral defeat of Najib Razak, ending his near decade long stint as prime minister.
The new government led by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad reopened investigations into 1MDB and charged Najib, who is now facing four trials involving a total of 39 criminal charges related to the fund's losses. 
He has plead not guilty to all charges. 
In a separate court on Monday, a judge fixed July 8 for the opening of one of those trials.
Najib, along with his former treasury chief Mohamad Irwan Serigar Abdullah, were each charged with six counts of criminal breach of trust in the case, which involves the alleged misappropriation of about $1.5 billion in government funds. 
Prosecutors have prepared a list of 138 witnesses for the trial, which is scheduled to run until Aug. 22, government lawyer Jamil Aripin told the court.

The three lawyers, headed by chief lawyer Motonari Otsuru, will speak at the FCCJ hours after Ghosn makes his first public appearance in seven weeks at a Tokyo court after he requested an open hearing to hear the reason for his continued detention.
Ghosn's arrest has put Japan's criminal justice system under international scrutiny and sparked criticism for some of its practices, including keeping suspects in detention for long periods and prohibiting defense lawyers from being present during interrogations, which can last eight hours a day.
The lawyers' news conference will be at 3:00 p.m. local time (0600 GMT), the FCCJ said. Otsuru's office confirmed to Reuters that the news conference will take place but could not give further details.
Ghosn was arrested on Nov. 19 on allegations of financial misconduct, followed by re-arrests over further allegations. He has already been indicted for under-reporting his income, but local media has said he has denied the allegation.
Last week, the court approved extending his detention to Jan. 11 after he was re-arrested by prosecutors who accuse him of aggravated breach of trust in transferring personal investment losses to Nissan.
Ghosn's arrest was followed by his removal from roles at Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211). The case has rocked the auto industry and strained Nissan's ties with French partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) where he still remains chairman and chief executive.
Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa told AFP that the automaker's alliance with Renault is not in danger at all, the news agency reported on Monday. He declined to comment directly on the case against Ghosn, AFP said.

Ghosn is being held in the spartan Tokyo Detention Center, a tower-like structure in the eastern part of Tokyo - a place that, with its many rules and restrictions, makes for a stark contrast with his comfortable, globe-trotting lifestyle prior to his arrest.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - New Trump administration policies aimed at curbing China's access to American innovation have all but halted Chinese investment in U.S. technology startups, as both investors and startup founders abandon deals amid scrutiny from Washington.
Chinese venture funding in U.S. startups crested to a record $3 billion last year, according to New York economic research firm Rhodium Group, spurred by a rush of investors and tech companies scrambling to complete deals before a new regulatory regime was approved in August. 
Since then, Chinese venture funding in U.S. startups has slowed to a trickle, Reuters interviews with more than 35 industry players show.
U.S. President Donald Trump signed new legislation expanding the government's ability to block foreign investment in U.S. companies, regardless of the investor's country of origin. But Trump has been particularly vocal about stopping China from getting its hands on strategic U.S. technologies. 
The new rules are still being finalized, but tech industry veterans said the fallout has been swift. 
""Deals involving Chinese companies and Chinese buyers and Chinese investors have virtually stopped,"" said attorney Nell O'Donnell, who has represented U.S. tech companies in transactions with foreign buyers.
Lawyers who spoke to Reuters say they are feverishly rewriting deal terms to help ensure investments get the stamp of approval from Washington. Chinese investors, including big family offices, have walked away from transactions and stopped taking meetings with U.S. startups. Some entrepreneurs, meanwhile, are eschewing Chinese money, fearful of lengthy government reviews that could sap their resources and momentum in an arena where speed to market is critical.
Volley Labs, Inc, a San Francisco-based company that uses artificial intelligence to build corporate training materials, is playing it safe. It declined offers from Chinese investors last year after accepting cash from Beijing-based TAL Education Group (N:TAL) as part of a financing round in 2017.
""We decided for optical reasons it just wouldn't make sense to expose ourselves further to investors coming from a country where there is now so much by way of trade tensions and IP tensions,"" said Carson Kahn, Volley's CEO.
A Silicon Valley venture capitalist told Reuters he is aware of at least ten deals, some involving companies in his own portfolio, that fell apart because they would need approval from the interagency group known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). He declined to be named for fear of bringing negative attention to his portfolio companies.
CFIUS is the government group tasked with reviewing foreign investment for potential national security and competitive risks. The new legislation expands its powers. Among them: the ability to probe transactions previously excluded from its purview, including attempts by foreigners to purchase minority stakes in U.S. startups. 
China is in the crosshairs. The Asian giant has been an aggressive investor in technology deemed critical to its global competitiveness and military prowess. Chinese investors have bought stakes in ride-hailing firms  Uber Technologies Inc  (UBER.UL) and Lyft, as well as companies with more sensitive technologies including data center networking firm Barefoot Networks, autonomous driving startup Zoox and speech recognition startup AISense.

A dearth of Chinese money is unlikely to spell doomsday for Silicon Valley. Investors worldwide poured more than $84 billion into U.S. startups for the first three quarters of last year, exceeding any prior full-year funding, according to data provider PitchBook Inc.
Still, Chinese funders are critical to helping U.S. companies gain access to the world's second-largest economy. Volley's Kahn acknowledged that rejecting Chinese investment may make his startup's overseas expansion more difficult.
""Those of us who are operators and entrepreneurs feel the brunt of these tensions,"" Kahn said.
It is a radical shift for Silicon Valley. Money has historically flowed in from every corner of the globe, including from geopolitical rivals such as China and Russia, largely uninhibited by U.S. government scrutiny or regulation.
Reid Whitten, an attorney with Sheppard Mullin, said that of the six companies he recently advised to get CFIUS approval for their investment offers, only two have opted to file the paperwork. The others abandoned their deals or are still considering whether to proceed.
""It is a generational change in the way we look at foreign investment in the United States,"" Whitten said.
CRITICAL TECHNOLOGIES
The decline in Chinese investment comes amid heightened tensions between Beijing and Washington. Trump has blasted China for its enormous trade surplus and for what he claims are its underhanded strategies to obtain leading-edge American technology.
The nations have already levied billions in tariffs on each other's goods. And Trump is considering an executive order to bar U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by China's Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763), which the U.S. government has accused of spying.
CFIUS is emerging as another powerful cudgel. Led by the U.S. Treasury, it includes members from eight other government entities, including the departments of Defense, State and Homeland Security. The secretive committee does not disclose much about the deals it reviews. But its most recent annual report said Chinese investors made 74 CFIUS filings from 2013 to 2015, the most of any nation. The president has the authority to make the final decision, but a thumbs-down from CFIUS is usually enough to doom a deal.
Washington demonstrated its tougher stance even before the new law was passed, when Trump in March blocked a $117 billion hostile bid by Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd (O:AVGO) to acquire  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) of San Diego. CFIUS said the takeover would weaken the United States in the race to develop next-generation wireless technology.
A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.
In November, CFIUS rolled out a pilot program mandating that foreign investors notify the committee of any size investment in certain ""critical technologies."" The scope of that term is still being defined, but a working list includes artificial intelligence, logistics technology, robotics and data analytics – the bread and butter of Silicon Valley.
Research firm Rhodium predicted that up to three-quarters of Chinese venture investments would be subject to CFIUS review under the new rules.
Just the threat of that scrutiny has caused some Chinese investors to reconsider.
Peter Kuo, whose firm, Silicon Valley Global, connects Chinese investors with U.S. startups, said his business has slumped dramatically. In 2018, he said not a single Chinese investor took a stake in the companies he shopped to them.
""CFIUS didn't kill our organization, but it hampered a lot of startups, and most of them are American startups,"" Kuo said.
SAFE SIDE OF THE FENCE
Some security experts applaud what they call long-overdue protections for U.S. startups.
""What we are concerned about is a limited number of bad actors who are phenomenally clever about how they can access our intellectual property,"" said Bob Ackerman, founder of AllegisCyber, a venture capital firm based in San Francisco and Maryland that backs cyber security startups.
Rhodium calculates that, on average, 21 percent of Chinese venture investment in the United States from 2000 through 2017 came from state-owned funds, which are controlled at least in part by the Chinese government. In 2018, that figure surged to 41 percent.
But some tech industry players say Washington is casting too wide a net in its zeal to check Beijing.
""A lot of innocent business people are getting"" caught up in the administration's spat with China, said Wei Guo, the China-born founding partner of Silicon Valley firm UpHonest Capital, whose funding comes mostly from foreign investors with ties to China.
Adding to Silicon Valley's anxiety, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has taken a more active role in policing Chinese investment.
Two industry veterans, a startup adviser and a venture capitalist who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters they were recently cautioned by the FBI not to pursue deals with Chinese investors. The two people did not name the Chinese entities of interest to the FBI, but said the deals concerned U.S. companies building artificial intelligence and autonomous driving technologies.
Whether any of this deters China from reaching its goal of dominating advanced technologies remains to be seen. China can still invest in U.S. technology through layers of funds that obscure the money source. And Chinese investors are redirecting funds to promising companies in Southeast Asia and Latin America. 
U.S. startups, meanwhile, are rewriting deal terms to avoid a CFIUS review. Strategies include adding provisions to prevent foreign investors from obtaining proprietary technical information, and denying them board rights, veto rights or additional equity in future rounds, attorneys told Reuters.

""People are rightfully concerned about making sure they are on the safe side of the fence,"" said Jeff Farrah, general counsel of the National Venture Capital Association.

135,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 12:50AM ET</span>","Powell, Not China, Gives Asia Stocks $330 Billion Banner Day","(Bloomberg) -- It’s the start of the first full week of stocks trading in Asia, and optimism is in the air -- about $330 billion of confidence to be precise.
With a sea of green in markets across the region, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index rallied as much as 2.1 percent Monday, eking out its first hint of gains for the new year. Japan’s Topix index surged more than 3 percent, and Taiwan was next in line with a 2.1 percent climb.
But before we start listing the obvious reasons for the euphoria, let’s point out that China and Hong Kong -- among the most watched markets in Asia -- have not joined in on the fun to the same extent, with the Hang Seng Index and Shanghai Composite Index up less than 1 percent each and the biggest Mainland-listed banks actually edging lower. Hong Kong’s benchmark, which actually had a good 1.6 percent start to the day, has trimmed its gain to 0.8 percent.
It appears investors may have digested the encouraging news last week from the central banks of the two largest economies and a blowout U.S. job reports. The verdict is in: thumbs up on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments that policy is flexible and not so much on Beijing’s latest policy boost.
“After so many false hopes on the trade standoff, markets seem to be treating any signs of light at the end of the tunnel suspiciously,” said Nader Naeimi, head of dynamic markets with AMP Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney. “So apart from a short-term sigh of relief following Powell’s dovish comments and the PBOC’s RRR cut, the question remains: ‘Is there more downside to growth?”’
Overall, markets will remain volatile until we see credible signs of a turnaround in economic data after the recent wave of disappointing PMI figures in China and elsewhere, he said.
‘Merely Neutral’
Here’s another possible explanation: while an extra 800 billion yuan ($117 billion) sloshing around China’s financial system is nothing to sneeze at, this fresh easing is “merely neutral” as the released funds will be used to pay back the People’s Bank of China for past medium-term lending facility borrowing that’s maturing, according to Michael Every, head of Asia financial markets research at Rabobank in Hong Kong.
“Only when the next round of RRR cuts or MLF extensions kick in will we see a net increase in liquidity,” Every said in a note to clients.
Others are not so sure. Edward Lim, chief investment officer of Covenant Capital Pte in Singapore, says it may take a while to actually see any positive market impact from China’s ongoing moves.
“China has been reflating its economy over the last seven to eight months through a series of RRR cuts, lower rates and fiscal stimulus,” he said. “History guides these will take nine to 10 months to filter into the real economy. We expect China economic momentum to bottom in the first quarter and improve thereafter.”

136,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 12:45AM ET</span>",Tesla CEO Musk says to break ground on Shanghai Gigafactory today,"By Yilei Sun and Adam Jourdan
SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) on Monday will break ground for its Shanghai Gigafactory where it will begin making Model 3 electric vehicles (EV) by year-end, Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1082103637990625281 ahead of the formal start of construction of the firm's first Chinese plant.
The $2 billion factory - long under discussion - marks a major bet by the U.S. electric vehicle maker as it looks to bolster its presence in the world's biggest auto market, where it faces rising competition from a swathe of domestic rivals and its sales have been hit by increased tariffs on U.S. imports.
""Looking forward to breaking ground on the @Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory today!"" Musk wrote in a post on Twitter.
Musk has said previously he would attend the event in Shanghai. Tesla officials in China declined to comment.
The carmaker, which currently imports U.S.-made vehicles to sell in China, is building the plant in an auto market that is set to contract this year for the first time in decades, though so-called new-energy vehicle (NEV) sales have been strong.
China raised the import tariff on U.S.-made cars to 40 percent in July, but cut it back to 15 percent from the start of this year as part of a ceasefire in a trade war with the United States. The lower tariff will last until the end of March pending trade talks.
A local plant will help Tesla lower prices in the market to compete with a new generation of local rivals including Nio Inc (N:NIO), Byton and XPeng Motors.
""Affordable cars must be made on same continent as customers,"" Musk said in another tweet.
""Shanghai Giga will produce affordable versions of 3/Y for greater China. All Model S/X & higher cost versions of Model 3/Y will still be built in US for WW market, incl China,"" he later added, referring to the worldwide market including China.
Alan Kang, Shanghai-based analyst for consultancy LMC Automotive, said: ""Tesla's sales (in China) have dropped over the past few months because of high price caused by the tariffs. And the competition is getting more and more fierce.""
""With the construction of the Shanghai factory, the faster the better (for Tesla),"" Kang said.
CONSTRUCTION TARGETS
Tesla has been pushing forward its plans for the plant after it secured the site in October, hiring staff, starting procurement for building materials and setting up a financial leasing company in the city.
The so-called Gigafactory would also be China's first wholly foreign-owned car plant, a reflection of China's broader shift to open up its car market even amid the whipsawing trade war.
Tesla plans to produce its Model 3 and Model Y cars in the initial phase of production at the Shanghai plant, with an annual capacity of 250,000 vehicles.
""Aiming to finish initial construction this summer, start Model 3 production end of year & reach high volume production next year,"" Musk wrote in a separate post on Twitter.
""Shanghai Giga production of Model 3/Y will serve greater China region,"" Musk added in another one.
Shares in Chinese suppliers to Tesla, including Tianjin Motor Dies Co Ltd (SZ:002510) and  VT Industrial  Technology Co Ltd (SZ:300707), rallied on Monday after Musk's comments.
The Shanghai government last month said mayor Ying Yong had visited the site and urged Tesla to ""accelerate"" work on the factory. He said production would start to some degree in the second half of 2019.

China is the largest market for electric vehicles, and most forecasters predict EV sales in the country will accelerate rapidly as the government drives toward a goal of 100 percent electric vehicles by 2030.

137,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2019 12:43AM ET</span>",Huawei launches server chipset as China pushes to cut reliance on imports,"By Sijia Jiang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] on Monday launched a new chipset for use in servers, at a time when China is pushing to enhance its chip-making capabilities and reduce its heavy reliance on imports, especially from the United States.
Huawei, which gets the bulk of its revenue from the sale of telecommunications equipment and smartphones, is seeking growth avenues in cloud computing and enterprise services as its equipment business comes under increased scrutiny in the West amid worries about Chinese government influence over the firm. 
Huawei has repeatedly denied any such influence.
Chinese firms are also seeking to minimize the impact of a trade dispute that has seen China and the United States slap tariffs on each other's technology imports.
For Huawei, the launch of the chipset - called the Kunpeng 920 and designed by subsidiary HiSilicon - boosts its credentials as a semiconductor designer, although the company said it had no intention of becoming solely a chip firm.
""It is part of our system solution and cloud servicing for clients ... We will never make our chipset business a standalone business,"" said Ai Wei, who is in charge of strategic planning for Huawei's chipsets and hardware technology. 
The Shenzhen-based company already makes the Kirin series of smartphone chips used in its high-end phones, and the Ascend series of chipsets for artificial intelligence computing launched in October.
It said its latest 7 nanometre, 64-core central processing unit (CPU) would provide much higher computing performance for data centers and slash power consumption. It is based on the architecture of British chip design firm ARM - owned by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) - which is seeking to challenge the dominance in server CPUs of U.S. maker  Intel Corp  (O:INTC).
Huawei aims to ""drive the development of the ARM ecosystem"", said Chief Marketing Officer William Xu. He said the chip has ""unique advantages in performance and power consumption"".
Xu also said Huawei will continue its ""long-term strategic partnership"" with Intel.
Huawei's new ARM-based CPU is not a competitor to the U.S. company's x86 CPUs and servers, but complementary, Xu added. 
Redfox Qiu, president of the intelligent computing business department at Huawei, said the company shipped 900,000 units of servers in 2018, versus 77,000 in 2012 when it started. 
Huawei was seeing ""good momentum for the server business in Europe and Asia Pacific"" and expects the contribution from its international business to continue to rise, Qiu added. 
Huawei on Monday also released its TaiShan series of servers powered by the new chipset, built for big data, distributed storage and ARM native applications.
The firm founded chip designer HiSilicon in 2004 to help reduce its reliance on imports.

In modem chips, Huawei internally sources 54 percent of those in its own devices, with 22 percent coming from  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) and the remainder from elsewhere, evidence presented at an antitrust trial for Qualcomm showed.

Chip exports from the region were up 16.6 percent year on year in 2018 to the end of November, accounting for just over a third of headline export growth.
While Goldman’s analysts expect the technology downturn to be benign, with modest price declines, they also see a risk that it could be worse than expected because of consumers delaying purchases once prices start to fall.
The most vulnerable would be South Korea, where chip exports accounted for 92 percent of headline export growth. Malaysia and Taiwan would be next hardest hit.
Goldman expects Korea’s semiconductor exports to weaken to falls of 7 percent year-on-year in the second half of 2019, the weakest since the global financial crisis. Together with other global headwinds that would lower the country’s current account surplus by $10 billion to about $60 billion, or 3.7 percent of GDP, its lowest in 7 years, it added.
Recent weak export data for South Korea suggests the slowdown could be more rapid than expected, Goldman said."

143,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2019 09:34PM ET</span>",Sears picks liquidator should rescue talks fall through: sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Mike Spector
(Reuters) - A long-standing liquidator is now first in line for one of the U.S. retail sector's most daunting assignments: shutting down 126-year-old department store chain Sears Holdings Corp (PK:SHLDQ), people familiar with the matter said on Sunday. 
Sears has lined up Closter, New Jersey-based Abacus Advisory Group LLC to sell the chain's vast inventories of tools, appliances and store fixtures should negotiations with Chairman Edward Lampert over his $4.4 billion takeover bid end unsuccessfully, the sources said. 
Lampert's bid to rescue Sears through an affiliate of his hedge fund, ESL Investments Inc, has fallen short so far, the sources said. The billionaire and Sears are racing to resolve the bid's sticking points before a Tuesday court date after negotiations dragged well beyond a Friday deadline, the sources said. 
The bid would preserve 425 Sears stores and up to 50,000 jobs across the United States, according to a letter delivered to Sears on Dec. 28. A liquidation would put roughly 68,000 people Sears now employs out of work.
Besides tapping Abacus, Sears has turned to a firm run by retail magnate Jay Schottenstein to help it shed inventory in the event of a liquidation, the sources said. Schottenstein is the chief executive of teen apparel chain  American Eagle Outfitters  Inc (N:AEO) and chairman of shoe seller  DSW Inc  (N:DSW).
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Sears and Alan Cohen, chairman of Abacus, declined to comment. Schottenstein could not be immediately reached for comment.
Abacus has a 16-year history with Sears, after liquidating more than 800 stores for the once-mighty chain since 2002, according to bankruptcy court papers. Sears had already retained Abacus as a liquidation consultant after filing for bankruptcy, but decided to take offers from other liquidators.
Sears decided to continue working with Abacus last Friday after turning down bids from competitors that have worked on some of the biggest wind-downs in recent years, including Bon-Ton Stores Inc, Toys ""R"" Us Inc and Sears Canada, the sources said. 
Abacus has worked on several liquidations, including Filene's Basement and Service Merchandise Corp, according to its website.
ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMS
A main point of contention in the negotiations between Lampert and Sears on Sunday centered on whether Lampert's bid adequately addressed so-called administrative claims, the legal term of art for the bankruptcy costs Sears has racked up since filing for bankruptcy protection on Oct. 15, some of the sources said. 
Those costs, which include bills from lawyers and financial advisers, are expected to exceed $200 million, those sources said. 
Under one scenario being discussed, Lampert would agree to cover the shortfall if Sears cannot fully pay those bills, these sources said. 
Lampert's bid also proposes forgiving $1.3 billion of debt he holds in exchange for ownership of the reconstituted Sears, a bankruptcy maneuver known as a credit bid. In addition, Lampert wants a release from legal exposure related to a series of transactions he engaged in with the retailer before it filed for bankruptcy protection. Those made him the company's biggest creditor, in addition to its largest shareholder.
Lampert's offer did not include putting up cash to back the credit bid. That has raised concerns in the negotiations since there remains a chance that the maneuver might not be allowed in court given ongoing investigations of Lampert's pre-bankruptcy deals, which the hedge fund manager maintains were proper, the sources said.
Lampert's takeover bid is not likely to go forward absent settling the concerns related to the proposed credit bid and legal release, one of the sources said. 

Unsecured creditors have pushed for Sears to liquidate, partially because they contend they will realize a better financial recovery if it does. Those creditors, which include Sears landlords and bondholders, have also questioned Lampert's pre-bankruptcy transactions with the retailer.

144,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 06, 2019 09:20PM ET</span>",Huawei Unveils New Chipset Using ARM Design for Server Push,"(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. unveiled a new processor chip for servers as the Chinese telecommunications gear giant pushes ahead with expansion despite closer scrutiny from abroad.
The Kunpeng 920 is built using the cutting edge 7-nanometer process and uses the semiconductor architecture of ARM Holdings (LON:ARM), Shenzhen-based Huawei said in a statement on Monday. The new chips would compete with the dominant x86 server architecture used by U.S. giants  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc.
Huawei is showing no signs of tempering its ambitions even after a number of setbacks on the international stage. Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou was arrested last year on allegations of violating sanctions on Iran, the U.S. and its allies are questioning its security and some wireless customers have resisted using its technology. The company has long rejected suggestions its gear poses a risk.
The Kunpeng 920 performs 25 percent higher than the industry benchmark, operates at a better power efficiency than its peers and will boost the development of big data, the company said. The company also unveiled a new server based on the processors.
“Huawei has invested patiently and intensively in computing innovation to continuously make breakthroughs,” Chief Strategy Marketing Officer William Xu said in the statement. “Huawei and Intel will continue our long-term strategic partnerships and continue to innovate together.”
While best known for its networking gear and smartphones, Huawei also sells components and services for internet-connected devices. It’s Enterprise Business Group generated more than $10 billion in revenue in 2018, about a 10th of the company’s total.
The company shipped 918,000 server units in 2018, a 25 percent increase from the year earlier, according to presentation materials from Huawei.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) cut the reserve requirement ratio for banks by 1% last Friday as Beijing hoped to stimulate lending after weaker-than-expected PMI data released last week suggested a slowing economy.
The cut will release a net 800 billion yuan ($117 billion) of liquidity, the central bank said in a separate statement, adding that the cut is still a ""targeted"" easing rather than wide-ranging stimulus.
""The PBOC is reacting to the recent deterioration of the economic environment,"" said Stefan Grosse, an economist at Nord LB in Hanover, Germany. ""The weak PMI in China as well as the ISM PMI manufacturing in the U.S. point to a slowdown of the global economy. Expect more governmental stimulus to come.""
The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component gained 0.4% and 1.1% by 9:05 PM ET (02:05 GMT) on Monday following the news.
Meanwhile, citing a person familiar with the matter, the South China Morning Post reported that U.S. President Donald Trump is likely to hold talks with Wang Qishan, China’s vice president, at the World Economic Forum later this month in Davos.
The meeting would follow another round of trade talks scheduled to start in Beijing on Monday between U.S. and Chinese officials.
Citing two person familiar with the preparations, Bloomberg said the talks would focus on issues including intellectual property, agriculture and industrial purchases. Preliminary discussions have been “a little more optimistic than usual,” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Bloomberg on Friday.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd is set to post its first drop in quarterly operating profit in two years as slowing economic growth in China, a key market for the South Korean tech giant, erodes demand for its products. 
Bleak results from the world's top maker of semiconductors and smartphones would add to worries for investors, already on edge after Samsung's biggest rival Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) this week took the rare step of cutting its sales forecast on slowing iPhone demand in China.
Samsung, due to publish preliminary fourth-quarter results on Jan. 8, is expected to see a 12 percent year-on-year drop in operating profit to 13.3 trillion won ($11.85 billion) for the period, I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv shows. 
""Depressed demand in China will further drive down Samsung's chip sales there. And China's overall smartphone market is stalled and declining, which will affect not only Apple but Samsung,"" Song Myung-sup, a senior analyst at HI Investment & Securities, told Reuters. 
Revenue is expected to have slipped 5 percent, hurt by lower memory-chip shipments. Samsung had in October slashed its 2018 capex, calling an end to a two-year bonanza for memory chips as the global smartphone market slowed.
This headwind continued to buffet the industry in the fourth quarter, with overall sales in the world's top smartphone market China falling 8 percent in the preceding three months, according to Counterpoint Research. 
CHINA IS KEY
Samsung's worldwide smartphone business has not been spared, with profit at the unit expected to have slumped by a fifth in the fourth quarter, Refinitiv data shows. 
""You see, Apple's iPhones are already losing sales in China. For Samsung too, how long this weak demand from China's mobile phone market will continue is key,"" said Park Jung-hoon, a fund manager at HDC Asset Management, which owns Samsung shares.
Samsung has a less than 1 percent share of China's smartphone market, versus 9 percent for Apple. But its memory and processor chips, which account for over three-quarters of its earnings and about 38 percent of sales, power smartphones including those from China's top player Huawei [HWT.UL]. 
Amid the smartphone woes, overall operating profit at Samsung's chip business is expected to have slipped 3.7 percent from a year ago to 10.5 trillion won.
Its memory-chip shipments fell 10 percent on an average in the fourth quarter, according to brokerage Eugene Investment & Securities. 
MORE PAIN AHEAD
Analysts say that Apple's woes and Samsung's are indicative of tougher times ahead for global businesses, as dismal growth in the world's second-largest economy, exacerbated by a long China-U.S. trade war, takes a toll.
China's factory activity contracted for the first time in over two years in December. The World Bank has estimated the weakest GDP expansion for the country in nearly three decades this year.
South Korea's semiconductor exports to China dropped for the first time in more than two years in December.
China is a major market for South Korean chipmakers that, led by Samsung and smaller rival SK Hynix, exported roughly 41 percent of their products to the mainland between January and November 2018.
Samsung's profit is expected to decline through 2019 as the weakness persists, Refinitiv data showed.
Prices for DRAM chips, which provide devices with temporary workspaces and allow them to multitask, declined 10 percent in the fourth quarter, according to industry tracker DRAMeXchange.
Prices of NAND flash memory chips, which hold data permanently, slipped 15 percent. 
DRAMeXchange anticipates memory chip prices to fall 10 percent on an average in the first quarter.

149,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2019 05:26PM ET</span>",Mexico offensive against fuel theft leaves motorists stranded,"By Fernando Carranza Garcia and Anthony Esposito
GUADALAJARA, Mexico (Reuters) - An offensive by Mexico's new government against fuel theft at one of the country's main refineries has led to days of shortages at gas stations in several central states, as authorities move more fuel by tankers and less by vulnerable pipelines.
A Reuters witness said many gas stations in the city of Guadalajara in Jalisco state were closed on Sunday, including those operated by state oil firm Pemex, Spain's Repsol (MC:REP) and  BP  (LON:BP). There were long lines of motorists at those that were operating.
""I've gone to 10 gas stations and nothing, there's none at any of them,"" said Alan Delgado, trying to fill his Buick truck at a BP gas station in Guadalajara. ""This is a serious and critical situation because it complicates work and businesses."" 
The shortages followed the closure of a pipeline from the Salamanca refinery in the central state of Guanajuato, and as Pemex started using more tankers to transport fuel.
Theft by gangs and oil industry workers from Mexico's state-controlled refineries is a major drain on government resources, but the measures taken to tackle the crime could also weigh on the economy if shortages drag on.
Violent criminal gangs have for years used fuel theft as a way to supplement their income, bleeding money from state coffers and driving bloodshed as they fight rivals and extort oil workers.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, confirmed on Friday that less fuel was being sent through pipelines.
""I ask citizens for understanding and support, because we need to solve this problem together. We are trying to get it resolved soon,"" Lopez Obrador said in a televised speech.
Obrador has vowed to tackle theft ""outside and inside"" Pemex, or Petroleos Mexicanos [PEMX.UL], which estimates that fuel worth more than 146 billion pesos ($7.40 billion) has been stolen since 2016 alone.
The president said last month that Mexico's armed forces would take part in security at Pemex installations around the country, including its refinery in Salamanca.
Fuel theft there has been linked to a surge in violence, according to Guanajuato state governor Diego Sinhue.
The Mexican Association of Gasoline Station business owners warned its members on Jan. 3 that no fuel was being transported via the pipeline from the Salamanca refinery.
""You are free to take measures that benefit your customers, to limit the sale (of fuel) to 10 liters per car or whatever you consider necessary to serve the public,"" the association said.
Guanajuato governor Sinhue took to Twitter on Sunday, saying that Pemex's chief executive Octavio Romero ""confirmed that after reopening the Salamanca-Leon pipeline, he expects to reestablish service to 100 percent of the gasoline stations during the day."" 
It was not immediately clear whether opening that pipeline would reduce shortages in other regions.
Pemex said on Saturday that it is ""preferring the use of safer means of transport, which means changes in the logistics for delivery to service stations,"" leading to delays in the states of Hidalgo, Mexico, Jalisco, Michoacan, Guanajuato and Queretaro.
Pemex said it is aiming to boost distribution in the affected states by up to 20 percent, transporting fuel by tanker trucks and trains.
A May 2017 study commissioned by the national energy regulator found that thieves, between 2009 and 2016, had tapped pipelines roughly every 1.4 kms (0.86 miles) along Pemex's approximately 14,000 km pipeline network.
The government has not made clear if they see road and rail transport as a long term solution for fuel distribution.
Transporting fuel by road and rail is 12 to 16 times more expensive than by pipeline, said Gonzalo Monroy, a Mexico City-based oil analyst.

""If this keeps happening and expanding to other parts of the country, the Mexican economy is going to have a very tough first quarter,"" said Monroy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he was in no hurry to find permanent replacements for one-quarter of his Cabinet currently serving in an acting capacity because it gives him ""more flexibility.""
""I am in no hurry,"" Trump told reporters as he departed for Camp David, the U.S. presidential retreat, for meetings on the partial government shutdown. About one-fourth of the U.S. government has been shuttered for more than two weeks and about 800,000 government workers have been either furloughed or working without pay. 
""I like acting. It gives me more flexibility. Do you understand that? I like acting. So we have a few that are acting. We have a great, great Cabinet,"" Trump said. He did not elaborate on why they give him more flexibility.
There are 24 Cabinet-level positions and six are currently filled by individuals who are serving in an acting capacity after the departure of members confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
Other than the White House chief of staff and the vice president, Cabinet-level officials require confirmation by the Senate. Federal law allows presidents to temporarily fill vacancies by appointing acting department heads who are already employees there. 
Trump said last month he was in no hurry to name a new defense secretary after Jim Mattis quit over policy differences, and he has praised the acting secretary, Patrick Shanahan. 
David Bernhardt is acting secretary of the Interior Department while Matthew Whitaker is acting attorney general. Andrew Wheeler is acting head of the Environmental Protection Agency while Mick Mulvaney is the acting White House chief of staff. Jonathan Cohen is acting ambassador to the United Nations. 

In the first two years of Trump's presidency, there has been a 65 percent turnover rate among senior-level advisers, according to the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.

154,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2019 08:25AM ET</span>",France presses Renault over executive compensation paid via Dutch holding company,"By Richard Lough and Caroline Pailliez
PARIS (Reuters) - The French government has told  Renault  (PA:RENA) to provide more details on compensation paid to senior executives via a Dutch holding company jointly owned with alliance partner Nissan, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday.
Le Maire made the demand after France's CGT trade Union voiced concerns over payments made to certain high-ranking executives via the alliance's Renault-Nissan BV (RNBV) Dutch venture and called for more transparency at the carmaker.
Corporate governance inside the alliance has come under tight scrutiny after Japanese authorities arrested its chairman Carlos Ghosn in mid November on suspicion of under-reporting his income at Nissan (T:7201).
The French state is Renault's biggest shareholder. 
Le Maire told CNews television that the government had written to Renault's leadership to ""request all details necessary for full transparency on these compensation payments"". 
""I want to know who these payments were made to, if they were declared and therefore whether ... the Renault board was aware of them.""
A Renault spokesman did not immediately return calls and messages seeking comment.
The Ghosn affair, sparked by a Nissan internal investigation, has rocked the auto industry, strained Nissan's ties with Renault and complicated diplomatic relations between Japan and the France.
A one-time titan of the auto industry, Ghosn, who has since been ousted as Nissan chairman, is also accused of aggravated breach of trust in transferring personal investment losses to Nissan.
Ghosn denies all the charges against him.
Renault board members including the French state's representatives have yet to be given full access to Nissan's findings against Ghosn, which have been shared with Renault's lawyers. The restrictions are justified by judicial confidentiality, the company has said. 
Executives from both carmakers - including Renault General Secretary Mouna Sepehri, who oversees communications with the board - had looked at least twice at legal ways to pay Ghosn undisclosed income through RNBV or other shared finances, Reuters revealed last month.
Those two efforts were ultimately abandoned. Immediately after Ghosn's Nov. 19 arrest, however, Nissan told Renault privately it was extending its internal investigation to cover their Dutch-registered alliance holdings.
Ghosn will make his first public appearance in seven weeks at a Tokyo court on Tuesday after he requested an open hearing for an explanation on his continued detention.

Ghosn's son, Anthony, told the Journal du Dimanche that Japanese prosecutors wanted his father to sign a confession..

156,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2019 05:55AM ET</span>",Philippine court orders arrest of Japanese casino mogul Okada,"MANILA (Reuters) - A Philippine court has ordered the arrest of Japanese pachinko billionaire Kazuo Okada, about a month after the country's Department of Justice recommended the filing of charges against him over three counts of fraud.
The DOJ has found cause to indict Okada for three counts of swindling after he acquired ""through mistake or fraud"" $3.15 million in salary and consultancy fees during his tenure as chief executive of Manila casino operator Tiger Resort.
Okada had filed a motion for reconsideration at the DOJ, dismissing the accusations against him as baseless.
Judge Rolando How of the Paranaque City Regional Trial Court Branch 257 ordered the National Bureau of Investigation and the Philippine National Police to present Okada to court. The warrant of arrest was issued on Friday and made public on Sunday. 
The bail was fixed at 348,000 Philippine pesos ($6,627) for all three charges.
Tiger Resort previously said the payments were facilitated by its former president and were not authorized by its board.
Reody Anthony Balisi, Okada's legal counsel in the Philippines, did not reply to Reuters' requests for comment on the arrest warrant.
Okada last year was ousted as chairman of Tiger Resort's parent, the Japanese gaming group  Universal Entertainment  Corp (T:6425), after Universal's board accused him of misappropriating $20 million. He denied wrongdoing.
It was unclear if Okada was in the Philippines when the court issued the arrest warrant.

He was arrested in Hong Kong in August in relation to multiple corruption-related charges and is currently on bail.

157,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 06, 2019 04:30AM ET</span>",Seven Key Issues to Determine Success of U.S.-China Trade Talks,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. and Chinese officials are set to begin trade negotiations on Monday in the hope of reaching a deal during a 90-day truce between President Donald Trump and his counterpart Xi Jinping.
While the mid-level talks probably won’t produce a major breakthrough, the stakes are high as both sides face a resumption of tariffs in March if they don’t strike a deal. More senior-level discussions are expected later this month, with the South China Morning Post reporting that Trump may hold talks with Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
Here are seven issues that will be key to making headway:
1. Intellectual Property
The U.S. accusation that China forces American companies to share sensitive technology and steals intellectual property is one of the thorniest issues, and could make or break any potential deal. The 90-day negotiations will focus on “structural changes” in the way China handles technology transfers, intellectual-property protection, cyber-theft and other issues, the U.S. said after Trump and Xi met in Argentina.
China has announced an array of punishments that could restrict companies’ access to borrowing and state-funding support over intellectual-property theft, and is drafting a law to prevent forced technology transfer. But the devil will be in the details and execution.
2. Huawei and 5G
Huawei Technologies Co., China’s biggest maker of telecom equipment, has long denied accusations by the U.S. and its allies of facilitating state-sponsored espionage. The company is racing to develop 5G technology and owns a tenth of essential patents worldwide. But its efforts have been frustrated by the U.S., which has banned its products for government procurement and encouraged other nations to do the same.
Beijing has also demanded Canada release Huawei’s chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, who was arrested in Canada on the behalf of the U.S. for alleged bank fraud. The FBI is also probing possible Iranian sanctions violations by the company. Two Canadians who were seized after Meng’s arrest remain detained in China.
3. Made in China 2025
Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” plan aims to transform China into an advanced manufacturing leader by targeting 10 emerging sectors including robotics, clean-energy vehicles and biotechnology. The industrial ambition has raised the ire of the White House, which argues its state-led intervention violates WTO rules and could create an unfair playing field for foreign investors. Tariffs imposed by Trump took aim at many of the industries targeted in the plan.
China sees the plan as essential to achieving its long-term economic goals. Last month, people familiar said China may be willing to amend the plan, perhaps even postponing some of it by a decade, if that helps bring an end to the trade war.
4. Energy
The trade tensions have disrupted what should be a sweet deal for the two countries: The U.S. is becoming a major oil and natural gas exporter while China has emerged as the world’s biggest buyer of both. While lifting China’s retaliatory tariff on U.S. liquefied natural gas may revive sales, the bigger, longer-term concern for the industry is restoring enough trust to convince Chinese companies to invest the billions of dollars in future American LNG export projects. Meanwhile, any assurances from Beijing that it won’t target U.S. crude would help dispel the concerns that choked off sales last year.
5. Agricultural imports
Investors will be watching to see if China removes retaliatory tariffs on U.S. farm products -- including soybeans, corn, cotton, sorghum and pork -- that severely hurt America’s heartland. Lifting the tariffs could encourage private buyers to immediately resume U.S. farm-product purchases. China may also remove its anti-dumping and anti-subsidy tariffs on U.S. distiller’s dried grains, which China is the largest buyer of, as well as allow imports of U.S. poultry after it gave the green light on U.S. rice purchases. If talks fail, China may also cancel some soybean orders that have been placed over the past weeks.
6. Auto tariffs
After imposing a 25 percent retaliatory tariff on vehicles imported from the U.S., China temporarily scrapped the duty starting Jan. 1 as the world’s two largest economies looked for a way to cool trade tensions. The additional tax has hurt all carmakers that sell U.S.-made cars in China, including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., BMW AG and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn). Auto sales in China have fallen for six consecutive months through November, and December data is due this week.
7. Market access for banks
China has pledged to increase access for foreign-owned financial firms. In November, UBS Group AG became the first entity to win control of a local securities joint venture under rules that were eased in 2018. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). and Nomura Holdings Inc. are still waiting for approval to take 51 percent stakes in onshore partnerships.
Xi says the opening is steadily widening, and Bloomberg Economics estimates that -- barring a major economic slowdown or change -- foreign banks and securities companies could be raking in profits of more than $32 billion a year in China by 2030.

158,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 06, 2019 02:10AM ET</span>",Saudis Slash Oil Output. Get Ready for Trump Tweets,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The list of things that President Donald Trump criticizes in his tweets varies from one day to the next. He may soon have to direct his ire to oil prices and the actions of his ally, Saudi Arabia, once again. 
The desert kingdom is already making good on its promise to slash supply, and the initial evidence suggests that the biggest cut is being made in deliveries to the U.S. On top of that, the price it charges American buyers of its crude has been raised to near record levels for cargoes to be shipped in February. That could be bad news for a president who just celebrated falling gas prices.
The OPEC+ group of countries met in December and, after Russia took the reins, eventually agreed to cut supplies by 1.2 million barrels a day from January. For Saudi Arabia, that meant cutting production to just over 10.3 million, but it pledged to go further — oil minister Khalid Al-Falih told reporters and analysts that it would be slashed to 10.2 million barrels a day in January.
The first job was to unwind the output surge made in November that had helped to deliver the price drop hailed by Trump. That was done last month. Saudi production in December was back below the October baseline used for its (and most other countries’) promised cuts.
That couldn’t have been what Trump wanted, given what he tweeted the day before OPEC began its meeting in Vienna — at the time, crude prices were in the midst of their worst quarterly decline in four years.
Bloomberg’s tracking of crude exports from Saudi Arabia indicates that the biggest drop in flows from the kingdom was in the volume heading for the U.S. Shipments to ports on the Atlantic, Gulf and West coasts fell by nearly 60 percent between November and December to just over 350,000 barrels a day. That’s the lowest since Bloomberg started tracking these flows in January 2017.
The size of the drop isn’t set in stone — a small number of ships signaling that they are heading for the Suez Canal or Singapore could eventually go to the U.S. Even so, a decline in Saudi crude shipments to American ports should start to show up in lower deliveries after about six weeks. By mid-February, U.S. imports of the kingdom’s oil could fall to the lowest in more than 30 years, according to data from the Department of Energy. The last time the flow from Saudi to the U.S. fell below half a million barrels a day was in the mid-1980s, after the kingdom slashed its production by 80 percent over four years in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to prop up oil prices. 
It’s not just this volume decline that is going to rile Trump. The price of that oil isn’t going to make him happy either. 
Saudi Arabia sets its crude prices a month in advance of it being loaded at its export terminals, so it has just published its price list for February. In common with other producers, it does not set an outright price, but rather a differential to regional benchmarks for each export grade and each market area.
Price differentials for U.S. buyers have been going up since August and for most grades are now close to record levels. Saudi heavy crude, which is the closest alternative to dwindling supplies from Venezuela and Mexico, is the most expensive it’s been since 2009 in relative terms.
It makes sense for Saudi Arabia to focus its cuts on sales to the U.S., the only country that publishes detailed weekly data on oil imports and inventory levels — traders watch the reports closely. This means the reductions will be evident more quickly than would similar cuts to other destinations, so a drop in American imports should have a much more immediate impact on price expectations.
There is no reason to doubt that Al-Falih will do what he said in Vienna. It was only after slashing exports to the U.S. in July 2017 that oil prices really began to recover, and Saudi Arabia will be hoping for a similar impact this time, too. But don’t be surprised if that also unleashes angry tweets from the U.S. president.

160,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2019 06:20PM ET</span>","Japanese prosecutors want Ghosn to sign confession, says son: paper","PARIS (Reuters) - Japanese prosecutors want Carlos Ghosn, the detained auto executive who oversaw an alliance that sold 10 million vehicles a year, to confess to financial misconduct, his son told France's weekly Journal du Dimanche (JDD).
Ghosn has been held in a Tokyo detention center since his Nov. 19 arrest on allegations of under-reporting his income at Nissan Motor Co Ltd. He is also accused of aggravated breach of mistrust in transferring personal investment losses to Nissan, from which he has since been ousted as chairman.
Ghosn denies the charges against him.
Anthony Ghosn, 24, has not been allowed by Japanese authorities to see his father, who he said had lost 10 kilograms in weight eating three bowls of rice a day in detention.
In his first interview since Japanese prosecutors seized his father as he stepped off his private jet, Anthony Ghosn said his father would fight to clear his name. 
Asked if his father spoke Japanese, Anthony Ghosn said he did not. ""The paradox is that the confession they want him to sign is written exclusively in Japanese."" 
Ghosn's arrest marked a dramatic fall for a business leader once hailed for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy.
The executive has been treated like others in detention, held in a small, chilly room, and denied a lawyer during interrogation.
Ghosn's detention has drawn scrutiny upon the legal system in Japan, where legal experts say prosecutors often try to force confessions from suspects. Deputy prosecutor at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, Shin Kukimoto, last month said no such method was being used with Ghosn.
Anthony Ghosn told the JDD that his father's lawyer has still not seen the prosecutor's full case file.
""From what I understand, in the Japanese system, when a person is held in detention, the prosecutor reveals little by little the elements that he has at his disposal. On each occasion, my father then shares these details with his lawyers.""
Ghosn is set to make his first public appearance in seven weeks at a Tokyo court on Tuesday after he requested an open hearing to hear the reason for his continued detention.
""For the first time, he will be able to answer the allegations against him, to give his version of events,"" Anthony Ghosn said, adding his father would appear in prison attire and be handcuffed.

The value of diesel cars plummeted after German environmental groups scored a court victory last year that forced cities to consider bans of older diesel vehicles to bring emissions into line with European Union clean air rules.
The FAZ daily said state authorities filed a lawsuit with a court in Stuttgart at the end of last year, seeking damages totaling ""low double digit millions"". 
Volkswagen could not confirm this, and told Reuters the company had not seen the particular lawsuit. 
But it added that previous court decisions had backed its stance that legal actions to seek damages are without merit given that VW cars had valid road certification at the time of sale.
Officials at Baden-Wuerttemberg state could not be immediately reached for comment.
The paper said taxpayer money had been spent on buying and leasing diesel vehicles for the police service. It did not specify how Baden-Wuerttemberg had lost money. 
U.S. regulators in 2015 blew the whistle on Volkswagen's systematic emissions test cheating which revealed that the carmaker's vehicles emitted far higher levels of nitrogen oxide pollution than permitted by the law. 

A global clampdown on pollution ensued, prompting regulators and environmental groups in Germany to scrutinize emissions. Unlike in the United States, older VW cars have not been found to be illegal in Germany after the carmaker agreed recall its vehicles to modify emissions filtering systems.

One of the biggest rallies of the bull market sent equities soaring on Friday, with the S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average both climbing more than 3 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index gaining 4.3 percent after a better-than-expected jobs report and sympathetic comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. It was the second time in just over a week that all three major indexes breached the 3 percent level.

The city has announced 18 policy measures to further enhance the healthy development of enterprises in the real economy, and will provide more fiscal and financial support, lower corporate costs and make it easier for firms to do business, the official Chongqing Daily reported on Saturday. 
Chongqing will set up a relief fund of at least 10 billion yuan ($1.46 billion) to help private firms suffering from temporary liquidity problems, the newspaper added.
Other provinces and regions have also sought to provide more support for the private sector, with the world's second-largest economy losing momentum aggravated by an ongoing trade dispute with the United States. 
The northeast rustbelt province of Liaoning also introduced 16 measures to help revitalize private firms, and pledged to implement tax cuts, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday. 
China's factory activity contracted for the first time in more than two years in December, highlighting the challenges facing Beijing as it seeks to end tit-for-tat trade tariffs with Washington and reduce the risk of a sharper economic slowdown. 

In efforts to boost liquidity in the economy, China's central bank said on Friday it was cutting the amount of cash that banks have to hold as reserves for the fifth time in a year.

166,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2019 11:16PM ET</span>",Fund managers hoping for stock rally look to emerging markets,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - After emerging market stocks led global equity markets lower in a brutal 2018, some U.S.-based fund managers are betting that the asset class may have the largest rebound in the new year.
It may not look likely at the moment, given that an economic downturn in China prompted iPhone-maker Apple Inc (O:AAPL) to lower its quarterly revenue forecast on Wednesday for the first time in a decade. Its shares slumped nearly 10 percent after Chief Executive Tim Cook blamed the U.S.-China trade war and ""economic deceleration,"" prompting broad selloffs around the world the following day.
Yet fund managers from Westwood Holdings Group, GMO, T. Rowe Price and Causeway Capital Management are among those who are betting that emerging market stocks will post outsized gains in 2019. They cite a combination of compelling valuations and a likely decline in the value of the dollar that will help accelerate economic growth. 
As China continues to bear the brunt of U.S. President Donald Trump's focus on trade tariffs, fund managers are expecting that shares in countries like India, Thailand, Peru, and Brazil will outperform the China-dominated emerging market benchmark index. 
""We want to lean into the fear in the markets,"" said Sebastien Page, head of asset allocation at T. Rowe Price. He expects emerging markets will outperform in the year ahead as the Federal Reserve curtails its pace of interest rate hikes and the dollar subsides. 
""When you have a recovery in risk assets, those that have been undervalued can snap back the most,"" he said. 
Emerging markets have been in a bear market since September, placing them already four months into the deep declines that rocked the U.S. equities market in December. The average bear market in emerging markets has lasted 220 days and posted a decline of 32.4 percent, or about 7 percentage points more than the roughly 25 percent drop in the MSCI Emerging Market Index since it hit near-record highs last January, according to data from Ned Davis Research. 
While emerging markets started the year with another roughly 1.7 percent loss over the first two trading sessions, fund managers say they are increasing their bets on stocks in countries that are among the most beaten-down, expecting they will have the largest rebound if and when a global bull market in equities resumes. 
""I'm actually a lot more positive than this time last year because there are tremendous opportunities to add to high-quality names in insurance and some banks,"" said Patricia Perez-Coutts, portfolio manager of the Westwood Emerging Markets fund.
She has been increasing her stakes in South Africa, Thailand and Peru, she said, with the largest positions in companies such as South African life insurance company Sanlam Ltd (J:SLMJ) and  Credicorp Ltd  (N:BAP), Peru's largest financial holding company. Shares of Credicorp are up 8.8 percent over the last 12 months, while shares of Sanlam are down 3.9 percent over the same time.
Perez-Coutts has been underweight China since the start of last year, though she is starting to wade back in by buying shares in gaming and e-commerce companies that have plunged. 
""Though China's overall economy may not be growing as strongly as it did in the past, there are still areas of strong growth,"" she said. 
Joe Gubler, a quantitative portfolio manager at Causeway Capital Management, says emerging markets remain a compelling opportunity with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of approximately 10 even after the recent declines in the U.S. market have pushed the forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 to slightly below 15 for the first time in about 5 years. 
As a result, Gubler has been increasing his positions in small-cap companies in India, as well as energy companies that have sold off as the price of oil has tanked. He has also been increasing his position in companies that could benefit if there is a breakthrough in global trade talks. 
""The market is not in a mood to give emerging market stocks much credit,"" he said. ""If you look at the chart, the emerging market index is sitting at about the same place it was in 2009.

""If you had a let-up in trade and interest rates, you could see a decent-sized rally.""

Munoz's absence comes as Ghosn has been held in a detention center since his Nov. 19 arrest on allegations of financial misconduct, which was followed by re-arrests over further allegations. 
In a statement on Saturday, Nissan said that Munoz has taken a leave of absence ""to allow him to assist the company by concentrating on special tasks arising from recent events."" 
As a result, his planned appearance at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next week would be canceled, a Nissan spokesman said.
Reuters could not immediately reach Munoz for comment.
Munoz is considered by many in the company to be a close ally of Ghosn, whose arrest has rocked the auto industry and strained Nissan's ties with French partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) where he still remains chairman and chief executive.
It has prompted some soul searching at the Japanese automaker, which has acknowledged that too much power was concentrated with Ghosn after he oversaw the turnaround of the struggling automaker two decades ago following its rescue from the brink by Renault.
After stripping Ghosn of his chairman position following his arrest, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa has called for changes to weaken the clout of controlling shareholder Renault. 
Munoz, who serves as Nissan's chief performance officer, joined the automaker in 2004 in Europe, and led its ambitious expansion in North America after the global financial crisis. 
Since then, Nissan has succeeded in raising its market share in the United States, but profitability in the region has plummeted in the past few years due to heavy discounting on its vehicles, an issue that Saikawa has pledged to reverse.

Earlier this year Nissan tapped Munoz to oversee its operations in China, where it plans to ramp up sales over the next few years. Since then, the world's largest auto market has been showing signs of a slowdown, prompting the automaker to cut local production plans in the coming months.

168,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2019 07:56PM ET</span>",Exclusive: California utility PG&E explores bankruptcy filing - sources,"By Liana B. Baker, Greg Roumeliotis and Mike Spector
(Reuters) - California utility company PG&E Corp (N:PCG) is exploring filing some or all of its business for bankruptcy protection as it faces billions of dollars in liabilities related to fatal wildfires in 2018 and 2017, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. 
The company is considering the move as a contingency, in part because it could soon take a significant financial charge for the fourth quarter of 2018 related to liabilities from the blazes, the sources said.
A bankruptcy filing is not certain, the sources said. The company could receive financial help through legislation that would let it pass on to customers costs associated with fire liabilities, the sources said. But that is just a possibility, they said, so bankruptcy preparations are being made. 
As of Friday, PG&E was shying away from negotiating so-called debtor-in-possession financing that companies typically line up before a bankruptcy filing to help keep operating while under court protection, one source familiar with the matter said.
A bankruptcy filing is not PG&E's preference for addressing liabilities from the catastrophic blazes, some of the sources said. But the preparations could put pressure on California politicians hoping the company can avoid such an outcome.
Shares of PG&E, which has a market capitalization of $12.7 billion, dropped 30 percent in after hours trading in New York on Friday on the news.
""PG&E's board and management are working diligently to assess the company's potential liabilities as a result of the wildfires and the options for addressing those liabilities. We recognize the need to balance the interests of many stakeholders while maintaining safe, reliable and affordable services for our customers, which is always our top priority,"" the company said in a statement.
PG&E is also exploring selling its gas unit, potentially through a court-supervised auction during bankruptcy proceedings, one of the sources said. The sale could also take place outside a bankruptcy process, the same source said. The company is weighing using proceeds from the unit's sale to address death and injury claims arising from the recent wildfires, this source said.
NPR first reported on the exploration of the gas unit sale earlier on Friday. 
PG&E, which filed for bankruptcy once before in 2001, said in November it could face ""significant liability"" in excess of its insurance coverage if its equipment was found to have caused last year's fires in northern California.
The Camp Fire broke out on the morning of Nov. 8 near the mountain community of Paradise, sweeping through the town and killing at least 86 people, in the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in state history.
PG&E also faces dozens of lawsuits from owners of homes and businesses that burned during 2017 fires. 
The utility has been wrestling with how best to proceed after two years of destructive fires. California policymakers had approved a bill that let utilities pass on to customers some costs related to wildfires, according to Moody's. But the bill did not cover 2018 fires. 
Filing for bankruptcy would shield PG&E from the liabilities, giving it time to figure out how to handle the claims. 
The company said on Friday that it was reviewing its ""structural options"" and assessing its operations, finances, management, structure and governance. It also said it is searching for new directors at its holding company and its utility subsidiary Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
PG&E added that it has formed a special board committee that includes independent experts to advise on wildfire safety best practices. 
Reuters reported last year that the company was working with bankruptcy advisors.
The utility has borrowed more than $3 billion under credit lines available to it, a move companies in financial distress will often make to shore up cash.
The California Public Utilities Commission last month opened proceedings to consider penalties against the company for falsifying pipeline safety records.

PG&E also filed for bankruptcy in 2001 during California's energy crisis. It had amassed too much debt by buying electricity, which it was then not allowed to recoup by increasing rates for its customers. It emerged from bankruptcy in 2004.

169,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2019 07:15PM ET</span>","Samsung, Huawei supply majority of own modem chips, Qualcomm says","By Stephen Nellis
SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) - The two largest smart phone makers in the world supply a majority of their own modem chips to help their devices connect to wireless data networks, according to evidence presented at an antitrust trial for chip supplier  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM).
A trial between the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Qualcomm kicked off in a federal courtroom in California on Friday, with the regulators arguing that Qualcomm engaged in anticompetitive patent licensing practices to preserve a monopoly on modem chips. The case is being closely watched because it may shed light on the likely eventual outcome of the global legal battle between Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Qualcomm.
Apple has alleged that Qualcomm engaged in illegal business practices, and Qualcomm in turn has alleged Apple violated its patents, scoring victories in China and Germany last month.
Qualcomm has argued its licensing practices follow long-established industry norms and that it charges broadly the same licensing rates that it had for many years before it ever started selling chips.
That has become a big market for Qualcomm, which controlled 59.6 percent of the $15.3 billion market for 4G modem chips in 2017, according to IDC's Phil Solis, who studies mobile chips for the research firm.
But Bob Van Nest, an attorney representing Qualcomm in the case, also sought to show that Qualcomm is not dominant in the world's two biggest handset makers.
During opening arguments, Van Nest's presentation said that Huawei [HWT.UL] internally sources 54 percent of the modem chips it puts in its devices and gets only 22 percent of its modems from Qualcomm, with the remainder coming from other unnamed makers. Samsung (KS:005930) internally sources 52 percent of the modem chips it uses, with 38 percent from Qualcomm and the rest from other makers, according to the presentation.
Huawei and Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Also, the FTC's case centers not on the overall modem chip market - which includes slower chips that go into cheaper handsets - but rather the market for speedy ""premium"" chips where Qualcomm is among the only options.
Huawei and Samsung are both large diversified technology corporations that make many other products aside from premium-priced smart phones. Huawei's HiSilicon unit supplies the chips for its high-end phones such as its Mate and P series. Samsung's chip division supplies processors and other components for many of its handsets and is also a dominant global supplier of memory chips beyond its own products.
The two firms are also Apple's fiercest rivals in the market for premium smart phones costing $700 or more. Apple depends entirely on  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) and Qualcomm for modem chips, though the iPhones released in 2018 use Intel modems exclusively.
Technology news publication The Information last month reported https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-developing-modem-as-chip-efforts-expand that Apple was designing its own modem chip, citing Apple job listings and a source briefed on Apple's plans. Apple declined to comment on its plans.

For the second quarter of 2018 - the most recent figures available from IDC - Apple was the third-largest smart phone supplier by volume, with Samsung and Huawei in first and second place, respectively.

The fire broke out on the morning of Nov. 8 near the Northern California mountain community of Paradise, sweeping through the town and killing at least 86 people in the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in state history. PG&E had reported equipment problems near the origin of the fire around the time it began.
PG&E faces billions of dollars of potential liabilities related to the wildfires if an investigation determines its equipment caused them.
PG&E, whose shares have lost nearly half of their value since the wildfire, said it is working with a leading search firm to identify new directors and is interviewing several candidates.
A company spokeswoman said no decision has been made on whether to increase the size of the board or to replace existing members.
PG&E said it is reviewing structural options to implement necessary changes while meeting customer and operational needs.
""The board is actively assessing PG&E's operations, finances, management, structure, and governance,"" the company said.
The company said it has formed a special board committee that includes independent experts to advise on wildfire safety best practices.
Earlier last month, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) opened a proceeding to consider penalties against the company, ordering immediate action against the utility for falsifying safety documents for natural gas pipelines.
The San Francisco Chronicle in December reported that California state Senator Bill Dodd called for a management shakeup at PG&E in light of the CPUC findings.

Dodd said findings of the regulator showed that the utility and its parent company, PG&E, need ""systematic change,"" including on its board of directors ""and in the executive suite,"" the newspaper had reported.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street rebounded on Friday to close at its highest in two weeks after a strong jobs report and assurances from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that the central bank would be patient and flexible in steering the course of interest rates.
In a session emblematic of the elevated volatility that has gripped markets for weeks, all three major U.S. stock indexes surged more than 3 percent in one of the broadest advances in years. The gains more than wiped out the previous session's losses and were led by the technology sector, which bounced back from its largest one-day decline in more than seven years after Apple Inc (O:AAPL) cut it sales outlook.
Since hitting a 20-month low on Christmas Eve just a rounding error from levels considered to be a bear market, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) has now gained 7.7 percent. Friday's advance, measured by the number of stocks rising versus those falling, was the broadest in more than eight years.
The main catalysts for the surge were the monthly U.S. payrolls report, which blew past economists' forecasts with the largest number of jobs created in 10 months, and comments by the Fed's Powell.
In remarks to the American Economic Association, Powell soothed market nerves with assurances that the central bank is sensitive to risks that worry investors and is not on a preset path of interest rate hikes.
Speaking after months of volatility in world bond and stock markets, Powell avoided some of the communication missteps that in the past have roiled rather than calmed investors. He also pledged to stay in his post even if asked to quit by President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly chastised the man he put in the job over the Fed's repeated rate hikes.
""(Powell is) saying the right things: that the Fed is prepared to shift, that it's listening carefully, that it's sensitive to the messages the market is sending,"" said James Athey, Senior Investment Manager, Aberdeen Standard Investments, in London. ""It's a good message for the market that is starting to consume itself out of fear.""
Still, others warn that the market's up-and-down roller coaster ride this week could be the new normal.
""While days like today feel good, we still anticipate more economic weakness ahead and expect a continued back-and-forth grind in markets,"" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. 
News that China and the United States would hold trade talks in Beijing next week helped tariff-vulnerable industrials lead the Dow's rally, headed by  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), United Technologies Corp (N:UTX), 3M Co (N:MMM) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA). 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 746.94 points, or 3.29 percent, to 23,433.16, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 84.05 points, or 3.43 percent, to 2,531.94 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 275.35 points, or 4.26 percent, to 6,738.86.
All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 ended the session in positive territory, with technology, communications services (SPLRCL), materials (SPLRCM) and industrial (SPLRCI) stocks seeing the largest percentage gains.
Apple shares rose 4.3 percent and led the tech sector's advance as the company began to recover ground lost after warning of a holiday quarter revenue shortfall on Wednesday.

And shortly after trading began, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell revved up buyers by saying the FOMC was prepared to be “patient” on monetary policy and would consider changing its balance sheet plans if warranted.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear an appeal filed by a subsidiary of chipmaker Broadcom Inc (O:AVGO) seeking to put an end to a shareholder lawsuit concerning its 2015 acquisition of Emulex Corp.
The legal question, which could affect other cases, is whether under the Securities and Exchange Act shareholders need to show intent to defraud when suing a company over statements made during the merger and acquisition process.
 Avago Technologies  Wireless Manufacturing, which later merged with Broadcom, paid almost $610 million to acquire Emulex Corp in 2015. Emulex made equipment for data centers such as chips and routers.
Gary Varjabedian, an Emulex shareholder, filed a securities class action lawsuit in federal court in California around the time of the deal seeking to prevent it. The move failed, but Varjabedian amended his lawsuit to include a claim that Emulex had failed to disclose data about other transactions between semiconductor companies when urging shareholders to accept the offer.
The plaintiffs have said they were misled into accepting a deal that may not have valued Emulex's shares highly enough.
A district court judge in 2016 dismissed the claim, finding that the plaintiffs had failed to show proof of intent, known in legal parlance as ""scienter.""
But in an April 2018 ruling, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived the litigation by ruling that the plaintiffs were not required to show intent. Instead, the court said, only a showing of negligence was required. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce business group urged the court to take the case, saying that shareholders have no right to make such claims, whether or not there is proof of intent.
A ruling is due by the end of June.

187,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2019 03:10PM ET</span>","Court battle, trade war and 5G spell tough 2019 for Apple in China","By Josh Horwitz and Stephen Nellis
SHANGHAI/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's chief executive Tim Cook has his work cut out in China this year: the iPhone maker faces the looming threat of a court-ordered sales ban, the uncertain outcome of trade war talks and the roll-out of a new 5G network, where it finds itself behind rivals like Huawei and Samsung.
The complex outlook raises a challenge for Apple as it looks to revive its China fortunes after weakness there sparked a rare drop in its global sales forecast, knocked $75 billion from its market valuation and roiled global markets.
Cook told investors that the main drag on the firm's performance in China had been a sharper-than-expected slowdown in the country's economy, exacerbated by the impact of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.
""We did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China,"" he said.
Chinese shoppers told Reuters another element had been key: the high price-tag on Apple's flagship phones.
Analysts said the firm faced a brewing storm of challenges: an economic slowdown, stronger rivals like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] bringing out comparable tech at lower prices and bubbling patriotic sentiment amid the trade war.
A Chinese court has also issued a preliminary injunction banning some Apple phones, part of a legal battle with chip maker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. This ban, potentially hitting iPhone models from the 6S through the X, has yet to be enforced.
On Thursday a local industry body, the China Anti-Infringement and Anti-Counterfeit Innovation Strategic Alliance, called on Apple to heed the court order and not ""trample the Chinese law by leveraging its super economic power and clout.""
Apple declined to comment on the group's statement but has previously said it believes its current phones comply with the Chinese court's order. 
""These are tough times for Apple in China,"" said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint, adding the iPhone could see its market share slip to 7 percent this year in the face of stronger local rivals and worry about the sales ban.
Apple's market share in the third-quarter of 2018 was around 9 percent, and has dipped from above 14 percent in 2015, overtaken by local rivals like Huawei, Oppo and Vivo.
Apple vs Huawei: https://tmsnrt.rs/2GWXNEf
5G STRATEGY
Another question mark for Apple is its 5G strategy in China, where the U.S. firm is not expected to have a 5G-enabled phone until 2020, behind rivals like Huawei, Xiaomi Corp and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930).
China is looking to push ahead with its rollout of a faster 5G network, with a pre-commercial phase this year and a commercial network in 2020.
Some are looking to make an early bet on the technology. Huawei is planning a 5G phone mid-year, while Xiaomi is aiming for the third quarter. Samsung is expected to unveil a 5G phone in the first half of the year.
Industry insiders, however, said Apple would likely hold off until the fall of 2020 to have its own 5G-enabled phone, a strategy that would bypass the untested early period of the technology, but which could mean Chinese shoppers delay iPhone purchases or buy another brand that switched to 5G earlier.
""I'll definitely be paying attention to 5G functionality when I buy my next phone,"" said Wu Chengjun, a graduate student in Beijing who currently uses an iPhone X.
With the exception of Huawei, which makes it own 5G chips, Qualcomm is providing the technology to many of the major phone makers releasing 5G handsets this year.
""If you're a [phone maker] looking for a 'super cycle' [of sales], if you don't have 5G, your situation won't get any better,"" Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm's president, told Reuters in an interview. ""The carrier channel is going to be incentivized to start selling 5G phones in the second half"" of 2019, he said.
But there are risks integrating 5G too early into high-end smart phones because the technology requires deeply re-designing the devices with multiple new antennas. Given spotty coverage in 2019, gambling on a new design before networks are mature could be more risk than reward, said Darryn Lowe, a Bain & Co partner who works with the wireless industry.
""When you think about 5G, it's a heck of a lot more complicated than an aluminum strip running around the phone,"" he said. 
And other shoppers and analysts said Apple's more cautious approach to 5G made sense and that the firm would not likely lose out too much to rivals by delaying its launch.
Apple's decision to wait to adopt 4G until after other makers didn't hurt it. But that was when consumers commonly purchased a phone every two years, a cycle that has elongated and might prompt buyers to want a more ""future proof"" device, said Glenn Lurie, CEO of Synchronoss Technologies and the former head of AT&T's wireless unit.
""If you're going to walk in to make a 30-month decision, the concept that I've already got 5G built in, it feels pretty good,"" Lurie said.
But buyers such as Li Hongzhuo, 22, a student in Beijing, said he was interested in 5G, but it wouldn't be the deciding factor and he preferred to wait until the technology was tried and tested.
""Typically my needs for my phone are high speeds for downloading videos or transferring files from chat apps. This will get faster (with 5G), but 4G already satisfies my needs,"" said Li.

""I won't really consider switching my phone until 5G has been operating stably on the market for some time without any bugs – or unless they stop offering 4G.""

188,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2019 02:17PM ET</span>",U.S. judge stands by ruling to limit evidence in Roundup cancer trials,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - A federal judge overseeing lawsuits alleging Bayer (DE:BAYGN) AG's glyphosate-based Roundup weed killer causes cancer on Friday declined to reconsider a ruling that limits evidence the plaintiffs in the litigation consider crucial to their cases.
U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria during a hearing in San Francisco federal court denied a plaintiff lawyer's request to review the decision, saying trials before him should focus on scientific evidence.
Chhabria on Thursday granted Bayer unit Monsanto's request to split an upcoming trial into two phases. The order initially bars lawyers for plaintiff Edwin Hardeman from introducing evidence that the company allegedly attempted to influence regulators and manipulate public opinion.
The decision lifted Bayer's shares, which on Friday closed up 6.7 percent at 64.90 euros ($74.02).
Thursday's order applies to Hardeman's case, which is scheduled to go to trial on Feb. 25, and two other so-called bellwether trials intended to help determine the range of damages and define settlement options for the rest of the 620 Roundup cases before Chhabria. 
Brent Wisner, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, during Friday's hearing told Chhabria his ruling is ""unfair"" as their scientific evidence allegedly showing glyphosate causes cancer is inextricably linked to Monsanto's alleged wrongful conduct.
""The science doesn't exist in some isolated, untouched world,"" Wisner said, adding that evidence of Monsanto's alleged attempts to manipulate, misrepresent and intimidate scientists has to be included.
The lawyers contend that such evidence, including internal  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) documents, showed the company's misconduct and were critical to a California state court jury's August 2018 decision to award $289 million in a similar case. The verdict sent Bayer shares tumbling at the time, though the award was later reduced to $78 million and is under appeal.
But Chhabria slammed that request, saying he did not want plaintiffs to ""focus on misrepresenting statements"" by Monsanto employees.
""My point is you're mischaractarizing what Monsanto people have said, you're putting your own spin on (it),"" Chhabria said.
Bayer denies that glyphosate causes cancer, saying decades of independent studies have shown the world's most widely used weed killer to be safe for human use.
But the company faces more than 9,300 U.S. lawsuits over Roundup's safety in state and federal courts across the country.

Under Chhabria's order, evidence of Monsanto's alleged misconduct would be allowed only if glyphosate was found to have caused Hardeman's cancer and the trial proceeded to a second phase to determine Bayer's liability.

208,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2019 12:05PM ET</span>",Brazil's Bolsonaro: worried Boeing could own all of Embraer's commercial division,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said on Friday he is concerned that a proposed sale of 80 percent of Embraer's (SA:EMBR3) commercial aviation business to Boeing (N:BA) could lead to the U.S. planemaker taking over all of the division. 
Bolsonaro's statement, made to reporters after an Air Force event, was the strongest indication yet of concerns by the Brazilian government, which has to greenlight the deal, over the proposed tie-up. 
Bolsonaro and his aides have generally supported the deal in public statements made in the past, but this is the first time he has discussed specifics. 
""The merger would be good,"" Bolsonaro said. But he noted that the proposed Embraer-Boeing tie-up could result in the Brazilian planemaker ""passing to the other side."" 
""That's our concern,"" he added. ""(Embraer) is our patrimony."" 
Under the terms of the deal presented by both companies last month, Embraer would keep 20 percent of its commercial division but would be allowed to sell that stake to Boeing within the next 10 years for around $1 billion, adjusted for inflation. 
After the 10-year period, Embraer could still sell its stake, but at fair value. 
A representative for Embraer declined to comment. Shares in the planemaker fell immediately following Bolsonaro's remarks, and were down nearly 3 percent in Sao Paulo on Friday afternoon. 

The deal could reshape midsized commercial aviation as competition between Boeing and Airbus intensifies. Airbus last July took control of the CSeries jet of Canada's Bombardier (TO:BBDb), which competed directly with Embraer's commercial planes, all of which can carry up to 150 passengers.

The California-based firm, which aims to accelerate Chinese sales that have been hit hard by the impact of trade tension between Washington and Beijing, said in a statement the starting price for a Model 3 in China would be 499,000 yuan ($72,000). 
Tesla cut prices for its Model 3 last month, the third time in the last two months for the firm to adjust prices in China.
In November, Tesla cut the prices of its Model X and Model S in China by 12 to 26 percent.
GIGAFACTORY
Tesla has opened a tender process to build a $2 billion plant in Shanghai - dubbed a Gigafactory - and at least one contractor has started buying materials, Reuters reported earlier last month.
The automaker has said it aims to initially produce about 3,000 Model 3 vehicles per week at the plant and localize its manufacturing and supply chain.

The factory, Tesla's first in China, marks a major bet by the EV maker as it looks to bolster its presence in the world's biggest auto market where it faces rising competition from a swathe of domestic rivals, while its earnings have been hit by increased tariffs on U.S. imports.

213,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2019 11:48AM ET</span>",Airbus chases aircraft lessors as order race tightens,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) has been chasing deals with leasing companies in recent weeks to try to narrow a gap in orders against rival Boeing (N:BA), while industry experts took a somewhat more sanguine view on 2018 deliveries after shares took a beating.
The outcome of the recent leasing talks could affect a tighter-than-expected race for orders in 2018, though Airbus is relying on a recent burst of orders for a newly acquired Canadian jet program and lags Boeing on a like-for-like basis.
The last-minute order flurry complicates a jigsaw of data awaited by investors as uncertainty lingers over whether Airbus met its crucial aircraft delivery target for 2018 - a reliable guide to profits and a barometer of supply chain tensions.
Industry sources have said Airbus was unlikely to meet the 800-jet goal (782 excluding the Canadian A220), but others said Airbus could still spring a surprise after workers delivered jets late on Dec. 31 that had not been expected to make the cut.
Bloomberg News reported on Thursday that Airbus had delivered more than 790 and fewer than 800 aircraft in 2018.
Shares in Airbus rebounded 3 percent on Friday after falling as much as 7.9 percent on Thursday due to doubts over deliveries and what dealers described as a possible trading error.
In a new year message to staff, planemaking chief and designated chief executive Guillaume Faury sounded upbeat on 2018 but warned industrial execution and quality must improve.
Even though official data would not be announced for a few days, ""all our team deserve a big congratulations,"" he said.
Airbus is due to announce commercial data on Jan. 11, but without the fanfare of an annual news conference that for years featured outspoken former sales chief John Leahy as the company reins in communication before its full results, due on Feb 14.
On the race for new orders, Irish leasing company SMBC Aviation was in talks with Airbus in the closing stretch of 2018 and looked close to expanding its narrow-body fleet by several dozen jets, industry sources said.
SMBC Aviation and Airbus declined comment.
Airbus was also said to be scouting for business in China, where it has a deal pending with lessor ICBC for 80 jets. 
A provisional order was announced at the Farnborough Airshow last July but the name of the buyer was never officially disclosed and the order is not yet on Airbus's books.
People familiar with the deal linked it at the time to ICBC Leasing, one of China's fastest-growing leasing companies.
A similar deal for 100 planes from Chinese-owned lessor Avolon, which had been kept under wraps in similar conditions as the industry waited to see how trade tensions between China and the United States would play out, was confirmed in December.
Both Airbus and Boeing typically turn to leasing companies to stay afloat when economic concerns deter airlines, but the financiers who now control about half the world fleet pick their moment carefully in order to capture the steepest discounts.
Airbus ended November with 380 net orders for 2018, to which it has since added 100 from Avolon and two U.S. deals for a total of 120 A220 aircraft. Boeing ended November with 690 net orders and has not announced firm new business since then.

The U.S. company publishes its data on Jan. 8.

218,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2019 11:10AM ET</span>",BAML says buy equities as sentiment falls to 'extreme bear' territory,"By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's ""Bull & Bear"" gauge of market sentiment has fallen to 1.8, a level the U.S. bank's strategists describe as ""extreme bear"" territory that has triggered a ""buy"" signal for equities.
This is the first time the ""buy"" signal for risk assets has been triggered since June 2016 when the Brexit vote sent global markets spiraling lower, the strategists said on Friday, adding it was ""time to buy"". 
The note came as markets rallied strongly after blowout employment figures from the United States lifted some investors' concerns about slowing economic growth. 
BAML said global equities have tended to rise after their ""buy"" signal was triggered. Their median performance the following three months - in the 15 occurrences since 2000 - has been 6.1 percent. 
Investors should buy the S&P 500, Chinese stocks, German stocks, U.S. small-caps, semiconductor and energy shares, U.S. and European high-yield bonds and emerging currencies, all of which are ""very oversold,"" the strategists said. 
They saw the S&P 500 rallying to 2,650 points.
Global markets have had a torrid December and difficult start to 2019 as trading was marred by a slowing global economy, and multiplying signs of the impact of a U.S.-China trade war, the most recent of which was a revenue warning from Apple Inc. (O:AAPL).
In recommended sells, BAML pointed to U.S. Treasuries, Japan's yen and healthcare and utility stocks considered ""defensive"".
BAML strategists said global equities have lost $19.9 trillion in market value since their peak in January 2018, close to the United States' nominal gross domestic product, which stood at $20.66 trillion a year in the third quarter of 2018. 
($20.66 trillion in the third quarter of 2018).
Citing data from flows tracker EPFR, BAML said the past six weeks have seen record outflows from equities ($84 billion) and investment-grade bonds ($34 billion), while government bonds have seen inflows of $24 billion.

243,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 04, 2019 09:40AM ET</span>","Trump Predicts Financial Markets to Calm Down, Blames Democrats","(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump blamed Democrats for the recent turmoil in U.S. financial markets and predicted that they’ll calm down.
“As I have stated many times, if the Democrats take over the House or Senate, there will be disruption to the Financial Markets,” Trump said on Twitter, a day after Democrats officially took control of the U.S. House. “We won the Senate, they won the House. Things will settle down.”
Trump regularly took credit for stock market gains during his first year in office, but has taken to faulting the minority party and the Federal Reserve for losses that analysts say have been exacerbated by his trade war with China and the partial government shutdown that he triggered with his demand for funds to pay for his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall.
The Twitter message came as White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on Fox News that Trump wouldn’t back down on his demand for wall funding, as the shutdown is set to enter its third week with no end in sight. Two measures that passed the House last night are “nonstarters” because they didn’t fund the proposed barrier, Sanders said.
Trump also lashed out at liberal Democrats who’ve called for his impeachment, after video leaked of freshman Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan at a political event. Tlaib told her son they planned to impeach the president, using an expletive to refer to Trump. “They only want to impeach me because they know they can’t win in 2020, too much success!” he said.
Trump tweeted, “How do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time, done nothing wrong (no Collusion with Russia, it was the Dems that Colluded), had the most successful first two years of any president, and is the most popular Republican in party history 93%?”

The deal, which is worth $95 billion including Celgene's debt, is the largest pharmaceutical deal ever and brings together two of the world's largest cancer drug businesses. 
Celgene's top executives, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, are entitled to severance benefits if they resigned with good reason or are terminated without cause within two years of the deal closing, according to the filing with the U.S. securities regulator on Friday.
The severance benefits include a cash severance payment equal to 2.5 times the officer's annual base salary and annual cash incentive opportunity, Celgene said https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/816284/000114420419000539/0001144204-19-000539-index.htm. 
Celgene CEO Mark Alles will be eligible for a severance benefit that would be three times his annual salary and cash incentive opportunity. 
The company is yet to disclose his 2018 compensation. 

If the termination or resignation is not connected to the deal closing, the severance payment would be 1.5 times the officer's salary, or two times in Alles' case, and would include cash incentive opportunity, Celgene said.

The Tesla chief executive officer shared an article Thursday written by a Forbes contributor that incorrectly said Tesla had become America’s No. 1 premium auto company. Forbes has since amended the story and clarified that the earlier version had compared Tesla’s global deliveries with U.S.-only sales for Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz, BMW AG’s namesake brand and Toyota Motor Corp.’s Lexus.
Tesla doesn’t report its U.S. sales on a monthly or quarterly basis like all other major automakers in the market, so it’s difficult to tell how much ground the company is actually gaining on Mercedes or BMW on American soil. But at least one of the two German giants has given Musk credit for starting to make an impact.
“Tesla is now ramping up their volumes, and it’s putting pressure on that market segment,” Bernhard Kuhnt, chief executive officer of BMW North America, told Bloomberg News in an Oct. 2 interview.

Trump also tried to soothe investor worries, saying markets would soon calm.
Fears of a global economic slowdown have roiled global financial markets in recent months amid ongoing concerns over the U.S-China trade war, tariffs and other economic concerns.
The major U.S. stock indexes posted their worst yearly performance in a decade in 2018 as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 marked their poorest December since 1931. [L1N1Z00LK] 
Since taking office in January 2017, Trump has repeatedly taken credit for stock market gains, frequently tweeting self-congratulatory remarks on Twitter. The S&P 500 and Dow reached record highs last fall. 
Amid market concerns in recent months, Trump blamed Democrats after they won control of the House in November's election though they didn't take control until Jan. 3. He has also criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who he tapped to lead the U.S. central bank.
""As I have stated many times, if the Democrats take over the House or Senate, there will be disruption to the Financial Markets. We won the Senate, they won the House. Things will settle down,"" Trump wrote in an early-morning post on Twitter on Friday. 

On Friday, U.S. stock index futures jumped after China agreed to resume trade talks with the United States and the government reported that U.S. employers hired the most workers in 10 months in December while boosting wages.

253,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2019 07:06AM ET</span>",Audits reveal Deutsche Bank's links to tax trade scandal," By John O'Donnell and Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - There are ""lots of indications"" that some managers discussed ""the reputational risks"" of  Deutsche Bank 's involvement in a share-trading scheme that is the subject of Germany's biggest post-war fraud investigation, according to a conclusion in one of five internal audits seen by Reuters.
The bank issued tax certificates for withholding tax that had never been deducted and made loans to clients to allow them to participate in the scheme to claim tax rebates, according to the audits.
German prosecutors say the scheme's participants misled the government into thinking a stock had multiple owners on its dividend payday who were each owed a dividend and a tax credit, according to court documents.
The authorities say the scheme, called ""cum-ex"" and involving several other global banks, cost the state 5.6 billion euros in rebates that should not have been paid.
Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) commissioned law firm Freshfields to write the five audits as part of an internal investigation into its role in cum-ex trading between 2006 and 2011. They are dated from 2013 to 2015 and marked ""highly confidential"".
The audits were prepared by Freshfields in Germany and London. One of the five documents is a summary that was handed to the prosecutors in May 2017. Reuters does not know whether the Freshfields documents are the final versions, but prosecutors have been given the summary for use in their investigation, according to a letter sent to the chief prosecutor, seen by Reuters. A spokesman for Freshfields declined to answer any questions for this story. 
One part of the audit addresses Deutsche Bank’s decision to lend money to companies – what the audit calls ""provision of finance"" -- so that those companies could carry out cum-ex trades and the discussion of risks to its reputation.
""Even though evidence is not clear-cut, there are a lot of indications that the staff of SETG (Strategic Equities Transactions Group) and managers, who were responsible for Prime Brokerage at the SEF-IM (Structured Equity Finance — Inventory Management) trading desk, discussed the reputational risk for Deutsche Bank from its provision of finance in January 2009 and came to the conclusion that this was acceptable,"" one of the Freshfields audits said.
""Group Tax confirmed in March 2009 the provision of leverage for cum-ex trades through Deutsche Bank.""
A Deutsche Bank spokesman said that Deutsche Bank was involved in some of its clients' cum-ex transactions and that it was fully cooperating with investigators.
Reuters has seen the Freshfields documents, as well as thousands of pages of bank files, correspondence and court documents relating to the cum-ex case. The documents were obtained as part of a European media investigation coordinated by non-profit newsroom Correctiv.
The audit dated April 16, 2015 pointed to ""significant failings"" in overseeing two traders, Simon Pearson and Joe Penna, who they say acted as middle men between the clients and the bank departments that lent money to fund the cum-ex scheme and issued tax certificates.
Pearson and Penna have been suspects in the investigation since at least 2014 for their role in cum-ex trading, according to court documents. The Freshfields audits say the two traders were aware the prime brokerage services were being used to help other companies carry out cum-ex deals.
The reports highlighted the role of the traders but also pointed to failures of the bank's internal controls as well as lapses of ""managers"" in the global financial markets division.
The April 16 report said that the bank’s controls over the trading desk headed by Pearson were too weak and this was a “serious shortcoming”.
That criticism about oversight is leveled at management generally but it does briefly single out one individual.
“Richard Carson was most directly responsible for this shortcoming as the direct supervisor of the manager of the trading desk,” the report said.
Carson has since left Deutsche Bank. In an email to Reuters he said: ""I have not seen, nor have been provided with any copies of the reports you mention in your communication. I would not accept that there was any failings on my part."" The report did not implicate him further in the cum-ex scheme.
Pearson did not respond to multiple emails sent to him at his new company in Gibraltar. Reuters also contacted his spokeswoman by email, who did not respond.
Penna did not respond to a letter requesting comment sent to his home in London. A person involved in the case gave Reuters the name of a lawyer he said represented Pearson and Penna. Reuters contacted the lawyer who would not confirm that he represented either, citing client confidentiality.
 
""EMPLOYEES KNEW""
According to one of the Freshfields reports dated Nov 28, 2013, Deutsche lent shares to Seriva, a client involved in cum-ex, via a chain of brokers in 2008.
Deutsche issued Seriva with 5.8 million euros of withholding tax certificates, allowing Seriva to make claims for tax rebates. Freshfields said in the report that staff at Deutsche and Seriva were aware that no withholding tax had been levied.
The tax certificates existed until 2017, when Deutsche Bank canceled them, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
""Seriva obtained withholding tax certificates from DB Frankfurt,"" the report said, adding later: ""Employees of DB London ... knew that no withholding taxes had been levied.""
Seriva's manager, who asked not to be named, said that the company had received no rebates because of the investigation by tax authorities. He declined to comment further.
Reuters also contacted Josef Schucker, a person named in the Freshfields audit as the sole investor in Seriva. Reuters received no response to two emails sent to his company.
The Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment on Seriva.
Deutsche also provided funding and acquired shares to help a company called Ballance carry out cum-ex deals multiple times between 2009 and 2011, the Freshfields documents say.
Ballance controlled several entities which have been disbanded or renamed, according to filings with the Britain's financial regulator, the Financial Services Authority, seen by Reuters. Reuters could not find any remaining parts of Ballance.
Pearson and Penna, the two Deutsche Bank traders, left to work for Ballance in 2009, when they became part owners, according to the Freshfields documents.
Deutsche made at least 18 million euros in interest and in the sale of financial products to Ballance, the Freshfields report said. The Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment.
The new details of the case come at a difficult time for Deutsche Bank as it tries to repair its public image and relations with Berlin after a series of fines relating to other trading scandals. The spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment.

Other global banks, including Santander (MC:SAN) and Macquarie, are also under investigation for their roles in cum-ex trading schemes. Contacted for this story, spokesmen for both banks said they are cooperating with investigators.

Tesla Isn’t America’s No. 1 Premium Carmaker,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. is giving  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and BMW AG a stiffer test in the U.S. luxury auto market. But despite what one might read in Elon Musk’s Twitter feed, it’s not yet the top dog.

256,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2019 06:35AM ET</span>",Former Barclays bosses face London trial over Qatari cash call,"By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - The most senior bankers to face criminal charges in Britain over conduct during the financial crisis will appear before a London jury next week in a trial that will test the mettle of the Serious Fraud Office.
Former  Barclays  (L:BARC) CEO John Varley and three one-time colleagues stand charged over deals with Qatari investors to secure cash injections that allowed the bank, that can trace its origins back to around 1690, to survive the crisis a decade ago. 
The trial, scheduled to start on Monday and slated to last for up to four months, is expected to begin with lengthy legal, procedural arguments before prosecutors open their case.
Varley, who married into one of the families that helped build Barclays, Roger Jenkins, the one-time chairman of the Middle Eastern banking arm, Tom Kalaris, an American former wealth division CEO and Richard Boath, a former European divisional head, are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud.
Varley, renowned for trademark bright braces and Jenkins, now based in California, also face a separate charge of unlawful financial assistance - a practice of companies lending money to fund the purchase of their own stock.
Lawyers for Boath and Kalaris declined to comment, while legal representatives for the other defendants did not respond to requests for comment.
When charges were filed in June 2017, a lawyer for Jenkins said his client would vigorously defend himself against the allegations. Boath said at the time he had no case to answer.
Barclays secured around 12 billion pounds ($15 billion) in emergency funds from mainly Gulf investors as markets plunged in 2008, allowing it to avoid the state bailouts taken by rivals Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) and Lloyds (L:LLOY). 
Qatar Holding - part of the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund - and Challenger, an investment vehicle of former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, invested about 6 billion pounds in the bank.
But the SFO, which prosecutes serious white collar crime, has charged the men over ""capital raising arrangements"" with Qatar Holding and Challenger in June and October 2008 and a $3 billion loan facility Barclays made available to Qatar in November 2008.
Qatar, a major investor in Britain, has not been accused of wrongdoing.
Lawyers say the performance of the SFO will be under as much scrutiny as that of the well-heeled defendants after a court threw out its separate charges against Barclays over the capital raising - and a judge last month halted its prosecution of former senior  Tesco  (L:TSCO) supermarket managers mid-trial.
Lisa Osofsky, who took the top job at the agency last August, has stood back from handling the Barclays case because of a potential conflict of interest linked to her previous work.

The new year has started briskly for the SFO. Its retrial of three former Barclays traders accused of plotting to rig Euribor global interest rates kicks off on Jan. 14. A jury was unable to reach a verdict in their case last year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - (The writer is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed are his own.)
How exactly does one get started on the road to saving the planet? We talked to a few environmental heroes about the jobs that got them started in life and activism.
Carter Roberts
President & CEO, World Wildlife Fund in the U.S.
First job: Dishwasher
It was in the kitchen of a French restaurant in Atlanta called Bernard’s. My job was washing dishes, surrounded by hot water on hot summer nights in Georgia. But I also had to do anything and everything needed to get the kitchen through the night, including cleaning out the grease traps, where months and months of grease had accumulated. Rodent control was also part of the job, and they weren’t the cute animated rats like the ones in the film ""Ratatouille.""
My job was the bottom of the heap, but by the end of the summer I had learned how to make dishes like Oysters Rockefeller and chocolate mousse from scratch. I was basically the assistant chef for those two dishes, which I prepared before the evening began and we all descended into hell.
What was great about that job is that it was a combination of the most humbling, backbreaking work, along with the most sublime high-end creative work. It was a combination of heaven and hell, and nobody had any idea what went on behind the swinging doors to the kitchen. At the end of every hot summer night, when the last customer had left, we broke out some beer from the freezer or had a little wine together. We had survived another day.
Mark Tercek
President & CEO, The Nature Conservancy
First job: Paperboy
That job had a big impact on my life. I delivered the Cleveland Plain Dealer, which came out every day, no exceptions. It had to be delivered by 6:30 am – that was the rule, because the local dads usually had factory jobs and they wanted to read the paper before they went to work.
I started at age 10, and back then paperboys had to purchase newspapers from the publisher at wholesale, and then sell them at retail. So I would buy them at seven cents, and sell them at 10 cents. If any customers didn’t pay - and sometimes they didn't - I would actually run a loss.
It taught me a lot about entrepreneurship. I had to show up and deliver every damn day. And the weather was rough: This was Cleveland in winter, it was freezing cold, and I would be out there at 5:30 am. At that time of day, there are some not-so-nice people out on the streets.
One happy outcome was that they actually had paperboy scholarships, and because of that I got into a top boarding school. From there I went on to Harvard, and then Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and eventually served as board chair of the school I had gone to as a boy. So delivering papers turned out to be an enormously pivotal time for me.
Rhea Suh
President, National Resources Defense Council
First job: Senator’s assistant
When I got back to Colorado after doing my Fulbright fellowship, I was really burned out. So I got a season ski pass, and waitressed and just wanted to hang out – much to my parents’ chagrin.
But eventually I got bored with myself, and I had always been interested in politics, so I decided to volunteer for somebody. I literally got out the Yellow Pages and started cold-calling elected representatives.
The third one down the list was Ben Nighthorse Campbell, whose staff liked the fact I had an environmental background. Two weeks later they offered me a job. Partway through his term he switched parties, so that was pretty eye-opening. I had to pick up all my stuff and just move to the other side of the political aisle.

That was during the Gingrich Revolution, so at the time it was the most partisan thing I had ever been through. But boy, does it pale compared to what we are going through now. The world has changed during my lifetime – and not for the better.

259,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2019 05:52AM ET</span>",Pioneering Southwest Airlines co-founder Herb Kelleher dies at 87,"(Reuters) - Herb Kelleher, who co-founded pioneering low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and built it into an industry powerhouse stamped with his colorful, unconventional personality, died on Thursday at age 87, the U.S. carrier said.
Kelleher set up Southwest with Rollin King more than 50 years ago, with the airline making its first flight in June 1971. King died in 2014, aged 83.
Dallas-based Southwest is known for its quirky culture, closely connected with Kelleher's maverick image, as well as its fast growth from a regional carrier into one of the biggest in the United States.
The airline flew short flights known as point-to-point, rather than the hub-and-spoke model of its bigger rivals, and used a single model of aircraft, Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737, to cut complexity and cost.
Kelleher was ""Grand Master Yoda of low fares airlines,"" the chief executive of Europe's largest low-cost carrier Ryanair said in a Twitter post on Friday. 
""He was the leader, the visionary and the teacher: without Herb there would be no Ryanair and no low fares airlines anywhere,"" said Michael O'Leary, who spearheaded the transformation of European air travel after a visit to Southwest in 1992.
Southwest's cabin crews have become known for their good humor – a legacy of Kelleher, memorialized in a ""laugh button"" that visitors could press inside the company’s headquarters to hear his famous cackle.
Kelleher won the affection of customers and employees with low fares, good wages and his own high spirits. He sought to instill a sense of fun among employees, sometimes showing up in costume or helping unload baggage.
""A company is stronger if it is bound by love rather than by fear,” he was once quoted as saying.
Kelleher was also known for his fondness for smoking and bourbon.
John Plueger, chief executive of Air Lease Corp, said on Thursday that when he first met Kelleher more than 30 years ago, Kelleher was about to deliver a speech at a New York hotel. ""The manager asked that he refrain from smoking. Herb looked up, smiled, and said: 'No smokey, No talkey.'”
Kelleher was a formidable industry competitor as well.
""There aren't a whole lot of individuals who you can point to that single-handedly contributed to building a demonstrable portion of the modern economy. Herb Kelleher was one,"" tweeted Jon Ostrower, an independent aviation commentator and editor of TheAirCurrent.com.
""His model spawned the global democratization of the affordable movement of humanity by air.""
'I LIKE TO WIN'
The New Jersey-born Kelleher served as Southwest's executive chairman for 30 years until 2008 and was chief executive from September 1981 to June 2001.
Kelleher was long a towering figure in the U.S. airline industry along with Bob Crandall, his rival at American Airlines and polar opposite in style. The two built different business models and competed fiercely but with mutual respect.
""It was very hot competition and I like to win,"" Kelleher told NPR in a 2016 podcast. Crandall, captured in a YouTube video, once serenaded Kelleher with a version of ""My Way,"" the song popularized by Frank Sinatra.
Steven Udvar-Hazy, executive chairman of Air Lease and a pioneer of the aircraft leasing industry, whose expansion coincided with the rise of budget carriers, paid tribute to Kelleher as “the builder of the world’s most successful low fare airline.”""Herb: a final Wild Turkey Bourbon toast from all of your closest friends,"" he added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Ousted Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) chairman Carlos Ghosn is set to make his first public appearance in seven weeks at a Tokyo court on Tuesday after he requested an open hearing to hear the reason for his continued detention.
Ghosn has been held in a detention center since his Nov. 19 arrest on allegations of financial misconduct, which was followed by re-arrests over further allegations.
The hearing will take place at 10:30 local time (0130 GMT) on Jan. 8, the Tokyo District Court said on Friday. The reason behind the timing of Ghosn's request was not clear.
Earlier this week, the court approved an extension to Ghosn's detention until Jan. 11, after re-arrest by prosecutors who accuse him of aggravated breach of trust in transferring personal investment losses to Nissan.
Those allegations center on the use of company funds to pay a Saudi businessman who is believed to have helped him out of financial difficulties, sources said last week.
Ghosn has already been indicted for under-reporting his income. He has denied the allegations, local media has said.
Former Nissan executive Greg Kelly, who has been charged with conspiring to under-report Ghosn's income, has been released on bail after the court ruled against extending his detention while he awaits trial.
Ghosn's arrest was followed by his removal from roles at Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211). The case has rocked the auto industry and strained Nissan's ties with French partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) where he still remains chairman and chief executive.

The arrest has also put some of the practices of Japan's criminal justice system under international scrutiny, including keeping suspects in detention for long periods and prohibiting defense lawyers from being present during interrogations.

The widening pay gap comes despite pressure from leading investors for excessive pay to be reined in and after several high-profile revolts at company annual meetings in 2018, most notably at  Persimmon  (L:PSN).
Median pay for a FTSE 100 (FTSE) CEO in 2017, the most recently disclosed data, was 3.9 million pounds ($4.9 million), the report said, up 11 percent from the previous year. Average full-time worker pay in 2018 was 29,574 pounds a year, it added.
""Excessive executive pay represents a massive corporate governance failure and is a barrier to a fairer economy,"" said Luke Hildyard, director of the High Pay Centre, a independent think-tank.
Many companies say high executive pay levels are needed to recruit and retain the best talent to oversee corporate strategy and drive shareholder returns through higher share prices, to which bonuses are linked.
Dubbing the day when CEO pay passes that of the average worker as ""Fat Cat Friday"" was unhelpful, said the Institute of Directors, which represents company executives.
""Determining executive pay requires sober and objective analysis. It should pay heed to public concerns but not be driven by populism,"" said IoD Head of Corporate Governance Roger Barker.

Asian shares were mixed and the yen slipped after Thursday’s shock surge.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced, shaking off two days of losses as miners led gains. Concern over China-U.S. trade tensions that have helped whipsaw stocks this week eased as vice ministers from the two countries prepare to hold talks starting Monday. Efforts to end a partial government shutdown in America also helped send S&P 500 Index futures higher on the heels of yesterday’s 2.5 percent plunge, the gauge’s steepest sell-off since Christmas Eve.
The yen, seen as a haven trade, slipped after wild moves on Thursday. Chinese shares rallied, while stocks in Japan were deep in the red as traders returned from an extended New Year’s break. Treasuries dipped, and the dollar was steady.
Optimism for a resolution to the U.S. government shutdown and over trade talks could ease two of the major overhangs that have dogged equities in recent days. Following poor data from China and Europe, the miserable market performance from last month has continued into the new year, with big swings and flights to safety. The talks will be the first face-to-face negotiation between the two countries since President Donald Trump and his counterpart Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day truce in their trade war last month.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if we get better communication on trade,” said Stefan Hofer, chief investment strategist at LGT Bank. Still, “we have beginning-of-the-year jitters, low levels of liquidity and exaggerated swings, which feed people’s worst fears -- which I simply can’t sign up to at the moment.”
Elsewhere, oil built on recent gains, heading for its biggest weekly advance since June as traders weighed signs that OPEC is following through on production cuts against hints of an economic slowdown.

Delta Beverages announced on Wednesday that it would only take payments in U.S. currency and would no longer accept electronic dollars known as ""Zollars"" or a quasi-currency known as ""bond notes"", amid a severe shortage of hard currency in Zimbabwe.
However, the country's commerce minister said on Thursday that the government opposed the plan and Delta, 40 percent owned by Anheuser-Busch Inbev, backtracked following a meeting with senior politicians and reserve bank officials.
""Delta withdraws the notice to sell its products exclusively in hard currency, in the spirit of the multi-currency framework,"" Delta and Zimbabwe's reserve bank said in a joint statement late on Thursday.
The reserve bank said it would endeavour to provide the foreign currency required to ensure that Delta continues to trade ""on the current basis"".
Zimbabwe's currency crisis is undermining President Emmerson Mnangagwa's efforts to win back foreign investors who were sidelined under his predecessor Robert Mugabe.
Zimbabwe abandoned its currency in 2009, adopting the U.S. dollar in an effort to tame hyperinflation, but a severe shortage of physical notes has seen dollars in bank accounts lose value compared with cash.
In an effort to ease a worsening cash crunch, Zimbabwe began issuing 'bond notes' in late-2016. The quasi-currency was supposed to trade in parity with the U.S. dollar but it wasn't long before it devalued sharply on the street.
As inflation shot up, the reserve bank in October ordered banks to separate dollars and the electronic ""Zollars' in customer accounts, effectively recognizing the country has two currencies.
That spooked investors and Zimbabweans panicked amid acute shortages of fuel and basic goods, piling pressure on Mnangagwa as he attempts to rebrand Zimbabwe after decades of international isolation under Mugabe.

264,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2019 02:45AM ET</span>",Foreigners pull most cash from Asian equities in at least 7 years in 2018,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra
(Reuters) - Foreign outflows from Asian equities were the biggest in at least 7 years in 2018 as the Sino-U.S. trade war and slowing profits battered regional stocks last year.
Data from South Korea, Taiwan, India, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnamese stock exchanges showed foreigners sold a net $33.6 billion worth of equities last year, which was the biggest since at least 2012.
""2018 had been of little doubt a turbulent year, underscored by worries over US-China trade relations and growth among others,"" said Jingyi Pan, a Singapore-based market strategist at trading and investments provider IG.
Taiwan led regional equities outflows with net sales of $11.7 billion last year, followed by Thailand and South Korea which saw outflows of $8.9 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively.
Net foreign flows turned negative for the first time in three years in 2018. 
In a tit-for-tat trade war, the United States and China imposed tariffs on each other's imports last year, which triggered concerns about the region's growth outlook and pulled down Asia's major stock indexes. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fell 16 percent in 2018, its sharpest drop since 2011. Chinese shares (SSEC) were the biggest losers in the region, shedding about 29 percent in dollar terms.
Regional economic growth is expected to cool further in 2019 amid softening domestic and export demand, but much will depend on how long it will take China to stabilize its cooling economy and whether Washington and Beijing can end their trade war. 
In China, the Caixin/IHS Markit PMI slipped into contraction territory in December for the first time in 19 months.
But the sharp selloff in Asian equities last year has made them cheaper in terms of price valuations and could lure investors back, some analysts said. 
""Asian equities are expected to see better interests into 2019 from the improved attractiveness from a valuations perspective and outlook. This is particularly with the Fed hike pace easing and the greenback paring in strength expected."" said IG's Pan. 
The forward price-to-earning ratio of MSCI Asia ex-Japan index was 11.5 at the end of 2018, lesser than its 10-year average of 12.4.
Niall MacLeod, a strategist at UBS Equities, said in a note that Asian equities have already discounted a lot of the slowdown that he expects.
""In the short-term term, trade uncertainty is likely to contain the upside. As the year gathers steam we think that Chinese policy moves from headwind to tailwind, the tariff impact wanes, Asian growth troughs and sequentially improves from Q2,"" said MacLeod.

""Against this backdrop, we think equities will re-rate.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Hong Kong insurance provider is to stop offering cover against the possibility of HNA-controled Hong Kong Airlines folding, according to a notice issued by the insurer to its agents and seen by Reuters.
Blue Cross Asia-Pacific Insurance Ltd, owned by Bank of East Asia (HK:0023), said in the notice that it would stop the provision for customers as of Monday. 
The note, first reported by the South China Morning Post, said the benefit item of ""Special Allowance - Winding-up of Airline"" would not apply to single-trip travel insurance plans issued on or after Jan. 7 for travelers on Hong Kong Airlines.
It said the move was taken in light of ""news of Hong Kong Airlines published by media recently"".
Hong Kong Airlines said in a statement it did not have a business relationship with Blue Cross.
""We are operating as normal and remain committed to offering our best service to customers,"" the airline said. ""We are here to stay and remain committed to sustaining our long-term growth.""
A Beijing-based spokeswoman for HNA declined to comment.
Blue Cross said in a statement to Reuters the decision was ""solely made based on commercial considerations"".
Several Hong Kong insurers offer payouts in the event of an airline collapse although the cover is not as common worldwide.
Under Blue Cross's online travel insurance offer, policy holders can claim up to HK$2,000 ($255) if they have paid for a ticket on an airline which publicly announces it is winding up prior to the journey.
Hong Kong Airlines reassured customers of its financial soundness last month after a series of high-level executive departures had sparked speculation it was struggling. 
The low-cost airline, which operates 38 aircraft to almost 40 destinations in Asia and North America, is part of Hainan Airlines (SS:600221), China's fourth-largest carrier and part of cash-crunched Chinese conglomerate HNA Group [HNAIRC.UL], which is in the process of selling a series of assets acquired during a $50 billion global deal spree. 
The group, whose assets still include the largest single stake in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), began its streamlining in 2017 after Beijing cracked down on aggressive overseas deal-making. 
HNA's sale process is now being overseen by China Development Bank, one of its largest creditors, Reuters reported last month.
In December, financing from CDB was instrumental in Airbus resuming stalled delivery of planes to HNA-affiliated airlines.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] has punished two employees for New Year greetings sent on the smartphone maker's official Twitter account using an iPhone, an internal memo showed.
Huawei, whose P-series handsets compete with Apple's iPhone, on New Year's Day wished followers a ""Happy #2019"" in a tweet marked sent ""via Twitter for iPhone"".
The tweet was quickly removed but screenshots of the blunder spread across social media.
""The traitor has revealed himself,"" quipped one user on microblog Weibo, in a comment 'liked' over 600 times.
(Click here for an interactive graphic of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) vs Huawei https://tmsnrt.rs/2GPPIRI)
In an internal Huawei memo dated Jan. 3 seen by Reuters, corporate senior vice-president and director of the board Chen Lifang said, ""the incident caused damage to the Huawei brand"".
The mistake occurred when outsourced social media handler Sapient experienced ""VPN problems"" with a desktop computer so used an iPhone with a roaming SIM card in order to send the message on time at midnight, Huawei said in the memo.
Twitter, like several foreign services such as those from  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, is blocked in China, where the Internet is heavily censored. To gain access, users need a virtual private network (VPN) connection.
Huawei, which overtook Apple as the world's second-largest smartphone vendor by volume in January-September, declined to comment on internal issues when contacted by Reuters.
Sapient did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent via the contact form on its website. Calls to its Beijing office went unanswered.
Huawei in the memo said the blunder showed procedural incompliance and management oversight. It said it had demoted two employees responsible by one rank and reduced their monthly salaries by 5,000 yuan ($728.27).

272,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 09:45PM ET</span>",U.S. judge limits evidence in trial over Roundup cancer claims,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - A federal judge overseeing lawsuits alleging Bayer (DE:BAYGN) AG's glyphosate-based weed killer causes cancer has issued a ruling that could severely restrict evidence that the plaintiffs consider crucial to their cases.
U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco in an order on Thursday granted Bayer unit Monsanto's request to split an upcoming trial into two phases. The order initially bars lawyers for plaintiff Edwin Hardeman from introducing evidence that the company allegedly attempted to influence regulators and manipulate public opinion.
Thursday's order applies to Hardeman's case, which is scheduled to go to trial on Feb. 25, and two other so-called bellwether trials which will help determine the range of damages and define settlement options for the rest of the 620 Roundup cases before Chhabria. 
But Hardeman's lawyers contended that such evidence, including internal  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) documents, showed the company's misconduct and were critical to California state court jury's August 2018 decision to award $289 million in a similar case. The verdict sent Bayer shares tumbling though the award was later reduced to $78 million and is under appeal.
Under Chhabria's order, evidence of Monsanto's alleged misconduct would be allowed only if glyphosate was found to have caused Hardeman's cancer and the trial proceeded to a second phase to determine Bayer's liability.
Bayer denies allegations that glyphosate causes cancer, saying decades of independent studies have shown the world's most widely used weed killer to be safe for human use.
But the company faces more than 9,300 U.S. lawsuits over Roundup's safety in state and federal courts across the country.
Bayer in a statement welcomed Chhabria's decision.
""The court's decision to keep the focus of the trial on the extensive science relevant to human health is encouraging,"" the company said.
Aimee Wagstaff, one of Hardeman's lawyers, in a statement said she was confident the jurors will find Roundup caused the man's cancer and proceed to the second phase.
Hardeman's attorneys had opposed proposals to split up the trial on the grounds that their scientific evidence allegedly showing glyphosate causes cancer was inextricably linked to Monsanto's alleged wrongful conduct.
Bayer has also asked that some of the plaintiffs' evidence on causation, specifically a finding by the World Health Organization's cancer unit that glyphosate is ""probably carcinogenic,"" be excluded in the first phase because it has no basis in science. 
Chhabria, who has previously expressed skepticism of that finding, on Thursday said he would soon decide to which degree he would allow it to be introduced at trial.
The assessment is central to the plaintiffs' claims, as other regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, have determined glyphosate likely does not cause cancer.

275,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 07:29PM ET</span>",Bristol-Myers to buy Celgene for $74 billion in largest biopharma deal,"By Michael Erman and Ankur Banerjee
(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (N:BMY) said on Thursday it would buy  Celgene Corp  (O:CELG) for about $74 billion, combining two of the world's largest cancer drug businesses in the biggest pharmaceutical deal ever.
Both Bristol-Myers and Celgene face separate challenges, and some Wall Street analysts questioned whether the combination - which the companies said would create $2.5 billion in cost savings and significantly raise earnings - would solve them. Amid clinical setbacks and other missteps, Bristol-Myers shares fell 15.2 percent in 2018 while Celgene plunged nearly 40 percent last year. 
Bristol's most important cancer immunotherapy and growth driver, Opdivo, has lost much of its luster as Merck & Co's (N:MRK) rival drug Keytruda seized dominance in advanced lung cancer, the most lucrative oncology market. Meanwhile, Celgene has endured high-profile clinical failures and U.S. exclusivity on its flagship multiple myeloma drug, Revlimid, will start being phased out in 2022.
On Thursday, Bristol's stock ended another 13.3 percent lower at $45.12. ""Doing this transaction clearly indicates that risk to Opdivo in lung cancer is obviously a concern,"" SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris said in an interview.
There is also shareholder concern that drugs in development would not have enough sales to offset major products losing exclusivity between 2022 and 2026.
But cash flow from Revlimid buys Bristol-Myers time to pay down debt and position for another transaction, Boris said. Revlimid is expected to record nearly $10 billion in 2018 sales.
Celgene shares were up 20.7 percent at $89.43.
""Both of them were coming into this year kind of limping,"" said Brad Loncar, who runs the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF. The deal makes ""the combined entity a lot stronger,"" he added.
Including debt, the deal is worth $95 billion, eclipsing Pfizer's $89 billion purchase of Warner-Lambert in 2000, according to Refinitiv. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2RsZ4XS)
Some analysts, including Baird Equity's Brian Skorney, said it raised the possibility of a new era of big drug deals, much like in 2009, when  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE), Merck, and Roche Holding AG (S:ROG) all pulled off transformational acquisitions. The news pushed up shares of rivals  Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD), Allergan Plc (N:AGN), Biogen Inc (O:BIIB) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:REGN).
Bristol expects to achieve the $2.5 billion in cost savings by 2022, with 55 percent coming from cuts in sales, general and administrative expenses, 35 percent through reduction in research & development spending and 10 percent from manufacturing. It said the deal will add more than 40 percent to its earnings in the first year after the deal closes, expected in the third quarter of 2019.
Under terms of the deal, Celgene shareholders will receive one Bristol-Myers Squibb share and $50 in cash for each share held, or $102.43 per share, a premium of 53.7 percent to Celgene's Wednesday close.
Celgene shareholders will also receive a so-called CVR payment, or contingent value right, of $9 if three treatments in development achieve timely approvals. Those are the high-profile multiple sclerosis drug ozanimod, lymphoma treatment liso-cel by Dec. 31, 2020 and a CAR-T therapy for multiple myeloma known as bb2121 from a partnership with bluebird bio (O:BLUE) by March 31, 2021.
BLOOD CANCER DOMINANCE
""What's important to us is the sustainability of Celgene's leadership position in hematology through their pipeline"" even after Revlimid loses patent protection, Bristol-Myers Chief Executive Giovanni Caforio said in an interview. His company's strength has primarily been in solid tumor cancers.
The New York-based drugmaker said it expects six product launches over the next two years - five coming from Celgene's pipeline. It also highlighted promising early clinical assets it would gain with the New Jersey-based biotech.
Celgene brings experience with potentially revolutionary CAR-T therapies from its $9 billion purchase of Juno Therapeutics and the bluebird collaboration. The therapy takes immune cells from a patient, engineers them to better recognize and attack cancer and returns them to the patient.
The deal could also provide a graceful exit for Celgene CEO Mark Alles, who has only committed to staying through the transition. His rocky tenure included management shakeups and the loss of more than half its market value since October 2017 as an expensive experimental Crohn’s disease drug touted as a future multibillion-dollar product failed and the expected approval of ozanimod was delayed.
Alles, on a conference call, urged shareholders to support the deal.
Jeremy Bryan, portfolio manager at Gradient Investments, which has small positions in both companies, said the Celgene purchase puts Bristol-Myers ""on the clock"" to do more deals.
""When you have a significant amount of cash coming in in the next three years, it gives you the flexibility ... for deals if they are out there or to buy back significant amounts of stock,"" Bryan said.
Talks between Bristol and Celgene opened in September, with Bristol approaching Celgene, according to two sources familiar with the matter. 
Bristol has obtained fully committed debt financing from  Morgan Stanley  Senior Funding Inc and MUFG Bank Ltd. 
Morgan Stanley & Co (NYSE:MS). LLC is the lead financial adviser to Bristol-Myers, and Evercore and Dyal Co LLC are its financial advisers. Kirkland & Ellis LLP is its legal counsel. 

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is serving as lead financial adviser and Citi is the financial adviser to Celgene. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is its legal counsel.

276,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 06:56PM ET</span>",Detroit Three ready for 2019 rumble over lucrative pickup trucks,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - The battle for profits from sales of large pickup trucks is intensifying among the Detroit Three automakers as sales of small cars in the United States shrivel.
For decades  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) has had the single best-selling truck brand in its F-Series trucks. General Motors Co's (N:GM) Chevrolet brand was a solid No. 2, and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV's (MI:FCHA) Ram brand was a distant third. 
Now, that hierarchy may be in flux. Sales figures for December and the fourth quarter released on Thursday show FCA's Ram brand tied with GM's Chevy brand for the No. 2 spot during the fourth quarter, as sales of the redesigned Ram pickup surged, fueled in part by demand for an optional 12-inch (30.48 cm) dashboard screen. 
Chevy not long ago held second place to Ford by a wide margin. GM executives said on Thursday they are bullish on their new GMC and Chevy trucks for 2019. 
""There's no doubt this segment (pickup trucks) is one of the epicenters of the auto wars,"" said Sandor Piszar, director of marketing for Chevrolet at GM. ""It's been that way forever and we wouldn't have it any other way.""
On Wall Street, investors give electric car leader Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) a higher valuation than any of the Detroit automakers. But in the nation's heartland, big pickups remain far more popular and profitable than any electric car - and most other consumer vehicles of any kind.
Large pickups generate at least $17,000 a vehicle in pretax profit for GM, the company has indicated in disclosures to investors. By contrast, many Detroit Three sedans are so unprofitable, their manufacturers have decided not to build them anymore.
DISCIPLINED APPROACH 
Sustaining sales and pricing in the large-pickup segment will be critical in a year when most forecasters expect overall U.S. car and light truck sales to fall.
Ford's U.S. sales chief, Mark LaNeve, on Thursday called the F Series ""the backbone of our franchise,"" during a conference call, and added the ""segment will continue to be strong, but hotly contested"" in 2019.
Automakers are banking on pickup truck sales to stay strong even if U.S. interest rates continue to rise. Rising interest rates translate into higher monthly car payments and are expected to deter some buyers in 2019.
GM has said 27 percent of Chevrolet and GMC trucks - which can haul trailers by day and substitute for a luxury sedan by night - sell for more than $55,000.
The new Silverado was engineered with a focus on slashing weight and trimming production costs to compete with market leader Ford. However, the truck has received unflattering reviews for its utilitarian interior. 
GM's Piszar brushed aside the critics. ""We're not concerned at all,"" he said. ""As people see this new truck they're blown away."" 
He said the automaker has adopted a ""very disciplined, very gradual"" approach to ramping up production of its new truck. All versions of the new Silverado will be in dealerships in January and sales moving forward will reflect that reality, he said.
RAM ON THE RISE 
The transformation of large pickups from work vehicles to substitutes for luxury sedans is most evident in the new Ram. FCA designers stuffed the new Ram 1500 with features including a 12-inch touch screen, betting customers would pay more for a fully loaded truck. 
""These are all the things that customers who are paying that kind of money have come to expect,"" said Jim Morrison, head of the Ram brand for North America. ""It's amazing to be able to have your cake and eat it too."" 
FCA Chief Executive Mike Manley told Reuters that with the new Ram trucks and additional production capacity, the brand should be the No. 2 seller in the segment. 
In the fourth quarter, FCA's Ram brand tied the Silverado at around 161,000 trucks. For all of 2017, FCA sold 500,000 Ram pickups to the Silverado's 585,000. 
WHO IS REALLY NO. 1? 
The Detroit automakers on Thursday renewed their jostling over which among them is really the leader in truck sales. 
Ford claims its F-Series is the market leader, with 909,330 trucks sold in 2018, an increase of 1.4 percent over 2017. 
But collectively across its Chevrolet and GMC brands -including smaller, midsize trucks like the Chevrolet Colorado - GM sold more pickups in 2018 with 973,469 vehicles sold, an increase of 2.6 percent over 2017.
Ford will start selling its midsize Ranger pickup truck this month to compete with the Colorado.
Overall, the Detroit Three sold 620,206 full-size pickups in the fourth quarter of 2018. Ford had 37.1 percent share of that total, GM had 36.8 percent and FCA had 26 percent. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Detroit Three sold 594,691 full-size pickups during the fourth quarter. Ford accounted for 40 percent of that total, GM had 38.8 percent and FCA 21.2 percent.

FCA was the only one of the three that reported an increase in full-size pickup sales in the fourth quarter.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors pulled $98 billion from U.S.-based stock funds in December, a calendar-month record that emphasizes the diminishing goodwill in financial markets, preliminary Lipper estimates showed on Thursday.
Fund investors trimmed their risk in the final days of 2018 to hunker down in case the Federal Reserve is too aggressively tightening monetary policy ahead of an economic slowdown and as the United States and China spar over trade. Some people see recent equity declines as a buying opportunity and are stockpiling cash to take advantage should prices fall further. The S&P 500 fell 9 percent last month.
""I used to feel comfortable saying we're not headed toward an economic recession or an earnings recession - that means we're in a correction, not a bear market,"" said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany, New York. ""It's getting harder and harder to do that, and with the Apple news today it's getting even harder.""
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) warned on Wednesday about weak iPhone demand in the holiday quarter due to slower sales in China, foreshadowing similar problems for other companies in the coming earnings season. The widely owned company's shares fell nearly 10 percent on Thursday.
December's withdrawals easily top the prior record, when investors yanked $48.8 billion from U.S. stock funds as Congress and then-President George W. Bush tried to stop banks failing in October 2008. 
Yet, while elevated, the monthly withdrawals amount to about 0.8 percent of the nearly $12 trillion of U.S.-based stock mutual fund and exchange-traded fund (ETF) assets tracked by Lipper, a research service. That data may be revised in coming days as more fund companies report their results.
During the most recent week, ended Jan. 2, investors pulled $18.7 billion from stocks and $13.3 billion from bonds, according to Lipper. Money market funds, where investors park cash, attracted $6.1 billion for the week and $122 billion in December, the preliminary numbers showed.

In a break with most recent weeks, both mutual funds and ETFs sold stocks at the same time during the latest seven-day period. ETFs, used heavily by institutional investors, had bought a net $9 billion in stocks in December. Mutual fund investors have sold stocks for the last 28 weeks.

279,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 04:45PM ET</span>",Activist U.S. hedge funds hurt by late-year stock tumble,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Widely followed activist investors Daniel Loeb, Barry Rosenstein and William Ackman suffered heavy losses in December, when fears about trade battles and slower growth sent stocks spiraling lower.
Many fund managers are still compiling annual returns, but early data from some of the industry's most prominent firms shows how December's stock market tumble erased gains at many funds. At others, the fall expanded small losses into bigger ones.
Early data from Hedge Fund Research shows that the average hedge fund lost 6.7 percent last year, slightly more the S&P 500's 6.2 percent loss. Data for activists' funds full-year returns have not been finalized.
Loeb's Third Point, fresh from settling for board seats at Campbell Soup Co, told investors its Third Point Partners fund closed 2018 with a 10.7 percent loss after sinking 6.2 percent in December. The Third Point Ultra fund lost 7.8 percent in December to end 2018 down 14.7 percent.
Rosenstein's Jana Partners Fund ended 2018 with an 8.1 percent loss after falling 10 percent in December, according to an investor update. Another portfolio, which tracks only the firm's activist positions, was up roughly 20 percent in 2016 and 2017, an investor said, but its 2018 return could not be obtained. 
David Einhorn, an occasional activist, put up some of the industry's worst numbers, nursing a 9 percent loss in December and a 34.1 percent drop for the year. Several investors said they have now pulled their money out, prompting some speculation about his future.
Several prominent hedge funds closed down last year and investors said more closures are expected.
December's stock market rout also hurt William Ackman's Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management. But the manager, who vowed to make 2018 his comeback year, finished with a small gain in one fund and roughly flat in another. 
Pershing Square Holdings fund lost 10.8 percent in December and ended 2018 off 0.7 percent. Pershing Square International ended the year up 1.8 percent, an investor said. The firm's capital, however, shrank to $6.8 billion at the end of December from $8 billion at mid-year.
Early in 2018, Ackman cut his staff and promised to shun the limelight as he sought to reverse his returns after three years of losses. For much of the year, Pershing Square was up double digits thanks to gains at investments ranging from Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) to Automatic Data Processing. Ackman announced new bets on Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings late in the year.
To be sure, there were some activist funds, mostly smaller ones, that performed well. Sahm Adrangi's Kerrisdale Capital ended the year up more than 37 percent, an investor said, and J. Daniel Plants' Voce Capital gained 6 percent.

There were wins among other hedge funds, too. Renaissance Technologies LLC's Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund gained 8.5 percent in 2018 while Brahman Capital Corp. posted a 2.4 percent gain, investors said.

283,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 04:10PM ET</span>","YOUR MONEY: The IRS might be closed, but your taxes are still due","By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Internal Revenue Services is closed, thanks to the government shutdown, but your taxes are still due on April 15 and that is why individuals need to proceed through tax season as if nothing is amiss, experts say. 
The opening day of e-filing traditionally occurs during the third week in January. This year, however, there is still a lot of unfinished business because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
One of the most complex changes in the legislation is how to calculate income for self-employed individuals or those with partnerships. Filers need to figure out something called qualified business income and run an algorithm for a new 20 percent deduction on this income, which has a lot of phase-outs and special qualifications. 
It is ""way more complicated than first blush would make it seem,"" said tax preparer David Tolleth in Holmdel, New Jersey. 
When Tolleth looks at 2018 forms in his professional software, they are all still marked draft, including the main 1040 form. In prior years plagued by filing delays, Tolleth prepared returns and then sent them once the system was online. 
""I’m hoping that will happen this year, but I don’t know,"" he said. 
Jake Johnstun, an enrolled agent tax preparer from Ogden, Utah, is not trusting his tax software, especially when it comes to qualified business income. Instead, he built spreadsheets with different variables and has been running numbers for a month and a half. 
Johnstun is supposed to tape a panel discussion with three IRS officials in less than two weeks to explain the changes to tax professionals. But his slated experts are currently furloughed. 
BUSY SIGNALS
Tax accountants say they get busy signals when they try to fax the Internal Revenue Service. Major software companies, meanwhile, are mostly just pinging electronic servers as they test their 2018 software updates. The IRS is not answering questions from professionals or from individuals, other than what is already publicly available on its website. 
Nevertheless, most tax professionals are not worried. Even though tax preparation firm Jackson Hewitt Tax Service is not on its usual schedule of speaking with the IRS daily, chief tax officer Mark Steber does not expect chaos. 
""They planned for this. They had contingency plans. It's not their first rodeo,"" Steber said.
TurboTax, the tax software service, said it is fully up to date and ready for taxpayers to start working on their returns as of Jan. 4. 
""TurboTax will securely store completed returns for transmission to the IRS and States once they begin accepting e-file,"" the company said in a statement. 
If that e-filing day is delayed, some early filers may start to worry about their refunds. The IRS will accept tax payments during a shutdown and will charge penalties and fees on money past due, but it will not dole out refunds until everything is back up and running. 
Any significant delay may back up refunds even more, which is why tax preparers say individuals should stay on track and prepare their tax materials for filing by April 15. 
Some tax preparation services, like Jackson Hewitt and H&R Block (NYSE:HRB), offer refund advance loans. But customers need to read the fine print and be sure to look at all fees and interest payments. Also consider the standard personal finance advice that advance loans are a last-resort option. 
Filers may also find that they are not due the kind of refund they received in the past, because their withholding throughout the year changed when the new tax laws took effect. 
Most companies updated their payroll calculations, and employees might not have even noticed the difference. In a recent survey by H&R Block, 47 percent of people did not even know they could change their W-4 form at any time. 
""You can’t really compare this year to last year,"" said Lynn Ebel, director of the Tax Institute at H&R Block. ""People need to be careful with expectations. This year is going to be different.""

The Dow lost 2.8%, more than 650 points, while the S&P 500 index fell 2.5%. The Nasdaq Composite ended down 3%.
Trading kicked off in the red after Dow component Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) warned on the revenue for its latest quarter, blaming weak China sales in particular.
Selling accelerated shortly after the bell when the Institute of Supply Management said its manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell to 54.1 in December from 59.3 the previous month.
And sentiment got weaker when White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett told CNN that a “heck of a lot” of U.S. companies would be cutting guidance like Apple until a trade deal between the U.S. and China countries was struck.
""We are seeing markets extrapolate Apple's news throughout several sectors and equate it to a deceleration in the global economy,"" said Christopher Anselmo, director at Nasdaq IR Intelligence.
""A lot of data in the past few days, including U.S. factory activity is pointing to a global economic slowdown. The data is just giving a magnitude of how broad this slowdown is and which regions it is affecting the most.""
Money moved out of stocks and into bonds, pushing the 10-Year Treasury yield sharply lower to 2.557%.
Meanwhile, the chances of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut this year jumped sharply. Tomorrow, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is set to speak shortly after the opening bell.
And today’s selloff will bring even more attention to Friday’s payrolls report, if that’s possible.
Among individual stocks, Apple fell 10%, while its suppliers also tumbled, with Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) falling 10.7%, Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) losing 8.5% and Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) down 9%.
The other FAANG stocks also closed down, with the exception of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which managed a gain of 1.3%.
And the concerns about global tech demand meant that the volatile chip stocks took it on the chin, with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) falling 9.5%, Micron (NASDAQ:MU) off 5.3% and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) losing 6%.
Elsewhere, the airlines struggled after Delta issued softer-than-expected unit revenue guidance. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) lost 9%, United Continental (NASDAQ:UAL) fell 5% and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) sank 7.5%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. bank regulator said on Thursday she had no concerns that volatility in the equities and futures markets posed a threat to the banking system, telling Reuters the country's lenders have plenty of capital to weather further market swings.
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Chairman Jelena McWilliams also told Reuters that banking regulators had begun a review of the so-called CAMELS rating system used to assess the health of the nation's banks.
""Frankly, recent market movements have not given us any reason to be concerned,"" she said in an interview. ""Banks are well capitalized. Actually, they are superbly well capitalized at this point in time.
""Nothing that happened in December gave us concern.""
U.S. stocks posted a loss in 2018 for the first time in a decade, amid fears over a weakening global economy and a trade war between the United States and China, sparking fears the turmoil could spread to other parts of the financial system.
Those jitters have continued into the new year, with stocks falling roughly 2 percent on Thursday following weak manufacturing data and a surprise revenue warning from Apple Inc. (O:AAPL).
McWilliams' comments mark the latest vote of confidence from bank regulators after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said on Wednesday banks are well positioned to navigate a market downturn.
McWilliams, who took office in June and was appointed by President Donald Trump to review post-crisis rules, has said some new rules can be tailored to help small banks.
On Thursday, she told Reuters regulators have begun a review of the system used to rate the financial health of banks.
She said the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, an interagency group comprising the country's bank regulators, was reviewing whether agencies are applying the CAMELS rating consistently.
McWilliams said she was worried that any differences could encourage banks to seek out less rigorous regulators.
""You don't want to have any sort of forum shopping,"" she said. ""You want to ensure the banks know that they're going to get the same shot"" regardless of the regulator. 
Regulators use CAMELS ratings as a measure of capital adequacy, asset quality, management capability, earnings, liquidity and risk sensitivity. The ratings are of critical important to bank management, as poor scores can lead to additional regulatory restrictions. But industry groups have complained the confidential scoring system can be opaque and is in need of an update.

If the interagency group finds inconsistencies in how ratings are applied, the regulators could seek public input on overhauling the process, McWilliams added.

291,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 01:32PM ET</span>","UAW sues GM over temporary workers, escalating fight over job cuts","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers said on Thursday it was suing General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) over labor contract violations stemming from its alleged use of temporary workers at an Indiana assembly plant, escalating the union's fight against GM's plans to possibly close U.S. factories.
The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Ohio, was the union's first counter-move to GM's decision in late November to put five North American factories on notice for closure. The decision, which affects four U.S. plants including one in Warren, Ohio, drew the condemnation of U.S. President Donald Trump and members of Congress. 
The UAW, which will negotiate a new national labor deal with GM this year, has vowed to fight the cuts. The current labor contract was reached in 2015 and expires in September.
The union said there are about 1,000 laid-off hourly employees that have the right to transfer to plants with openings, including almost 700 at the Lordstown plant in Ohio. GM is employing temporary workers at its Fort Wayne Assembly plant rather than transferring workers, the UAW said.
""UAW members negotiated a binding agreement and we expect General Motors to follow the contract they agreed to and GM members ratified,"" UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said in a statement.
In December, the UAW sent a letter to GM formally objecting to the decision to end production in 2019 at four U.S. plants, saying it violates commitments made during the contract talks in 2015. ""We will use all of our resources to enforce our agreements,"" the union said in the letter.
GM said in a statement that it started the process to bring about 50 workers from the Lordstown plant to Indiana late last year and has ongoing talks with the union regarding staffing needs in Fort Wayne. It declined to comment directly on the lawsuit, however.
The No. 1 U.S. automaker has said the fate of the plants that have no future product allocated will be decided in talks with the UAW.
The union said in the lawsuit that on May 31, 2018, it approved GM's request to use temporary workers at the Indiana plant through the end of August 2018 to support the launch of new full-size pickup trucks. 
GM sought to extend that period, and while the UAW agreed it had also pushed for the laid off pool of workers to eventually be hired to fill those openings, the lawsuit said. 
GM ultimately lost the union's permission to use the temporary workers beyond the end of November, according to the lawsuit.

The UAW said many of the 690 Lordstown workers on layoff had applied to transfer to the openings at Fort Wayne. It is asking the court to make any affected workers whole through back wages lost, benefits, relocation costs and seniority credit.

292,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 01:28PM ET</span>",Google shifted $23 billion to tax haven Bermuda in 2017: filing,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Google moved 19.9 billion euros ($22.7 billion) through a Dutch shell company to Bermuda in 2017, as part of an arrangement that allows it to reduce its foreign tax bill, according to documents filed at the Dutch Chamber of Commerce.
The amount channeled through Google Netherlands Holdings BV was around 4 billion euros more than in 2016, the documents, filed on Dec. 21, showed.
""We pay all of the taxes due and comply with the tax laws in every country we operate in around the world,"" Google said in a statement.
""Google, like other multinational companies, pays the vast majority of its corporate income tax in its home country, and we have paid a global effective tax rate of 26 percent over the last ten years.""
For more than a decade the arrangement has allowed Google owner Alphabet (O:GOOGL) to enjoy an effective tax rate in the single digits on its non-U.S. profits, around a quarter the average tax rate in its overseas markets.
The subsidiary in the Netherlands is used to shift revenue from royalties earned outside the United States to Google Ireland Holdings, an affiliate based in Bermuda, where companies pay no income tax.
The tax strategy, known as the ""Double Irish, Dutch Sandwich"", is legal and allows Google to avoid triggering U.S. income taxes or European withholding taxes on the funds, which represent the bulk of its overseas profits.
However, under pressure from the European Union and the United States, Ireland in 2014 decided to phase out the arrangement, ending Google's tax advantages in 2020.
Google Netherlands Holdings BV paid 3.4 million euros in taxes in the Netherlands in 2017, the documents showed, on a gross profit of 13.6 million euros.

The company, which makes trucks, construction equipment and buses, said on Thursday the estimated costs were based on factors including vehicle testing and statistical analysis, and were made in dialogue with relevant authorities. 
Volvo said in October its truck and bus engines might be exceeding limits for toxic nitrogen oxides because an emissions control component it uses was degrading.

295,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 12:45PM ET</span>",Major automakers bullish on U.S. market despite rising interest rates,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - Major automakers on Thursday shrugged off declines in U.S. new vehicle sales in December and said they were bullish about 2019 even as economists warned that rising interest rates will discourage consumers from buying cars in the year ahead.
""Despite recent market turbulence, the data we have in hand suggests an economy that remains on solid footing heading into the new year,"" Ford Chief Economist Emily Kolinski Morris said on a conference call. ""Consumers seem to be looking through market volatility to focus on continued positive job and income conditions."" 
But Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs said an overhaul of the U.S. tax system boosted sales in 2018, adding that consumers moved up their purchases on concerns the Trump administration would impose tariffs as well as fears of rising interest rates. 
American consumers have gradually been abandoning passenger cars in favor of larger, more comfortable SUVs and pickup trucks that are far more profitable for automakers.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) reported an 8.8 percent drop in sales for December, with declines in passenger cars, SUVs and pickup trucks. 
Sales of Ford's F-Series pickup trucks, the top-selling U.S. brand since the 1980s, fell 1.8 percent in December and its SUV sales were off 4.4 percent. 
The automaker's transaction prices rose $1,600 in December to a monthly record of $38,400 per vehicle, U.S. sales chief Mark LaNeve said, driven by the consumer shift from sedans to SUVs and pickups.
Ford executives said the automaker will switch to reporting quarterly sales like main rival General Motors Co (N:GM) which stopped reporting on a monthly basis last spring, arguing that a 30-day snapshot was too small a window to accurately reflect market conditions.
GM on Thursday reported a 2.7 percent drop in fourth-quarter sales, with declines for Chevrolet, Cadillac and Buick brands.
The No. 1 U.S. automaker also posted declines for some of its more popular larger vehicles, including the Chevrolet Suburban, the Cadillac Escalade and the GMC Yukon, all high-margin SUVs.
GM reported a small decrease for its Silverado pickup truck as it transitioned to a new, revamped model.
The automaker expects U.S. new vehicle sales industrywide to hit 17.3 million units for 2018, a slight increase versus 2017.
While analysts have estimated that 2019 will be a down year, automakers were upbeat about the market.
""We are very bullish on pickups heading into 2019,"" Kurt McNeil, GM's U.S. vice president for sales operations, said in a statement. ""We feel confident heading into 2019 because we have more major truck and crossover launches coming during the year and the U.S. economy is strong."" 
Toyota Motor Corp's (T:7203) December sales dropped 0.9 percent from the same month in 2017. The Japanese automaker said passenger cars were down 16.5 percent, including its flagship Camry sedan, which slid 32.9 percent. It posted strong gains in SUV and pickup truck sales.
 Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) bucked the trend for December, posting a 14 percent increase in sales. Its key Jeep and Ram brands were up 10 percent and 37 percent, respectively, in December. Ram pickup truck sales were up 34 percent in December.
""This year's performance underscores the efforts we undertook to realign our production to give U.S. consumers more Jeep vehicles and Ram pickup trucks,"" Reid Bigland, FCA's head of U.S. sales, said in a statement. ""We see sales remaining solid in 2019."" 
A large portion of the gains came from higher sales to rental car companies, corporations and government agencies. 
Nissan Motor Co Ltd's (T:7201) sales were up 7.6 percent as strong truck and SUV sales offset a decline in passenger cars. Despite the strong finish to the year, Nissan's U.S. full-year sales were down 6.2 percent versus 2017. 
Ford shares were up 0.8 percent at $7.97, FCA fell 0.8 percent to $14.21 and GM dropped 2.6 percent to $32.77.
After a long bull run, U.S. new vehicle sales were expected to drop in 2019 as rising interest rates weigh on sales and translate into higher monthly car payments for consumers. Recent stock market turmoil and uncertainty over the health of the U.S. economy could also add to consumer caution in the short term.
While passenger car sales have fallen rapidly, a pick-up in profitable trucks and SUVs are expected to remain relatively robust despite an overall decline in sales.
Based on a forecast that includes two interest rate hikes this year, Cox Automotive forecasts auto sales of 16.8 million units in 2019.

""Higher interest rates are the biggest risk we see at the moment,"" Krebs said.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus narrowed a sales gap against U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) by finalising orders for 120 of the former Bombardier CSeries jet, but shares in Europe's top planemaker fell as doubts surfaced over a target for overall 2018 deliveries.
Airbus, which took over the loss-making CSeries last July and rebranded it the A220, said on Thursday it had finalised deals to sell 60 each of the jets to U.S.-based JetBlue and to Moxy, a U.S. start-up backed by JetBlue founder David Neeleman.
But shares in the European company fell as Airbus prepared a keenly awaited delivery tally for overall deliveries in 2018. In late trading they were down 3.6 percent.
Reuters earlier reported growing doubts over whether Airbus had achieved a 2018 target of 800 deliveries, or 782 without counting the Canadian A220 jets.
An industry source familiar with the matter said it was ""more than likely"" Airbus had missed the target by a handful of jets, marking the first time it has done so since it was reshaped through European mergers in 2000.
An Airbus spokesman declined to comment.
Deliveries are closely watched by investors since they mark the point at which most cash and operating profit are generated.
Planemakers worldwide have been struggling with supplier problems in the past 12 months and Airbus has faced some production snags and quality problems, though any shortfall in deliveries is not expected to have a significant profit impact. 
Thursday's U.S. deals mark the first formal orders for the 110-130-seat A220 since Airbus took majority control of the Montreal-based programme with Bombardier and Quebec as partners. 
That realignment sets the stage for a broader confrontation with Boeing, which last month closed a deal to take over 80 percent of the commercial unit of Bombardier’s competitor Embraer, subject to Brazilian government approval.
For 2018, most attention is on the core sales battle between the transatlantic plane giants, with Boeing so far in the lead.
Airbus ended November with 35 percent of net sales in the main jetliner market against its U.S. rival after 11 months overshadowed by management changes and delivery delays.
Since then it has picked up speed with formal deals for 220 aircraft, including a 100-plane order from Irish lessor Avolon, leaving it 90 short of Boeing's end-November total of 690 jets.
On a like-for-like basis, excluding the former CSeries model, Airbus has reached a total of 480 net sales for the year against Boeing's most recent tally of 690 for a market share of 41 percent, based on orders announced since November. 

Airbus plans to give full-year figures on Jan. 11. Both companies often pull in last-minute deals to lift annual totals, with announcements delayed until early the following year.

311,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 11:42AM ET</span>",Delta shares fall 10 percent on lowered outlook; drags down rivals,"By Rachit Vats and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - Shares of Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) fell 10 percent on Thursday, after the U.S. carrier warned fourth-quarter unit revenue would be slightly below its prior forecast due to the lower-than-expected improvement in last-minute fares booked by travelers.
The No.2 U.S. airline said it now expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM)- a closely followed measure of airline performance - to rise about 3 percent, compared with the 3.5 percent growth it forecast earlier.
""While close-in yield momentum continues, the pace of improvement in late December was more modest than anticipated,"" Delta said. Shares of bigger rival American Airlines Group Inc fell 11 percent. Smaller carriers United Continental Holdings Inc, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and JetBlue Airways Corp were down 5-7 percent. The broader U.S. markets slumped 2 percent as weak U.S. factory data and the fallout of a rare sales warning from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) fanned fears of slowing growth.  ""The unit revenue guide-down is the second time Delta lowered RASM forecast in the past two months,"" Cowen & Co analyst Helane Becker said in a note. ""Investors are concerned that RASM will continue to weaken in 2019, although we believe other airlines are not necessarily seeing the same pressure as Delta.""  Becker, rated 5 stars by Refinitiv for estimate accuracy on Delta, lowered her price target to $65 from $67, but maintained an ""outperform"" rating. Atlanta-based Delta also said it expects fuel price per gallon to be in the range of $2.38 to $2.43, about 10 cents below its earlier guidance. In the past, airlines have competed away gains from lower fuel by rewarding fliers with lower fares. ""With oil trending lower in recent months, investors are worried this time will not be different,"" said Becker. Airlines also take advantage of lower fuel costs to add more flights and seat capacity, a measure that can also drive down unit revenue.  Delta last month forecast 2019 revenue and profit below analysts' estimates.  The airline said it expects revenue to rise about 4-6 percent in 2019, compared with an average 5.6 percent increase forecast by Refinitiv data.  
The company's profit estimate of $6-$7 per share also fell short of average expectation of $6.70.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Grains trader Cargill Inc on Thursday reported a 20 percent drop in its fiscal second-quarter 2019 net earnings, as global trade tensions hit the bottom line along with challenges in the Chinese hog sector and a struggling U.S. dairy business.
Three of the company's four business units reported results that were below the same period a year earlier.
While demand remained strong at the company's beef business in North America, Cargill said political and marketplace headwinds hurt many of units, particularly its protein and food ingredients divisions, both of which have been strategic growth areas.
Political instability in Central America and market challenges in Southeast Asia ate into its poultry efforts, the company said. Meanwhile, earnings for its starches and sweeteners business slumped as U.S. ethanol prices hit historic lows and raw material costs rose in Europe.
""We are pushing to ready our businesses for the future with continuous improvement, financial discipline and a disruptive mindset,"" said Dave MacLennan, Cargill's chairman and chief executive officer.
The privately held company said its net earnings on a U.S. GAAP basis for the quarter ended Nov. 30, 2018, were $741 million, a 20 percent decline from $924 million for the same period a year earlier.
Cargill's second-quarter revenues fell 4 percent to $28 billion, bringing the year-to-date figure to $56.7 billion. The company's quarterly adjusted operating earnings were $853 million, down 10 percent from $948 million.
One bright note was the company's ""strong"" oilseed processing results in North America and Europe, while grain exports from the U.S. and Canada, biodiesel production in Europe, and better crop yields in Argentina boosted the company's origination and processing unit's performance, Cargill said.
Processors including Cargill have benefited from increasing global demand for soymeal and from soybean prices being near 11-year lows.

But the U.S.-China trade fight dragged on its ocean transportation business due to uncertainty in the freight markets. And industrial and financial services performance was off from the year-earlier quarter, ""due in part to broader weakness in financial markets that negatively affected Cargill's investments in managed funds,"" the company said.

The strike, called by the country's two main unions, CCOO and UGT, may affect the delivery of products for Epiphany, the day on which three kings brought gifts to Jesus in Christian tradition, which most Spaniards mark by exchanging presents.
""We have been protesting for a year. This is the richest company in the world and they want to keep profiting by taking away workers' rights,"" said David Matarraz, an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) worker outside the warehouse close to Madrid.
Amazon workers in Germany and Poland have also walked off the job, demanding better conditions.
German and Spanish workers went on strike two months ago on Black Friday, the discount spending spree that kicks off the Christmas shopping season, but Amazon said this had no impact on customer orders.
Seventy percent of employees at the Spanish center joined Thursday's strike, CCOO representative Douglas Harper said. An Amazon spokesman denied this, saying most employees at the center had been at work on Thursday.

Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, said in November that it was prepared for a no-deal and that it was not seeing any impact from Brexit on demand for flights. Chief Executive Michael O'Leary had earlier warned that a disorderly Brexit could ground flights for several weeks after the U.K. leaves on March 29. A departure agreement negotiated by Prime Minister Theresa May with Brussels hangs in the balance ahead of a parliamentary vote this month. British lawmakers will take a decision on whether to accept May's plans for a managed exit or reject the deal and spawn huge uncertainty about the country's next steps. Brexit minister Stephen Barclay warned on Thursday that the country is more likely to end up leaving the EU without a deal if parliament rejects May's deal with Brussels. Ryanair's smaller rival easyJet (L:EZJ) also said last year that it was prepared for a no-deal scenario and that Brexit uncertainty was not having any impact on ticket sales.

341,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 10:00AM ET</span>",Carige looking to use convertible bond to boost capital,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's Banca Carige (MI:CRGI) is looking for ways to use a 320 million euro ($363 million) convertible bond to boost capital and avoid any use of taxpayers money, one of its special administrators said on Thursday.
The European Central Bank picked three administrators on Wednesday to take charge of Carige to save the struggling lender after it failed to raise new capital.
Italy's 10th biggest lender has said the administrators would seek fresh talks with the country's deposit guarantee fund (FITD) which underwrote the bond last year to help meet capital plans.
The bond, which should have been reimbursed early this year after a successful cash call, carries a 16 percent yield.
""We're reflecting (with FITD) on how best to use this instrument in the light of recent developments,"" Fabio Innocenzi told Italy's Class CNBC television when asked if the bond could be converted into shares. 
If Carige fails to raise capital by June 30 falling short of ECB requirements, a conversion of the bond would allow it to bolster capital without tapping current shareholders for fresh cash.
Innocenzi said the aim was to avoid creating a situation whereby taxpayers or anyone else would have to pick up a bill.
A conversion into shares would help the FITD avoid having to guarantee deposits of up to 9.4 billion euros if the lender were compulsorily wound up, a source said on Thursday.
Innocenzi, Carige's CEO until recently, said the bank was well capitalized, adding the plan was to press ahead with a restructuring plan put in place a few months ago to strengthen capital, shed unpaid loans and seek a possible merger partner.
Innocenzi said the bank was in an exploratory phase as regards a merger, adding there were financial and industrial reasons why the bank would be an attractive proposition. 
Concern has been growing that Carige might struggle to attract a merger partner as recommended by the ECB after selling off some of its best assets in recent years to stay afloat.
On Thursday Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi di Maio said the government was following the matter ""with great attention"", but added Rome was ""not concerned"". 
The ECB stepped in for the first time since taking over as the euro zone's top banking supervisor in 2014 after Carige's top shareholder - the Malacalza family of steel entrepreneurs -refused to back a 400 million euro share issue last month.
Innocenzi said he had not been able to find an agreement with the Malacalzas so far but added ""all channels remain open"". 
Carige has raised 2.2 billion euros from investors in three cash calls since 2014, piling up 1.5 billion euros in losses over the same period, mainly due to bad loans.
The lender's troubles stem from decades of mismanagement and overexposure to the depressed local economy. 
It has also undergone a string of top management shake-ups since the Malacalzas replaced a local charitable foundation as the single largest shareholder in the bank.

The S&P 500 fell 45 points, or 1.84%, as of 10:24 AM ET (15:24 GMT), while the Dow decreased 511 points, or 2.19%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 147 points, or 2.18%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell more than 9% after CEO Tim Cook said in a letter late Wednesday the company expects sales of $84 billion for the last quarter, down from earlier estimates of $89 billion to $93 billion. The lowered guidance is due to a steep decline in Chinese sales, as trade tensions have put pressure on China’s economy.
The news put a shadow over upcoming earnings results later in the month.
""This provides solid evidence of how slowing economic growth and a trade war make the best death cocktail for sentiment,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK.

Maggi, Nestle India's single-largest revenue earner, was banned in June 2015 for six months across the country following allegations it contained chemicals beyond prescribed limits. 
The company had to recall and destroy 38,000 tonnes of Maggi noodles from millions of retail shelves. The ban was relaxed in November 2015.
In Thursday's ruling, the Supreme Court backed Nestle's stance that analysis of Maggi noodles already conducted by the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) sufficed to help decide a lawsuit filed by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, the company said.
That analysis showed that samples met standards for lead and other parameters, Nestle added.

The ruling set aside efforts by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) to conduct more tests, Nestle said, adding the case would now proceed based on the CFTRI reports.

LONDON (Reuters) - Apple's rare warning on revenue rocked financial markets on Thursday, as investors sought safety in bonds and less risky assets amid renewed concerns about slowing global economic and corporate growth.
Asian and European shares fell sharply, led by a sell-off in technology stocks, and U.S. equity futures pointed to a weaker open on Wall Street after Apple (O:AAPL) cut its revenue forecast, its first downgrade in nearly 12 years, blaming weaker iPhone sales in China. 
The news also jolted currency markets and German government bond yields held close to their lowest in over two years.
""For the moment, investors have reacted by going into non-risky assets,"" said Philippe Waechter, chief economist at Ostrum Asset Management, in Paris.
""No one wants to take any risk because none of the uncertainties we are facing have been lifted, whether it's Brexit, this trade war, or growth. Investors are putting their heads in the sand and waiting.""
Apples shares tumbled in after-hours trade and those listed in Frankfurt (F:AAPL) were down 8.6 percent in early European deals.
The news sparked a 'flash crash' in holiday-thinned currency markets as growing concerns about the health of the global economy, particularly in China, sent investors scurrying into the safe-haven of the Japanese yen, which was poised for its biggest daily rise in 20 months.
Apple's warning came after data earlier this week showed a deceleration in factory activity in China and the euro zone, indicating the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China was taking a toll on global manufacturing.
Major European bourses were firmly in negative territory by midmorning - Frankfurt's DAX (GDAXI), with its exposure to Chinese trade and tech-heavy constituents, was the biggest faller and down as much as 1.2 percent, while Paris' CAC40 (FCHI) dropped 1.1 percent and London (FTSE) eased 0.4 percent.
Chipmakers who supply parts to Apple were the worst hit, sending technology stocks (SX8P) to their lowest since February 2017.
U.S. stock futures pointed to another rough start on Wall Street, with Nasdaq E-minis (NQc1) down 2.7 percent and S&P 500 E-minis (ESc1) off 1.6 percent.
Overnight, shares in China (CSI300) and Hong Kong (HSE) see-sawed between gains and losses as investors braced for Beijing to roll out fresh support measures for the cooling Chinese economy.
""Chinese authorities have got the luxury of having control not just of the fiscal parts of the government tool case, but also the monetary parts ... and I suspect the Chinese authorities will use that,"" said Jim McCafferty, head of equity research, Asia ex-Japan, at Nomura.
China's central bank said late on Wednesday it was adjusting policy to benefit more small firms that are having trouble obtaining financing, in its latest move to ease strains on the private sector, a key job creator.
While more fiscal and monetary policy support had been expected in coming months on top of modest measures last year, some analysts wonder if more forceful stimulus will be needed to stabilize the world's second-largest economy.
'FLASH CRASH'
Currency markets saw a wild spike in volatility in early Asian trade, with the yen moving sharply higher against the U.S. dollar, breaking key technical levels and triggering stop-loss sales of U.S. and Australian dollars.
The dollar was last 1 percent weaker against the yen  at 107.77, having earlier fallen as low as 104.96, its lowest level since March 2018. The Australian dollar at one point hit levels against the Japanese yen not seen since 2011. 
The euro (EUR=) was up 0.3 percent, buying $1.1375, and the dollar index (DXY), which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of major rivals, was 0.3 percent weaker at 96.52.
Germany's 10-year bond yield was most recently at 0.185 percent, after hitting a session low of 0.148 percent (DE10YT=RR). 
U.S. crude (CLc1) oil fell 0.9 percent to $46.12 a barrel, and Brent crude (LCOc1) was down 0.2 percent at $54.82. Slowing global growth is expected to coincide with an increase in crude supply, depressing prices. 
Gold was higher as the dollar weakened, with spot gold  trading up 0.2 percent at $1,289.4 per ounce.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shanghai student Xu Yechuyi wanted to buy a new iPhone last year but couldn't afford one at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's flagship store, so she opted for a used, three-year-old iPhone 6S at less than a third of the sticker price.
The purchase made Xu, 22, one of many consumers priced out of stores and resorting to China's rapidly growing second-hand handset market, bartering via text-messaging apps and spending money on Apple products that never reaches Apple.
""I think there is real demand for this sort of second-hand market from less affluent consumers like me,"" said Xu.
The second-hand trend adds to challenges Apple faces in the world's biggest smartphone market, where it has long been losing ground to domestic makers of high-end yet lower-priced handsets such as market leader Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL].
The first iPhones in China in 2009 brought Apple record profit. But the launch last year of its most expensive handset ever - priced 9,599 yuan ($1,397) - coincided with economic downturn and a slowing smartphone market, while deteriorating Sino-U.S. trade relations stoked support for local rivals.
Poor iPhone sales in China prompted Apple on Wednesday to lower its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in over a decade, hammering its shares and those of its suppliers. Chief Executive Tim Cook blamed the trade war and the economy. (https://tmsnrt.rs/2SATVKo)
""We did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China,"" said Cook.
Several leading Chinese technology companies also lowered forecasts in the past year, including e-commerce firm  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and search engine provider Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), with both citing the impact of the trade war.
Meanwhile consumer confidence has tumbled since the middle of last year, with its impact rippling through the economy, from overall retail numbers to box office receipts and car sales.
As confidence falls and the economy continues to slow, analysts said the market for used smartphones can only expand. China's iiMedia Research forecast 144 million users of second-hand smartphones in 2019, up a third versus last year.
""The macro environment is just not in Apple's favor,"" said Singapore-based IDC senior research manager Kiranjeet Kaur. ""People's spending power is coming down.""
In west Beijing's tech district, one worker surnamed Zhou at a phone refurbishing firm said she had seen a rise in users looking to upgrade old iPhones instead of purchasing new ones.
""Quite a few people choose to continue using their older iPhones by changing the battery and updating to iOS 12,"" agreed one user on Weibo, referring to Apple's latest operating system. 
""BUY CHINESE BRANDS""
On Thursday, popular threads on microblog site Weibo largely blamed the price for a drop in sales of what was once a must-have status symbol, with some comments taking on a patriotic bent.
""Only fools buy expensive iPhones. Sane people buy top quality, cheap Huawei,"" wrote one user in a comment 'liked' several hundred times. ""Support Chinese brands!""
Support for local smartphone brands gained momentum in the past year as the U.S. imposed import tariffs on Chinese goods. Netizens responded by calling for a boycott of Apple - a company widely regarded as being representative of the United States.
Apple started 2018 with a market share of 15 percent but that had fallen to roughly 9 percent by July-September, showed data from Counterpoint Research. Huawei, whose high-end phone retails at 70 percent of the price of fifth-ranked Apple, saw its share rise to 23 percent from 20 percent.
The Chinese handset maker gained further support last month after the arrest of its chief financial officer in Canada at the request of the United States.
At an Apple shop in Beijing's Wangfujing shopping district on Thursday, fashion worker Zhang Lijun was considering buying an iPhone X or the competing Huawei P20, which runs on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Android operating system.
""I think the price is too high,"" she said, referring to the iPhone. ""Huawei has been trending in the past two years, maybe because there's been more awareness about supporting local brands.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese coffee startup Luckin is aiming to open 2,500 new stores this year and overtake  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) as the largest coffee chain by number of outlets in the world's second-biggest economy, it said on Thursday.
The firm, which only officially launched its business at the start of last year, has expanded at breakneck speed, propelled by a focus on technology, delivery, and heavy discounting even at the cost of mounting losses.
""What we want at the moment is scale and speed,"" Luckin's chief marketing officer, Yang Fei, told reporters on Thursday at a presentation in Beijing. 
""There's no point talking about profit,"" he said, adding that subsidies to lure in more users would be an important part of the firm's strategy for the next few years. 
Luckin said it was targeting a total of more than 4,500 stores by the end of 2019, which would take it past Seattle-based Starbucks that has long dominated China's coffee scene and has over 3,600 stores in the country.
Luckin's caffeine-fuelled expansion is in stark contrast to Starbucks, which opened its first China store in 1999 and has spent two decades reaching its current store count.
The U.S. chain, which spearheaded the growth of a coffee culture in China, started to see competition rise from smaller peers over the last 18 months, though Luckin has stood out as the most aggressive competitor.
But Luckin's rise has not come cheaply. 
The firm recorded a loss of 800 million yuan ($116.34 million) last year, which its chief marketing officer said was in line with expectations as it pushed to expand.
Luckin, backed by Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd and China International Capital Corp Ltd (HK:3908), opened more than 2,000 locations in the last year, gaining a valuation of $2.2 billion after raising $200 million in a funding round last month.
The firm's chief executive, Qian Zhiya, told Reuters last year that Luckin aimed to outnumber Starbucks in China.
Reuters previously reported that Luckin was also in early-stage talks with investment banks about an overseas initial public offering. The firm, however, declined to answer questions about IPO plans on Thursday.

394,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 06:10AM ET</span>",Apple Cuts Outlook as Chinese Slowdown Hits iPhone Demand,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. cut its revenue outlook for the first time in almost two decades citing weaker demand in China, triggering a slump for Asian suppliers and a wave of lower price targets on Wall Street.
Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said sales will be about $84 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 29, down from earlier estimates of $89 billion to $93 billion. Apple posted sales of $88.3 billion in the fiscal first quarter a year earlier, so the new forecast would mean Apple is reporting a holiday quarter slowdown for the first time since Cook became CEO in 2011.
Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were down 7.8 percent in pre-market trading at 05:37 a.m. in New York Thursday.
The announcement, made in a letter from Cook to investors, comes after weeks of signals from inside Apple and its supply chain indicating the Cupertino, California-based company is struggling to sell the latest iPhones released in September. The flagship product earns Apple about two-thirds of its revenue, and allows the company to generate more money from attached products like Apple Watches, AirPods, and services like Apple Music.
“While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China,” Cook wrote. Greater China, a region that includes the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan, accounted for most of the revenue shortfall, but iPhone upgrades also weren’t as strong as the company anticipated in some developed markets, Cook said.
“The fact that they missed that wasn’t the shock,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. “It was the degree and how confined it was to China. The fact that China basically fell off a cliff was a jaw dropper, and combined with the lack of metrics, it makes investors feel like they’re walking blindfolded in the dark.”
Suppliers in Europe and Asia slumped on the news. AMS AG, which produces optical sensors for mobile phones, fell as much as 19.4 percent in Zurich, and Dialog Semiconductor Plc, which makes power-management components, fell as much as 8.5 percent in Frankfurt.
 SK Hynix Inc  (KS:000660), a producer of memory for Apple, dropped 4.8 percent in Seoul while Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co., which makes chips and displays, fell 3 percent. IPhone assembler  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW:2317) lost 1.7 percent and rival  Pegatron  Corp (TW:4938). slipped 1.2 percent.  Taiwan Semiconductor Co Ltd  (TWO:5425) fell 1.8 percent.
Several key Apple suppliers overseas had cut their revenue estimates during the past few months, suggesting something was amiss. In November, the company said it would stop reporting unit sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs beginning in fiscal 2019. That sparked concern Apple wanted to avoid disclosing weak growth numbers. Apple’s stock had fallen 32 percent from an October peak to its close of $157.92 Wednesday amid growing concerns about the iPhone.
In December, Bloomberg News reported the company was facing a “fire drill” to boost iPhone sales. That led Apple to aggressively market the iPhone XR on its website for $449, about $300 less than its official sticker price. The deal required customers to trade in an iPhone 7 Plus, a high-end handset from two years earlier.
At least four Wall Street firms, including BITG and RBC, lowered their share price forecasts by more than 15 percent after Cook’s letter.
In his letter, Cook said the new iPhone models were released earlier than the flagship iPhone X last year, which created a difficult year-over-year comparison. The iPhone X launched in November 2017, while the iPhone XS and XS Max were released in September. Cook also noted supply constraints to new models of the Apple Watch, iPad Pro and AirPods.
“IPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be,” he said, meaning the sales of new models to current customers replacing their old phones.
The CEO attributed much of the company’s “shortfall” in its outlook to struggles in China that he pinned on the economy and “rising trade tensions” with the U.S.
“As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed,” Cook said.
The timing of Apple’s announcement blaming its shortcomings partly on President Donald Trump’s trade war with China may increase pressure on American officials to ease the tensions quickly. Mid-level officials from the Trump administration are scheduled to travel to Beijing for talks early next week.
While iPhone revenue accounted for the forecast cut, Apple’s other product categories, including the iPad and services, grew a combined 19 percent year-over-year, he said. Services generated $10.8 billion in revenue for the quarter -- a 27 percent increase from a year earlier.
Apple’s decision to cut its sales outlook, “isn’t a huge shock at this point,” said Shannon Cross of Cross Research. “It will be interesting to see how Apple shares react if there’s a China trade agreement.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Apple's first sales warning in nearly 12 years sent European shares sliding on Thursday, with the tech sector particularly badly bruised as chipmakers that supply the iPhone maker fell sharply. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 0.7 percent as Europe joined a selloff in Asia with the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) warning compounding concerns about global growth. 
Apple's Frankfurt-listed shares (F:AAPL) fell 7.9 percent after the tech giant cut its sales forecast, blaming weaker iPhone sales in China, whose economy has been hit by a trade war with the U.S.
Germany's DAX (GDAXI), highly sensitive to Chinese growth, fell 0.9 percent.
Chipmakers that supply parts to Apple were the worst hit. Shares in AMS (S:AMS), which provides the facial recognition sensors used in the latest iPhones, fell as much as 19 percent to the bottom of the STOXX. 
Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) tumbled 6.7 percent, while Infineon (DE:IFXGn), ASML (AS:ASML), ASM International (AS:ASMI),  Logitech  (S:LOGN), and STMicroelectronics (MI:STM) fell 4 to 7.3 percent. 
""The last Apple guidance in November saw a plethora of supply chain companies come out and follow suit in the following couple of weeks. You can expect more of the same this January,"" wrote Neil Campling, co-head of the global thematic group at Mirabaud Securities. 
""...You can expect ongoing volatility and downside risk for the sector. It is tin-hat time.""
The tech sector (SX8P) was the worst-performing, down 2.9 percent and only the telecoms and bank sectors stayed in the black. 
Investors have dumped risk and preferred sectors considered defensive, like telecoms, which deliver large dividends and have steady revenues, as markets have turned sour.
""Globally, investors have no desire for risky assets,"" said Philippe Waechter, chief economist at Ostrum Asset Management in Paris. 
Luxury goods shares, which are also highly sensitive to signs of slowing demand in China, joined the selloff. 
LVMH (PA:LVMH), Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP), Moncler (MI:MONC),  Burberry  (L:BRBY), and Swatch (S:UHR) were down 2.2 to 3.9 percent, among the biggest fallers.
Moves were exacerbated by thin volumes, with many investors still on festive holidays. Just 16 percent of the average daily volume in the STOXX 600 was traded in the first 100 minutes, usually the busiest.
Among rare gainers,  Next  (L:NXT) shares topped the STOXX with a 5.1 percent rise after the clothing retailer reported a rise in sales in the run-up to Christmas in line with its expectations.

Peer Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) gained 2.1 percent, while Primark owner ABF (L:ABF) rose 1.7 percent and  Tesco  (L:TSCO) rose 2.1 percent.

399,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 04:44AM ET</span>",Powell and Trump Are Locked in a Battle for Wall Street's Trust,"(Bloomberg) -- Jerome Powell has been sucked into a one-sided communication fight with Donald Trump, who blames the Federal Reserve chairman for losses in the stock market.
Powell can’t match the president’s megaphone on social media. But he can try to prevent equity prices becoming the barometer of Fed success by reminding the public that Congress gave it a different mandate: stable prices, and jobs for as many Americans as possible.
Trump’s Twitter feed is “drowning out the message that the economy is doing well with low inflation and record low unemployment,’’ said Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington
Since Oct. 3, U.S. equity prices have plunged almost 15 percent, and Trump has put the blame squarely on the Fed. He tweeted on Dec. 18 that central bankers needed to “feel the market’’ and hold off from hiking -- one day before they raised rates. Bloomberg News reported Dec. 21 that the president had discussed firing Powell.
The Fed chief has a chance to snatch the initiative back with public appearances on Friday in Atlanta and Jan. 10 in Washington.
“The burden is on him to come back and say, we are taking everything into account and we are also doing it independently,’’ Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton LLP in Chicago. “There is no easy answer here,’’ she said, because the Fed can’t be entirely separated from the causes of stock market volatility.
While investors had expected last month’s rate increase, which showed Powell was willing to defy the president, they were alarmed by projections for two more hikes in 2019. The S&P 500 index fell more than 5 percent from Dec. 19-21.
Not Just Fed
The slide in share prices has many causes, analysts say.
Stocks may have been over-valued relative to a forecast for moderating U.S. and global growth in 2019. Domestic stimulus engineered by Trump in early 2018 will fade in the coming quarters. China and the eurozone both show signs of slowing. The economic outlook could deteriorate further amid Trump’s trade dispute with China and the threat of a disorderly U.K. exit from the European Union.
The Fed did acknowledge those growing risks in its Dec. 19 policy statement, pledging to monitor “global economic and financial developments.’’ That left investors puzzled over what it would take for the central bank to shift into a holding pattern -- especially when there are few signs of rising inflation.
For all that, the data show the Fed is doing what Congress asked it to. The jobless rate is below the Fed’s estimates of what constitutes full employment, and inflation is running close to its 2 percent target.
Louder Voice
Moreover, Powell and his colleagues have said they’ll pull back if new data confirm the market’s more pessimistic outlook. The two projected rate hikes could disappear, just as four increases foreseen at the end of 2015 turned into just one during 2016. Investors, however, aren’t getting that message. Two possible reasons stand out: The critics have a louder voice, and Fed communication hasn’t been clear.
Trump has 57 million followers on Twitter and each of his tweets on the Fed is amplified by blaring media headlines. The Fed Board has 500,000 followers, and generally limits its tweets to dry topics like speeches or economic research. And, while the world’s most powerful central bank does get plenty of media coverage, its own communication can be hard to decode -- even for market professionals.
Could Do Better
It could do better, according to Richard Torrenzano, chief executive of The Torrenzano Group, which counsels corporations and executives on reputational strategy.
“The Federal Reserve does have a large megaphone and bully-pulpit platforms they have chosen not to use,’’ Torrenzano said. “They need to explain why and what they are doing in an active and thoughtful way,” including on social media, he said. “Until they do, they will continually get beat up.’’
One example is the current Fed dependence on incoming data, which officials could do a better job of explaining. It’s not the first time they’ve had this problem. In 2006, the Fed’s then-Vice Chairman Donald Kohn urged his colleagues to spell out what that meant. “We have all said in our speeches, we are becoming more data-dependent,” he said. “It behooves us to explain to the public what data we’re looking at.”
Another difficulty for Powell is that investors have an exaggerated sense of what problems the Fed can or should solve, according to Mickey Levy, chief U.S. and Asia economist at Berenberg Capital Markets. He thinks Powell should stick to emphasizing his progress toward meeting the central bank’s statutory goals.
“Markets expect the Fed not just to manage the real economy, but to prop up the stock market,” Levy said."

Moller-Maersk (CO:MAERSKb) will shut a transport container factory in China and instead focus on producing refrigerated containers for food, it said on Thursday.
While the market for so-called dry containers has been squeezed by increased competition, demand for refrigerated containers has grown thanks to higher global demand for fresh produce and other commodities, Maersk said in a statement.
The company's Dongguan container factory, which has 2,240 employees and can produce 100,000 40-foot containers a year, has been idle since the beginning of December, Maersk said.

At least four firms reduced their share price forecasts for the iPhone maker by more than 15 percent after Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said Wednesday that the company expects sales of about $84 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 29, down from earlier estimates of $89 billion to $93 billion. The new estimate would mean Apple is reporting a holiday quarter slowdown for the first time since Cook became CEO in 2011.
KeyBank Capital Markets was less optimistic after the forecast cut, noting that the company is facing large risks around its pricing for iPhones and monetization of the App Store. Others including Royal Bank of Canada remained bullish on the stock, noting that it is getting closer to attractive valuations and that non-iPhone businesses such as Apple Watches, AirPods and services like Apple Music are still growing strongly.
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) plunged by as much as 8.5 percent post-market, while Asian suppliers including Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. followed with declines on Thursday.

Here’s what analysts are saying about the results:
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Rod Hall
“Beyond China, we don’t see strong evidence of a consumer slowdown heading into 2019 but we just flag to investors that we believe Apple’s replacement rates are likely much more sensitive to the macro now that the company is approaching maximum market penetration for the iPhone.”
Hall has a neutral rating on the stock and cuts price target to $140 from $182 as he sees potential for further downside to full-year numbers depending on the trajectory of Chinese demand in early 2019.
He also reduces his full-year 2019 revenue estimate by 6 percent to $253 billion and earnings per share by around 10 percent to $11.66.
Piper Jaffray, Michael J. Olson
“The lowered expectations are largely due to weaker than anticipated iPhone sales in Greater China, as well as several emerging markets.”
Olson says “silver lining” is that non-iPhone revenue accelerated in the quarter, including record revenue from Services and Mac.
Olson has an overweight rating on the stock and cut its target price to $187 from $222. Olson also lowers full-year 2019 and 2020 estimated revenue by 6 percent and 4 percent respectively.
RBC, Amit Daryanani
“While this is clearly disappointing, investors were bracing for a disappointing print.”
The stock is getting closer to trough valuation support as its trading below 10 times forward earnings and could see downside support around $120, Daryanani said in a report. In addition, the services business continued to “outperform expectations” and “wearables also posted very strong growth.”
Daryanani has an outperform rating on the stock and lowered its price target to $185 to $220.
BITG, Walter Piecyk
“0% revenue growth is our new expectation for fiscal 2019, but we believe Apple can return to revenue growth in the June quarter.”
“The huge miss in iPhone was offset by upside to other segments.”
Piecyk kept a buy rating on the stock but trimmed his price target to $197 from $235. He cut the fiscal year’s earnings per share estimate by $1.30 to $12.34 but maintained that the share repurchase program could help achieve EPS growth of 4 percent. He estimated that Apple would buy back 503 million shares this calendar year.
KeyBank, Andy Hargreaves
“Aggressive price increases and limited functional differentiation in new models are driving elongated holding periods and trade down activity across several geographies. We see little to change this in the medium term, which suggests a likelihood for soft iPhone results to persist.”
“We continue to see significant risks to iPhone demand and services revenue growth, which would likely need to become more fully factored into the multiple to prompt a more positive rating.”
Hargreaves kept a sector weight rating on the stock with no price target and lowered his 2019 revenue estimate to $269 billion from $277 billion. He said expected software and services revenue of around $10.8 billion was below estimates and reflected the “lower-than-expected App Store monetization due to limited new games in China and broader market saturation.”
Separately, semiconductor analysts John Vinh and Michael Lin lowered estimates on Apple suppliers including Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc., Qorvo Inc., Skyworks Solutions Inc. and Cirrus Logic Inc.
Loup Ventures, Gene Munster
“This challenging quarter accelerates the change in mindset from iPhone product cycles to Apple as a service.”
“We don’t see any sustainable shifts in market share, so iPhone owners will remain in the ecosystem, and eventually upgrade.”
“Tough quarters will come and the team needs to rise to the occasion,” he wrote in a note. “Cook’s commentary on investor expectations, Apple’s talent, and its ability to innovate are spot on -- a battle cry for the company and a sign of strong leadership.”
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Katy Huberty
“While we view the after hours trading price of $146/share as an attractive entry point long-term in light of our believe that new Services and Wearables can deliver more consistent EPS growth long-term,, we see shares as range bound until investors get more visibility into the March quarter on January 29th when Apple plans to report December quarter earnings.”
“The larger than market decline in iPhone units will likely contribute to investor concerns that Apple may be losing share. However, our data suggests Apple took considerable share of China’s smartphone user base through November.”
Huberty maintained an overweight rating on the stock, cutting the price target to $211 from $236.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), Wamsi Mohan
“Although the trade tensions with China could ease in 1H19, the broader demand weakness and slower upgrade cycles are likely to push units much lower in F19.”
“Our downgrade late last year was predicated on a weaker China but demand seems to have deteriorated materially over the past two months.”
Mohan kept a neutral rating on the stock with a price target of $195. He said the street is likely to continue revising estimates downwards, which will pressure the stock in the near-term. The bank’s semiconductor analysts led by Vivek Arya lowered the earnings estimates and price targets of Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo.
Citi, Jim Suva
“We were surprised about the magnitude of the miss and the negative impact of China demand for iPhones.”
Nomura Instinet, Jeffrey Kvaal
“We believe the weakness was primarily in the new Xs/Xr models. The gross margin should reach 38% despite lower iPhone volumes.”
“The bright spots are that weak iPhone demand seems partially cyclical, other units are faring well, and the installed base is rising.”
Kvaal reiterated a neutral rating on Apple shares and lowered his price target by $10 to $175.

The company, currently mired in a controversy surrounding the safety of its baby talcum powder, reported overall sales of 58.28 billion rupees ($829 million) in India for the year, its filing with the country's Ministry of Corporate Affairs shows.
But its after-tax profit for the period rose 18 percent to $98 million on other income, including foreign exchange gains.
J&J's medical device sales in India have been hit following the federal government's move in 2017 to cap prices of devices such as orthopedic knee implants to help poor patients. 
The restrictions were part of a broader push by India to end what it called ""illegal profiteering"" by companies.
The company has recently been in the news after a Reuters investigation found J&J knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos lurked in its baby powder. 
The report prompted drug inspectors across India to collect talc samples from J&J facilities for testing. 
J&J has said the Reuters article was ""one-sided, false and inflammatory"", adding that its Baby Powder was ""safe and asbestos free"".
J&J's Baby Powder is one of the most recognized foreign brands in India. The company leads sales in the Indian baby and child toiletries market, which Euromonitor International estimates was worth $178 million last year.
J&J's consumer segment in India, which includes baby care products such as soap and talc, recorded sales of 31 billion rupees in the year to March 2018, marginally lower than the previous year, the company's India filing showed.
Sales in its medical segment, which includes its orthopedic products, fell 7 percent to 19.6 billion rupees.

407,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 02:06AM ET</span>","At Brazil's Petrobras, a 'Chicago Boy' takes the reins","By Gram Slattery
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Depending on who you ask, Roberto Castello Branco, the new chief executive of Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4), will either save the indebted oil major - or strip it to the bone.
Tapped by far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who took power on Tuesday, Castello Branco had said in a June newspaper column he thought Petrobras - as the company is known - should be privatized, a hardcore proposal even in an administration packed with free market advocates.
He has walked back on that idea since being named as CEO in November, saying such a move is not in his mandate, but has indicated he remains laser-focused on an ambitious divestment program, aimed at cutting Petrobras' staggering net debt, which stood at $73 billion as of the third quarter.
Castello Branco has sharply criticized the former government for meddling in domestic diesel pricing. In an interview last year with Reuters, he also complained about courts blocking Petrobras asset sales, which include four refineries and a pipeline subsidiary known as TAG, among many others.
His stance has delighted investors, who want the sprawling firm to slim down and consolidate efforts on core businesses, notably exploiting Brazil's deepwater oilfields.
Yet some lawmakers, judges and unions fear Castello Branco will give away some of Brazil's most prized possessions. They have pledged to get in his way.
""It's the worst situation possible; he's a fox in the hen-house,"" said Eduardo Henrique, a leader of the FNP oil workers union, one of the nation's largest.
""He's come along to destroy the company ... and confronting that is our big challenge.""
ROCKY TERRAIN
Castello Branco, an academic and former board member at Petrobras and iron ore miner Vale SA (SA:VALE3), is among a coterie of economically conservative officials in the Bolsonaro administration who were trained at the University of Chicago.
In Latin America, its pro-free-market graduates - who have at times in recent decades enjoyed significant sway over policymakers - are often referred to as ""Chicago Boys.""
""It's interesting that although he is a liberal, he's going to be head of a state-run company,"" said Carlos Langoni, an economist, who advised Castello Branco on his dissertation in the 1970s.
""He has been very consistent in his ideas about reducing the role of the state in the economy ... he knows that state-run companies are exceptions.""
However, the extent to which Castello Branco will be able to put his liberal ideas into practice is in doubt.
Various courts in Brazil have suspended major Petrobras asset sales in recent months. The company is locked in a multi-billion-dollar dispute with the government over an oil producing zone known as the transfer-of-rights area, while the state has effectively required the firm to help front the bill for subsidized diesel purchases since June.
Castello Branco, described by many around him as exuding confidence, lacks the political experience of his predecessor Ivan Monteiro, who rose up the ranks of state-run Banco do Brasil SA (SA:BBAS3), deftly maintaining a healthy balance sheet even amid periods of intense government interference.
Castello Branco already ruffled feathers at Petrobras in December by setting up an office before taking on his role officially, sources said. He is due to begin formally on Thursday.
Brazilian voters have consistently opposed selling off public firms in part or in whole, even as they supported a candidate who promised to dramatically shrink the role of the state in the economy. That could also leave Castello Branco's agenda vulnerable.

""A lot of people who voted for (Bolsonaro) didn't agree with his ideas,"" said Henrique, the union leader. ""Next year there will be a big movement to confront the privatizations - specifically with Petrobras.""

The unit, China Tobacco International, is primarily responsible for buying overseas tobacco leaf from countries like Brazil and Canada and sell them to Chinese manufacturers. The international unit only accounts for “a tiny portion” of China National Tobacco’s overall business, according to reports.
Citing an unnamed source, Reuters reported that the listing would raise about $100 million for the unit. The company’s listing document did not give details of how many shares would be issued, or when the listing would take place.
This comes as an unexpected move as the Chinese government is piling more pressure to reduce smoking in public space.
The unit recorded a profit of HK$222.3 million ($28.4 million) for the first nine months ended in September.

409,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2019 01:53AM ET</span>",Apple cuts sales forecast as China sales weaken; iPhone pricing in focus,"By Stephen Nellis, Munsif Vengattil and Adam Jourdan
SAN FRANCISCO/BENGALURU/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Wednesday took the rare step of cutting its quarterly sales forecast, with Chief Executive Tim Cook blaming slowing iPhone sales in China, whose economy has been dragged down by uncertainty around U.S.-China trade relations.
The news, which comes as a spotlight grows on Beijing's attempts to revive stalling growth, sent Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) tumbling in after-hours trade, hammered Asian suppliers and triggered a broader selloff in global markets.
The revenue drop for the just-ended quarter underscores how an economic slowdown in China has been sharper than many expected, catching companies and leaders in Beijing off balance and forcing some to readjust their plans in the market.
""While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a letter to investors.
Apple finds itself in a tricky position in China, a key market for sales and where it manufactures the bulk of the iconic products it sells worldwide, after the high-profile arrest in Canada of the CFO of domestic rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL].
Since the arrest last month, at the request of the United States, there have been sporadic reports of Chinese consumers shying away from Apple products. Even before then, local rivals like Huawei had been gaining market share over Apple.
Cook told CNBC that Apple products have not been targeted by the Chinese government, though some consumers may have elected not to buy an iPhone or other Apple devices due to the firm being an American brand.
""The much larger issue is the slowing of the (Chinese) economy, and then the trade tension that has further pressured it,"" Cook said.
PRICE TAG
Some analysts, however, questioned the impact of Apple's own actions, such as its unyielding pursuit of high selling prices for its products.
""Apple sales in China have not been doing well for a few quarters now, part of the reason is that their price points have gone too high - past the $1,000 mark,"" said Kiranjeet Kaur, an analyst at market research firm IDC.
""(That's) almost three times as expensive as phones from other vendors that are filling the mass market.""
China's smartphone market has dropped sharply this year, with Apple and South Korean rival Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd leading the fall, even as some domestic peers have performed more strongly.
(Apple, Samsung lead China smartphone drop: https://tmsnrt.rs/2PdBGNw)
Samsung said last month it would cease operations at one of its mobile phone manufacturing plants in China, after seeing its share of the Chinese market drop to 1 percent in the first quarter of 2018 versus 15 percent in mid-2013.
FORECAST CUT
Apple on Wednesday lowered its forecast to $84 billion in revenue for its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 29, below analysts' estimate of $91.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Apple originally forecast revenue of between $89 billion and $93 billion.
This marked the first time Apple had issued a warning on its revenue guidance ahead of releasing quarterly results since the iPhone was launched in 2007.
Apple shares skidded 7.7 percent in after-hours trade, dragging the company's market value below $700 billion. In the broader market, the S&P 500 futures fell 1.5 percent. In the U.S. government bond market, a typical safe-haven, the yield on the benchmark 10-year, which moves inversely to the bond's price, sank to an 11-month low.
PRECURSORS TO A WARNING
Apple's move was not entirely a surprise. In November, the Cupertino, California-based company said it would quit disclosing unit sales data for iPhones and other hardware items, leading many analysts to worry that a drop in iPhone sales was coming. And after several component makers in November forecast weaker-than-expected sales, some market watchers called the peak for iPhones in several key markets.
In November, Cook cited slowing growth in emerging markets such as Brazil, India and Russia for lower-than-anticipated sales estimates for the company's fiscal first quarter. But Cook specifically said he ""would not put China in that category"" of countries with troubled growth.
That all came before the damage to the Chinese economy from trade tensions with the United States and long-simmering structural issues became evident.
Apple is now the highest-profile multinational corporation to warn that the economic slowdown in China could hurt its business. Automakers such as Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Hyundai Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co Ltd all previously said they planned to cut production in the country.
But Apple has held firm on its premium pricing strategy in China despite the risk of a slower economy.
""The question for investors will be the extent to which Apple's aggressive pricing has exacerbated this situation and what this means for the company's longer-term pricing power within its iPhone franchise,"" James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, told Reuters.
In the latest fiscal year, ended Sept. 29, unit sales of the iPhone were essentially flat from the prior year, while iPhone revenue expanded 18 percent to $166.7 billion. That growth came entirely from higher prices.
Hal Eddins, chief economist at Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said Cook's comments on the impact of the U.S. trade tensions with China ""might be a dig at (U.S. President Donald) Trump, but mostly he may be using the trade turmoil as an excuse for some missteps they've made over the last year.""
But some investors were heartened by Apple's plans on using its cash pile.
In his letter, Cook said Apple has $130 billion in net cash and that it intends to continue its efforts to reduce that cash balance to net zero, which the company has so far accomplished through dividend increases and share buybacks.

""We would anticipate the company increasing share buybacks on the weakness to return capital to shareholders at discount prices,"" said Trip Miller, managing partner at Apple shareholder Gullane Capital Partners.

The smartphone maker, which pinned its reduced revenue outlook on a slowdown in the country, joins a growing list of companies struggling as a trade war with the U.S. and an equity selloff weigh on the world’s second-largest economy.
Here are other prominent companies now finding it harder to sell everything from cars to takeaway coffee in China:
FedEx
The U.S. delivery giant slashed its profit forecast in late December -- just three months after raising it. While FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX).’s woes weren’t limited to China, the company cited trade tensions, especially between the U.S. and China, among its troubles. FedEx Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith said most of the problems he faced were due to “bad political choices.”
Starbucks
The coffee behemoth opens a new store in China every few hours and expects it to become the company’s largest market. But last month,  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). said sales growth in China could be as low as 1 percent in the long term. That’s slower than the 3 percent to 4 percent growth seen for the U.S. and the rest of the world. It’s not clear how much China’s economy or trade tensions are to blame -- or if China is just losing its taste for caffeine.
Tiffany’s
China’s economic woes are more of a headache for the jeweler outside the country than inside. In November, Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF). reported weaker-than-expected sales and highlighted a “clear pattern” of Chinese shoppers cutting back on spending when they’re overseas. It’s a trend first highlighted by Louis Vuitton owner LVMH in October as Chinese officials cracked down on travelers returning home with undeclared goods in a bid to encourage local consumption instead.
 Daimler 
The German maker of Mercedes cars was among the first global brands to blame escalating trade tensions when it warned in June that retaliatory tariffs in China on car imports from the U.S. would hit sales on the mainland. Daimler AG (DE:DAIGn) cut its profit a second time in October -- but didn’t single out the trade war as a culprit. Jaguar Land Rover and BMW AG have since weighed in, saying they’ve been hit by sinking demand in China.

With the hashtags ""Promisemadepromisekept"" and ""lessonlearnt"" the carrier said it would maintain the economy fares. 
The fares were not available on Cathay's website on Thursday.
Online flight blogs and forums have been active with discussion on the deals since the error, with posts wagering on whether Cathay would honor the ticket fares. 
Flyer Talk Evangelist wrote ""Nobody here has noticed the hot mistake fare? ... Has been going on for hours. Wanna bet on the odd CX would honor this?""
The ticketing error caps a tough year for Cathay. The carrier has come under mounting criticism after it said in October that about 9.4 million passengers' personal data had been accessed without authorization, seven months after it became aware of the breach.

The airline said it has spent over HK$1 billion ($127.7 million) on IT infrastructure and security over the past three years.

Blake Nordstrom passed away unexpectedly, the department store chain said, less than a month after being diagnosed with lymphoma.
He had been co-president of the department chain along with his brothers Pete and Erik since May 2015.
Blake, along with his brothers, was heir to the sprawling retail business founded in 1901 by his great-grandfather John Nordstrom, a Swedish immigrant.

Blake's tenure as co-president involved an attempt to take the company private in 2017 as it struggled with an industry-wide sales slowdown.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street edged higher on Wednesday after stumbling out of the starting gate on the first trading day of 2019, while fears of a global economic slowdown were exacerbated after Apple cut its holiday-quarter revenue forecast.
Apple (O:AAPL) dropped 8 percent in extended trading late in the day after the iPhone maker slashed its outlook for the December quarter, blaming weak demand in China.
Shares of Apple's suppliers also fell, and S&P 500 futures  dropped 1.3 percent, signaling that Wednesday's modest advance could unwind when the market reopens on Thursday.
""To see Apple's sales drop off this much says something about the Chinese economy,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""Any company that does business in China will feel the impact of this."" 
Stocks had started the session lower after separate reports showed a deceleration in factory activity in China and the euro zone, indicating the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China was taking a toll on global manufacturing.
Energy (SPNY) stocks led the S&P 500's advance and the sector was the index's biggest percentage gainer, buoyed by a 2.4 percent jump in crude prices. The group was the worst performing S&P sector in 2018. 
Gains were offset by healthcare (SPXHC) and so-called defensive sectors, such as real estate <.SPLRCR>, utilities (SPLRCU) and consumer staples (SPLRCS). Healthcare companies provided the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Dow. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 18.78 points, or 0.08 percent, to 23,346.24, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 3.18 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,510.03 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 30.66 points, or 0.46 percent, to 6,665.94.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, seven closed in positive territory. 
Banks got a boost from  Barclays  (LON:BARC), as the broker wrote in a research note that the sector could outperform the S&P this year. The Dow Jones Industrial average was led higher with gains from Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and JPMorgan (N:JPM). 
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) delivered fewer-than-expected Model 3 sedans in the fourth quarter and cut U.S. prices. The electric automaker's shares slid 6.8 percent. 
 General Electric  Co (N:GE) jumped 6.3 percent in heavy trading as bargain hunters bought the stock in the wake of its over 50-percent plunge in 2018.
In the coming weeks, the fourth-quarter reporting period will get underway. Analysts see S&P 500 companies posting profit gains of 15.8 percent, significantly smaller than the third quarter's 28.4 percent advance.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.42-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 9 new highs and 58 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.80 billion shares, compared to the 9.18 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

420,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2019 07:45PM ET</span>",Apple's warning a bad omen for Wall Street bulls,"By Noel Randewich and April Joyner
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple's (O:AAPL) warning on Wednesday about weak iPhone demand in the holiday quarter is a gloomy omen for Wall Street bulls hoping for an early gift in 2019 following December's steep selloff. 
After the bell, the Cupertino, California company cut its sales forecast for its quarter ending in December, citing slowing iPhone sales in China.
That sent its stock down 7.5 percent after hours and knocked 1.3 percent off S&P 500 futures, suggesting the market was set to open weaker on Thursday as already skittish investors reconsider their earnings expectations for U.S. multinationals. 
""People are looking for a January rally effect as they place bets for the new year. Apple puts a bit of a sour tone on that,"" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager of Synovus Trust Co. ""It raises concerns about whether current estimates for the quarter are too high.""
Including its after-hours drop on Wednesday, Apple's stock market value has tumbled to below $700 billion from over $1.1 trillion at its peak in October. Although it has fallen behind Amazon (O:AMZN) and Microsoft (O:MSFT) in value, Apple remains one of Wall Street's most widely-held companies, and its warning will affect sentiment across the stock market. 
Following the S&P 500's worst December performance since the Great Depression, many investors this week returned from holidays optimistic that a correction that started last September may have run its course. The S&P 500 (SPX) on Wednesday was up nearly 7 percent over five sessions from its recent low on Dec. 24.
Apple's revised fiscal first-quarter revenue estimate of $84 billion was nearly 12 percent short of the average analyst estimate, even after recent warnings about slow demand from iPhone component suppliers Skyworks Solutions (O:SWKS) and Qorvo (O:QRVO). 
With the S&P 500 recently trading at 14 times expected earnings, down from 18 times a year ago, a key argument for Wall Street bulls is that the stock market has become undervalued after its recent sell-off. But if Apple's warning is followed by many more, the S&P 500 may appear less of a bargain at current levels. 
Analysts on average expect S&P 500 companies to increase their earnings per share by nearly 7 percent this year, far below their expectations of 24 percent EPS growth for 2018, according to the most recent estimate from Refinitiv's IBES. At the start of October, analysts had been forecasting 10 percent EPS growth for 2019.

Tech sector profit growth, a whopping 29 percent in the third quarter, is expected to slow to 12 percent for the fourth quarter and to dwindle to just 2 percent in the first quarter of 2019, according to the most recent IBES data.

421,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2019 07:35PM ET</span>",Mexico airport trust calls shareholder meeting on early payment plan,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - An investment trust created to help fund a now-canceled Mexico City airport project said on Wednesday it will call for a shareholders meeting to approve a government plan to buy back shares ahead of schedule.
The trust said in a statement to the Mexican stock exchange that the government-run Mexico City Airport Group (GACM) had resolved to make the early repayment of the preferred shares that back trust certificates issued earlier this year. 
The statement said GACM's plan would be put to a shareholder vote in a meeting to be called in early January. 
That could represent a first step in allowing investors in the certificates linked to the ditched project to get at least some of their money back.
However, it was not immediately clear how the plan could affect the 30 billion pesos ($1.54 billion) of trust certificates known as FNAIM that were issued last March, mostly to Mexican investors.
Representatives at the airport group and Mexico's Finance Ministry declined to comment.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is scrapping the partially-built $13 billion airport. Lopez Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1, has long argued the project was tainted by corruption and too expensive. He said last month that construction to convert a military airstrip into a commercial airport will begin in January.
He was able to move forward with the cancellation after bondholders agreed to sell back $1.8 billion of $6 billion worth of debt issued for the project.
The trust certificates are a type of Mexican investment vehicle known as ""Fibra E"" that were designed to allow local pension funds to boost infrastructure and energy investments. 
Funds controlled by the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, including pension fund Afore Inbursa, snatched up around 13 billion pesos of the trust certificates, according to people involved in the deal.
Slim's construction business has been one of the biggest winners of work for the airport.
Lopez Obrador's move to ditch the country's largest infrastructure project touched off a major sell-off in Mexican assets.
The airport Fibra was issued as Lopez Obrador was already threatening to cancel the airport if he won election, and its placement has made canceling the project more complex by involving more private investors.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) hit 200,000 total electric vehicles sold in the United States by the end of 2018, reaching a threshold that triggers a phase-out of a $7,500 federal tax credit over the next 15 months, a person briefed on the matter said Wednesday.
The largest U.S. automaker reached the figure in the fourth quarter of 2018, which means the credit will fall to $3,750 in April, and then drop to $1,875 in October for six months. The credit will completely disappear by April 2020. The 200,000 figure covers GM's cumulative EV sales since 2010.
The tax credit is aimed at defraying the cost of electric vehicles that are more expensive than similarly sized internal combustion engine vehicles. In 2009, Congress set the phase-out threshold at 200,000 vehicles per manufacturer.
GM, which said previously it expected to reach the 200,000 sales figure before the end of 2018, declined to comment ahead of the release of its quarterly sales results on Thursday.
GM and Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), which hit the 200,000 figure in July 2018, have both lobbied Congress to lift the cap or extend the existing tax credit. Tesla's EV tax credit fell to $3,750 on Tuesday and Tesla said it was cutting prices on its EVs by $2,000 to partially offset the lower tax credit.
In March, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra called on Congress to expand the consumer tax credit for electric vehicles as the company boosted production of the EV Bolt in response to consumer demand. She repeated the request last month during a visit to Capitol Hill.
GM said in November it was doubling resources allocated to developing electric and self-driving vehicles as part of a significant restructuring that includes ending production at five North American plants. GM also announced it would halt production of the plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt by March.
In November, a congressional report said 57,066 taxpayers claimed $375 million in EV tax credits in 2016. Congress estimates the cost of the EV tax credit at $7.5 billion between the 2018 and 2022 fiscal years.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The new Barrick Gold Corp is considering options for its stake in Acacia Mining PLC including possible sale, as Barrick works to end a nearly two-year-long tax dispute in Tanzania that has effectively shuttered operations there, Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow said on Wednesday.
The new Barrick, which began trading on Wednesday following its merger with  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS), holds a 64 percent stake in Acacia, which has not been able to export gold during the tax row. 
Bristow expressed confidence that the conflict, which began when the Tanzanian government slapped Acacia with a $190 billion tax bill in March 2017, would be resolved. 
""This has been a very complex and challenging situation where no one has won. It's untenable and will be resolved,"" said Bristow, who previously led Randgold.
Under an October 2017 framework pact that has yet to be implemented, Barrick Executive Chairman John Thornton and Tanzanian President John Magufuli agreed that Acacia would pay the government $300 million and 16 percent ownership and split the economic benefits of its mines.
Barrick could buy out the rest of Acacia that it does not already own, or it could split up the company, among other options, Bristow said in a phone interview with Reuters.
""This conflict has destroyed lots of value. We need to make sure there's enough value to work out a solution that various interested and affected parties get something that's fair and proper for them,"" he said, adding the company would provide more information in the second week of February.
Barrick in September agreed to buy Randgold in an all-stock deal valuing the Africa-focused miner at $6.5 billion. It was the biggest transaction in years in the gold mining industry, which is under investor pressure to cut costs and better manage capital.
Bristow plans to follow Randgold's strategy of deploying most of its staff at mine sites rather than centralized offices, giving local staff more autonomy as part of a new approach to slash bureaucracy and boost returns in the face of a sagging gold sector.
""When you're right there in the thick of things, your decisions are immediate,"" said Bristow, who previously led Randgold. ""If you're in a fathead office far away, your ability to even understand the situation is retarded."" 
Barrick shares fell 3.1 percent in New York on Wednesday, compared with slight rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Gold prices also rose on Wednesday.
Across the new company, Bristow said his focus will be on making sure Barrick automates and streamlines both operations and management. 
For instance, he said, Barrick will take a page from Randgold's use of one shared processing facility for three of its mines in Mali by doing the same in Nevada, where Barrick owns two mines. 
Bristow said his vision for a leaner Barrick has the support of legacy leaders from both Randgold and the original Barrick.
The company also wants to attract younger, more tech-savvy talent drawn to more hands-on work, Bristow said. 

The new Barrick will adopt Randgold's strategy of using contractors to do jobs the company doesn't have the skills for, Bristow said. The company also plans to retain ownership of its mines and ores, he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Weak Chinese and European economic data weighed on stocks around the world and boosted safe-haven Treasuries and the Japanese yen on Wednesday, though Wall Street shares edged higher as investors took advantage of cheaper shares to ring in the new year.
Chinese factory activity contracted for the first time in more than two years, according to a private survey.
The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the euro zone also reached its lowest level since February 2016, and France's PMI fell in December for the first time in two years. Concerns about the flagging global economy contributed to U.S. stocks posting a loss in 2018 for the first time in a decade.
The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index dropped as much as 1.6 percent on the data, but later moved higher in choppy trading and ended up 0.13 percent.
Bank and energy shares, which have been especially hard-hit in recent sell-offs, were among the biggest gainers. But while cyclical stocks rose, defensive shares fell.
Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta, said that divergence was likely driven by investors' seeking to rebalance their portfolios by looking for undervalued stocks
""It's a normal shifting in position, regardless of the data today,"" Lerner said. ""We're seeing a 'January effect' on areas of the market that have sold hard.""
Energy shares also benefited from a jump in oil prices, which climbed as U.S. stocks recovered.
(GRAPHIC: How global markets did in 2018 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ss8qjS) 
MSCI's gauge of stocks around the globe ended 0.26 percent lower, as did Asian markets and the pan-European STOXX 600.
Reflecting lingering investor nervousness, yields on U.S. 10-year Treasury notes fell, hitting an 11-month low. However, the boost in oil prices pushed up yields on short-dated maturities, flattening the yield curve. An inverted yield curve is widely seen as an indicator of a future recession. 
""The yield curve is signaling that something is wrong,"" said Matt Miskin, market strategist at John Hancock Investments in Boston. ""The underlying economic data continues to suggest a slowdown.""
The safe-haven Japanese yen reached a seven-month high against the dollar.
Yet the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, advanced 0.7 percent as the euro (EUR=) and sterling  fell more than 1 percent. The euro sank as a result of weak European manufacturing data, while concerns about Brexit negotiations weighed on sterling.

For its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 29, the tech giant now expects revenue of about $84 billion. That’s well below analysts’ consensus estimates of $91.36 billion.
Apple originally forecast a revenue of between $89 billion and $93 billion.
The stock fell 7.5% after hours and should pull down futures and the Dow at the Wall Street open.
Apple blamed lower-than-anticipated iPhone revenue and upgrades, something the sell side has been concerned about lately, and weakness in emerging markets.
A slew of brokerages had reduced their first-quarter production estimates for iPhones after several makers forecast weaker-than-expected sales, leading some market watchers to call the peak for iPhones in several key markets.
""While Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be,"" CEO Tim Cook said in the letter to investors.
""(M)ost of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad,"" Cook said.
Apple predicts quarterly gross margin of 38% and operating expenses of $8.7 billion.

The S&P 500 rose 0.13% and the Dow edged up 0.08%. The Nasdaq Composite was the highlight, gaining 0.46%.
""We had a lousy quarter and the negative returns for the year,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management. ""However, we could see a more friendly Fed than what we had last year and we could see some movement on the trade talks.""
The day started on a weak note after news that China’s Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) contracted for the first time in 19 months in December.
Among active stocks, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) plunged nearly 7%. The electric automaker delivered fewer-than-expected Model 3 sedans in the fourth quarter and cut U.S. vehicle prices.
Meanwhile, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was about flat after volatile trading. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey said the streaming giant added fewer subscribers than expected last quarter and lowered its price target to $355 a share from $410 a share. But the company also confirmed it is hiring Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ:ATVI) former chief financial officer.
And GE (NYSE:GE) rose more than 6% in a January-effect move, as investors looked for solid stocks at rock-bottom prices. GE was down more than 50% last year.
In the coming weeks, the fourth-quarter reporting period will be underway. Analysts see S&P 500 companies posting profit gains of 15.8%, significantly smaller than the third quarter's 28.4% advance.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. banking system has strong capital and liquidity and is well-positioned to manage more adverse market conditions, a spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said on Wednesday.
In a statement to Reuters, Bryan Hubbard said the banking regulator was monitoring the effects of falling stock markets on the nearly 1,300 institutions it oversees and would share any relevant systemic information with fellow supervisors through the appropriate interagency forums. 
U.S. stocks posted a loss in 2018 for the first time in a decade due to fears over a weakening global economy and the U.S.-China trade war, sparking fears turmoil could spread to other parts of the financial system.
""The federal banking system ... is strong with capital and liquidity near historical highs and improved earnings and risk management. From this strength, the federal banking system is well positioned to manage more adverse market conditions,"" Hubbard said in the statement. 
He added that OCC expects supervised institutions to understand exposures within their portfolios and take appropriate action to mitigate any risks. These could include adverse effects on liquidity, pricing, or terms for corporate loans and bonds, he said.
On Wednesday, U.S. indexes started the new year down more than 1 percent, although by early afternoon they had inched into positive territory.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google unit won approval from U.S. regulators to deploy a radar-based motion sensing device known as Project Soli.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said in an order late on Monday that it would grant Google a waiver to operate the Soli sensors at higher power levels than currently allowed. The FCC said the sensors can also be operated aboard aircraft. 
The FCC said the decision ""will serve the public interest by providing for innovative device control features using touchless hand gesture technology.""
A Google spokeswoman did not immediately comment on Wednesday.
Google said in documents filed with the FCC that the effort emerged from the work of Google’s Advanced Technology and Projects group that focuses on development of mobile technologies.
The FCC said the Soli sensor captures motion in a three-dimensional space using a radar beam to enable touchless control of functions or features that can benefit users with mobility or speech impairments.
Google says the sensor can allow users to press an invisible button between the thumb and index fingers or a virtual dial that turns by rubbing a thumb against the index finger. In a video on its website, Google said a user could operate a smart watch, scroll through music or adjust the volume by simply motioning using the system.
Google added that the radar signal could penetrate fabrics, enabling controls that could work in a pocket or a backpack.
The company says that ""even though these controls are virtual, the interactions feel physical and responsive"" as feedback is generated by the haptic sensation of fingers touching.
Google says the virtual tools can approximate the precision of natural human hand motion and the sensor can be embedded in wearables, phones, computers and vehicles.
In March, Google asked the FCC to allow its short-range interactive motion sensing Soli radar to operate in the 57- to 64-GHz frequency band at power levels consistent with European Telecommunications Standards Institute standards.
 Facebook Inc  (O:FB) raised concerns with the FCC that the Soli sensors operating in the spectrum band at higher power levels might have issues coexisting with other technologies.
After discussions, Google and Facebook jointly told the FCC in September that they agreed the sensors could operate at higher than currently allowed power levels without interference but at lower levels than previously proposed by Google.
The company told the FCC that without the higher power levels that field testing showed blind spots could occur close to the sensor location.
Facebook told the FCC in September that it expected a ""variety of use cases to develop with respect to new radar devices, including Soli.""

The Soli devices can be operated aboard aircraft but must still comply with Federal Aviation Administration rules governing portable electronic devices.

450,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2019 02:48PM ET</span>",Drug companies greet 2019 with U.S. price hikes,"By Michael Erman
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugmakers kicked off 2019 with price increases in the United States on more than 250 prescription drugs, including the world's top-selling medicine, Humira, although the pace of price hikes was slower than last year.
The industry has been under pressure by the U.S. President Donald Trump to hold their prices level as his administration works on plans aimed at lowering the costs of medications for consumers in the world's most expensive pharmaceutical market.
During a White House meeting with members of his Cabinet, U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he expected to see a tremendous decrease in drug prices. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar was at the meeting.
The overall number of price increases was down by around a third from last year, when drugmakers raised prices on more than 400 medicines, according to data provided by Rx Savings Solutions, which helps health plans and employers seek lower cost prescription medicines. 
Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc was particularly aggressive. It raised list prices on more than 50 drugs, and more than half of those by 9.5 percent, according to the Rx Savings data 
 AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) increased by 6.2 percent the list price of its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira, which is on pace to record about $20 billion in sales in 2018.
Allergan said in a statement that its average list price increase across its portfolio is around 3.8 percent this year. It said it does not expect to realize any net benefit from the increases this year because of higher rebates and discounts it expects to make to payers.
AbbVie did not immediately respond to request for comment.
More price increases are expected this month. Reuters reported late last year that nearly 30 drugmakers had notified California agencies they plan to raise list prices of their drugs. Not all of those increases have been announced yet.
The United States, which leaves drug pricing to market competition, has higher prices than in other countries where governments directly or indirectly control the costs, making it the world's most lucrative market for manufacturers.
HHS has proposed policy changes aimed at lowering drug prices and passing more of the discounts negotiated by health insurers on to patients. Those measures are not expected to provide relief to consumers in the short-term, however, and fall short of giving government health agencies direct authority to negotiate or regulate drug prices.
""It's business as usual"" for drugmakers, said Rx Savings Solutions Chief Executive Michael Rea, who said he believes there has to be meaningful changes to the marketplace, rather than new regulations in order for drug prices to drop.

477,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2019 12:03PM ET</span>","European shares start 2019 shakilyas China, EU figures deepen gloom","By Julien Ponthus and Josephine Mason
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares lost further ground in their first trading day of 2019 on Wednesday as fears about global growth, trade wars and political instability rolled over into the new year while investors sought safety in stocks considered less risky.
While sentiment had already been hit by disappointing data from China, fresh surveys showed Euro zone manufacturing activity barely expanded at the end of 2018 in a broad-based slowdown.
Euro zone stocks (STOXXE) ended down just 0.3 percent and the pan European STOXX 600 (STOXX) closed 0.2 percent lower after trimming earlier heavy losses as Wall Street turned positive. 
Paris (FCHI) notched up the biggest drop, down 1 percent, while Frankfurt, Madrid and Milan all managed to move back into positive territory by the close.
Turnover on the STOXX 600 was extremely low, though - with just 75 percent of the 90-day average daily volume traded - as many investors remained on holiday.
""Investors are still cautious about the outlook for the second largest economy in the world,"" said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK.
""China has been undergoing an economic slowdown for years, and the manufacturing report underlined the point that the second largest economy in the world is cooling."" 
Some analysts drew comfort from the tentative turnaround in market fortunes on the day as investors tried to put 2018 - which saw the worst stock market performance in a decade - behind them.
""Bruised by the volatility of Q4 2018, investors aren't yet grabbing the chance to buy the dip with both hands, but it is at least encouraging to see a continuation of the move higher instead of the relentless selling of the past few weeks,"" said IG chief market analyst Chris Beauchamp. 
Still, the laggards of 2018 took some of the biggest hits. Miners, autos and banks fell, and investors dumped the cyclical parts of the market most exposed to a slowing global economy.
The basic resources sector (SXPP) was the weakest performer, dropping 1.8 percent, while autos and parts stocks fell 1.5 percent.
Among individual moves, medical equipment maker Gerresheimer (DE:GXIG) dropped 5.8 percent to its lowest since July 2015 after JP Morgan cut its rating on the stock to ""underweight"", according to traders.
Bargain hunting in crude futures helped heavyweight oil stocks (SXEP) reverse earlier losses to rise 1.1 percent on the day, while defensive stocks popular in times of economic strife - healthcare, utilities and telecom - were in favor.
In Italy, market watchdog Consob suspended trading in shares of Banca Carige (MI:CRGI) while the European Central Bank appointed temporary administrators in a bid to save the struggling lender after it failed to raise capital late last year. 

The Italian banking sector (FTIT8300) was down 1.1 percent.

Prosecutors investigated Kengeter after he purchased Deutsche Boerse shares worth 4.5 million euros in December 2015 as part of a management remuneration plan awarded only two months before the German company announced it was in talks to combine with  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE).
Frankfurt prosecutors had sought to establish whether the share purchase constituted share trading by someone privy to insider information.
Deutsche Boerse has denied wrongdoing and a spokesman for Kengeter, who has not been charged with any crime, reiterated that the former CEO denies wrongdoing.
Kengeter resigned from his post in October 2017, with the company saying the decision was to allow management to focus on business rather the investigation.
The Frankfurt prosecutor's office on Wednesday said the case had been dropped in exchange for a 250,000 euro charitable donation. A further 4.5 million euro payment equivalent to the value of Kengeter's stock purchase was confiscated by a Frankfurt court.
Last month Deutsche Boerse said it would pay a 10.5 million euro fine to resolve the case and that investigation of Kengeter had been dropped.
The exchange operator said the allegations were unfounded but it had concluded that resolution of the caser on this basis was in the best interest of the company.

502,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 02, 2019 09:50AM ET</span>",Treasuries Join Global Rally in Bonds as Economic Outlook Sours,"(Bloomberg) -- Benchmark Treasury yields dropped to the lowest level in almost a year as investors scrambled to seek the safety of government bonds on concern the global economy could be stalling.
The difference between the yields on 10- and two-year debt narrowed as signs growth may be slowing in China spurred demand for longer maturities. Meanwhile, the yield on Germany’s benchmark notes fell the most since May after manufacturing sectors in Italy and France shrank.
“Markets are running in fear of an economic slowdown, so now any signs of a U.S. or wider global slowdown are seen as a negative,” said Jason Simpson, a rates strategist at Societe Generale . “On that front many of the PMIs have not been great -- Italy and France are both below 50 -- so this is feeding the risk-off market sentiment.”
The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell as much as four basis points to 2.65 percent, the lowest since Jan. 26. The move follows a tumultuous December that saw more than 30 basis points wiped off the 10-year rate amid a sell-off in stocks, holiday-thinned trading and a repricing of expectations around Federal Reserve interest-rate increases.
BMO strategists led by Ian Lyngen said in a note Wednesday that their present concerns are centered on the question of “whether or not the bond rally has gone too far, too fast.” While they are constructive on Treasuries for 2019 and are on board with the idea that the Fed might struggle to keep hiking rates, “the low liquidity offered during the holiday trading period introduces a degree of apprehension” regarding the sustainability of the move, they wrote.
Yields on 10-year German bonds dropped as much as nine basis points to 0.15 percent, the lowest since November 2016, while those on gilts fell as low as 1.18 percent, down almost 10 basis points. Most European stock indexes slid as investors returned from holidays.
It’s too early to know if this move signals a trend toward even lower core yields in early 2019 given a wave of planned bond selling by European governments is due in coming weeks, said Martin van Vliet, a senior interest-rate strategist at ING Groep.
Spain, Germany and the U.K. are among those set to offer debt to investors in the next week, with Barclays estimating issuance at 28 billion euros ($32 billion).

The market had its worst years in a decade in 2018. The decline was set to continue after factory data from China showed a contraction for the first time in 19 months.
""Investors are clearly concerned about the growth in 2019 and the lack of confidence is keeping them on the sidelines or they are feeling safer by parking their capital in risk-off assets,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK.
The U.S. government shutdown also drew on for the 12th day. Congress is expected to reconvene on Wednesday, but there are no clear signs that the shutdown will end anytime soon. A tweet from U.S. President Donald Trump late on Tuesday suggested he could be open to deal.

527,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2019 08:32AM ET</span>",Bill Gates' nuclear venture hits snag amid U.S. restrictions on China deals: WSJ,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - TerraPower LLC, a nuclear energy venture chaired by  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates, is seeking a new partner for early-stage trials of its technology after new U.S. rules forced it to abandon an agreement with China, company officials told the Wall Street Journal. 
TerraPower reached an agreement with state-owned China National Nuclear Corp in 2017 to build an experimental nuclear reactor south of Beijing. But Gates wrote in an essay published late last week that TerraPower is unlikely to follow through on its plans in the face of new U.S. restrictions on technology deals with China. 
The Bellevue, Washington-based company is now unsure which country it will work with to conduct trials of its technology, which is designed to use depleted uranium as fuel for nuclear reactors in a bid to improve safety and costs, company officials told the Journal. 
“We’re regrouping,” Chief Executive Chris Levesque told the Journal in an interview. “Maybe we can find another partner.”
The U.S. Department of Energy in October announced new restrictions on nuclear deals with China, in keeping with a broader plan by the Trump administration to limit China's ability to access U.S-made technologies it considers to be of strategic importance. 

Gates, who co-founded TerraPower, said in his essay that regulations in the United States are currently too restrictive to allow the reactor prototype to be built domestically.

549,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 02, 2019 06:48AM ET</span>",Key Fed Yield Gauge Points to Rate Cuts for First Time Since 2008,"(Bloomberg) -- A market indicator watched by the Fed as one of the most accurate gauges of economic health is pricing in lower rates for the first time in more than a decade.
The little-known near-term forward spread, which reflects the difference between the forward rate implied by Treasury bills six quarters from now and the current three-month yield, fell to -0.0653 basis point on Wednesday.
It was the first time since March 2008 the gauge -- seen as a proxy for traders’ outlook on Federal Reserve policy -- fell below zero.
Crossing the threshold indicates the market sees easier policy and recession in “the next several quarters,” economists at the U.S. central bank wrote in a research paper dated July 2018.
“When negative, it indicates market participants expect monetary policy to ease, presumably because they expect monetary policymakers to respond to the threat or onset of a recession,” Eric C. Engstrom and Steven A. Sharpe wrote. “When market participants expected -- and priced in -- a monetary policy easing over the next 18 months, their fears were validated more often than not.”
Money markets have been paring back expectations of rate hikes as economic data weaken and equities whipsaw. Last week, traders priced in no move in the Federal Funds rate this year and more than a 50 percent chance of a rate cut in 2020.
In their paper, the Fed economists said the gauge had more predictive power than other long-term spreads, such as the differential between two- and 10-year Treasury bonds.
Still, some investors including Manoj Hemrajani, manager of the Macroscope hedge fund, prefer to take their cues from the latter. Hemrajani said he anticipates it will turn negative in 2019.
“That’s a more visible spread to investors,” he said. “And it’s not one an investor needs to compute, unlike the one the Fed paper mentions.”

552,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2019 06:10AM ET</span>",Big claims strain senior living market for U.S. insurers,"By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - Last March, a 103-year-old resident of a Sunrise Senior Living facility in Willowbrook, Illinois, went on a field trip to the movies.  Ruth Smith, who used a walker, fell down two concrete steps in the theater and died about six weeks later. Now Smith's estate is suing Sunrise, saying that aides did not properly watch her.
As the U.S. society ages, senior living communities are on the rise. So are claims and lawsuits against them. And when they lose, it is usually down to insurers to pay up.
""It's a tremendous opportunity that has pretty specific challenges,"" said Brendan Gallagher, who heads the senior care business at insurance broker Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (N:AJG)
Some senior living facilities could see insurance rate hikes in 2019 as high as 30 percent, according to insurance broker Willis Towers Watson. (O:WLTW)
Fewer insurers are offering coverage today than they were five years ago and some Lloyd's of London members stopped writing the coverage during the past year, said John Atkinson, managing partner at Willis. 
Some insurers are dropping coverage of those communities entirely while others are avoiding litigious locations such as Kentucky, Illinois and Florida, said insurers and brokers.
While the pullback threatens to raise costs for families, other insurers are expanding, betting on the industry's strong growth prospects. 
The number of people living in U.S. residential care facilities has grown by over 10 percent to 812,000 between 2010 and 2016, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
As the industry gears up for the arrival of the greying 74-million baby boom generation, senior living facilities have grown even faster. The number of rooms in those centers has risen up by a fifth since 2013, according to the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care (NIC), which collects data for the 99 largest U.S. metro areas. 
While aging is a global phenomenon and the U.S. society is relatively younger than those in Europe and north Asia, its greater dependence on senior centers confronts it with challenges other nations may yet have to grapple with.
More so than previous U.S. generations, today's elderly often live far away from their children. In Europe, seniors tend to live much closer to their relatives or in communities that provide generous government services for the elderly. In many Asian and African communities, multiple generations commonly live together.
Not only do more people move into retirement communities, but they tend to do it later than they used to, resulting in more frequent and severe injuries, insurance professionals say. 
""People are living longer and they are more frail,"" said Gloria Holland, vice president of finance at  Capital Senior Living Corp  (N:CSU), a Dallas-based company that runs 129 communities across the country.
A spokeswoman for Sunrise Assisted Living, where Smith lived, said the company had policies and procedures in place to help promote resident safety. ""Anytime we lose a member of our community we are deeply saddened,"" she said. 
Falls are the biggest risk. Allegations of falls account for nearly half of all assisted living claims that insurer CNA Financial Group (N:CNA) closed in 2016 and 2017, the company said. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2GzYrHM) 
Another source of insurance claims are ""memory care"" centers, which cater to people with Alzheimer's disease and other types of memory problems. 
The nascent sector has grown 52 percent since 2013, according to NIC. A big issue there: residents who wander away.
Last year, the body of 77-year-old Audrey Penn was found in a ditch after she left a senior living community in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  A lawsuit filed by her family settled for an undisclosed amount. 
A CHANGING AMERICA
Capital Senior Living's Holland said the average age of residents who moved to its facilities was between 78 and 80 when she joined the company in 2004 and has risen to between 82 to 84 by now. That makes individual claims more expensive to settle. The company anticipates a 5 percent rate increase when it renews its insurance in 2019, Holland said.
Higher rates and deductibles are more likely to affect smaller facilities, which may lack robust compliance programs for preventing accidents and other problems, insurers and brokers say. Smaller centers often ""struggle to keep up with changing regulations,"" said Caroline Clouser, who heads the healthcare industry practice at insurer Chubb Ltd. (N:CB)
Insurance premiums for senior facilities vary by state. Premiums for each assisted living apartment range from $150 to $600 annually, insurers and brokers say.
Insurance for those facilities makes up less than 1 percent of the $558 billion property and casualty insurers collected in net written premiums in 2017. Yet it is likely to grow as aging boomers fill up senior communities, industry insiders say.
Nationwide is among the companies that have been growing their senior living insurance business while being selective, said Jeremy Moore, senior living underwriting manager.
""You have to understand what the exposures are and the controls in place,"" he said.
Nationwide has a team of former senior living executives and administrators who visit communities and look at everything from building maintenance to evacuation procedures, Moore said.
Wisconsin-based Church Mutual Insurance Company, which writes coverage for the industry in 49 states, is planning to expand into Florida, the remaining state, in 2019, according to Jim Ketterson, who heads the insurer's senior living practice. 
Brokers are also working to help senior living communities better manage their risk. Willis recently launched a program to help facilities learn how to more safely lift residents. 
Willis also runs a webinar on active shooter events, including tips such using beds to block doors that do not lock, a common feature in memory care facilities.

Senior living companies also keep reviewing their facilities and procedures, they say. For example, Capital Senior Living is gradually replacing carpet flooring with laminate, which is less of a trip hazard, Holland said. It is also considering a technology that can help track residents' movements to determine if they are at risk of a fall.

LONDON (Reuters) - A year after new EU rules forced banks and brokers to charge investors for equity research, the pressure on small brokerages to make ends meet is becoming intense and more look set to merge or even shut up shop in 2019.
According to dozens of executives at major hedge funds, asset managers, banks and brokerages, the picture looks bleak for smaller brokers who are being undercut by large banks and face increasingly cost-conscious asset managers.
Smaller brokerages have far less clout in negotiating contracts with investors, forcing some to cut prices or research, carve out a niche with bespoke research or, in more drastic cases, team up with a rival or close.
The aim of the EU's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) was to increase transparency and ensure investors got a fairer deal, but the dominance of the big banks is also pushing some regulators to have a rethink.
""MiFID is going to have continued significant ramifications. I always felt the fourth quarter (2018) or first quarter (2019) would be when the change starts to bite,"" said Steven Fine, chief executive at mid- and small-cap broker Peel Hunt.
Before MiFID II came into force in January 2018, banks and brokerages bundled the cost of research into their overall charges for executing customer trades, or gave it away free.
Under the new EU rules, they must bill institutional investors for everything from research to meetings to conference calls, and separate research from execution fees.
Itemizing the services has caused havoc. 
U.S. bank JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) led the charge in 2017 before the rules came in by offering research subscriptions to investors for as little as $10,000 a year, a fraction of the six or seven figure sums some smaller boutique firms had hoped for. 
'MORE RADICAL'
The move roiled Europe's fragmented stockbroking sector and put pressure on rivals to follow suit or risk losing business.
One year into Europe's big experiment, data from Greenwich Associates shows 60 percent of research services are still handled by the global investment banks, suggesting they have not loosened their grip on the market since the new rules came in.
While large investment banks are more willing to fund their research teams to maintain their edge in equity capital markets, the pressure is only set to get worse for smaller rivals and the small companies they cover, executives said.
Recent merger talks between Australian investment bank Macquarie and UK broker Liberum were a sign of things to come in 2019, said Nigel Bolton, co-head of fundamental equities at BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager.
""That's the sign that brokerages and banks are saying 'now we've been trying this for a year, it's not improving, we're going to have to do something more radical'. And I think you will see that happening in 2019."" 
Market regulators in the UK and France have raised concerns about the impact of a subsequent decline in research coverage and trading liquidity for smaller firms - and may yet take action.
In an interview with the Financial Times in November, the head of the French markets watchdog, Robert Ophele, said MiFID had had ""very detrimental"" effects on research, particularly of midcap companies, and called for a review of the legislation.
The fragmented nature of the UK market means brokerages there are undergoing the biggest change, but firms in the euro zone are also under pressure.
In November, AllianceBernstein (N:AB) announced plans to buy Autonomous Research, an independent firm with offices in London, New York and Hong Kong and more than 35 analysts. 
German private bank Berenberg has laid off staff in its equities business amid pressure from MiFID II, the Financial Times reported last year.
Others, including London's Numis Corp (L:NUM) and Peel Hunt, say they are expanding research teams to fill a gap left from cutbacks by rivals.
Peel Hunt's Fine says he won't budge on the prices his company charges, and expects the impact of the loss of some research clients to be cushioned by revenues elsewhere in the business, including corporate finance.
Still, pressure on research prices may be here to stay, with asset managers in a strong bargaining position. 
Finding it hard to charge the bill to investors, most asset managers are paying for it themselves and using less, leading to a slide in total industry spend of about 30 percent.
NOT PAYING
Penny pinching led to an average budget cut by asset managers of about 20 percent in 2018, with a reduction of another 5 percent to 6 percent expected in 2019, according to Greenwich Associates research.
Asset managers are also expected to reduce the number of research and advisory firms they use to 15.3 in 2019, from 15.7 last year and 20 in 2015, it said.
Richard Buxton, chief executive of Merian Global Investors, said his firm began pricing research separately before the new rules kicked in, with year-on-year budget reductions of 10 percent that should continue in 2019.
""We don't want waterfront coverage from a whole raft of big firms. It's 'we like your analysts in these three sectors and everything else, frankly, we're not prepared to pay for'.""
Matthias Desmarais, head of research at broker Oddo BHF in Paris, said he expected more cuts in research budgets when talks with providers kick off in 2019 - before brokers recover some pricing power from 2020.
BlackRock's Bolton was not so sure.
He said his team's research spending would stay lower as managers think twice about paying for a broker's research or access to their analysts - with quarterly reviews and a massive monitoring and reporting exercise to check usage and spending.
One hour with an analyst can cost as much as 1,000 pounds.
Stiffer competition has also forced brokerages to look at selling their wares in new ways.

RSRCHXchange, an online marketplace for research, said the number of firms selling research on its site has doubled to 400 since January 2017. ""People want to monetize their research more than ever before,"" co-founder Jeremy Davies said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean plaintiffs in a World War Two forced labor court case against Japan's Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp have applied to seize some of Nippon Steel's Korean assets, their lawyers said on Wednesday. 
The application for the asset seizure, if approved by the court, could further strain South Korea's already frosty bilateral relations with Japan over the issue.
Japan denounced a South Korean Supreme Court ruling in October that Nippon Steel should pay 100 million won ($90,500) to each of four South Koreans to compensate them for suffering forced labor during the war.
The Japanese government said all wartime reparations were dealt with in a 1965 treaty that had normalized ties between the two neighbors.
The South Korean plaintiffs applied to a district court on Dec. 31 for the seizure of Nippon Steel's shares in a Korea-based joint venture with steelmaker POSCO.
""We express strong regret for Nippon Steel's careless and inhumane attitude, which has not shown any willingness to carry out the ruling for the plaintiffs, who have fought to remedy the violation of their rights for some 70 years,"" the lawyers said in a statement. 
Nippon Steel owns a 30 percent stake in POSCO-Nippon Steel RHF Joint Venture, known as PNR, and its 2.34 million shares are worth about 11 billion won ($9.83 million), South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported earlier on Wednesday. 
The lawyers did not say how much the plaintiffs sought from the seizure. 
A spokeswoman for Daegu District Court confirmed that the application for asset seizure had been submitted. 
Repeated calls to Nippon Steel's office went unanswered. Wednesday is a holiday for most businesses in Japan. 
Nippon Steel called it ""extremely regrettable"" at the time of the ruling but said it would review the decision carefully while considering further steps. 
POSCO declined to comment. 
South Korean plaintiffs that won similar cases in Korea's top court against Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd are also considering applying for seizure of the company's assets, such as patent rights, in the country, South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo reported citing an unnamed representative lawyer. 

Mitsubishi Heavy's main number went unanswered, and an automatic voice message said the company’s office was closed until January 7th.

(Reuters) - JLT Re's global property-catastrophe reinsurance index fell 1.2 percent at the key Jan. 1 policy renewal season, the broker said on Wednesday, dashing the industry's hopes of higher reinsurance premiums after the second straight year of big losses.
Reinsurance prices have fallen in recent years as traditional reinsurers face competition from new players and products such as catastrophe bonds, but industry giants were hoping for higher rates after facing the most costly quarter on record in 2017.
However, prices did not rise as much as expected, hurting expectations of what would have been the first major reversal since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history.
""Despite another active catastrophe year in the United States, property-catastrophe rate changes were modest,"" said Ed Hochberg, chief executive officer of JLT Re in North America.
JLT Re said rate increases were restricted to categories which had suffered substantial losses or where performance had worsened.
Insurers and reinsurers faced a bill of $80 billion from several catastrophes in 2018 including hurricanes Florence and Michael, typhoons Jebi, Mangkhut and Trami, flooding in Western Japan and the California wildfires.
Together, 2017 and 2018 represent the costliest two-year period ever for insured catastrophe losses, with a hefty bill of $150 billion in 2017, JLT Re said.
Investor appetite for the reinsurance sector softened in the fourth quarter of 2018, especially when compared with the same period in 2017, the broker added.
""Loss experiences and the macroeconomic environment will play an important role in shaping the reinsurance market in 2019,"" said David Flandro, global head of analytics at JLT Re.
""Another large-loss year could test the limits of carriers' capital resilience, as well as investors' appetite for reinsurance at a time of capital market volatility.""

563,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2019 03:25AM ET</span>",Markets start the way they ended,"LONDON (Reuters) - The new year starts in the red.
After the worst year for world stock markets in a decade, 2019 has kicked off with the same trepidation surrounding economic slowdown, trade tension and rising interest rates that infected markets for most of the second half of last year.
The first impetus of the new year comes from the December business surveys around the world and news that China’s manufacturing sector contracted for the first time in 19 months set the tone first thing.
Sub-forecast growth in Singapore's gross domestic product reinforced the picture regionally.
Shanghai stocks fell more than 1 percent, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng down almost 3 percent. Seoul’s Kospi dropped 1.5 percent.
Tokyo’s Nikkei outperformed despite losing 0.3 percent and further strengthening of the safe-haven yen.
With U.S. interest rate futures now priced for no more Federal Reserve interest rate rises in the current cycle – even after the Fed indicated at least two more at its meeting two weeks ago – and also moving toward a rate cut by the middle of 2020, the dollar has been on the back foot during the year-end roller coaster on stock markets.
Dollar/yen slipped to within a whisker of 109 overnight – its lowest level in a year.

564,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2019 03:22AM ET</span>","Hyundai flags tough 2019 as U.S., China demand stays slow","By Hyunjoo Jin and Ju-min Park
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's  Hyundai Motor  Group flagged another year of tepid car sales growth on the back of a slow 2018, saying trade protectionism adds uncertainty and major markets such as the United States and China remained sluggish.
In his first New Year address to employees, group heir apparent Euisun Chung said Hyundai Motor Co (KS:005380) and Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270) would complete a restructuring of South Korea's second-biggest conglomerate, which is widely expected to pave the way for him to formally succeed his octogenarian father as head of the group.
The complicated succession plans come as Hyundai contends with a bunch of problems that have cost it market share in China and the United States and stalled its rise up the ranks of global automakers.
It missed a boom in sports utility vehicles (SUVs), faces potential U.S. tariffs and a U.S. investigation over how it handled a vehicle recall, and lost ground in technological advances such as self-driving cars.
""Business uncertainties are heightening as the global economy continues to falter. Walls of protectionism are being constructed around the world,"" Chung, 48, told hundreds of employees at the group's headquarters in Seoul. 
""Internally, we face challenging tasks such as stabilizing business in major markets like the U.S. and China, while simultaneously enhancing our responsiveness to drive future growth."" 
Hyundai and Kia - together the world's fifth-biggest automaker - set what they called a ""conservative target"" of 7.6 million vehicle sales in 2019, a 3 percent increase from the 7.399 million vehicles sold last year.
The 2018 sales fell short of the group's target of 7.55 million vehicles, marking their fourth consecutive annual sales goal miss. The duo sold 7.25 million vehicles in 2017.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) expects global auto production to fall 1 percent in 2019, the first drop in nine years.
In that environment, the group said it would launch 13 new or face-lifted models in 2019, including a premium Genesis SUV and the Sonata sedan.
""Hyundai will be launching new models, but competitors will be also doing so, making it difficult for Hyundai to increase shares in the sluggish markets in China, U.S. and Europe,"" said Sean Kim, an analyst at Dongbu Securities.
Hyundai shares ended down 3.8 percent and Kia slumped 2.7 percent, while the wider market (KS11) was down 1.5 percent.
Chung said Hyundai would launch a pilot service of its autonomous taxis in South Korea by 2021 and expand partnerships with leading players in that area. 

He also pledged to ""actively communicate with"" shareholders, an apparent reference to U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management Corp which effectively scuttled a previous restructuring plan last year.

The Caixin Manufacturing PMI fell to 49.7 in December from 50.2 last month, marking the first contraction since May 2017. A reading below 50 signals contraction.
The reading confirmed a trend seen in the official PMI that was reported on Monday, which showed a drop to 49.4 in December.
The Caixin/Markit survey focuses mostly on smaller businesses, filling a niche that isn't covered by the official data.
""Even more eye-catching was that 'new orders' in both PMIs fell from expansion in November to contraction in December,"" said analysts at ING. ""This confirms our view that the economy is weak and that stimulus needs to arrive quickly.""
The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component both fell 1.2% by 1:50 AM ET (06:50 GMT).
 Evergrande  Real Estate Group Ltd (HK:3333) received some focus on Wednesday in Asia after a local newspaper reported that the company raised rents of its centre in Wan Chai by 321% to boost the estimated value of the property.
The estimated value of the China Evergrande Centre stood at HK$22.5 billion ($2.87 billion), up nearly 80% from the price the company paid to acquire the building from Chinese Estates Holdings in 2015, Ming Pao reported.
U.S.-China trade dispute returned to focus as U.S. President Donald Trump said this week that talks between the two countries are “progressing well.”

""Regardless of the development of Sino-U.S. relations, China's strategic choice to deepen reform and opening is unswerving, and we are committed to doing our own thing"", the article said.
Meanwhile, South Korea’s KOSPI fell 1.5%. North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un warned that he would take a “new path” in nuclear talks if the U.S. didn’t relax economic sanctions.
“I am willing to sit with the U.S. president any time in the future and will strive to produce outcomes that would be welcomed by the international community,” said Kim.
“However, if the United States does not deliver its promise and misjudge our people’s patience, making unilateral demands to continue sanctions and put pressure on us, we will have no choice but to seek a new path to protect the country’s independence, interests and peace on the Korean Peninsula,” he added.

On top of the rent price for offices, Evergrande also raised prices for the rent of carparks by 110%.

573,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2019 10:50PM ET</span>","China's Didi launches credit, crowdfunding services in diversification push","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's Didi Chuxing has launched a suite of financial products, including crowdfunding and lending, as it continues to diversify outside the ride-hailing business following a year of safety scandals.
The move comes on the heels of a company-wide reorganization announced in December, which was aimed at improving safety on its platform as well as operating efficiency.
The new products were tested in 10 cities and have now been introduced nationwide, the firm said on Wednesday. They include wealth management, credit and lending and crowd-funding for critical illnesses, all aimed at short-term, temporary workers.
The products bring Didi into competition with investor  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) and technology peer Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700).
They also come as rivals including other Alibaba-backed firms have been making a renewed push in a ride-hailing market dominated by Didi, aiming to tap unmet demand brought about by regulatory change.
Didi itself is facing new rules and increased scrutiny from authorities after a series of high-profile safety incidents, including the murders of two female Didi passengers in separate cases.
As part of a subsequent national audit of ride-hailing firms, the Ministry of Transport said Didi was ""out-of-control"", and pledged to tighten driver recruitment standards.
The firm is already short of drivers in major cities, since regulations in 2017 curbed the number of eligible applicants. 

Didi, whose backers include U.S. peer  Uber Technologies Inc  (UBER.UL), Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9434), is reshuffling its domestic business as it expands globally with new services in South America and Australia.

March contracts on the S&P 500 Index fell 0.6 percent as of 10:37 a.m. in Hong Kong, after a closely watched gauge of Chinese manufacturing had its lowest reading since May 2017. Nasdaq 100 Index futures and those on the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.6 percent each.
The closely watched Caixin Media and IHS Markit China’s December manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 49.7 from 50.2 in November, below the 50 threshold for the first time since May 2017. That follows the official gauge that fell into the same zone for the first time since July 2016 on Monday.
Adding to global growth concerns, Singapore’s export-reliant economy grew an annualized 1.6 percent in the three months through December from the third quarter, easing from a revised 3.5 percent gain previously, according to an advance estimate from the Ministry of Trade and Industry Wednesday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists was for a 3.6 percent expansion.
“The disappointment that came through in December has transferred into January as well,” said Jingyi Pan, a Singapore-based market strategist at IG Asia Pte. While there was some small development in uncertain Washington politics, it’s a reminder of the U.S.-China trade tensions and “brings back to the surface worries on growth,” she said.
A fourth quarter sell-off in American equities sent the benchmark to the brink of a bear market late last year as fears of a recession crept up amid intensified U.S.-China trade tensions and a fourth rate hike by the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 Index closed out 2018 with a 6.2 percent decline, finishing just above 2,500 and ending its worst year since the 2008 financial crisis amid worries the global economy will weaken in 2019.
FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX). last month slashed its profit forecast just three months after raising it, and pared its international freight capacity amid a slowdown in global trade in recent months, with leading indicators pointing to an ongoing deceleration in the near term.  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT)., a bellwether of global growth, was punished by investors in October after repeating its warnings of rising costs due to higher steel prices and U.S. tariffs.
Earlier Wednesday, U.S. stock futures rose as much as 0.6 percent after President Donald Trump invited the top congressional leaders from both parties to a White House briefing on border security Wednesday and suggested he wants to “make a deal” to end the government shutdown. It’s the first sign of a possible opening for negotiations to break the stalemate over funding for the border wall.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The fatality rate on passenger jet aircraft worldwide jumped in 2018 after airlines recorded zero accident deaths on passenger jets in the prior year, according to a Dutch consulting firm and an aviation safety group.
Dutch aviation consulting firm To70 and the Aviation Safety Network both reported on Tuesday there were more than 500 deaths stemming from passenger airline crashes in 2018, but emphasized that fatal crashes remain rare.
To70 estimated that the fatal accident rate for large commercial passenger flights at 0.36 per million flights, or one fatal accident for every 3 million flights.
That is up from 2017's 0.06 per million flight rate and above the most recent five-year average of 0.24 per million flights. There were 13 deaths in 2017 in two fatal crashes worldwide, but both were on regional turboprop aircraft.
Over the last two decades, aviation deaths around the world have been falling. As recently as 2005, there were 1,015 deaths aboard commercial passenger flights worldwide, the Aviation Safety Network said.
Despite the increase, 2018 was still the third safest year ever in terms of the number of fatal accidents and the ninth safest measured by deaths, the Aviation Safety Network said.
""If the accident rate had remained the same as ten years ago, there would have been 39 fatal accidents last year,"" Aviation Safety Network's chief executive, Harro Ranter, said in a statement. ""This shows the enormous progress in terms of safety in the past two decades.""
On Oct. 29, a Lion Air-operated Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX 8 crashed into the Java Sea after takeoff from Jakarta, killing 189. 
In May, a Cubana flight of a Boeing 737-201 crashed just outside Havana airport, killing 112 people. In March, 51 of 71 on board died after a US-Bangla Airlines plane crashed on landing at Nepal’s international airport.
In February, a plane operated by Saratov Airlines crashed in Russia after taking off from Stepanovskoye, killing all 71 people aboard, while the same month an Aseman Airlines flight crashed into a mountain in Iran, killing 66 people onboard.

The United States suffered its first accident death involving a U.S. airline since 2009 in April, when a fan blade on a Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) Boeing 737’s jet engine broke apart in flight, shattering a window and nearly sucking a woman out of the plane.

577,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 01, 2019 07:10PM ET</span>",Rio Plans to Delay Ex-CEO's Bonus Again Amid Guinea Probe,"(Bloomberg) --  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Group plans to further delay paying outstanding bonuses to its former chief executive officer as regulators continue investigating payments to a consultant on an iron-ore project in Guinea.
In 2017, the company said it would postpone any short- and long-term incentives owed to Sam Walsh for a minimum of two years. Rio is now planning to extend that time period.
“Given investigations remain ongoing the board has asked Sam to agree to a further deferral until the investigations have concluded,” a Rio spokesman said in an email Tuesday.
Walsh retired as CEO in July 2016, months before Rio announced that it alerted authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.K.’s Serious Fraud Office, about payments related to the Simandou project. The investigation is centered on a $10.5 million payment to an external consultant in 2011 for assisting on negotiations with Guinea’s President Alpha Conde.
Rio later terminated contracts of two senior executives, arguing they failed to maintain standards in the company’s code of conduct. Leaked emails showed former CEOs Tom Albanese and Walsh, then head of Rio’s iron-ore unit, discussing the payment.
Walsh has previously said that he always acted lawfully and in accordance with his duties while at the company. A spokesman for Walsh declined to comment.
In its 2016 annual report, Rio said that any long-term incentive plan payments, including so-called bonus deferral and performance share plans, that would have vested up to 2020 will be impacted by the agreement and will affect awards going back to 2013.
The value of these awards changes with company’s performance. In 2016, Walsh’s total pay package was $11.4 million, which includes long-term incentives of $6.8 million that were deferred.
The Simandou deposit in Guinea was once one of the most prized mineral assets, but a bitter dispute over the license, collapsing iron-ore prices and huge infrastructure costs, saw Rio abandon plans to build it.

578,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2019 05:35PM ET</span>","Big banks look to cut back, alter credit card rewards programs: WSJ","(Reuters) - Large financial institutions including  JP Morgan Chase  & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), and  American Express  Co (N:AXP) are cutting back or altering some of the rewards plans that their credit card businesses offer borrowers, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. 
The financial institutions don't plan to end rewards entirely, but want to alter them in ways that boost credit card usage and reduce upfront rewards bonuses, people familiar with the matter told the Journal. 
Banks have historically offered rewards such as free air travel to users of premium credit cards both to lure customers and prompt them to spend more on their cards. 
But some financial institutions are now looking to revise their rewards strategies, which have been under pressure as consumers become more savvy in their use of the credit cards, the Journal said.
The cost of rewards programs had grown an average 15 percent on a year-over-year basis as of the third quarter of 2018 at several of the biggest credit card providers, bank analyst Charles Peabody told the Journal.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reaffirmed on Tuesday his resolve to completely denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, but warned he may have to take an alternative path if the United States continued to force Pyongyang into unilateral action. 
In his New Year address, Kim said he was willing to meet U.S. President Donald Trump again at any time to achieve denuclearization, and urged Washington to take unspecified corresponding action to speed up the stalled process. 
North Korea, however, would have ""no option but to explore a new path in order to protect our sovereignty"" if the United States ""miscalculates our people's patience, forces something upon us and pursues sanctions and pressure without keeping a promise it made in front of the world,"" Kim said in his nationally televised address.
The comments are likely to fuel growing scepticism over whether Pyongyang intends to give up the nuclear weapons program that it has long considered essential to its security.
Kim and Trump vowed to work toward denuclearization and build a ""lasting and stable"" peace regime at their landmark summit in Singapore in June, but little progress has been made since and satellite images have indicated continued activity at North Korea's nuclear and missile facilities. 
Pyongyang has demanded Washington lift sanctions and declare an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War in response to its initial, unilateral steps toward denuclearization, including dismantling its only known nuclear testing site and a key missile engine facility.
U.S. officials say those steps can be easily reversed and have not been verified, and Washington has slapped additional economic sanctions on the impoverished country. Washington halted some large-scale military exercises with Seoul, although smaller drills continued.
Kim called for South Korea to ""completely stop"" joint military drills with the United States involving strategic assets, while multilateral negotiations should be pursued to build a permanent peace regime on the Korean Peninsula. 
""Now that North and South Korea decided to take the path of peace and prosperity, we insist that joint military exercises with outside forces should no longer be allowed and deployment of war equipment such as outside strategic assets should be completely stopped,"" Kim said.
Analysts said Kim's message sent clear signals that North Korea is willing to stay in talks with Washington and Seoul this year - but on its own terms.
""North Korea seems determined in 2019 to receive some sort of sanctions relief ... The challenge, however, is will Team Trump be willing to back away from its position of zero sanctions relief?"" said Harry J. Kazianis at the Washington-based Centre for the National Interest. 
""Kim's remarks seem to suggest his patience with America is wearing thin.""
The televised speech is closely watched as a rare public appearance for the young leader, setting the tone for his domestic and foreign policies for the year ahead.
After racing toward the goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States in 2017, Kim used last year's speech to call for defusing tensions and improving ties with the South, and a shift in focus toward economic development.
That resulted in a dramatic detente last year, including three summits with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, and the historic meeting with Trump in June. 
In this year's 30-minute speech, Kim spent more than 20 minutes highlighting his new focus on the economy. 

Kim said inter-Korean relations have now entered a ""completely new phase"", and he is willing to resume key joint economic projects with the South - the factory park in Kaesong and tours to Mt. Kumgang - without conditions.

590,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2018 06:26PM ET</span>","After damaging Reuters report, J&J doubles down on talc safety message","By Mike Spector and Lisa Girion
NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Inc's statement was unequivocal.
""The FDA has tested Johnson's talc since the '70s. Every single time it did not contain asbestos,"" the company said in a Dec. 19 tweet. It followed by several days the publication of a Reuters investigation (https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer/) that found the healthcare conglomerate knew for decades that the carcinogen lurked in its Baby Powder and other cosmetic talc products.
The tweet, posted under the handle @JNJNews, didn't mention that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found traces of asbestos in the company's Shower to Shower talc in 1973, as revealed in agency documents https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5669405-2017-J-J-witness-on-FDA-finding-asbestos-in.html reviewed by Reuters. And it is only one of dozens of tweets conveying a similar message about talc safety since the Reuters article appeared Dec. 14.
The Reuters article prompted a stock selloff that erased about $40 billion from J&J's market value in one day and created a public relations crisis as the blue-chip healthcare conglomerate faced widespread questions about the possible health effects of one of its most iconic products.
To reassure investors and consumers, J&J has tweeted, posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), run a series of full-page newspaper ads across the United States, published a lengthy rebuttal to the Reuters investigation on its website and announced a $5 billion stock buyback. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky has appeared in a company video and on CNBC's ""Mad Money"" to reinforce the company's position.
That position has been unwavering. J&J insists that its Baby Powder is safe and has been asbestos-free at least since regular testing began in the 1970s. The message doubles down on the stance the company has taken to defend against lawsuits in which about 11,700 plaintiffs allege that the J&J talc they used in past decades caused their cancer. The company is pursuing this strategy despite the evidence that talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for the carcinogen from the 1970s into the early 2000s — test results that the company didn’t disclose to regulators or consumers.
In response to a Reuters request for comment, the company said it is committed to defending the talc litigation, ""and that same, long-term view is reflected in our ongoing communications that consistently point to the strong scientific evidence that our talc is and always has been safe.""
As for the 1973 Shower to Shower test, J&J noted that the result didn't ""reflect FDA's final determination about this sample"" in a 1976 table summarizing the agency's early 1970s cosmetic talc testing. However, in that 1976 table, which Reuters examined, the FDA did not indicate any result, positive or negative, for the type of asbestos found in the Shower to Shower sample in 1973.
Given the mass of litigation it faces, J&J has little choice but to zealously dispute findings that its products sometimes contained traces of asbestos, said Eric Dezenhall, a crisis-management consultant in Washington, D.C. ""If your position in court is that the claims being made are false…you can't just shrug your shoulders,"" he said.
Soon after the Reuters article appeared, J&J executives consulted crisis-management experts, according to people familiar with the matter. Among the company's reasons for deciding to maintain its stance on absolute talc purity, these people said, was a conviction that a company known for putting health and safety first had the facts on its side, a litigation track record that included victories and mistrials, and the expectation that adverse verdicts will be overturned on appeal.
THROUGH LAWYERS
Many of J&J's subsequent messages have mirrored the company's written responses to questions and findings Reuters presented to the company during its investigation: They deny that the company kept information from regulators and point to the many studies finding that talc is safe and doesn't cause cancer.
Those earlier responses were composed by J&J's outside litigators, led by Peter Bicks at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, and conveyed to Reuters by lawyers at a crisis-management firm co-founded by Lanny Davis, a lawyer who represented U.S. President Bill Clinton in the 1990s and Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s former attorney who has pleaded guilty to multiple criminal charges.
Gorsky, in his appearance on ""Mad Money,"" invoked J&J's now legendary response to the Tylenol crisis as evidence that the company can be trusted to address any safety problems linked to its products. In 1982, J&J moved decisively to pull all Tylenol from store shelves after seven people died from taking cyanide-laced pills.
""I can't believe the company that took that dramatic of an action would allow a product that they felt in any way could be harmful to stay on the market,"" Gorsky told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer. ""We unequivocally believe that our talc, our Baby Powder, does not contain asbestos.""
Citing the Tylenol recall provides ""some reputational buffer,"" said Stephen A. Greyser, the Harvard Business School professor who wrote the first study of the company's handling of that crisis. ""But it is not a total protection"" because it won't shield the company from a loss of trust if consumers or investors conclude the company hasn't been fully forthcoming in this case, he said. J&J needs to guard against ""reputational contagion,"" the risk that a loss of confidence in Baby Powder could bleed over into how consumers, shareholders and others view the company more broadly, Greyser added.
The key difference between the two crises is that poisoned Tylenol presented a threat to consumers at the time, while the documented asbestos contamination of J&J talc that Reuters investigated spanned from 1971 to the early 2000s. J&J says that if it believed that Baby Powder today presented safety risks, it wouldn't hesitate to remove it from store shelves, given that the product accounts for less than 0.5% of annual revenue.
The company joined its talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, a unit of Paris-based Imerys SA, in requesting that a trial scheduled for January in St. Louis be delayed for, among other things, what they called ""negative national and local news coverage"" resulting from the Reuters investigation that would inevitably taint prospective jurors.
The judge denied the motion. The same judge recently upheld a $4.69 billion jury award in a separate ovarian cancer case, which J&J says it expects to be overturned on appeal. The judge said J&J's promotion of a product that the evidence showed was contaminated with a known carcinogen was ""particularly reprehensible.""
In an emailed statement, Imerys Talc America said it ""is committed to the quality and safety of its products,"" and that rigorous research ""overwhelmingly confirms that talc is safe, and no agency has asserted that talc causes cancer.""
UNDERMINED BY EVIDENCE
Some of J&J's messages in its recent campaign omit key details regarding findings on talc and, in certain instances, are undermined by other evidence, according to a Reuters review of the company's statements.
The Dec. 19 tweet claiming that the FDA’s own tests never found asbestos in J&J talc, for example, ignores an agency scientist's 1973 finding that a Shower to Shower sample contained asbestos fibers, according to a copy of an FDA report titled ""Asbestos and Other Contaminants in Talc"" and a deposition of a former J&J head toxicologist. The FDA did not respond to questions for this article, citing a partial government shutdown.
On CNBC, Gorsky said: ""We also not only used the best testing methodologies that were available, but we continued to improve them through the years.""
J&J's testing methods do exceed the industry standard. But even so, as a geologist and frequent J&J expert witness acknowledged in court this year, only a tiny fraction of the company's talc sold over the past 40 years has been tested using what is widely recognized as the best method to detect asbestos fibers, known as transmission electron microscopy.
Plaintiffs' lawyers are already homing in on inconsistencies between J&J's statements and other evidence regarding its talc, and they are planning to depose Gorsky in coming weeks.
""There is no flexibility in what they're saying,"" said Leigh O'Dell, one of the lead lawyers representing plaintiffs in thousands of lawsuits against J&J consolidated in a New Jersey federal court. ""Taking these statements on behalf of the company and pointing out to juries and judges the misrepresentations contained in those statements — I think you're going to see that in every case going forward, whether it's an ovarian cancer case or a mesothelioma case.""
One of J&J's recent tweets criticized plaintiffs' lawyers: ""Far from a new theory or insight, plaintiffs' lawyers have resurrected a disproven argument about asbestos in our talc that dates to the 1970s.""
The Reuters investigation found that tests by J&J's own contract labs and others periodically found small amounts of asbestos in talc from mines that supplied the mineral for Baby Powder as recently as the early 2000s.
Some J&J tweets and newspaper ads have adopted a question-and-answer format. ""What about the allegation you withheld safety information?"" the company said in a full-page ad in USA Today the day after Christmas.
""It is false,” the company said. “All safety concerns are taken seriously, and we share all relevant information with regulators.""
Some Twitter users have responded to J&J's tweets with praise and support. Others have referenced their relatives' longtime use of J&J talc products and subsequent deaths from ovarian cancer. ""We're very sorry to hear this,"" J&J responded to several Twitter users, expressing a desire to speak with them and offering a phone number to call.
In response to another recent tweet in which J&J said its talc doesn't contain asbestos, one Twitter user asked: ""Did it USED to?""

""No,"" J&J responded. ""For decades, J&J's baby powder has repeatedly been tested for asbestos and found not to contain asbestos.""

(Reuters) - A California toy company has sued Louis Vuitton to stop the French luxury goods maker from interfering with its sales of a slime-filled, poop-shaped toy purse for children, Pooey Puitton.
In a complaint filed on Friday in Los Angeles federal court, MGA Entertainment Inc said no reasonable consumer would mistake Pooey Puitton, which retails for $59.99, for costlier Louis Vuitton handbags.
MGA called Pooey Puitton protected parody ""designed to mock, criticize, and make fun of that wealth and celebrity"" associated with Louis Vuitton products and rejected what it called Louis Vuitton's claim of trademark infringement to an MGA customer.
""The use of the Pooey name and Pooey product in association with a product line of 'magical unicorn poop' is intended to criticize or comment upon the rich and famous, the Louis Vuitton name, the LV marks, and on their conspicuous consumption,"" the complaint said.
Jim Fingeroth, a spokesman for Louis Vuitton, on Monday said the unit of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE had no comment on the complaint.
Many luxury goods makers file lawsuits or threaten litigation to stop companies from piggybacking off their names and customer goodwill.
MGA is seeking a court declaration that Pooey Puitton does not infringe Louis Vuitton's intellectual property rights, and is protected parody and fair use.
The Van Nuys, California-based company said Pooey Puitton, whose contents include ""slime powder"" for making a ""rainbow of poop"" when water is added, is part of its Poopsie Slime Surprise line launched in 2018 and among its more successful new toys.
Other products sold by MGA include L.O.L. Surprise and Bratz dolls.

592,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2018 04:36PM ET</span>","Wall Street rises, limps across the finish line of a turbulent year","By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street advanced in low-volume trading on Monday as revelers gathered to ring in 2019, marking the end of the worst year for U.S. stocks since 2008, the height of the financial crisis. 
Wall Street entered correction territory in late January and was challenged for much of 2018 by tariff jitters, rising interest rates, and fears of diminishing corporate profits.
""Investors got complacent,"" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta. ""People were positioned for the lack of volatility, and when that changed because of trade concerns and interest rates, people started repositioning and that started the cascade."" 
December was a particularly trying month for U.S. equities. The S&P 500 (SPX) saw its worst December since the Great Depression and the Nasdaq (IXIC) confirmed it was in a bear market, or 20 percent below its high. All three are down about 9 percent since the beginning of the month.
In the new year, investors hope for the removal of question marks that acted as significant headwinds in 2018, including U.S.-China trade negotiations, the path of U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, slowing corporate growth and economic fallout from the upcoming departure of Britain from the European Union, or Brexit, among other concerns. 
As 2019 gets underway, ""investors will be looking to corporate earnings, what happens with the trade negotiations and the body language of the Fed,"" Martin added. 
On Monday, renewed hopes for a resolution to the U.S.-China trade dispute provided a glimmer of optimism for investors.
U.S. President Donald Trump indicated on Twitter that progress had been made toward a potential settlement of trade tensions between the United States and China which have plagued stock markets for much of the year. 
Trading volume was relatively light, owing to the holiday as the U.S. federal government shutdown entered its 10th day. 
Healthcare (SPXHC) and tariff-sensitive technology (SPLRCT) stocks, led by  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 on Monday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 265.06 points, or 1.15 percent, to 23,327.46, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 21.11 points, or 0.85 percent, to 2,506.85 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 50.76 points, or 0.77 percent, to 6,635.28.
All 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 ended the session in positive territory. But for the year, only healthcare and utilities (SPLRCU) ended 2018 higher.
Energy (SPNY), materials (SPLRCM), communication services (SPLRCL), industrials (SPLRCI) and financials (SPSY) were the biggest percentage losers of 2018, down between 14.7 percent and 20.5 percent from the beginning of the year.
The 20.5 percent drop of energy stocks in 2018 was largely attributable to crude prices (LCOc1) plunging 38 percent since early October.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.42-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.81-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded eight new highs and 98 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.46 billion shares, compared with the 9.22 billion-share average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Equities around the world rose on Monday as possible progress in resolving the trade dispute between the United States and China engendered some investor optimism in what has been a punishing end of year for markets.
The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index advanced in light trading volume after U.S. President Donald Trump said he held a ""very good call"" with China's President Xi Jinping on Saturday to discuss trade and said ""big progress"" was being made.
Chinese state media were more reserved, saying Xi hoped the negotiating teams could meet each other halfway and reach an agreement that was mutually beneficial.
The rise in U.S. equities mirrored that in Asian and European markets, which were also buoyed by trade optimism. 
Despite Monday's advance, equities ended the year largely in the red, victims of investor anxiety over trade tensions and slowing economic growth. Asian and European shares had been sluggish for much of the year, and in recent months, U.S. stocks followed suit. 
""If the European economy continues to decelerate and the Chinese economy decelerates because of tariffs, there is definitely going to be spillover to the United States,"" said Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at Boston Private.
The S&P 500 dropped more than 9 percent in December, its largest decline since the Great Depression. For the year, the index slid more than 6 percent, its biggest drop since the 2008 financial crisis.
Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended down 16 percent for the year, while the STOXX 600 was more than 13 percent lower. MSCI's gauge of stocks around the globe (MIWD00000PUS) fell 11.1 percent in 2018.
A further blow to the Chinese economy could spur a quicker resolution to the U.S.-China trade dispute and thus boost global equities, Saccocia said. Survey data on Monday showed Chinese manufacturing activity contracting for the first time in two years even as the service sector improved.
On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 265.06 points, or 1.15 percent, to 23,327.46, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 21.11 points, or 0.85 percent, to 2,506.85 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 50.76 points, or 0.77 percent, to 6,635.28.
MSCI's emerging markets index (MSCIEF) rose 0.32 percent, while the MSCI world stock index (MIWD00000PUS) gained 0.66 percent.

NO MORE HIKES
Yields on U.S. Treasuries fell on Monday, keeping with the trend over the past two months as investors moved to lower-risk investments.
Benchmark 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) last rose 15/32 in price to yield 2.686 percent, compared with 2.738 percent late on Friday.
The fall in Treasury yields reflects expectations of a slowdown, if not a pause altogether, in the Federal Reserve's progression of interest-rate hikes.
The precipitous drop in yields has undermined the U.S. dollar in recent weeks. The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.3 percent and on track to end December with a loss. It is, however, still set for its highest yearly percentage gain since 2015.
On Monday, the dollar fell to a six-month low against the yen .

The electric-car maker has been urging buyers to make use of the federal tax credit, with Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk reminding them on Twitter https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1079172996793651200 on Saturday that the benefit would drop to half beginning 2019.
On Monday, Musk tweeted https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1079816583906639872 a list of Tesla stores open until midnight.
The report https:// citing sources, said while the automaker is expected to deliver some vehicles on the last day of the year, it is not possible for Tesla to go through the whole inventory.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on the report.

(Reuters) - Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra said on Monday that Odebrecht should not be able to continue working in Peru because the Brazilian construction company had ""contaminated private activity"" and admitted bribing public officials.
Vizcarra's statement comes weeks after Odebrecht Peru signed a deal with Peruvian authorities to pay a fine of $182 million over 15 years that would allow it to continue operating in the country in return for providing evidence about officials it bribed to win infrastructure project contract.
Vizcarra was preparing on Monday to travel to Brazil for the inauguration of Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday. He told local radio station RPP that Odebrecht had ""disqualified itself from working with the Peruvians"" by paying bribes. 
""Regardless of the agreement Odebrecht reached with the public prosecutor's office in return for information, which I respect, it is my opinion that it should not continue working in Peru,"" he said.
""(This) is a company that has contaminated the private sector. There are many respectable companies here but now there is distrust of all companies because of Odebrecht."" 
Odebrecht is awaiting authorization from the Vizcarra government for the sale of its hydroelectric plant in Peru to the China Three Gorges for some $1.39bn, part of which would be used to pay debts to local suppliers and guarantee the payment of civil compensation. 

The Peruvian president took office at the end of March after the resignation of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who was accused of links to Odebrecht - links he has denied.

Europe’s main stock gauge headed for 13 percent drop in the year -- the biggest since 2008. Natural gas futures slid below $3 for the first time since September, putting the front-month contract on path for worst December since 1991.
Crude erased gains that took it above $46 a barrel. It remains on track its first annual drop since 2015. The dollar edged lower as a government shutdown continued. The euro held steady against the greenback after Italy’s populist government won final parliamentary approval for its 2019 budget.

613,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 31, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",U.S. Stocks Pare December Slide; Dollar Slips: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks rose, paring a December slump that is among the worst in history, after President Donald Trump reported “big progress” in trade talks with his Chinese counterpart. Treasuries slipped and oil erased gains.
The S&P 500 trimmed its monthly loss to 9 percent, the steepest of the record bull market, as Trump said in a tweet that negotiations toward a comprehensive trade deal were “moving along very well.” Stocks around the world climbed at the end of a dismal year that’s seen bear markets in equities from Japan to Germany. Europe’s main stock gauge headed for 13 percent drop in the year -- the biggest since 2008.
Crude erased gains that took it above $46 a barrel. It remains on track its first annual drop since 2015. The dollar edged lower as a government shutdown continued. The euro held steady against the greenback after Italy’s populist government won final parliamentary approval for its 2019 budget.
Global stocks are set for their worst year since the financial crisis while oil is mired in its steepest quarterly slump since 2014. Plenty of event risks loom in the next 12 months, from the U.K.’s exit from the European Union to U.S.-China trade talks and the continuing showdown between President Trump and Congress over the budget. The American political landscape is also unsettling investors following departures of senior officials and Trump’s repeated criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
Elsewhere, emerging-market shares climbed and their currencies were steady even as factory data from China contracted.

637,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2018 08:03AM ET</span>",Canada Goose's first China store draws eager crowds despite diplomatic headwinds,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Large crowds have been drawn to Canada Goose's new outdoor wear store in downtown Beijing, its first in mainland China, since its opening on Friday, despite sub-zero temperatures and a chill in China's relations with Canada. 
A long line of shoppers in thick winter coats queued outside the two-storey store on Monday afternoon, with waiting times of an hour or more for a look at Canada Goose's 9,000 yuan ($1,300) parkas. 
Canada Goose staff were seen walking up and down the queue asking shoppers which product they were looking for and then telling them whether or not they had it in stock. 
""It's been popular for ages but Beijing didn't have one, only Hong Kong. So everyone's come to see it,"" said Long Hua, 32, lining up outside the store with a friend. 
Ties between China and Canada have turned frosty since the arrest of a top Chinese executive in Vancouver at the request of the United States in December and the subsequent arrest of two Canadians in China on suspicion of endangering state security.
Canada Goose opened its Beijing store about two weeks later than initially planned. It has made no connection between the delay and the heightened tensions between the two governments, saying earlier this month that the postponement was due to construction work. 
On Monday, construction workers were still seen on scaffolding on one side of the store. 
The Toronto-listed parka maker has made no mention of the Beijing store opening on its Chinese social media platforms, although the store in Beijing's swanky Sanlitun district is now listed on the company's global website.
""We are proud of our newest store in China and look forward to welcoming our fans,"" Canada Goose said in an email to Reuters on Monday.
A buoyant sales outlook for mainland China has been shaken in recent weeks by some caustic posts on Chinese social media calling for the boycott of Canada Goose products following Canada's arrest of Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL] Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou.
Shares of Canada Goose have fallen about 37 percent in Toronto trading since Meng's detention and the ensuing strains between the two countries. 
Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, faces U.S. allegations that she misled multinational banks about Iran-linked transactions, putting the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions. 
Meng has said she is innocent. 
The stakes are high for the maker of high-end goose-down coats, which enjoy significant brand recognition in China's big cities. 
Chinese customers account for more than a third of spending on luxury products worldwide, and are increasingly shopping in their home market rather than overseas. 
Earlier this year, Canada Goose opened its first store in Hong Kong.

641,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2018 03:50AM ET</span>",A euro curse? European banking stocks' lost decades,"LONDON (Reuters) - Paris, December 31, 1998: 
Fearing his country's pay-as-you-go pension scheme is unsustainable, a 40-year old French engineer - let's call him Jean Dupont - makes a New Year resolution.
Hoping the introduction of the euro the next day will mark a new era of prosperity for the European economy, Dupont decides to invest in the bloc's banking sector every single trading day for the next two decades.
His strategy is simple: buying and holding on what he believes is the best proxy to play the region's dynamic economy.
And why not? Europe is expanding at its fastest rate in about 10 years, Germany has turned its economy around since reunification in 1990 and, with more than 10 Eastern and Central European countries queuing up to join the EU, there seems to be no shortage of growth on the horizon. 
Moreover, a dot-com boom is fuelling belief in a promising IT-based ""new economy"".
What could possibly go wrong? 
Paris, December 31, 2018:
Now 60, Dupont must come to terms with the fact that his investment strategy has misfired horribly. 
Excluding dividends, he finds that he has lost money on his 20 years of daily investments in the euro zone banking sector a staggering 98.5 percent of the time.
Only about 1.5 percent of his investments were made at a lower level than the index's close on Dec. 28, 2018.
He is not sure who to blame.
The great financial crisis of 2008 seems a credible culprit. 
But his American cousin Jonathan Bridges, who 20 years ago followed a parallel strategy of daily investments in the U.S. banking index, has had a success rate of about 50 percent. 
That's even though the subprime loans that were a major factor in the crisis were centered on the United States.
Dupont might also look for clues in the euro zone economy's sluggish growth rate, the sovereign debt crisis of 2011 or ultra-low, and at times negative, interest rates.
But none of that can fully explain to him why the bloc's banking index has lost about two-thirds of its value over 20 years. 
If he wasn't such a rational man, he'd almost think the euro was cursed.

643,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2018 03:43AM ET</span>",Tokyo court says extends detention of Nissan's Ghosn until Jan 11,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Tokyo District Court said on Monday it has extended the detention of ousted Nissan Motor Co chairman Carlos Ghosn by 10 days until Jan. 11.
Ghosn, accused of aggravated breach of trust, is facing allegations of making the car maker shoulder 1.85 billion yen ($16.8 million) in personal investment losses.
The latest extension will see Ghosn remain in Tokyo's main detention center, where he has been confined since his first arrest on Nov. 19 on allegations of financial misconduct.
Since then, he has been re-arrested twice over the latest allegations and on claims that he underreported his Nissan salary for a prolonged period. He denies the allegations.
Calls to the office of Ghosn's lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, were not answered on Monday, an unofficial holiday in Japan.
A Nissan spokesman said the car maker was not in a position to comment on the latest development in the case.
""The company's own investigation is ongoing, and its scope continues to broaden,"" the spokesman said.
The decision to extend Ghosn's time in detention comes a day before his 10-day detention period for the latest allegation was set to expire on Tuesday, and follows the release of former Nissan executive Greg Kelly on bail last week after a court ruled against extending his detention while he awaits trial.
Both Ghosn and Kelly were initially arrested in late November and have been charged with underreporting Ghosn's salary at Nissan over a five-year period from 2010. Both deny the charges.
Nissan's board in November fired Ghosn as chairman and Kelly as representative director, although both men technically still remain board members who can only be removed by shareholders.
Ghosn's arrest has rocked the auto industry and strained Nissan's ties with French automaking partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), where Ghosn still remains chairman and CEO.
Ghosn served as CEO of Nissan for more than a decade through 2017 and concurrently held the chairman position at Renault, Nissan and partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp until his arrest. 
The three automakers are linked by a complicated share-holding structure under which Renault holds a 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, and Nissan holds a 15 percent stake in Renault, with no voting rights. Nissan holds a 34 percent stake in Mitsubishi Motors.
Since Ghosn's arrest, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa has called for changes to weaken the clout of controlling shareholder Renault.
Ghosn's arrest has also put Japan's criminal justice system under international scrutiny and sparked criticism for some of its practices, including keeping suspects in detention for long periods and prohibiting defense lawyers from being present during interrogations, which can last eight hours a day.
Ghosn is being held in the spartan Tokyo Detention Center, a tower-like structure in the eastern part of Tokyo, over New Year in addition to Christmas.
The detention center, with its many rules and restrictions, makes for a stark contrast with his comfortable, globe-trotting lifestyle.

645,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 30, 2018 11:51PM ET</span>","HK Stocks Close 2018 On Up Note, Low China PMI Weighs","Investing.com - Asian stocks rose in the last day of trading for the year Monday, with investors focusing on positive hints about the progress of U.S.-China trade talks and overlooking some negative economic signals out of China.
Markets in mainland China and Japan were closed and other markets in the region, including Hong Kong, had shortened sessions so trading was generally thin. Still, investors got past the news that manufacturing activity in China contracted more than analysts and economists had expected.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index closed off a short trading at 11 AM ET (4:00 AM GMT) up 1.34% to 25,845. The positive close marked an end to the worst year for Asian stocks since 2011. The Hang Seng Index fell more than 15% through the year.
Australia also ended a short day in positive territory, with the S&P/ASX 200 down 0.14% to 5,646.
Markets in mainland China did worse, putting in the worst performance among major stock markets in the world through 2018. The Shanghai Composite Index lost about a quarter of its value through the year. 
And the latest economic indicator out of China might worry investors at the beginning of 2019.
China’s official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for December released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Friday was 49.4, missing the 49.9 reading that analysts polled by Reuters had expected. A measure below 50 signals contraction.
The December PMI was the weakest since February 2016, according to Reuters, and fell below an already weak reading of 50 recorded in November. New export orders have fallen for seven months straight.
A silver lining was the non-manufacturing PMI, which came in at 53.8, higher than the 53.4 measured in November. This might be good news for some investors, given that services make up about half of the country’s economy.
Still, the low manufacturing PMI numbers “suggest the economy is still decelerating,” Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian Economics Research at HSBC told CNBC. “That’s going to weigh down not just Chinese GDP growth but really global trade.”
Lending support to stocks were comments from U.S. President Donald Trump over the weekend pointing to significant progress in trade talks with China.
Trump tweeted that negotiations are “moving very well” and “big progress” has been made. He pointed to a “very good call” with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday. In comments to state media, Chinese President Xi Jinping said both the U.S. and China are looking for “stable progress.”"

Whole Foods employees have visited regions of Western North America for potential retail spaces in parts of Idaho, southern Utah and Wyoming where it currently has no stores, the Journal reported citing a source.
The world's largest online retailer plans to expand its two-hour delivery service, Prime Now, to nearly all of its roughly 475 Whole Foods stores in the United States, the Journal said, citing another source.
The plans are a part in the series of Amazon's grocery, delivery and pickup expansions to cities across the United States in recent months.
Prime Now services include a two-hour delivery option to subscribers in more than 60 cities, and online grocery pickup from Whole Foods stores in as little as 30 minutes from nearly 30 cities, WSJ said.

647,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 30, 2018 09:52PM ET</span>",Asian Stocks End 2018 With Upbeat Note,"Investing.com - Asian stocks rose during morning trade Monday, the last day of 2018, closing out a bad year on an upbeat note.
Stocks across the region were supported by claims from U.S. President Donald Trump of significant progress in trade talks with China.
Trump tweeted that negotiations are “moving very well” and “big progress” has been made and pointed to a “very good call” with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday. In comments to state media, Chinese President Xi Jinping said both the U.S. and China are looking for “stable progress.”
Those comments helped support shares in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng Index was up 1.09% to 25,778 by 9:15PM ET (2:15 AM GMT), almost halfway through the morning session of a shortened trading day. Markets in mainland China and Japan are closed.
Australia was also trading in positive territory, with the S&P/ASX 200 up 0.69% to 5,693.
Trading was thin ahead of the New Year’s Day holiday.
Still, closing out the year on an upbeat note is a small silver lining for investors in Asian equities, which have gone through their worst year since 2011.
The Hang Seng Index ETF (HK:2833) started out 2018 at 30,515 and has dropped more than 15% over the past 12 months.
Also putting a damper on any upbeat news was the release of a measure of Chinese manufacturing, which did not meet estimates and fell into contraction territory for the first time in more than two years.
China’s National Bureau of Statistics’ official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for December was 49.4, missing the 49.9 that analysts polled by Reuters had expected. A measure below 50 signals contraction.
The December PMI fell below an already weak reading of 50 recorded in November and was the weakest since February 2016, according to Reuters. New export orders have fallen for seven months straight.
The non-manufacturing PMI came in at 53.8, higher than the 53.4 measured in November. Services make up about half of the country’s economy.

648,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 30, 2018 09:20PM ET</span>",Hong Kong Stocks Are Set to Mark Their Worst Year Since 2011,"(Bloomberg) -- Hostage to everything from the U.S.-China trade dispute, a global tech sell-off and interest rate hikes, this has been one of the toughest years for Hong Kong stocks.
The benchmark Hang Seng Index is set to end the year down 14 percent, the worst since 2011, with technology shares and trade-war proxy WH Group Ltd. among the most sold. Heavyweight Tencent Holdings Ltd. is on track for its steepest annual loss on record, while drugmakers also joined the worst-performer list following a recent sell-off.
Hong Kong shares will only trade for half the day on Monday as 2018 comes to a close. The Hang Seng was up 1.1 percent as of 10 a.m. WH Group led the gains after U.S. President Donald Trump touted “big progress” in trade talks with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.
The liquid Hong Kong stock market, which has many Chinese listings, is vulnerable to shifts in sentiment. Concerns over slowing economic growth in China -- the latest sign being the weakest purchasing managers’ index since early 2016 -- coupled with an increase in borrowing costs by the Federal Reserve, have dragged down every sector on the broader Hang Seng Composite gauge this year apart from utilities. Hong Kong imports its monetary policy from the U.S. due to a currency peg.
The local dollar has slipped 0.23 percent against the dollar this year, trading at the weak end of its permitted band much for several months as the interest-rate spread between the U.S. made it lucrative to short the currency. Hong Kong’s de facto central bank intervened repeatedly since April to defend the peg.

649,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2018 07:55PM ET</span>",Wall Street may gain Monday but unlikely to mute December losses,"By Jessica Resnick-Ault
BOSTON (Reuters) - Investors could see one last boost to Wall Street stocks in the final trading session of the year on Monday, but they do not expect gains to offset losses in the worst December since the 1930s. 
“I think there’s a chance that the market could rally into the end of the year,” said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
Potential for positive news on a trade dispute with China and anticipation of coming remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell could lift the market, Dollarhide said. Still, no matter how strong any potential rally is, market unease is expected to remain. 
“When you start going through December and it's the worst December since the Great Depression, it leaves a very strong lasting image as to how bad it has been,"" said Dollarhide. ""There’s no getting around that no matter how much we rally tomorrow.”
Last week started off with Wall Street's worst-ever Christmas Eve drop, pushing the S&P 500 to within a whisker of bear market territory. Overall, the global MSCI index, the S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq are headed for their worst years since the 2008 financial crisis.
While data on consumer spending has been strong, housing data has not and the market has been see-sawing amid political insecurity and a U.S. government shutdown. 
""It's a pretty illiquid day Monday ... so I don't think expectations for fireworks are too high,"" said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. ""I think you're seeing a good balance now of buyers coming into the market and providing a more solid base and the potential for a little bit of upside.""
U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested progress has been made in a trade dispute with China, which could boost stocks, Meckler said. Additionally, strong consumer data from Christmas spending could support the market. 
But after the violent swings this month, the last day of trading is expected to be relatively muted. Few companies make major announcements on the last day of the year, and trading volumes are expected to be light.
Disappointing economic data on Friday reinforced caution, including Japan's slowing industrial output and retail sales, declining German inflation, and U.S. data for November showing contracts to buy previously owned homes fell unexpectedly.
Breaking with the bad news, the Chicago Purchasing Management Index came in ahead of consensus.
Major indexes moved in and out of positive territory on Friday, with the Dow and S&P finishing modestly lower, while the Nasdaq eked out a slight gain.
""I think Friday's close should be viewed as very positive for bulls,"" said Oliver Pursche, a board member at Bruderman Asset Management. But despite the turnaround from significant losses in the session, Pursche said investors should be cautious moving into January. ""Investors should expect continued outsized moves to the up and down side.""

Registered U.S. suppliers can export rice to the Asian country with effect from Dec. 27, according to a statement from China’s customs administration on Friday. That follows the conclusion of a phytosanitary agreement and comes before a resumption of bilateral trade discussions in China in January.
“This is a goodwill gesture from the Chinese government before the talks,” said Ma Wenfeng, an analyst with Beijing Orient Agribusiness Consultant Co. But U.S. prices are not competitive compared with supplies from Thailand and Vietnam, China’s main suppliers, and import volumes will probably be limited, said Ma. U.S. supplies would also still be subject to retaliatory tariffs.
China is the world’s biggest rice importer, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, with purchases estimated at 5 million metric tons in the 2018-19 year. Seven U.S. suppliers have registered to export to China, including Farmers’ Rice Cooperative and American Commodity Company LLC, China’s customs said in a separate statement.

651,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2018 07:11PM ET</span>",UK watchdog plans to overhaul treatment of whistleblowers,"By Kanishka Singh
(Reuters) - Britain's markets watchdog said on Sunday that it plans to overhaul its treatment of whistleblowers to make it easier for people to come forward.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said that it would announce details of the plan in the new year but was looking at how it maintains whistleblower confidentiality; how information is shared between supervision and enforcement teams; and how it can enhance senior oversight of investigations.
The plan was first reported by the Financial Times.
The watchdog has called for better protection of people who come forward but has also faced criticism for its own treatment of whistleblowers.
Earlier this year, it was told to apologize to a former Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) employee for having revealed his identity to the bank in a whistleblower case in 2013.
The Financial Regulators Complaints Commissioner, which handles complaints against watchdogs, said that the FCA had failed to take sufficient care to establish whether the complainant had sought anonymity.
Last month, the FCA said that most British banks are not assessing and escalating whistleblower concerns consistently, adding that some of them need to improve arrangements to protect those who lift the lid on wrongdoing from victimization.
The regulator received its highest number of disclosures from whistleblowers after its director for supervision, Megan Butler, warned financial firms in May about failing to tackle sexual harassment.
The disclosures related to racism, physical bullying and homophobia, as well as issues around gender, Christopher Woolard, the FCA executive director for strategy and competition, said this month.

652,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 30, 2018 05:50PM ET</span>",Emerging Markets at Mercy of Trade and Fed After Painful 2018,"(Bloomberg) -- Until a trade dispute between the U.S. and China is resolved, a single tweet on the matter will have the power to ignite rallies and sell-offs.
The tweet in question this week is President Donald Trump’s declaration that “big progress” is being made toward a deal between the U.S. and China, and it may spur gains across emerging markets. The message comes about 10 days before a U.S. government delegation is said to plan a trip to Beijing in the week of Jan. 7 for the first face-to-face discussion between the two sides since early December.
Investors will also be on alert when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell joins his predecessors for an interview on Friday as derivatives traders bet that the central bank won’t hike interest rates in 2019. Some see the next move as a cut in 2020.
“Emerging markets have been particularly hard hit so I expect to see a relief bounce in January,” said Tarek Fadlallah, the Dubai-based chief executive officer at Nomura Asset Management Middle East. “But where do we go after the relief bounce? I think nowhere. The reason why interest rates are not going up in the U.S. is because the economy is not going to be very strong.”
Stocks, bonds and currencies across developing nations are poised for their worst annual performance in three years. The outlook for China’s economy is also key for developing-nation assets, Fadlallah said

656,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2018 04:18AM ET</span>",Defensive stocks top 2019 playbooks,"By April Joyner and Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Perceived safe havens like utilities and consumer staples, often an afterthought in Wall Street's cascade of year-ahead investment recommendations each December, are emerging as top picks as stocks limp into 2019.
Growth-oriented sectors like tech or communications services have typically dominated year-end roundups of investment ideas. But an uncertain economic outlook and concerns the bull market's roar is morphing into a bear's growl have more Wall Street banks telling investors to play it safe.
A Reuters analysis of 2019 outlooks from 10 major financial institutions found eight, including  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC), with ""overweight"" ratings on at least one defensive sector for 2019. That marks a big change from last year, when just two of those banks favored any defensive sectors.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), for instance, has moved its rating on utilities (SPLRCU) to ""overweight"" from ""underweight."" 
""Utilities offering 6 to 8 percent total return with a lower level of risk might actually be a good place to be in an environment where volatility is rearing its head,"" Savita Subramanian, the bank's head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, said during a recent outlook call.
The lack of analyst love for defensive sectors over the years is understandable. 
Appreciated more for their rich dividend yields than share price gains, the utilities and consumer staples sectors have turned in relatively yawn-worthy performances during the long bull run since the March 2009 market bottom.
Utilities and staples (SPLRCS) are up 135 percent and 160 percent, respectively, versus the S&P 500's (SPX) 268 percent gain. The tech sector has jumped 441 percent and consumer discretionary has soared 513 percent.
But defensive sectors have held up reasonably well for the past three months while the market has crashed around them.
Nasdaq is now in a bear market, having recently slid more than 20 percent from its record high in late August, and the S&P 500 earlier this week was just a stone's throw from bear territory.
In recommending defensive sectors, including the health sector (SPXHC) in some instances, many strategists cited decelerating U.S. and global economic growth and the potential for higher market volatility. 
And geopolitical issues such as U.S.-China trade tensions and Britain's exit from the European Union could continue to weigh on U.S. equities in 2019, investors said.
However, U.S. President Donald Trump offered investors a ray of hope 2019 may offer less volatility when it comes to China, tweeting on Saturday that ""big progress"" was being made toward a possible trade deal between the two countries.
Defensive sectors may also benefit from an expected slowdown in the pace of Federal Reserve interest rate increases in 2019.
Because of their higher dividend yields, defensive stocks are seen as bond proxies and do poorly when interest rates and bond yields are on the rise, as they were through much of this year. 
But the Fed is now seen throttling back on rate hikes, and benchmark 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) have retreated to around 2.75 percent, down by roughly half a percentage point from an early November high.
Robert Phipps, director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas, recently added a utilities position to his stock holdings, the majority of which are in growth sectors.
""There's the income component, and it is actually among the few sectors that still has upside momentum,"" he said.
Cyclical and growth sectors are not entirely out of the mix. For instance, RBC Capital Markets has ""overweight"" ratings on consumer staples and healthcare but also on financials (SPSY) and energy (SPNY).
Some investors argue it is too early to jump into defensive sectors with economic and earnings growth expected to continue, albeit at a slower pace. Safe havens are also looking pricey relative to growth stocks. 
Forward price-to-earnings ratios for the S&P 500 consumer staples and utilities sectors are now higher than for the technology sector, according to Refinitiv data. Utilities are the priciest they have been relative to tech stocks in 2-1/2 years.
Still, even some of the more optimistic strategists say a sector allocation shift is warranted. Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. investment strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities in New York, recently upgraded his rating on healthcare to ""overweight.""

""The economy is going to move forward, and I think the market is going to move forward, but they're not going to be led by things that are as cyclical,"" Golub said.

The cyber attack appeared to originate outside the United States, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing a source with knowledge of the situation.
The attack led to distribution delays in the Saturday edition of The Times, Tribune, Sun and other newspapers that share a production platform in Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Times reported.
Tribune Publishing, whose newspapers also include the New York Daily News and Orlando Sentinel, said it first detected the malware on Friday.

(Reuters) - A Hilton hotel in Portland, Oregon fired a security guard and a manager after a black guest captured them on video calling the police to report him for trespassing after he had been speaking to his mother by phone in the lobby, the hotel said on Saturday.
Police responded to the call and escorted Jermaine Massey out of the DoubleTree by Hilton hotel, where he was staying, on Dec. 22, a law firm representing Massey said in a statement. His attorneys said Massey was doing nothing more than ""calling his mother while black.""
Massey videotaped his interactions with the security guard and manager and posted it to Instagram where it was widely viewed. He has called his treatment by the hotel an incident of racial profiling. 
""Following an internal review, we have terminated the employment of the security guard and manager involved in this incident,"" the hotel said in a statement on Saturday. ""Our hotel is a place of hospitality, and their actions were inconsistent with our standards and values.""
The identities of the security guard and manager were not released and they could not be reached for comment.
In the video shared on social media, the security guard can be heard telling Massey that police would be arriving to escort him away. Massey protests that he is staying at the hotel.
""Not anymore,"" the guard responds.
On Friday, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said he was deeply troubled to hear about what Massey went through.
""No one should be treated this way, and I hope this serves as a catalyst for necessary changes that address the systemic nature of discrimination of all forms,"" Wheeler said on Twitter.
Hilton (N:HLT) said in a statement it has no tolerance for racism and was working with the independently owned and operated hotel in Portland to reinforce training on diversity.
Massey's attorney, Greg Kafoury, said Massey plans to sue the Hilton chain over his eviction from the hotel.
In April in Philadelphia, two black men were arrested at a Starbucks after a manager called police to complain that they had not made a purchase and refused to leave.
Online video of their arrests sparked protests and accusations of racial profiling.  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) chief executive Kevin Johnson called that incident ""reprehensible.""

665,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 09:30PM ET</span>",Sears Chair Lampert makes $4.4 billion bid to keep retailer alive,"By Mike Spector, Jessica DiNapoli and Harry Brumpton
(Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp Chairman Eddie Lampert submitted a $4.4 billion takeover bid for the bankrupt U.S. retailer, representing its only chance of escaping liquidation and laying off tens of thousands of workers, a spokesman for the billionaire's hedge fund said on Friday.
Lampert's bid is backed in part by $1.3 billion in financing from three different financial institutions, the spokesman for his hedge fund, ESL Investments Inc, said. It would preserve about 425 stores that Sears has yet to close, and secure the jobs of up to 50,000 workers out of the 68,000 employed by the retailer. An affiliate of ESL, Transform Holdco LLC, submitted the bid, the spokesman said.
People familiar with the matter said the financing comes from Sears' existing lenders Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), as well Royal Bank of Canada, which was not previously a lender, which together agreed to provide a $950 million asset-based loan and a $350 million revolving credit line.
Some of Lampert's bid relies on $1.8 billion of Sears debt that ESL already holds and plans to forgive to back the offer, the sources said. The bid also includes about $400 million in financing from non-bank lenders, the sources said.
The bid contemplates assuming protection agreements Sears has previously sold to reassure customers who have bought appliances, televisions, lawn tractors and other big-ticket items, the ESL spokesman said.
""Factoring for all considerations, we believe that our going concern bid provides the best path forward for the company, the best option to save tens of thousands of jobs and is superior for all of Sears’ stakeholders to the alternative of a complete liquidation,"" the ESL spokesman said. ""Much work remains and there is no assurance our proposal will be completed.""
Sears will now evaluate the bid to determine whether it is viable, and there remains a possibility the company could reject it, some of the sources said. 
A Sears spokeswoman declined to comment. Bank representatives either had no immediate comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A U.S. bankruptcy court judge must approve any sale of Sears. The judge will weigh the opinions of other stakeholders, including unsecured creditors who have argued they could recover more of their investment if the department store operator winds down.
Without the financing or another buyer, Sears faces the prospect of closing its doors for good and putting roughly 68,000 people out of work. 
The 125-year-old retailer filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 15 and developed plans to restructure around the sale of 500 stores and businesses including Kenmore, DieHard and the company's home services division. Only Lampert's ESL offered to buy the entire company. 
The only other bids Sears has received are from suitors interested in pieces of the company and liquidators prepared to run going-out-of-business sales at stores and shut down the retailer.
Sears dates back to the late 1880s. Its mail-order catalogs with merchandise ranging from toys, medicine and gramophones to automobiles, kit houses and tombstones made it the Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) of its time.
But the iconic retailer gradually lost its shine as consumers increasingly favored brick-and-mortar rivals such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and e-commerce.
Lampert, who through ESL is Sears' biggest shareholder and creditor, formed Sears Holdings in 2005 by acquiring Sears Roebuck in an $11 billion deal and combining it with discount chain Kmart, which he had also taken over.
Lampert had pledged to restore Sears to its glory days, when it owned the Sears Tower in Chicago, then the world's tallest building, and companies that included a radio station and Allstate (NYSE:ALL) insurance. But the company stopped turning a profit in 2011, and it gradually started to sell assets, such as its legendary Craftsman brand and many of its properties, to stay afloat.
Sears Holdings listed $6.9 billion in assets and $11.3 billion in liabilities in documents filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York.

The largest U.S. toy retailer, Toys ‘R’ Us, tried to emerge from its 2017 bankruptcy filing but was forced to liquidate six months later after creditors lost confidence in its turnaround plan.

666,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 07:12PM ET</span>","Wall Street rally pauses, but stocks mint weekly gain","By Lewis Krauskopf
(Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended marginally lower in a choppy session on Friday, but major indexes posted weekly gains for the first time in December following a wild few days of trading that saw equities rebound from a prolonged slide.
Major indexes moved in and out of positive territory during the day, action that was emblematic of recent volatility though lacking the huge swings of the past week. The Dow finished modestly lower, while the Nasdaq eked out a slight gain.
With the year coming to an end, investors will be watching key U.S. economic reports next week, including on manufacturing and employment.
“It’s just maybe nervousness ... with another short week coming up,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. ""There’s a lot of potential for moves one way or the other. We have got a lot of data coming in next week.” 
Thursday's trading was marked by a stunning reversal late in the session to build on a rally that started on Wednesday with the biggest single-day percentage gains for the indexes in nearly a decade. 
The week started off with Wall Street's worst-ever Christmas Eve drop, pushing the S&P 500 to within a whisker of bear market territory.
“The market does seem to be forming a tradeable bottom,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors in Boston. ""In the last few days and even including today, you are seeing investors come in and starting to look for some bargains.”
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 76.42 points, or 0.33 percent, to 23,062.40, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 3.09 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,485.74 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 5.03 points, or 0.08 percent, to 6,584.52.
For the week, the S&P 500 rose 2.86 percent, the Dow added 2.75 percent, and the Nasdaq gained 3.97 percent.
Even so, the S&P 500 was on track to drop more than 9 percent in December, its biggest monthly percentage decline since February 2009, during the throes of the financial crisis.
Concerns about trade tensions between the United States and China, instability in Washington as underscored by the partial federal government shutdown, and slowing U.S. corporate profit growth continue to worry investors heading into 2019.
But the recent slide in stocks means valuations are more reasonable, while some market watchers said this week that Wall Street was becoming more confident about the Federal Reserve's approach to interest rate policy and monetary tightening.
“Investors are beginning to price in the fact that they believe the Fed will raise rates at a much slower pace in 2019,"" Arone said.
The rebound in stocks this week comes as investors may be rotating into equities from bonds. U.S. fund investors added $5.2 billion to equity funds in the first net positive flows for such funds this month, while bonds funds saw $8.3 billion in outflows, according to Lipper data for the latest weekly period.
Contracts to buy previously owned homes fell unexpectedly in November, the National Association of Realtors said, the latest sign of weakness in the U.S. housing market.
In corporate news, Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shares jumped 5.6 percent after the electric carmaker named  Oracle Corp  (N:ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison to its board, in response to a demand by U.S. regulators for independent oversight of company management.
Dell Technologies Inc (N:DELL) returned to public markets, nearly six years after the company's founder and chief executive, Michael Dell, took it private.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.97-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.23-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded six new highs and 90 new lows.

About 8 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 9.2 billion-share daily average over the last 20 sessions.

667,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 05:59PM ET</span>",Is China buying U.S. soy? Washington shutdown keeps traders guessing,"By Julie Ingwersen
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Commodity traders are in the dark because of the partial U.S. government shutdown, unable to see daily and weekly reports of agricultural exports to obtain clues as to whether China is following through with promises to buy grain and soy amid the ongoing trade war.
Traders have been anxiously awaiting proof from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that China is ramping up purchases of grains and soy from U.S. farmers, who are preparing their spring planting and trying to secure financing for seeds, fertilizer and land rents.
Now, trade experts and grain analysts warn the suspension of the reports is clouding the marketplace and potentially giving an advantage to big grain companies directly involved in the export trade. The government shut down partially at midnight on Dec. 21.
""We're watching sales to China like a hawk,"" said Ted Seifried, vice president and chief ag market strategist for the Zaner Group.
Beijing resumed buying U.S. cargoes earlier this month, after the two countries agreed on Dec. 1 to a trade war truce. But hefty tariffs on U.S. cargoes remain in place, and there is uncertainty over how much the top U.S. soybean customer will purchase. 
The gap also gives the large commercial grain merchants - such as Archer Daniels Midland Co (N:ADM),  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG), Cargill Inc (CARG.UL) and Louis Dreyfus Corp [LOUDR.UL] - an advantage by allowing them to keep their export deals with countries like China and Mexico out of the public marketplace.
ADM and Cargill said on Friday they had no comment. The other two companies could not immediately be reached for comment.
Rich Feltes, vice president for research with Chicago-based brokerage R.J. O'Brien, said the absence of USDA export sales data can increase the risk involved in trading agricultural markets, pushing speculators to the side.
""It gives a little bit of unfair advantage to exporters who either are or are not making sales, and can trade that information accordingly,"" he said.
Along with its weekly export sales reports, the USDA has issued daily announcements of grain and soybean sales over 100,000 tonnes since 1977. The reporting system was launched in response to the purchase of millions of tonnes of U.S. grain by the Soviet Union in 1972 in deals that resulted in soaring U.S. grain and food prices
FARMERS AT RISK
University of Illinois agricultural economist Scott Irwin said the partial shutdown could also deal a blow to farmers suffering from the U.S.-China dispute, by delaying aid payments meant to help offset some of the losses for crops hit by retaliatory Chinese tariffs in a trade war launched by U.S. President Donald Trump.
""If you're talking about cash in the farmer's pocket, the longer this goes on, the longer it's going to delay that program, which is really just getting ramped up,"" Irwin said. 
The shutdown entered its seventh day on Friday, and was on track to continue into next week and possibly longer. It affects about 800,000 employees of the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Agriculture, Commerce, and other agencies.
If the shutdown persists, it also could jeopardize the release of a host of hotly anticipated monthly and quarterly grain supply and demand reports. 
The USDA on Friday reiterated that the shutdown, if it continues, would halt its World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report and reports by its National Agricultural Statistics Service, which tracks quarterly U.S. grain stocks and U.S. winter wheat seedings.
Those reports, along with an annual summary of U.S. crop production, were scheduled for release on Jan. 11.
In the reports, Feltes said analysts expected to see the USDA trim its estimates of the average 2018 U.S. corn and soybean yields, imply strong feed usage of corn in the first quarter, and shed light on how many acres of winter wheat farmers were able to plant this past autumn, given excessive rains in many areas.

""Those are all bullish influences that we are going to be denied confirmation of,"" he said.

The lawsuit, filed on Friday in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, alleges that a Lion Air-operated Boeing 737 MAX 8 was unreasonably dangerous because its sensors provided inconsistent information to both the pilots and the aircraft.
Boeing declined to comment on pending litigation.
Lion Air Flight 610 crashed into the Java Sea after take-off from Jakarta on Oct. 29.
The complaint was filed on behalf of pilot Harvino's widow and three children, who are all from Jakarta. It also alleges that the instruction manuals provided by Boeing with the two-month-old plane were insufficient, leading to the death of the pilots, crew and passengers. 
In a statement, law firm Gardiner Koch Weisberg & Wrona said Harvino and Flight 610 Captain Bhayve Suneja were both experienced pilots, having logged more than 5,000 and 6,000 flight hours prior to the disaster.     
At least two other lawsuits have been filed against Boeing in Chicago by the Lion Air victims.
A preliminary report by Indonesian investigators focused on airline maintenance and training and the response of a Boeing anti-stall system to a recently replaced sensor but did not give a cause for the crash.
One of the investigators, Nurcahyo Utomo, told reporters it was too early to determine whether or not a new version of the anti-stall system, which was not explained to pilots in manuals, was a contributing factor.

669,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 05:39PM ET</span>",Tesla names close Musk friend Larry Ellison to board,"By Sonam Rai and Ben Klayman
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc on Friday named  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison, a shareholder and self-described close friend of Chief Executive Elon Musk, to its board to provide the independent oversight demanded by U.S. regulators after Musk tweeted about taking the electric carmaker private. 
The move is meant to usher Tesla past months of turbulence following Musk's Aug. 7 tweet that he was considering taking the company private and had secured funding. 
The fallout, which included the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subsequently filing fraud charges against Musk for what it said were his ""false and misleading"" tweets, led some investors to call for stronger board oversight of Musk. 
The inclusion of Ellison puts one of the world's richest people with experience building a startup into a successful company on Tesla's board. He served as a director at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at a critical time for that company – in the five years after Steve Jobs returned to the helm of the then struggling computer maker in 1997, helping oversee one the greatest turnarounds in corporate history.
Joining Ellison on the board, effective Dec. 27, was Walgreens Boots (NASDAQ:WBA) Alliance's global head of human resources, Kathleen Wilson-Thompson.
Charles Elson, director of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware, questioned adding a friend of Musk's and another director with no experience at an industrial company like Tesla.
""Why would you put a friend (on the board) if the idea of the two independent directors were to be objective,"" Elson said. ""Investors who were hoping for two newly objective directors who could stand up to Mr. Musk would be rather disappointed by the choice.” 
Under a court-approved agreement with the SEC, Musk agreed to pay a $20 million fine and step aside as Tesla's chairman for three years to settle charges that could have forced his exit. Tesla also agreed to name the independent directors and a board committee to control Musk's communications. 
SEC officials could not be reached to comment on Friday, but Harvey Pitt, the agency's former chairman, called the addition of Ellison a positive step.
""His personal investment in Tesla stock — said to be his largest personal investment outside of Oracle — means he will be focused on ensuring that Tesla develops profitable strategies,"" Pitt said. ""He also has the stature to stand up to Mr. Musk, should that become necessary.”
Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth said Ellison's ""maverick type CEO traits"" match Musk's.
Ellison bought 3 million shares of Tesla earlier this year. Through a spokeswoman, he declined to comment.
Tesla's shares closed up 5.6 percent at $333.87 on Friday. 
Musk on Friday afternoon tweeted his welcome: ""Excited to have Larry Ellison & Kathleen Wilson-Thompson join the Tesla board!""
In November, Tesla named director Robyn Denholm as board chair, fulfilling one of the SEC's demands. Denholm, who joined Tesla as an independent director in 2014 and agreed to step down as finance chief of Australian telecoms firm Telstra Corp Ltd, spent 11 years as a senior vice president at Sun Microsystems, a unit of Oracle.
Tesla said it conducted a ""thorough, expansive"" search process for the directors, calling Ellison a ""preeminent entrepreneur"" and Wilson-Thompson ""a human resources leader"" and said both had a passion for sustainable energy. They bring the Tesla board count to 11 people. 
The larger-than-life Ellison, like Musk, is known for making bombastic, brash public comments. He went on a diatribe attacking cloud computing at a 2008 analyst conference, which only served to highlight Oracle’s slow move into the space. He undermined Oracle’s business relationship with Hewlett Packard in 2010 in an email to the New York Times that chastised the board for firing its CEO and his friend, Mark Hurd, after a sexual harassment inquiry.
He rarely interacts with journalists or blogs, and has only tweeted once - a 2012 message promoting Oracle’s cloud products.
""VERY CLOSE FRIENDS""
Ellison, said by Forbes magazine to be worth $55 billion, has in the past defended Musk.
""I'm very close friends with Elon Musk, and I'm a big investor in Tesla,"" Ellison, 74, said on a Oct. 26 conference call with analysts.
""This guy is landing rockets,"" Ellison added about Musk, referring to his leadership of SpaceX. ""He's landing rockets on robot drone rafts in the ocean, and you're saying he doesn't know what he's doing. Well, who else is landing a rocket?""
Wilson-Thompson, who could not be immediately reached for comment, spent 17 years at Kellogg Co before joining Walgreens, and serves on the boards of two U.S.-based manufacturing companies.
Musk has gained fans for his bold approach to business and technology, using his almost 24 million Twitter followers to promote Tesla, SpaceX and tunnel venture Boring Co.
But the August claim that he had the funding to take Tesla private, and a subsequent U-turn, stunned Wall Street. It all came as Musk was filmed briefly smoking marijuana during a live Web show and as he called a British diver in the Thai cave rescue a ""pedo.""

Tesla's market cap exceeds that of traditional, established U.S. automakers that make millions of vehicles and billions of dollars in profits annually, and the company has garnered legions of fans despite repeated production issues.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) will pay $575 million to settle claims made by U.S. states, the latest settlement as the bank works to resolve lingering investigations and legal battles stemming from its sales-practices scandal and to remove a punitive asset cap. 
Two years ago, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $190 million to settle federal government claims that the bank created phony customer accounts. Since then, the bank has racked up over $2 billion in penalties as other issues were discovered across most of its business lines. 
Friday’s settlement resolves claims by all 50 states and the District of Columbia related to the accounts, as well as claims that the bank improperly referred and charged customers for a number of financial products like auto and life insurance. “Instead of safeguarding its customers Wells Fargo exploited them,"" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement. ""This is an incredible breach of trust that threatens not only the customer who depended on Wells Fargo, but confidence in our banking system.” 
The settlement, confirmed by Wells Fargo and the offices of various state attorneys general, was first reported earlier by Reuters.
Wells Fargo has been seeking a fresh start after revelations that its employees opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts tangled the nation’s fourth-largest bank in fierce investor and regulatory scrutiny for the past two years.
Over the summer, Wells Fargo launched a marketing campaign saying the bank had been “re-established” this year, but Wells Fargo continued to attract fresh headlines about the customer abuses of the past.
The bank has been working to resolve ongoing investigations and legal battles as it tries to gain approval from the Federal Reserve to lift its cap on assets. 
This year, the bank has settled claims with the New York attorney general, a class of investors and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, but the bank still has a number of probes looming over its bottom line. Wells Fargo still faces probes by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice and the Department of Labor, according to its most recent securities filing.

690,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 01:18PM ET</span>",U.S. retirees try to keep cool as stocks tumble,"By Tim McLaughlin
BOSTON (Reuters) - Nancy Farrington, a retiree who turns 75 next month, admits to being in a constant state of anxiety over the biggest December stock market rout since Herbert Hoover was president.
""I have not looked at my numbers. I'm afraid to do it,"" said Farrington, who recently moved to Charleston, South Carolina, from Boston. ""We've been conditioned to stand pat and not panic. I sure hope my advisers are doing the same.""
Retirees are worrying about their nest eggs as this month's sell-off rounds out the worst year for stocks in a decade, and some fear they are headed for a day of reckoning like the 2008 market meltdown or dot-com crash of the early 2000s. 
Retirees have less time to recover from bad investment moves than younger workers. If they or their advisers panic and sell during a brief downturn, they may lock in a more meager retirement. But their portfolio could be even more at risk if they hold on too long in a prolonged decline.
""I have no way of riding it out if that happens,"" said Farrington. ""I can feel the anxiety in my stomach all the time.""
While many industrialized countries still have generous safety nets for retirees, pensions for U.S. private-sector workers largely have been supplanted by 401(k) accounts and other private saving plans. That means millions of older Americans are effectively their own pension managers. 
Workers in countries like Belgium, Canada, Germany, France and Italy receive, on average, about 65 percent of their income replaced by mandatory pensions. In the Netherlands the ratio of benefits to lifetime average earnings is abut 97 percent, according to a 2017 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development report.
The OECD says the comparable U.S. replacement rate from Social Security benefits is about 50 percent.
U.S. retirees had watched their private accounts mushroom during a bull stock market that began in early 2009. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates near zero for years, enticing retirees deeper into stocks than previous generations as investments like certificates of deposit, government bonds and money-market funds generated paltry income.
At the end of 2016, 69 percent of investors in their 60s had at least 40 percent of their 401(k) portfolio invested in stocks, up from 65 percent in 2007, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington. 
Still, fewer have gone all in on stocks in recent years. Just 19 percent had more than 80 percent of their 401(k) invested in stocks in 2016, down from 30 percent at year-end 2007, according to nonprofit research group EBRI.
""Nothing has gone wrong, but it seems the market is trying to figure out what could go wrong,"" said Brooke McMurray, a 69-year-old New York retiree who says she became a finiancial news junkie after the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
""Unlike before, I now know what I own and I constantly read up on my companies,"" she said.
The three major U.S. stock indexes have tumbled about 10 percent this month, weighed by investor worries including U.S.-China trade tensions, a cooling economy and rising interest rates, and are on track for their worst December since 1931. 
The S&P 500 is headed for its worst annual performance since 2008, when Wall Street buckled during the subprime mortgage crisis. But some are not quite ready to draw comparisons.
""We had lousy forecasts in 2008. The housing market was in a tailspin,"" said 76-year-old John Bauer, who worked for McDonnell Douglas and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co for 36 years in St. Louis. ""Today, employment is way up. The housing market is steady and corporations are flush.""
Still, Bauer said he is uneasy about White House leadership. He and several other retirees referenced U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin's recent calls to top bankers, which did more to rattle than assure markets. U.S. stocks tumbled more than 2 percent the day before the Christmas holiday.
Nevertheless, Bauer is prepared to ride out any market turmoil without making dramatic moves to his retirement portfolio. 
""When it's up, I watch it. When it's down, I don't,"" he said.
And there are some factors helping take the sting out of the market rout, said Larry Glazer, managing partner of Boston-based Mayflower Advisors LLC. 
""Retirees are sensitive to energy prices,"" Glazer said. ""We saw a big decline before the holidays. That's good for the broad economy and there's nothing more psychologically supportive than cheap energy prices.""
Oil prices were hovering near 18-month lows after a week of volatile trading. [O/R]
Rising interest rates have also helped retirees generate more income from their portfolios, Glazer said. 
New York-based writer John Morris, 61, recently wrote his financial adviser ""I don't feel so flush,"" after reading his retirement account statement on Dec. 18.
“I’m not freaking out this week because I have enough savings that in the early years of retirement I would be fine,"" Morris said. Still, he is concerned about the job market and possibly staying employed until he is 70.
Morris worries about a costly long retirement, given his mother lived until almost 90 and his father was nearly 96 when he died.

“The question is, 'Will I have enough money to get me to 96?'""

691,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 12:59PM ET</span>",Dell returns to market with NYSE listing,"(Reuters) - Dell Technologies Inc  returned to public markets on Friday, nearly six years after the company's founder and Chief Executive Officer Michael Dell took it private in what was then the biggest buyout since the financial crisis of 2008.
The computer maker is trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol 'DELL', after it bought back shares (N:DVMT) that tracked the financial performance of software maker VMware (N:VMW), in which Dell held an 81 percent stake. The cash-and-stock deal was worth nearly $24 billion.
Buying back the shares allowed Dell to bypass the traditional IPO process, which would likely have involved grilling by investors over the company's $52.7 billion debt pile.
Dell shares opened at $46 on Friday, marking its market valuation at $16 billion, as per Refinitiv data.
The company was seen as a model of innovation in the early 2000s, pioneering online ordering of custom-configured PCs and working closely with Asian component suppliers and manufacturers to assure rock-bottom production costs.
But it missed the big industry shift to tablet computers, smartphones and high-powered consumer electronics such as music players and gaming consoles later in the decade, and saw sales declining to a little over 10 percent in 2012's fourth quarter on a fall in shipments.
That forced Michael Dell to take the company off the public market, and look at acquisitions to transform his company from a PC manufacturer into a broader seller of information technology services, ranging from storage and servers to networking and cyber security.
The strategy is in sharp contrast to that of rival HP Inc's (N:HPQ), which separated from  Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co  (N:HPE) in 2016, based on the reasoning that two technology companies focused separately on hardware and services would be more nimble.
But Dell's strategy seems to be paying off, especially as corporates are increasingly turning to one-stop shops to help them manage their IT infrastructure on the cloud.
Dell reported a 15 percent rise in revenue in its latest quarter, and said it expects total adjusted revenue in the range of $90.5 billion to $92 billion in 2019.

The company currently holds 17 percent of the global PC market share year-to-date, behind rival HP Inc's (N:HPQ) 23 percent and Lenovo Group Ltd's (HK:0992) 21 percent share, according to data from Canalys.

692,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",U.S. appeals court nixes labor agency's Obama-era 'joint employment' test,"By Daniel Wiessner
(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Friday ruled that a U.S. labor agency's Obama-era standard making it easier to hold companies liable for illegal labor practices by their contractors and franchisees was too broad, giving business groups a victory.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, in a 2-1 ruling, said that a 2015 National Labor Relations Board decision did not properly define the kind of ""indirect control"" over working conditions that the agency said could make companies so-called joint employers of contract or franchise workers. 
Joint employers are required to bargain with contract workers' unions and can be held liable for violating those workers' rights under federal labor law. Overturning the 2015 standard has been a top priority of business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation's largest business lobby, which said the Obama-era ruling threatened to upend supply chains and the franchise model. 
The five-member NLRB, whose current majority was appointed by President Donald Trump, proposed a rule in September that would restore an earlier standard for determining when a company is a joint employer. The board has said it expects to adopt a final rule by June. 
Under the proposal, companies are considered to be joint employers with their contractors or franchisees only when they exercise direct control over issues such as hiring or firing workers and setting wages.
In the 2015 case, the NLRB said that indirect control over the way work is performed could be enough to establish joint employment. The D.C. Circuit on Friday said that could be the case, but the board's definition of indirect control went beyond the traditional legal understanding of what constitutes an employment relationship. 
The court sent the case back to the NLRB with orders to ""confine"" its definition of control over working conditions. 
The decision involved California sanitation company Browning-Ferris Industries Inc, which the NLRB said was a joint employer of workers at a recycling plant who were provided by a staffing agency. 
Lawyers for Browning-Ferris did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nor did an NLRB spokeswoman. 
The NLRB had overturned the Obama-era joint employment standard in a December 2017 ruling. But it wiped out that decision two months later because a board member appointed by Trump was found to have a conflict of interest.
The case is Browning-Ferris Industries Inc v. National Labor Relations Board, U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, No. 16-1063.

The rise on the continent's stock market didn't match, however, the past two-day surge on U.S. indexes that saw the benchmark S&P 500 index gain 5.9 percent, its best performance since late August 2015. 
Christmas week has been a wild ride for investors, with U.S. and European stocks suffering significant losses on Dec. 24. 
Threats continued to lurk with a U.S. government shutdown ongoing after a brief session of Congress on Thursday afternoon took no steps toward ending it.
""It sounds increasingly contrarian but my feeling is that, particularly if we get the transmission mechanism of a lower dollar, stocks outside the U.S. are set up for a good 2019,"" said Chris Bailey, strategist at Raymond James.
Overall, analysts expect earnings from companies in Europe's STOXX 600 to grow 8.4 percent in 2019, the latest Refinitiv IBES estimates show. That's more than the 7.6 percent earnings growth expected for the S&P 500 (SPX).
""My feeling is corporate earnings in Europe will surprise a few people in 2019,"" said Bailey. ""Earnings growth of 8.5 percent is more credible for Europe than for the S&P 500, which is a regime shift.""
All sectors in Europe rose during the session and among them technology (SX8P) jumped 2.4 percent. 
Chipmaker AMS (S:AMS) topped the STOXX with a 10.2 percent leap. 
Tech has been one of the worst-hit parts of the market as investors grew scared that waning economic growth and a U.S.-China trade war would suck the momentum out of high-growth companies.
Banks (SX7P) also rallied, up 2.3 percent since hitting their lowest point since August 2016 on Thursday.

One of the most notable mover was UK inkjet printer technology maker Xaar (L:XAR), whose shares fell 8 percent to their lowest in more than eight years after a profit warning.

709,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Citi cuts Q1 iPhone production estimates on weak demand,"(Reuters) - Citi Research on Friday slashed its first-quarter production estimates for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's iPhones and nearly halved expectations on the costliest iPhone XS Max, joining other brokerages in lowering forecast amid reports of weak demand.
""The material cut in our forecasts is driven by our view that 2018 iPhone is entering a destocking phase, which does not bode well for the supply chain,"" analyst William Yang wrote in a client note.
Citi said it expects the company to make 45 million iPhones for the quarter, down from 50 million it forecast earlier. The cut was mainly due to weak outlook for the iPhone XS Max, analyst William Yang said in a research note.
The brokerage lowered its forecast for the iPhone XS Max, which starts at $1,099, by 48 percent. 
According to a Wall Street Journal report in November, Apple cut production orders for all three iPhone models launched in September.
Shares in Apple's Asian suppliers and assemblers slid in November after several component makers forecast weaker-than-expected sales, leading some market watchers to call the peak for iPhones in several key markets. 
The brokerage that has ""sell"" ratings on iPhone assemblers Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd and Foxconn Technology Co Ltd, said it sees Hon Hai as particularly vulnerable, with higher exposure to the new models. 

In early December, TF International Securities analyst cut first-quarter iPhone shipment estimate by 20 percent. https://cnb.cx/2LhejNR

The regulator said that the firm failed to ""establish and maintain effective procedures"" for identifying and handling wire transfers and for complying with rules on customer due diligence and ""continuous monitoring"" of business relationships.
The HKMA also ordered the Hong Kong unit of the U.S. bank to have an independent external adviser prepare a report into whether its remedial measures were sufficient to address the ""contraventions and other deficiencies"" it had identified.
The action follows an investigation by the HKMA which found that between April 2012 and February 2014 JPMorgan Hong Kong contravened six provisions of the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing rules, the regulator said.
""We look forward to working with the independent adviser who will be appointed to review our current internal controls in Hong Kong to verify that the legacy issues have been addressed by the remedial actions already undertaken by JPMorgan,"" the bank said in an emailed statement to Reuters.
The HKMA statement said that JPMorgan Hong Kong had self-identified and reported certain deficiencies, and had taken ""positive and extensive remediation work"" after it became aware of the lapses. 
""In particular, it has enhanced its control functions to prevent similar contraventions from recurring,"" it said.
The Asian financial hub's regulator has made combating money laundering and terrorist financing a priority, and the HKMA has recently stepped up action against banks for breaches in its 2012 anti-money laundering rules.

In August, the regulator fined unlisted Shanghai Commercial Bank HK$5 million ($638,000) for similar breaches.

716,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 09:38AM ET</span>",Germany paves way for upgrading exhaust systems on older diesel cars,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany on Friday cleared away legal hurdles for carmakers to upgrade exhaust emissions filtering systems on older diesel cars as a way to avoid vehicle bans, but failed to quell doubts among manufacturers and suppliers over the effectiveness of retrofits.
Carmakers have been forced to consider upgrading exhaust treatment systems on older cars after German cities started banning heavily polluting diesel vehicles to cut pollution from fine particulate matter and toxic nitrogen oxides.
The fight over refits is the latest fallout from an emissions cheating scandal triggered by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) in 2015 after it admitted systematically hiding illegal pollution levels from regulators.
An environmental and regulatory backlash ensued and lawmakers and the auto industry are now at odds over how to clean up dirty air in inner cities.
Carmakers want customers to buy new cars with cleaner engines, while environmentalists and consumer groups argue that retrofitting older vehicles may be more cost-effective.
The transport ministry on Friday released a 30-page document setting out guidelines for getting regulatory approval to install upgraded exhaust filtering systems on older cars.
""Now it is the turn of the retrofit industry to develop effective systems to meet all limits and regulations,"" transport minister Andreas Scheuer said in a statement. 
The Federal Motor Transport Authority would grant approval quickly so that the retrofit systems could be offered on the market as soon as possible, he added.
Baumot Group, which makes exhaust filtering upgrade kits, welcomed the guidelines. ""Under a normal vehicle certification process, we believe we can deliver our system in 2019 in a timely fashion,"" said Marcus Hausser, the company's chief executive.
German auto lobby group VDA, however, said that customers should buy new cars rather than spend money on installing new exhaust filtering mechanisms on older vehicles.
""We cannot give a guarantee for a vehicle in which third-party exhaust purification systems have been retrofitted,"" VDA president Bernhard Mattes told Die Welt newspaper. ""If a customer has his vehicle modified, then he and the retrofitter are responsible for any consequential damage.""
German environmental lobby group Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) won a landmark ruling in February to force diesel bans after it sued cities that failed to meet clean air rules.
Cities have considered banning older vehicles which do not conform to the latest Euro 6d engine emissions standards.
Hamburg has banned older diesel cars from the city center, and other cities, including Berlin and Stuttgart, the home of Germany's car industry, are set to introduce similar bans.
Of the 15 million diesel cars on Germany's roads, only 2.7 million have Euro-6 technology. Evercore ISI has estimated that upgrading the exhaust cleaning of just the Euro-5 fleet could cost up to 14.5 billion euros ($17.9 billion).
German carmakers have already agreed to spend up to 3,000 euros ($3,431) per vehicle to upgrade engine management software to make exhaust filtering systems more effective, but environmentalists say these measures are insufficient.
Carmakers are divided over who will pay the retrofit costs, given that most older diesel cars met clean air rules at the time when they were sold.
Volkswagen and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) announced they would cover some retrofit costs, while rival BMW (DE:BMWG) has refused, only proposing incentives to trade in old vehicles for new ones.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said on Friday that customers may not benefit from installing new exhaust systems on older cars. 
""All concepts known to us to date have disadvantages for our customers, such as increased fuel consumption and thus increased CO2 emissions and, in some cases, reduced performance,"" VW research and development head Frank Welsch said in a statement. 
BMW said exhaust system upgrades that would not penalize fuel consumption or cause additional wear and tear could take up to three years to develop and certify.
Selling newer cars through incentives combined with the ramp-up of electric car charging infrastructure would bring down pollution levels in inner cities much faster than trying to retrofit older vehicles, BMW said on Friday. 
Supplier Continental (DE:CONG) supported the carmakers' critical stance. A spokesman said developing retrofits for each model would be extremely costly and time-consuming. 
Paris, Madrid, Mexico City and Athens have said they plan to ban diesel vehicles from city centers by 2025, while the mayor of Copenhagen wants to ban new diesel cars from entering the city as soon as next year. France and Britain will ban new petrol and diesel cars by 2040.

The S&P 500 rose 0.35%, while the Dow gained 0.35%. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1%.
On Thursday, the S&P fell as much as 2.8% but closed 0.8% higher as the markets turned around late in the session.
There will be some economic data to trade shortly after the bell, with the Chicago PMI for December released and pending home sales numbers for November coming.
But there is little else for market moves to hinge on.
""With two trading sessions left before year end, the indices are likely to be supported by window dressing and technical factors,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.
Without much corporate news, geopolitics could again help determing direction.
In a sign of optimism on trade on Friday, China opened the door to imports of rice from the United States for the first time ever in the run-up to talks between the two countries in January.
Cardillo says trading will be supported in part by the news that China is allowing U.S. rice imports ahead of the trade talks.

719,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 08:32AM ET</span>",World stocks at one-week highs as Wall Street extends rebound,"By Julien Ponthus
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks rose to one-week highs on Friday and looked set to snap a three-week losing streak after a late-session bounce overnight on Wall Street filtered into Asian and European markets.
Safe-haven assets were also in demand amid broader doubts about the market stability that in turn eroded the dollar's appeal.
U.S. shares appeared poised for another rise, with futures for the S&P500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq indices all up around half a percent while a pan-European benchmark rose 1.7 percent, reversing Thursday's retreat. 
That took MSCI's all-country equity index 0.6 percent higher, for a weekly gain so far of almost 2 percent. 
Non-U.S. equities have however not matched a two-day surge on Wall Street that saw the S&P 500 gain 5.9 percent, its best performance since August 2015.
While Wall Street's resilience has fueled hope that some of the market pressure may be easing, investors remain wary. 
""The volatility here at year-end is unlikely to be sustained, but without more encouraging signals from Washington, the markets will likely remain treacherous in the New Year,"" Marc Chandler at Bannockburn securities told clients. 
Volatility in Europe and in the United States spiked to highs not seen since a global stock market correction in February, but the main volatility gauge has since subsided to one-week lows.
Among currencies, the dollar slipped 0.55 percent to 110.40 yen and was on track to lose more than 2 percent against the Japanese currency this month. Against the Swiss franc, it declined 0.3 percent to 0.9853 francs.
Another safe-haven asset, gold, inched up to touch a six-month high of $1,282 an ounce. 
The steady drumbeat of disappointing data continued to reinforce caution, with Japan's industrial output contracting in November and retail sales showing sharply. 
In Europe, German annual inflation slowed sharply in December.
The euro and sterling both firmed 0.3 percent against the soft dollar , while an index of emerging market currencies touched three-week highs. 
Chris Bailey, a strategist at brokerage Raymond James, said dollar weakness was good news for non-U.S. assets.
""My feeling is... if we get the transmission mechanism of a lower dollar, stocks outside the U.S. are set up for a good 2019,"" Bailey said. ""Once people get their heads around the fact the U.S. is not going to have yet another double-digit return year in 2019, you can look elsewhere.""
This year though, the annual picture for most assets remains grim, with world stocks for instance losing close to 12 percent so far in 2018 and oil prices falling 30 percent. 
Brent crude futures, which had rebounded after Thursday's 4.2 percent fall, eased back half a percent to $51.9 a barrel as rising U.S. inventories and concern over global economic growth weighed 
On bond markets, yields on safer debt from Germany and the United States rose slightly, though they remained near multi-month lows.
In Italy, 10-year yields are set for their biggest monthly drop since July 2015. The last auction of the year there saw investors willing to buy 10-year government bonds at 2.70 percent, down from 3.24 percent last month. 

The auction could be a sign Italy has turned a corner after months of volatile trading amid fractious talks over its spending plans with Brussels.

721,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 08:05AM ET</span>",Tough to stop Nord Stream 2 now it's being built - EU's Oettinger,"BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's criticism of the Russian-backed Nord Stream 2 pipeline is no reason to stop the project and any attempt to do so would be difficult now that it is being built, European Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said.
Trump has attacked Berlin for supporting the $11 billion gas pipeline spanning the Baltic Sea, accusing Germany in July of being a ""captive"" of Russia due to its reliance on Russian energy.
U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said last month that Washington retained the option of imposing sanctions on companies working on the pipeline, which would bring Russian gas directly to Germany. 
Berlin and Moscow have been at odds since Russia annexed Crimea four years ago, but they have a common interest in the Nord Stream 2 project, which will double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 route from next year.
""I was never a great supporter of Nord Stream 2,"" Oettinger, the EU's budget commissioner, told German magazine Der Spiegel. ""But the truth is the pipeline has long been under construction and can no longer so easily be stopped.""
He added: ""Trump's threats are no reason for that.""
Germany refuses to join opposition to the project from many EU states and - thus far - from the EU executive, describing it as a private enterprise.
Washington is concerned that the pipeline, which will bypass Ukraine by running under the Baltic Sea, will strip Ukraine of important transit revenue and says Moscow is using the project to divide Europe.
Ukraine derives up to 3 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) from transit charges.
Construction of the project is progressing.
Oettinger, a German, pressed Russian gas giant Gazprom (MM:GAZP), which is leading the project, to agree ""a fair deal on the further use of the existing pipelines through Ukraine"".
Gazprom is the sole shareholder in Nord Stream 2, shouldering half of the 9.5 billion euro ($10.89 billion) construction cost. Gazprom's European partners are Germany's Uniper (DE:UN01) and Wintershall (DE:BASFn), Anglo-Dutch group Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), France's Engie (PA:ENGIE) and Austria's OMV (VI:OMVV).

722,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",SNB Ignores Critics and Keeps Negative Rates in Play,"(Bloomberg) -- Swiss National Bank interest rates are stuck to the floor and 2019 could see criticism of the policy growing louder: The financial sector hates it and there’s trouble brewing in the real estate market.
After nine years of economic growth and the eradication of deflation risks, the arguments are building for the SNB to call time on the world’s lowest rates. Switzerland’s banks blame them for crimping profits, and insurers are pumping money into property to get better returns, creating a potential bubble.
According to the Swiss Bankers’ Association, the effectiveness of SNB policy is diminishing as its risks increase. But as the four-year anniversary of the minus 0.75 percent benchmark approaches, President Thomas Jordan’s focus remains on the franc. He’s concerned that tighter monetary policy could push it too high against the euro, hurting exports and the wider economy.
“It was sensible to introduce them in 2015,” said Daniel Kalt, an economist at UBS in Zurich. Yet “the balance between costs and benefits is increasingly shifting against them.”
The SNB set the rock-bottom rate when it scrapped a currency cap that had forced it to spend massively on interventions.
With markets volatile, the currency is now at just over 1.13 per euro -- far stronger than the level of almost 1.70 before the financial crisis or even the 1.20 mark at which the SNB had its cap.
Jordan said this month that shifting policy isn’t necessary and could even be “counterproductive.” As for difficulties for banks and pension funds, he argued that it’s the low-yield environment generally that’s to blame.
“They should begin very quickly with the abolition of negative rates,” said Kurt Schiltknecht, who was chief economist at the SNB in the 1980s before a career in commercial banking. “One needs to make things that hurt the economy disappear as quickly as possible. But I don’t think the SNB shares this opinion.”
The record-low rate initially appeared to help curb Swiss property exuberance as banks pushed up mortgage rates to compensate. But they’ve also encouraged more activity in residential investment property -- with prices up nearly 80 percent over the past 13 years.
Inflation Hedge
Swiss Life Holding AG, the country’s biggest private property owner, has boosted its real estate exposure, primarily with acquisitions in the center of larger Swiss cities. Renato Piffaretti, its head of real estate for Switzerland, said the investments provide “constant, predictable cash flow” and a hedge against inflation.
The proportion of real estate in pension fund portfolios has risen over the past five years, according to asset manager Swisscanto, making them overly exposed to a market downturn.
Both UBS (NYSE:UBS) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Switzerland’s two biggest banks, say negative rates have dragged on profits. They squeeze the margins from customer deposits and loans, according to UBS wealth management chief Martin Blessing.
Concerned about residential investment property risks, SNB officials this month urged the government to take action. But measures such as loan-to-value ratio restrictions may not do much because the major players aren’t borrowing to buy.
According to Credit Suisse economist Claude Maurer, if the central bank is really concerned, the only solution is ending negative rates.
“Typical regulatory measures target debt-financed business and this is self financed,” he said. “So interest rates are the most important lever.”

The blue-chip Dow futures gained 160 points, or 0.69%, to 23,312.50 points by 6:52 AM ET (11:52 GMT), the S&P 500 futures rose 17 points, or 0.69%, to 2,512.25 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 35 points, or 0.55%, to 6,358.38 points.
Although Wall Street began the week with the worst Christmas Eve selloff in its history, buyers quickly entered the market when doors reopened after the holiday with the Dow managing to lodge a record 1,000-point rally.
Thursday saw U.S. stocks start off on the back-foot only to stage their best reversal since 2010 to end in positive territory and the bullish vibe looked set to continue on the last day of the week.
""Selling pressure on U.S. equities is beginning to dissipate, but the VIX index is still around 29 with investor risk sentiment still recovering. A renewed market slide remains a risk,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo
But worries pervade as investors face 2019, with stocks still on track for their worst month of December since 1931 and both the Dow and S&P 500 down more than 6% for all of 2018.
Concerns remain over political turmoil in Washington, unresolved trade issues between the U.S. and China, higher interest rates and a global economic slowdown.
“I think worries regarding the U.S. government shutdown as well as lack of clarity over whether the U.S.-Sino negotiations (over trade) will go well or not still remain,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.
The partial government shutdown entered its seventh day with markets looking ahead to Jan. 3 when Democrats take control of the U.S. House of Representatives.
As U.S. President Donald Trump grapples with Congress over $5 billion in funding for the southern border wall, Democratic chief Nancy Pelosi, incoming House speaker, promised that the chamber will pass a spending bill designed to reopen the government without funding for the border wall.
“We will vote swiftly to reopen government and show that Democrats will govern responsibly in stark contrast to this chaotic White House,” Pelosi said in a statement.
On the economic front, and due to the partial government shutdown, trade balance data and wholesale inventories that were originally scheduled for release Friday will not be published.
However, the Chicago purchasing managers’ index for December is expected to be released at 9:45 AM ET (14:45 GMT), while the National Association of Realtors will publish November pending home sales at 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT).
With regard to oil, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) will release its weekly report on crude inventories at 11:00 AM ET (16:00 GMT), amid expectations for a stock draw of 2.9 million barrels. If confirmed, that would mark the fourth consecutive decline. U.S. crude inventories for the week to Dec. 21 rose by 6.9 million barrels to 448.2 million barrels on increased refinery output, according to data released on Thursday by industry group the American Petroleum Institute.
Also on the radar, Baker Hughes will release its weekly rig count data, an early indicator of future output, at 1:00 PM ET (18:00 GMT).
Ahead of the data, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, was down 0.23% to 95.78 by 6:55 AM ET (11:55 GMT).
In commodities, gold futures slipped 0.01 to $1,281.00 a troy ounce, while crude oil rebounded 2.167% to $45.58 a barrel.

725,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 06:36AM ET</span>",Modi's clampdown on e-commerce in India may not win back votes of small retailers,"By Manoj Kumar
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's new curbs on e-commerce companies may not be enough to win over small store owners and traders in next year's general election, with the key voting bloc still seething over what it sees as broken promises by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
From Feb. 1, e-commerce firms such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart-owned Flipkart Group will not be able to sell products from companies in which they have an equity interest or form exclusive agreements with sellers.
Intended to prevent predatory pricing and deep discounting, the curbs follow intense lobbying by India's many millions of small shopkeepers and the middlemen who serve them, particularly after Walmart (NYSE:WMT) this year spent $16 billion to acquire Flipkart. 
The sector, which includes an estimated 25 million small store owners, largely supported Modi in the 2014 general election. While seeing the new rules as a step in the right direction, many small businesses feel too much damage has been done after Modi went back on promises that he would not allow the entry of foreign companies into the domestic retail sector.
""We clapped and voted for Modi believing in his promises. But what have we got is just a slap on our face,"" said Pankaj Revri, president of a furniture market association in central Delhi.
The curbs, announced on Wednesday, surprised foreign e-commerce firms as little had been done by the government despite over three years of lobbying by domestic retailers.
Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party is widely viewed as panicking after losing five state elections this month. The government, which must hold a general election by May, is also expected to come up with new support programs for farmers as their opposition grows due to low crop prices. 
An opinion poll by TV channel ABP News this week predicted Modi's party could fall short of a majority if the opposition forms an effective alliance in the national election. 
EARNINGS HALVED
B.C. Bhartia, president of the Confederation of All India Traders, said some small businesses had seen earnings more than halve in the last few years as they struggle to compete with low prices offered by the American-controlled behemoths.
""The last minute policy change is too little and too late,"" he said.
In particular, retailers and traders believe Modi turned a blind eye to what they say was the use of policy loopholes by major e-commerce companies to offer heavy discounts that allowed them to seize market share for goods such as electronic items.
Asked about those accusations, Amazon India said in a statement that it had always operated ""in compliance with the laws of the land"" and that had more than 400,000 small and medium businesses on its marketplace.
Flipkart declined to comment on the specific allegations. 
Small Indian businesses have also been bruised by other Modi policies, including a sudden ban on the use of high-value currency notes in late 2016 and the launch of a national sales tax in 2017, both of which raised compliance costs. 
Bhartia said if the government was serious about the concerns of small traders, it should prosecute violators of trade rules and appoint an independent regulator to curb malpractice. 
A government official told reporters on Thursday the administration could consider demands for a regulator in its new e-commerce policy, expected to be released in the coming months. 
A September report by PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated online commerce in India would grow 25 percent a year for next five years, hitting $100 billion a year by 2022.
The new curbs could harm those growth prospects and discourage some foreign investors, said investment consultants. 
""Sentiment is definitely hurt,"" said Harminder Sahni of retail consultant Wazir Advisors, adding that the policy suggested online retail business should only be done by Indians.
Amazon said in its statement it was evaluating the new guidelines to engage as necessary with the government so it could remain true to its vision of ""transforming how India buys and sells and generating significant direct and indirect employment.""
Flipkart said the advent of e-commerce had created hundreds of thousands of jobs and ""the industry was set to be a major growth driver for the Indian economy and create millions of jobs in the future.""
""It is important that a broad market-driven framework through the right consultative process be put in place in order to drive the industry forward,"" it added.
The government boasts of attracting nearly $223 billion foreign investment in the last four years, compared with about $152 billion in the previous four years.

726,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",Japan stocks are a bargain but there are few takers,"By Tomo Uetake and Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - As the developed world's cheapest equity market and home to a rising breed of more profitable companies, the Japanese market should be a safe investment bet. 
Yet fund managers are bypassing it on fears ebbing global growth could knock Japan's economy, home to multinationals like Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Sony Corp (T:6758), which are closely tapped into world supply chains. 
Long dogged by disappointment over the structural reforms Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had promised, it's not hard to see why funds are lukewarm toward the cheap market; the world's third-biggest economy barely escaped recession earlier this year, and the yen hasn't weakened enough to prop up its exports.
In a warning sign of what might be in store, a Wall Street rout this week sent the Tokyo's Nikkei share average crashing into bear market territory, underscoring how synchronized Japan is to the global economic cycle. 
Prospects for global demand are at their most dire in years, hurt mainly by the year-long U.S.-China trade war and the Federal Reserve's steady monetary tightening. 
""Japan is a global cyclical market and it's the wrong time in the cycle,"" said Mark Baribeau, head of global equity at Jennison Associates, one of PGIM's investment arms in Boston, which manages $181 billion in assets. 
""We are very much underweight Japan. At different timing of the cycle, it can be more attractive."" 
It is little surprise then that worries about slowing economic growth and the outlook for corporate earnings have sent investors scampering to the exits. 
The Nikkei (N225) has fallen rapidly from its 27-year peak in early October and is now down 12.1 percent for the year. The Topix (TOPX) has tumbled 21.8 percent from its January high. Exchange data shows foreigners' net selling of Japanese shares is on track to hit the largest ever this year, with their net selling soaring to 13.1 trillion yen ($120 billion), including in cash equities and in futures, at the end of last week. 
(GRAPHIC: Foreign investors in Japan - https://tmsnrt.rs/2RcotET) 
A survey of 44 big, long-only global or international funds by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Japan shows active foreign investors have Japanese stocks at the most underweight since 2010.
ALL JUST BOJ 'MAGIC'? 
Kathy Matsui, Goldman's chief Japan strategist, who visited U.S. clients last month, said many investors there insisted Japan Inc's strong earnings growth was achieved by the help of the Bank of Japan's ""magic"" and thus not sustainable. 
The BOJ's aggressive monetary easing program since 2013 has indirectly weakened the yen  and boosted exporters' profits. The central bank has also supported the market more directly by purchasing hefty amounts of shares every year. 
While the BOJ's stimulus has propped up stocks, it has failed to deliver the primary goal of achieving two percent inflation and to foster sustainable economic growth.
Moreover, critics say the BOJ's purchases of six trillion yen of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) a year has reduced tradable shares and increased market volatility. 
The world's largest money manager BlackRock (N:BLK), which has $6.44 trillion in assets under management globally, downgraded its stance on Japanese equities in July to neutral from overweight. 
Nigel Bolton, London-based chief investment officer (CIO) of international equities at BlackRock, said he sees ""no catalysts for change."" 
Such views come despite the rise over recent years of Japanese companies' notoriously low return-on-equity to levels on par with many European peers. 
And Japanese corporate profits have outpaced America's since Prime Minister Abe took office in December, 2012. Shares are cheap, trading well below 12 times earnings, which is the lowest in six years.

""In Japan, you are paying 2008-style discounts and Japanese companies have out-earned both European and U.S. companies. It's just that no one wants to pay for it,"" said Norman Villamin, Zurich-based CIO at Swiss private bank Union Bancaire Privée, with 128 billion Swiss francs ($130 billion) in assets.
Indeed, many investors see these improvements as cyclical, and have doubts about the sustainability of earnings growth.
""You've seen Japanese returns on equity rising to about the 10 percent level - it's very solid by traditional Japanese standards. But the question is if it's going to go up or down here,"" said Ned Gray, global and international value equity CIO at Macquarie Investment Management in Philadelphia. 
Mustafa Sagun, equities CIO at Principal Global Investors, with $451 billion in assets, said the Iowa-based asset manager remained modestly underweight Japan over the past couple of months. ""After the (post-Fed) selloff, there are great value opportunities in Asia, including Japan. But our stance did not change,"" Sagun said, referring to a sharp equities downturn after the latest Fed rate hike this month - the fourth for the year.  
""The catalyst needs to be resolution of uncertainty regarding potential trade wars and U.S. interest rates.""

The C919, which will compete with Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 and the Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A320, is widely regarded as a symbol of China's civil aerospace ambition and President Xi Jinping's policy of upgrading manufacturing capabilities.
In a statement on its official microblog, Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL] said the plane landed safely at Shanghai Pudong International Airport at 12:45 p.m. (0445 GMT), having flown for 1 hour and 38 minutes. 
The jet will next fly to the city of Xian in central China for more test flights with a focus on aircraft flutter and airspeed calibration, the company said.
The second prototype of the C919 jet conducted its first flight in December 2017, seven months after the maiden flight of the first C919.
COMAC said it is assembling a further three prototypes, and that all six will be scheduled to conduct flight tests next year.
The C919 has dozens of customers that have placed orders and commitments for 815 jets.

COMAC is aiming to obtain certification for the plane from Chinese regulators by the end of 2020, as well as Europe's aviation safety regulator, which agreed in April to start the certification process.

Sinopec’s stock is now down almost 22% from Dec. 3 and hit a one-year low on Friday.
“The government inspectors were looking into the company’s operations for the past few years… one of the problems they found was the severe trading losses in the second half of this year because of wrong market judgement,” an unnamed source told Reuters.
Sinopec released a statement on the same day confirming the suspension of Unipec President Chen Bo and the company’s Communist Party of China representative Zhan Qi “due to work reasons” but did not link the suspension to any wrongdoing. Rather, Sinopec said the losses at Unipec were related to crude oil transactions and were related to drops in the price of oil.

734,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2018 01:23AM ET</span>",Nissan to make fewer cars in China in months ahead as demand slows: source,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) will produce 30,000 fewer vehicles in the coming months in China than what it had planned, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters, as global automakers grapple with falling demand in the world's biggest car market.
After  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380), Nissan becomes the latest automaker to cut production in the country, where slowing economic growth and a crippling trade war with the United States have pummeled vehicle sales in the past few months.
Nissan plans to cut production in China by a total of 30,000 units during the December-February period from its initial output plans, said the person who declined to be identified as the plans are not public.
Automakers set initial plans on how many vehicles to produce at each of their plants. These plans can be modified due to demand, supply chain issues and other factors. It was not known how much Nissan had planned to produce in the three months.
The automaker produced nearly 400,000 units in the country during the three-month period ended February this year. The period covers the first two months of the year, when sales usually slow in the run-up to the Lunar New Year holidays.
Japan's Nikkei business daily reported late on Thursday that Nissan plans to cut production at three plants in China, including one in Dalian, where it produces the popular Qashqai and Infiniti QX50 SUV crossover models, and in Zhengzhou, where it makes the X-Trail SUV crossover, one of its top-selling models, and Venucia brand models. 
A Nissan spokeswoman in Beijing declined on Friday to comment on future production plans.
China is Nissan's second-largest market, accounting for roughly one-quarter of its annual global vehicle sales. It sold 1.5 million vehicles in China last year, and earlier this year said it planned to boost sales to 2.6 million units by 2022, making China its biggest market in terms of vehicle sales.
But a stretch of booming demand for cars in China seems to have come to an end, with the market on track to post a fall in annual sales for the first time since at least 1990. Nissan's group sales in China rose 3.9 percent in the January-November period, slowing from a 12 percent jump a year ago.

A slowdown in the major market comes at a time when the Japanese automaker is grappling with a scandal involving alleged financial misconduct of Carlos Ghosn, leading to his arrest and subsequent ouster as chairman, and straining ties with French automaking partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).

The previous chairman, Matthias Warnig, stepped down earlier this week after six years at the world's largest aluminum producer outside China. His resignation was a condition of the deal.
Jean-Pierre Thomas was elected by the board as chairman with effect from Jan. 1, Rusal said in a filing to the Hong Kong bourse.
Thomas, 61, has been an independent non-executive director on Rusal's board since June. He was a managing partner at Lazard investment bank for 15 years, leaving in 2013.
He has also been a non-executive independent director on the board of French metals producer Recylex since 2009.
The U.S. Treasury said last week it would remove sanctions against Rusal, its parent En+ and power firm EuroSibEnergo if they restructured to reduce the controlling stakes of businessman Oleg Deripaska, who is on Washington's sanctions list.
The deal is subject to a 30-day review period in the U.S. Congress. After the restructuring is completed, En+ will retain the right to nominate the producer's chief executive, the U.S. Treasury has said earlier.
""Mr. Thomas has in-depth experience with Russian relations, having been tasked with several projects aimed at boosting economic cooperation between France and Russia,"" Rusal said in a disclosure in June.
Hong Kong-listed shares of Rusal rose 2 percent on Friday and were on track for their biggest monthly percentage gain in a year.

Despite last night’s gains, all three U.S. major indexes remain down more than 9% for December following losses earlier in the month.
In Asia, China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component gained 0.4% and 0.2% respectively by 10:12 AM ET (03:12 GMT). Fresh concerns over Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763) were in focus after Reuters reported, citing three sources familiar with the matter, that U.S. President Donald Trump is considering an executive order to ban American companies from using telecommunications equipment made by the two companies.
The British newspaper The Times also reported that Britain's defence minister Gavin Williamson said he has ""grave, very deep concerns about Huawei providing the 5G network in Britain.""
The news came one day after Bloomberg said U.S. and China are set to resume talks in early January. Earlier in December, the two countries agreed to a 90-day grace period on implementing additional tariffs.
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.3% in morning trade after closing 3.9% higher on Thursday. Official data showed the country’s industrial output fell 1.1% month-on-month in November, compared with a median market forecast of a 1.9% decline and a 2.9% increase in October.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 rose 0.5%. Rio Tinto Ltd (AX:RIO) announced that it does not expect to cut jobs in 2019 despite the plans to deploy automated heavy-haul trains.

""Early results indicate significant potential to improve productivity, providing increased system flexibility and reducing bottlenecks,"" Ivan Vella, Rio Tinto's iron ore managing director Rail, Port & Core Services, said."
738,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2018 08:54PM ET</span>",Green Growth to launch hostile bid for pot producer Aphria,"By Harry Brumpton
(Reuters) - U.S. cannabis retailer Green Growth Brands Ltd (CD:GGB) said on Thursday it would make a hostile takeover bid for  Aphria Inc  (TO:APHA) in an all-stock deal valuing the Canadian pot producer at C$2.8 billion ($2.06 billion).
Several companies are looking to partner with or buy pot firms to explore opportunities in the Canadian cannabis sector after the country legalized recreational use of marijuana in October.
Green Growth would offer 1.5714 shares for each Aphria share, representing a premium of 45.5 percent over Aphria's closing price on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Dec. 24. The offer is based on a valuation of C$7.00 per Green Growth share.
Aphria did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Green Growth said its advisers reached out to Aphria last week after a meeting with the company and after having taken a tour of its facilities earlier this year.
Green Growth then arranged a call with the Aphria board that included a presentation laying out their offer, Green Growth CEO Peter Horvath told Reuters, adding that the company did not hear back from Aphria.
The rationale underlying the bid was recent market declines which also hit the cannabis sector. Among Green Growth's strengths are a U.S. market footprint and experience, and its $54 million in trailing 12-month revenue already outstrips Aphria's, Horvath said.
Green Growth said its retail strength and Aphria's low-cost cultivation and near-term production capacity would create a strong combination. 
Earlier this month, Marlboro cigarette maker  Altria Group  Inc (N:MO) invested $1.8 billion in Cronos Group Inc (TO:CRON), representing by far the biggest investment by a major tobacco conglomerate in a cannabis company. 
Green Growth said it had engaged Aphria's board for a ""friendly business combination"" before launching the hostile bid and claimed it has the support of Aphria shareholders who hold about 10 percent of the outstanding shares.
The company disclosed that it has acquired a ""meaningful toehold position"" in Aphria but did not reveal the size of the stake. 
U.S. listed shares of Aphria (N:APHA) rose 23 percent after the bell.
Canaccord Genuity is Green Growth's financial adviser and Norton Rose Fulbright Canada LLP its legal adviser. Kingsdale Advisors is its strategic shareholder and communications advisor and depositary.

Frost was among 10 people and 10 associated entities charged by the SEC on Sept. 7 with involvement from 2013 to 2018 in the manipulation of three companies' share prices.
The SEC accused various defendants of buying large blocks of penny stocks at steep discounts, promoting the shares, and then quietly selling their stock at inflated prices, generating more than $27 million of improper gains.
Frost was allegedly involved in two of the schemes, the SEC said.
Now 82, Frost is worth $1.9 billion, Forbes magazine said on Thursday.
He had been chairman and chief executive of Ivax Corp before selling that drugmaker for $7.4 billion in 2006 to Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA), where he later served as chairman.

741,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2018 05:41PM ET</span>",Wall Street roars back late to keep rally going,"By Lewis Krauskopf
(Reuters) - U.S. stocks roared back to end in positive territory on Thursday following steep losses for much of the session, as equities rebounded for a second day.
The failure of an initial selloff to gain more momentum lent credence to the idea that the extended bout of selling pressure may be coming to an end for now, investors said.
The gains come a day after the major indexes posted their biggest daily percentage increases in nearly a decade. The S&P 500's two-day percentage gain of 5.9 percent is the best performance for the benchmark index since late August 2015 when the market was in the midst of a downturn over a slowing China. 
Even so, all three major indexes remain down more than 9 percent for December. The S&P 500 is on track for its biggest annual percentage drop since 2008.
""The market is right now in a psychological frenzy, both good and bad,"" said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors in New York. ""There’s fear of the market going down; there’s fear of missing the rebound.""
Stocks were lower for most of Thursday's session, and strategists said such a pullback was to be expected following the huge jump on Wednesday, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1,000 points for the first time.
Almost in unison, stocks across market sectors began rising around 2:30 p.m. ET, shortly after the S&P 500 briefly broke below 2,400, a level that has been repeatedly tested during the last several days of choppy trading. 
From there the index surged 3.8 percent to close at its highest point in a week.
Even the clutch of technology and internet stocks that were the biggest drags through the first several hours of trading recovered most or all of their losses. Apple Inc (O:AAPL) gained 4 percent from its low and Amazon Inc (O:AMZN) shot up 5 percent; both finished the day about 0.6 percent lower. 
 Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), which had been among the biggest drags on the S&P 500, surged 4.8 percent to finish 0.6 percent higher on the session, ending up as the third-biggest boost to the index.
“I just think that the selling has been exhausted in the near term. When yesterday’s rally only retraced a portion this morning, buyers came back in at the end of the day,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, in New Vernon, New Jersey. “The general feeling is that a near-term bottom has been put in.”
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 260.37 points, or 1.14 percent, to 23,138.82, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 21.13 points, or 0.86 percent, to 2,488.83 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 25.14 points, or 0.38 percent, to 6,579.49.
All 11 major S&P 500 sectors finished in positive territory, with materials (SPLRCM) as the biggest percentage gainers.
Investors also said the steep pullback in recent months, which has seen the Nasdaq confirm a bear market and the S&P 500 come within a whisker of doing so, may have created some bargains that are attracting buyers.
""Certainly there are folks that do recognize an opportunity, they stepped in, but then other people see it as a selling opportunity so that is kind of the back and forth,"" said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois.
Trade tensions between the United States and China, an expected slowdown in U.S. corporate profit growth and the general health of the economy remain concerns for investors heading into 2019.
A measure of U.S. consumer confidence posted its sharpest decline in more than three years in December, deflating some optimism a day after a report that holiday sales were the strongest in years helped mollify concerns about the health of the economy.
“The consumer has been a big support for this economy and if all of a sudden the consumer starts to get a little bit anxious and spending slows down, that’s going to have an impact,” said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) in Boston.
About 9 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, just below the 9.2 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 7 new highs and 270 new lows.

743,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2018 04:52PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Chile to delay arbitration with top lithium producer Albemarle,"By Antonio De la Jara
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile will delay a previously announced arbitration with  Albemarle  Corp (N:ALB), the world's top lithium producer, in anticipation that the U.S.-based miner will make a new offer to bring it into compliance with a 2016 contract, a source close to the negotiations told Reuters.
Under the contract, U.S.-based Albemarle had agreed to provide as much as 25 percent of its annual production at a discount to companies seeking to produce battery metals within Chile.
But state development agency Corfo, which leases mining rights to Albemarle in the lithium-rich Salar de Atacama, had in October threatened to refer the dispute to the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce, saying the miner had failed to make a ""serious"" offer to the companies, thus violating the terms of its contract.
The source with knowledge of the negotiations told Reuters attorneys for Albemarle and Corfo had continued conversations recently and that Corfo anticipated Albemarle would soon make a more favorable offer.
Albemarle did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Albemarle had previously said it regretted the disagreement, but decried what it considered the ""substantial difference"" between the contractual agreement and what Corfo is now demanding.
The contract clause that requires Albemarle to provide the ultralight battery metal at a reduced price is intended to help spur a value-added lithium industry.
In March, Corfo awarded contracts to Chile's Molymet, China's Sichuan Fulin Industrial Group and a joint venture between Samsung (KS:005930) SDI Co Ltd and South Korea's POSCO to produce battery components in Chile using discounted lithium from the Atacama, for a total investment of $754 million.

All of the projects are awaiting resolution of the contract dispute with Albemarle, Corfo has said.

The $940 million rail project, AutoHaul, is focused on driverless train movement to transport ore to the company's port operations and has been in development since 2012. 
""Early results indicate significant potential to improve productivity, providing increased system flexibility and reducing bottlenecks,"" Ivan Vella, Rio Tinto's iron ore managing director Rail, Port & Core Services, said. 
Rio Tinto operates about 200 locomotives on more than 1,700 km of track in Pilbara to transport ore from 16 mines to four port terminals. 

In 2017, Rio Tinto's iron ore chief Chris Salisbury had said the company would look to develop an ""intelligent"" iron ore mine at a cost of $2.2 billion by fully incorporating technologies such as robotics and driverless trains and trucks on a single site.

Renault, and its alliance with Nissan Motor Co (T:7201), has been in the spotlight after the partnership's architect Carlos Ghosn was arrested in mid-November in Japan amid allegations his Nissan income was understated. 
The CGT wrote to French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire in early December questioning the way Renault had handled the affair and to denounce a lack of transparency at RNBV, a joint Renault-Nissan holding company based in the Netherlands, FranceInfo reported on Thursday. 
A CGT spokesman confirmed the union had reached out to Le Maire and to Renault's deputy CEO Thierry Bollore, adding it was calling for clarity on additional wage payments made via RNBV to an unidentified member of the French carmaker's executive committee. 
""Workers have no information about RNBV,"" the CGT spokesman said. 
Spokesmen for Le Maire and for Renault declined to comment. The French state owns 15 percent of Renault. 
Executives from both carmakers in the Renault-Nissan alliance looked at least twice at legal ways to pay Ghosn undisclosed income through the partners' shared finances, including via RNBV, Reuters reported earlier in December.
The two efforts discussed were ultimately abandoned. 
Ghosn, who remains Renault's chairman and chief executive but was ousted as Nissan's chairman, has been in a Tokyo jail since mid-November. 

He had been expected to possibly go free on bail last Friday but was re-arrested by Japanese prosecutors on new allegations of making Nissan shoulder $16.6 million in personal investment losses.

760,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2018 01:28PM ET</span>",Dramatic stock market rally runs out of steam,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
(Reuters) - A dramatic global stock rally faded on Thursday after a fall in Chinese industrial profits and in U.S. consumer confidence offered reminders of the pressures on the world economy.
Still, an index of world stocks stayed off near two-year lows hit earlier this week before Wednesday's 1,000 point-plus surge on the U.S. Dow Jones index, which was attributed to the strongest holiday sales in years.
""Yesterday was a blowout day for U.S. equity markets which triggered optimism that this could be a key reversal day but the upward momentum has not really followed through,"" said Lee Hardman, an analyst at MUFG in London.
""One reason is that maybe the sharp move higher was driven by year-end rebalancing, which exaggerated the scale of the rebound, and now we have reverted to the trend which has been in place most of this month.""
That trend is toward weaker stock, U.S. dollar and oil prices along with stronger demand for safe-haven government bonds, gold and Japanese yen.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.85 percent and U.S. crude fell 2.29 percent to $45.16 per barrel after each staged big rallies the day prior. [O/R]
In a sign some consumers are getting nervous about the economy amid volatile stock markets and the partial shutdown of the U.S. government, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index dropped to a five-month low in December and came in weaker than even the lowest economists' estimate in a Reuters poll.
Earlier, markets in mainland China as well as Hong Kong closed weaker after data showed earnings at China's industrial firms dropped in November for the first time in nearly three years.
A Reuters report added to the gloom around the world's second-biggest economy, saying the White House was considering barring U.S. firms from buying telecoms equipment from China's Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763).
That overshadowed positive noises from the U.S. government on trade talks with Beijing, its efforts to temper the White House's recent broadsides against the Federal Reserve and a report showing the number of Americans filing applications for jobless benefits fell marginally last week in a sign of labor market strength. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 366.52 points, or 1.6 percent, to 22,511.93, the S&P 500 lost 42.95 points, or 1.74 percent, to 2,424.75 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 144.79 points, or 2.21 percent, to 6,409.56. (N)
""So far, we don't see a shift in fundamentals. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China remain the biggest unknown factor for 2019,"" said Hussein Sayed, a strategist at online brokerage FXTM.
There were also renewed concerns in Italy, where troubled lender Banca Carige was denied a cash call by its largest shareholder, pushing its shares down 12.5 percent.
The concerns over a faltering global economy and signs of an oil glut pressured crude prices a day after their 8 percent rally. U.S. Treasury prices also reversed direction after falling sharply on Wednesday, with the 10-year note last rising 15/32 in price to yield 2.7452 percent. 
Another safe-haven, gold, was up 0.9 percent to $1,277.68 an ounce, around a six-month peak. 
Investors also bought yen, strengthening that currency 0.68 percent against the greenback at 110.62 per dollar. Against a basket of trading partners' currencies the dollar was down 0.54 percent. 

""We have started to see the yen regain its place as the safe haven of choice,"" MUFG's Hardman said.

761,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",Tesla's Musk says cave rescuer's defamation case should be dismissed,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Elon Musk, Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) chief executive, asked a U.S. judge to dismiss a lawsuit by a British diver who helped rescue a boys soccer team trapped in a Thailand cave and said Musk defamed him by calling him a pedophile and child rapist.
In a filing on Wednesday with the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Musk's lawyers said their client's comments about Vernon Unsworth were free speech protected by the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment even if they lacked any factual basis.
They also said Musk's ""over-the-top"" comments came amid a ""schoolyard spat on social media,"" including Twitter, where participants ""expect to read opinions, not facts,"" and that no one could have reasonably believed they were truthful.
These statements were ""just imaginative attacks; even if offensive, such speculative insults are by their nature opinion and protected by the First Amendment,"" the lawyers said.
Musk on July 15 called Unsworth a ""pedo guy"" in a tweet to more than 22 million Twitter followers, a comment for which he later apologized. He also urged a BuzzFeed News reporter in an Aug. 30 email to investigate Unsworth and ""stop defending child rapists.""
Unsworth has denied those allegations. 
He said he became a target after rescue divers declined to use a mini-submarine offered by Musk's SpaceX rocket company. Unsworth told CNN the offer was a ""PR stunt"" and the device would not have worked.
L. Lin Wood, a lawyer for Unsworth, rejected Musk's defense, saying it would effectively doom all lawsuits over alleged false and defamatory attacks on reputation published online.
""Mr. Musk does not let the facts or well-established law get in the way of his novel but inaccurate contentions in his motion to dismiss,"" Wood said on Thursday. ""I am confident the trial court will likewise reject this fanciful position.""
A hearing is set for April 1, 2019.
Unsworth, who lives in Hertfordshire County north of London, sought at least $75,000 in compensatory damages plus unspecified punitive damages in his Sept. 17 lawsuit.
The soccer team, including 12 boys and a coach, was freed from the cave on July 10 after an 18-day ordeal.
Musk has faced other litigation over his Twitter use. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused him of securities fraud for saying he had ""secured"" funding to take Tesla private for $420 per share, a big premium.
On Sept. 29, Musk agreed to pay a $20 million fine and step aside as the Palo Alto, California-based electric car company's chairman for three years to settle the SEC case.

The case is Unsworth v Musk, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 18-08048.

777,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2018 11:51AM ET</span>","Exclusive: White House mulls new year executive order to bar Huawei, ZTE purchases","By David Shepardson and Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is considering an executive order in the new year to declare a national emergency that would bar U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by China's Huawei and ZTE, three sources familiar with the situation told Reuters.
It would be the latest step by the Trump administration to cut Huawei Technologies Cos Ltd [HWT.UL] and ZTE Corp (HK:0763), two of China's biggest network equipment companies, out of the U.S. market. 
The United States says the companies work at the behest of the Chinese government and that their equipment could be used to spy on Americans.
Huawei and ZTE did not return requests for comment. Both in the past have denied that their products are used to spy. 
Rural operators in the United States are among the biggest customers of Huawei and ZTE, and worry that they may also have to rip out existing Chinese-made equipment without compensation. Industry officials are divided on whether the administration could legally compel operators to do that.
The executive order, which has been under consideration for more than eight months, could be issued as early as January and would direct the Commerce Department to block U.S. companies from buying equipment from foreign telecommunications makers that pose significant national security risks, sources from the telecoms industry and the administration said. 
While the order is unlikely to name Huawei or ZTE, a source said it is expected that Commerce officials would interpret it as authorization to limit the spread of equipment made by the two companies. The sources said the text for the order has not been finalized.
The United States and China are locked in a trade war that has disrupted the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars of goods. 
The executive order would invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law that gives the president the authority to regulate commerce in response to a national emergency that threatens the United States. 
The issue has new urgency as U.S. wireless carriers look for partners as they prepare to adopt next generation 5G wireless networks. 
In August, Trump signed a bill that barred the U.S. government itself from using Huawei and ZTE equipment. 
A White House official said the United States was ""working across government and with our allies and like-minded partners to mitigate risk in the deployment of 5G and other communications infrastructure,"" but stated that the White House had nothing further to announce. 
The Wall Street Journal first reported in May that the order was under consideration, but it was never issued.
HIT TO RURAL NETWORKS
While the big U.S. wireless companies have cut ties with Huawei in particular, small rural carriers have relied on Huawei and ZTE switches and other equipment because they tend to be less expensive.
Huawei is so central to small carriers that William Levy, vice president for sales of Huawei Tech USA, is on the board of directors of the Rural Wireless Association.
The RWA represents carriers with fewer than 100,000 subscribers. It estimates that 25 percent of its members had Huawei or ZTE equipment in their networks, it said in a filing to the Federal Communications Commission earlier this month.
The RWA is concerned that an executive order could force its members to remove ZTE and Huawei equipment and also bar future purchases, said Caressa Bennet, RWA general counsel. 
It would cost $800 million to $1 billion for all RWA members to replace their Huawei and ZTE equipment, Bennet said.
Separately, the FCC in April granted initial approval to a regulation that bars giving federal funding to help pay for telecommunication infrastructure to companies that purchase equipment from firms deemed threats to U.S. national security, which analysts have said is aimed at Huawei and ZTE.
The FCC is also considering whether to require carriers to remove and replace equipment from firms deemed a national security risk.
In March, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said ""hidden 'back doors' to our networks in routers, switches — and virtually any other type of telecommunications equipment - can provide an avenue for hostile governments to inject viruses, launch denial-of-service attacks, steal data, and more.""
In the December filing, Pine Belt Communications in Alabama estimated it would cost $7 million to $13 million to replace its Chinese-made equipment, while Sagebrush in Montana said replacement would cost $57 million and take two years.

Sagebrush has noted that Huawei products are significantly cheaper. When looking for bids in 2010 for its network, it found the cost of Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) equipment to be nearly four times the cost of Huawei.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) is taking advantage of a Brexit hit to UK asset prices to buy a majority stake in Britain's second-busiest airport, London's Gatwick, for 2.9 billion pounds ($3.7 billion), the construction company said on Thursday. 
The deal to buy a 50.01 percent stake gives Vinci, which already runs 45 airports in 12 countries, access to the world's largest metropolitan aviation market and is part of the company's drive to expand its most promising businesses.
Vinci Airports President Nicolas Notebaert signalled uncertainty over Britain's departure from the European Union next March had cut the price of buying into Gatwick, and forecast any hit to UK economic growth after Brexit was likely to be offset by a rise in tourism due to a weaker pound. 
""Just a few months ago we would not even have dreamed of being able to acquire an unlimited licence in the London airports system for less than 20 times core earnings,"" he said on a conference call, referring to the price of the deal. 
The acquisition is expected to close by June 2019. 
It comes just days after drone sightings caused 36 hours of chaos for more than 100,000 travellers at Gatwick. CEO Stewart Wingate, who will remain in his role, said the airport was working to avoid a repeat of the disruption. 
Thirty miles (48 km) south of London, Gatwick serves 228 destinations in 74 countries and is a major base for airlines including EasyJet (L:EZJ) and British Airways (L:ICAG). 
It handles over 46 million passengers per year, more than a quarter of the 170 million passenger journeys the London airports system - led by Heathrow - handled in 2017.
Vinci says Gatwick is the most efficient airport in the world and operates the busiest single runway, which in 2017 achieved a record 950 flights in one day. 
Gatwick plans to serve growing demand by optimising its existing runway and boosting use of its standby one. 
FRENCH AIRPORTS GIANT
Vinci is buying Gatwick shares from existing shareholders.
Investment group Global Infrastructure Partners will halve its stake to 21 percent, while Abu Dhabi Investment Authority will own 7.9 percent, California Public Employees' Retirement System 6.4 percent, National Pension Service of Korea 6 percent and Australia's Future Fund Board of Guardians 8.6 percent.
The deal follows Vinci's purchase this year of the airport management portfolio of Airports Worldwide, which allowed it to enter the United States and expand in Europe.
Notebaert said the deal would ""not in the least"" affect Vinci's interest in Paris airports operator ADP (PA:ADP), which the government plans to privatise.
""For ADP, all depends on the terms the government will set in coming months. We have the financial and operational capacity,"" he said. 
Vinci operates airports in countries including France, Portugal, Britain, Sweden, Serbia, Cambodia, Japan, United States, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Chile and Brazil. In 2017, its network handled over 180 million passengers. 
To counter signs of weakness in its construction business, the company has been expanding into faster growing and more profitable concessions such as airports and motorways.
In 2017, Vinci Airports' managed activities revenue was 3.2 billion euros, with consolidated revenue at 1.4 billion euros. 
Between 2014 and 2017, Vinci Airports' revenue grew 196 percent, driving the concessions business up 19.3 percent. Vinci Construction's revenue fell 9.5 percent over the same period.
At 1403 GMT, Vinci shares were little changed at 70.5 euros.

But given the tremendous rally the session before, it’s unsurprising some investors are locking in gains.
The Dow fell 1.5%, while the S&P 500 lost 1.46%. Both indexes rose nearly 5% yesterday.
The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.47% after jumping nearly 6% the day before.
""Such rallies are not uncommon in troubled times, and we have experienced many of them in past bear markets,"" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.
""To call for a bottom, we need at least a couple of days of strength, not just in price, but also in trading volume, breadth of the market, and fundamentally supported environment. Until we see a shift in fundamentals, it's challenging to build on a single-day rally.""
Traders and investors also said technical market factors contributed to Wednesday's rally as the S&P was its most oversold in years by some technical measures.
The FAANG stocks, which all gained more than 5% Wednesday, started in the red.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) lost 1%, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) slipped 1.3% and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was down 1.8%.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which soared more than 9% yesterday on encouraging retail numbers, dropped 1%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell 1.2% as Reuters reported that the company will begin assembling its top-end iPhones in India through the local unit of Foxconn as early as 2019.
In financials,  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) lost 1.7% after the company agreed to pay $135 million to settle claims that it improperly handled transactions of American Depositary Receipts.
And Visa (NYSE:V) fell 2,2% after the company said it would acquire British payments firm Earthport for about $250 million.
On the economic front initial jobless claims fell unexpectedly, but not by much. Claims for first-time unemployment benefits fell by 1,000 to 216,000.

The California-based carmaker, led by billionaire Chief Executive Elon Musk, has opened a wholly-owned financial leasing unit in Shanghai's free trade zone with registered capital of $30 million, according to China's National Enterprise Information Publicity System.
Its scope includes leasing and consultancy, the document said, which listed the firm's legal representative as Zhu Xiaotong, Tesla's boss in China.
Tesla declined to comment.
The company has opened a tender process to build its Shanghai Gigafactory and at least one contractor has started buying materials, Reuters reported earlier this month.

The $2 billion factory, Tesla's first in China, marks a major bet by the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) maker as it looks to bolster its presence in the world's biggest auto market where it faces rising competition from a swathe of domestic EV makers and its earnings have been hit by increased tariffs on U.S. imports.

796,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 27, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",Investors Are More Wary of Trump Than of Wall Street,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Stock market losses and volatility, particularly in financial stocks, have people worried about, well, everything.
This recent selloff is historic in scale but strange because so far, it's hard to identify a specific culprit behind it. The jitters could be chalked up to the hawkishness of the Federal Reserve, the flattening of the yield curve, trade wars, the relationship between the U.S. and China, projections for slower economic growth in 2019, financial market liquidity issues near year-end … or President Donald Trump. He is certainly at the center of investors' crisis of confidence this time, as the financial system was during the slump of 2008.
The best way to think about this confidence juxtaposition might be Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tweeting Sunday afternoon that he had calls with the CEOs of Wall Street banks to make sure they had enough liquidity in light of recent market conditions. This was bizarre for a couple of reasons. First, with memories of the financial crisis still relatively fresh in the minds of market participants, nothing spooks investors more than a high-ranking official saying there's nothing to worry about in the financial system. Second, the banking system has dramatically reformed over the past decade. The Federal Reserve now puts out an annual report in June called the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which dictates the extent to which banks return capital to shareholders. This isn't like 2007, when regulators were fumbling in the dark about the risk exposure and stability of the nation's largest banks.
It would have made more sense for the bank CEOs to be calling the White House to check in on the state of affairs there.
The next triggering event like the collapse of Lehman Brothers is not likely to look like the collapse of Lehman Brothers. It might well be the ouster of Trump, as key bulwarks remove their support of the administration and others start to step back – a spiraling crisis of confidence like a run on a bank.
What has prevented such a spiral so far? The one area in which Trump has maintained relatively decent approval ratings: the economy. That public support has kept his own party strongly in his corner.
But cracks have been forming. The struggles of the administration to replace Trump's chief of staff, attorney general and secretary of defense show that party luminaries are increasingly reluctant to tie their fortunes to the White House. January will be a key test to see whether Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives, plus the impact of the stock market slump, do further damage to the administration.
Here's the scenario that should keep the White House up at night: First the stock market fails to recover, which negatively impacts the public's view of how Trump is handling the economy. Trump's approval among Republicans drops, especially plausible as they may be more sensitive to the stock market than the public at large is.
Then the conversation in the media starts to shift. Already, in response to the stock market drop, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman says Republicans need to consider removing Trump from office. Next, retired Republican officials start to say the same. So do the Republican members of Congress who face competitive elections in 2020. The conservative media starts to come aboard, saying that Trump will be a drag on the party's fortunes in 2020 and threaten a whole host of conservative priorities, from tax cuts to immigration restrictions to reshaping the judiciary to redistricting in the 2020s. Eventually, Republicans in the Senate join their Democratic colleagues in voting to impeach.
This may sound implausible when so much of the past two years has been defined by Trump's base sticking with him, with expressions like ""fake news"" and ""nothing matters"" coming to define an era of entrenched partisanship. But the Democratic takeover of the House, the stock market crash, a new level of turmoil in the White House, and the dawn of a new presidential election cycle might spell the end of Trump's immunity. Something will matter."

The blue-chip Dow futures fell 344 points, or 1.50%, to 22,528.0 points by 6:59 AM ET (6:59 GMT), while S&P 500 futures lost 36 points, or 1.46%, to 2,432.00 points. Meanwhile the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 96 points, or 1.53%, to 6,181.62 points.
Volatility was in full force in a topsy-turvy week for U.S. stocks that began with their worst Christmas Eve ever only to stage record gains on Wednesday that included the biggest rally in the S&P 500 since 2009 and the largest point increase in the history of the Dow.
Background sentiment has seen little change as a deadlock on Capitol Hill was in focus and concerns over the trade dispute between the U.S. and China were unresolved.
""I think worries regarding the U.S. government shutdown as well as lack of clarity over whether the U.S.-Sino negotiations (over trade) will go well or not still remain,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.
The partial government shutdown entered its third day with little hope of an imminent resolution as U.S. President Donald Trump grappled with Congress over $5 billion in funding for the southern border wall.
Trump reiterated the need for border security while visiting troops Wednesday at the Al Asad Air Base in Iraq. “The American public is demanding a wall,” he insisted.
Weak data out of China, showing the first drop in industrial profits since December 2015, reminded investors that trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies remain.
Although China and the U.S. have made plans for face-to-face consultations over trade in January, a clear solution to the trade conflict is elusive.
For Thursday’s session, although the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau will not publish economic data during the ongoing partial government shutdown, the Labor Department is still expected to publish weekly jobless claims at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
With the U.S. labor market showing strength, attention will likely focus on the Conference Board’s consumer confidence for December, due at 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT). Consensus is looking for the index to dip to 133.7 from the prior 135.7 in what would be its weakest reading in four months.
Ahead of the data, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, was down 0.27% to 96.32 by 7:09 AM ET (12:09 GMT).
In commodities, gold futures rose 0.32% to $1,273.85 a troy ounce, while crude oil slumped 2.49% to $45.45 a barrel.

S&P 500 Index futures contracts expiring in March fell 1.9 percent and traded around 1.5 percent lower as of 10:20 a.m. in London. The retreat came after the underlying gauge rallied 5 percent Wednesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average contracts were also down 1.5 percent while those on the Nasdaq 100 were down 1.8 percent.
In Europe, markets returned from their two-day Christmas break to reverse early gains. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.6 percent with nearly all the sub-groups in the red, led by drops in utilities and real estate shares. With only three trading days left, equities in the region are heading for the worst year since the 2008 financial crisis.
Equity bulls flooded the stock market stateside on a flurry of developments on Wednesday:
Wednesday’s rally is unlikely to be sustained as the “fundamentals haven’t shifted,” said Kyle Rodda, a Melbourne-based market analyst at IG Group Holdings Plc. “Markets are still nervous about how financial markets and the global economy will go during a cyclical slowdown without central bank support,” he said by phone.
History shows that not every miracle resurrection in equities is a dead-cat bounce, though it is true that strong rallies are common in prolonged market slumps. In eight previous bear markets, the S&P 500 has experienced rallies of greater than 2.5 percent more than 120 times as the benchmark plunged from peak to trough, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
A U.S. government shutdown and trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies are among reasons for investor caution.
“You’re going to get this push and pull in markets where there’ll be big up days and big down days because no one really can get a good grasp on where things ought to be at this point in time,” Rodda said.

804,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 27, 2018 02:30AM ET</span>",Historic U.S. Stock Surge Sees Limited Momentum: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest rally in American equities since 2009 flowed powerfully through to Japanese stocks, but had little momentum thereafter, with mixed trading in U.S. and European futures and in emerging Asian stocks. The dollar gave up some of Wednesday’s advance.
Contracts on the S&P 500 swung between modest gains and losses after American benchmarks soared 5 percent on signs of robust consumer spending, easing concern about the tenure of the Federal Reserve chief and progress on U.S.-China trade talks. Tokyo’s Topix Index closed almost 5 percent higher, leading in Asia, while Australian shares rallied 1.9 percent. Hong Kong and Shanghai saw declines, while Korean stocks were little changed. Treasury yields dipped after climbing yesterday. Crude oil also retraced some of Wednesday’s surge.
The jump in Japanese shares, the biggest in two years, followed a sell-off that pushed the Topix gauge into a bear market on Tuesday. The benchmark is still valued at 11.8 times estimated earnings, near the cheapest level since 2012.
“The market right now is very bumpy,” Banny Lam, head of research at CEB International Investment Corp., said on Bloomberg Television. Investors are sifting through “how many policy risks are actually on the table,” he said. For Hong Kong stocks, Lam anticipates renewed declines over the coming quarter, before signs of rebounding Chinese growth stoke gains later in 2019.
Just one of the S&P 500 members fell on Wednesday, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 1,050 points for its biggest-ever point gain. Consumer shares paced the rally, with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). jumping 9.5 percent on record holiday sales. Investors also drew comfort from White House adviser Kevin Hassett’s assurance that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s job is “100 percent” safe.
‘Choppy Trade’
It’s still a horrible month for U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 down almost 11 percent. Japan’s Topix is even worse, with a 14 percent slide. Emerging markets have done better, thanks to expectations of less aggressive tightening by the Fed. The Shanghai Composite is off less than 4 percent, for example. And China’s yuan, along with most major Asian currencies, is up against the dollar this month.
“We could still be choppy here and in a bit of a trading range” for stocks, Matt Miskin, a market strategist at John Hancock Financial Services, told Bloomberg Radio. “You’re getting whipsawed from all this different information hitting the markets.” For the S&P 500, he said “we do not see a real sustainable breakout past the prior highs in the near term.”
The yuan was little changed after news that a U.S. government delegation will travel to Beijing in two weeks to hold trade talks with China.
Trading in the U.K. and Europe will resume after a two-day holiday.

805,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2018 02:10AM ET</span>",Japan's Nomura aims for increased deal-related business in U.S. push: CEO,"By Taiga Uranaka
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nomura Holdings Inc (T:8604) aims to increase its share of business arranging foreign exchange hedging, acquisition finance and other deal-related services for corporate clients in the United States, the CEO of Japan's biggest investment bank said.
The bank is in the process of re-allocating global resources to shift its growth focus to the Americas, which has the world's largest pool of investment banking fees. It is trying to build up businesses there without taking on bigger risks.
""Our key words are 'America', 'corporate clients' and 'solutions business',"" Koji Nagai told Reuters in an interview.
He said Nomura's global markets business - involving the trading of fixed income and equity - remains an important source of revenue but is not currently under consideration for further expansion.
""Rather, our focus is on advisory and primary business, which are not subject to market risks to the same degree and do not use our balance sheet much,"" he said. Primary business includes helping client companies issue stocks and bonds.
""In addition, we will expand our solutions business such as acquisition finance and foreign currency exchange services for deals we advise on.""
Nagai forecasts the expansion of Nomura's client financing and solutions business in the United States and elsewhere to boost revenue by $250 million in the medium term.
Nomura has made U.S. expansion of its investment banking arm one of its priorities as it strives to earn more stable income from advisory services. Its recent hires include bankers covering healthcare, technology and financial services.
The U.S. push comes after major restructuring in 2016, which included significantly shrinking its European operations, resulting from its acquisition of Lehman Brothers' Asian and European businesses in 2008.
Nomura suffered three consecutive quarters of pretax loss in its overseas business through September. Earnings in the latest quarter were also weighed down by a one-time 20 billion yen ($181 million) charge, part of a settlement with U.S. authorities regarding the sale of residential mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis.
""We will absolutely keep our global platform though we have been shrinking businesses that are unprofitable and not needed by our clients,"" Nagai said.

The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component both slipped 0.2% by 1:22 AM ET (06:22 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was also down 0.5%.
The fall in Chinese stocks came after data showed the country’s industrial profits fell 1.8% to 594.8 billion yuan in November from a year earlier.
The decline was due to slowing growth in sales and producer prices, and rising costs, He ping of the statistics bureau said in a statement accompanying the data.
Rising trade tensions with the United States also piled pressure on China's manufacturing sector, analysts said, although recent reports seemed to suggest there may be some progress made on the trade issues between the two countries.
Citing two people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that a U.S. government delegation would hold trade talks with Chinese officials in the week of Jan. 7.
Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Jeffrey Gerrish will lead the Trump administration’s team, which will also include Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs David Malpass, Bloomberg said.
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei 225 outperformed its regional peers and surged 3.9% in afternoon trade. Australia’s ASX 200 gained 1.9%, while South Korea’s KOSPI was little changed at 2035.6.
Overnight, Wall Street recovered from the steep losses suffered in the previous session and recorded the biggest rally since 2009.
U.S. stocks gained as White House’s economic adviser Kevin Hassett told reporters that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell 's job was not in jeopardy, easing some market worries about his future.
U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticised the Fed over the past few days, calling it ""the only problem our economy has"" in a tweet. Trump also said on Tuesday that the Fed was ""raising interest rates too fast because they think the economy is so good.""
The central bank has hiked overnight rates four times this year.

808,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>",Activist fund Argyle asks Toshiba to exit TEC business to boost margins,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Hong Kong-based activist fund Argyle Street Management asked Japan's Toshiba Corp (T:6502) on Thursday to exit more non-core businesses such as office machinery company Toshiba TEC (T:6588) to bolster margins of the once-mighty conglomerate.
Toshiba has already announced exits from its British nuclear power and U.S. LNG businesses as part of a plan to regain investor confidence after a 2015 accounting scandal uncovered widespread irregularities and forced it to recognize huge cost overruns at its now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse. 
""We believe that further firm commitments to divest other non-core businesses (such as Toshiba TEC for instance), would be well received and affirms management’s commitment to decisive execution of its plans,"" the investment fund said in a letter sent to Toshiba CEO Nobuaki Kurumatani and shown to Reuters.
The fund also reiterated its call for the company to boost share buybacks to 1.1 trillion yen ($901.5 million), calling its current 700 billion yen repurchase launched in November ""grossly insufficient"".
Toshiba had substantial excess capital, and a higher buyback would make sense ""especially with the current depressed share price of Toshiba"", the fund said. 
It also called on the company to hire more board members with international experience.
""As a long-term shareholder of Toshiba, we may feel the need to propose an agenda item at the AGM next year should we feel that our suggestions have not been given due consideration,"" the fund said.
Toshiba could not immediately comment.
It was not immediately clear how much stake Argyle owned in Toshiba.
Argyle had previously opposed Toshiba's sale of its chip business to a Bain Capital-led group, saying the deal undervalued the prized unit. The sale was completed earlier this year.

810,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 26, 2018 09:00PM ET</span>",Traders See End to ‘Feverish Fear-Mongering’ After Stocks Surge,"(Bloomberg) -- Some Asia equity traders greeted U.S. stocks’ best rally since 2009 -- and subsequent strong gains in Japanese shares -- with conviction that this is more a turning point than a dead cat bounce.
As Japan’s Topix index and Nikkei 225 Stock Average jumped more than 3 percent on Thursday, following an almost 5 percent advance in the S&P 500 Index, they pointed to economic conditions in the U.S., which they say don’t justify the December equities rout. Any doubts about the health of the American economy were called into question during the Asian night when Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). surged 9.5 percent after reporting record holiday sales.
“The recovery should put to rest the feverish fear-mongering that had investors believing the investment world as we know it was coming to an end,” said Stephen Innes, head of Asia Pacific trading at Oanda Corp. “The fear mongering and doom-and-gloom prophecies were not based on current U.S. economic fundamentals,” he said. “There’s a lot of money parked on the sidelines. So bargain hunters came back with a bang, but it’s a stark reminder never to underestimate the purchasing power of the U.S. consumer.”
While Asia-based traders were sleeping, some potentially positive news also emerged on the trade war front. A U.S. government delegation will travel to Beijing in the week of Jan. 7 to hold trade talks with Chinese officials, two people familiar with the matter said, in the first face-to-face discussion the two sides have held since President Donald Trump and China’s Xi Jinping agreed on a 90-day truce in Argentina this month.
Kiyoshi Ishigane, chief strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management Co. in Tokyo, says he’s watching those developments and Federal Reserve officials’ speeches for hints about any potential changes in monetary policy. But like Innes at Oanda, he’s taking a positive view on the rebound. “There will be ups and downs, but I think buying could persist for two to three weeks,” he said. “What happens with the U.S.-China trade issue will be something to keep an eye on.”
Here’s what other market participants are saying about the rally:
‘Irrational Market Moves’
“This spike demonstrates that much of the short-term market moves appear irrational,” said Jim McCafferty, the head of equity research for Asia ex-Japan at Nomura Holdings Inc. “The volatility of markets is inevitably caused by the prevalence of active-quant strategies. This gives an opportunity for the rational active investor who believes in company fundamentals.”
Short Squeeze?
“While I’m sure there was some long-only buying involved, given the severity of the move it definitely feels like more of a short squeeze,” said Andrew Jackson, head of Japanese equities at Soochow CSSD Capital Markets in Singapore. “It will take more than Donald Trump saying the market is oversold to make it rally like this.”
Earnings Concerns
“Stocks fell too much until now,” said Kazuyuki Terao, chief investment officer for the Japan arm of Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors. “But the concern surrounding corporate earnings will linger quite a bit. I don’t think we’re entering a phase where stocks are set for a rebound track from here. There’s quite a bit of concern surrounding cyclical sectors like technology companies and machinery” for both the U.S. and Japan.

812,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 26, 2018 08:40PM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Slide After S&P 500 Stages Best Comeback Since 2009,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stock-index futures fell on Thursday, suggesting investors aren’t prepared to build on the biggest rally in American equities since 2009.
S&P 500 Index futures contracts expiring in March fell as much as 0.6 percent after the underlying gauge rallied 5 percent Wednesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq 100 index futures also dropped as much as 0.6 percent.
Equity bulls flooded the stock market stateside on a flurry of developments on Wednesday:
Wednesday’s rally is unlikely to be sustained as the “fundamentals haven’t shifted,” said Kyle Rodda, a Melbourne-based market analyst at IG Group Holdings Plc. “Markets are still nervous about how financial markets and the global economy will go during a cyclical slowdown without central bank support,” he said by phone.
History shows that not every miracle resurrection in equities is a dead cat bounce, though it is true that strong rallies are common in prolonged market slumps. In eight previous bear markets, the S&P 500 has experienced rallies of greater than 2.5 percent more than 120 times as the benchmark plunged from peak to trough, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
A U.S. government shutdown and trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies are among reasons for investor caution.
“You’re going to get this push and pull in markets where there’ll be big up days and big down days because no one really can get a good grasp on where things ought to be at this point in time,” Rodda said.

The Thomson Reuters United States Most Shorted Index rose 6 percent, the biggest percentage rise in its six-year history, as some investors moved to cover bearish bets on the 51 stocks in the index, some of which were at their lowest price in years.
The gain came as the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged more than 1,000 points in a single session for the first time, in a broad stock rebound that pulled the benchmark S&P 500 index back from the brink of a bear market.
""This is a short-covering rally,"" said Michael Antonelli, managing director of institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.
""The move you see is just everybody trying to get out of these super, super bearish positions that they have been in, that have been easy to make money in,"" he said.
U.S. stocks have been battered this month by fears of slowing economic growth and worries about a potential conflict between the White House and the Federal Reserve, putting the S&P on pace for its worst December since the Great Depression.
""From the day the market opened in December, if you just went short the market every morning, you were making money at the close,"" said Antonelli.
Short-sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price.
The rally in heavily shorted names exerted pressure on short-sellers to at least partly cover their bets, analysts said.
""The shorts realize that they probably shouldn't be too greedy here,"" said Brett Ewing, chief market strategist at First Franklin Financial Services in Tallahassee, Florida.
Several components of the Thomson Reuters United States Most Shorted Index rose sharply from multi-year lows on Wednesday.
Shares of home furnishing retailer Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (O:BBBY), which on Monday fell to a two-decade low, rose 9 percent on Wednesday.  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP), which dropped to a record low last week, rose 4.6 percent. Shares of  California Resources Corp  (N:CRC) rebounded 22 percent from their lowest since early March.

Abercrombie & Fitch Co (N:ANF), another component of the index, rose 10.5 percent.

815,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2018 06:21PM ET</span>",Ex-Insys CEO to plead guilty to opioid kickback scheme,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - The former chief executive of  Insys Therapeutics Inc  (O:INSY) has agreed to plead guilty to participating in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe a powerful opioid medication in order to boost its sales, U.S. prosecutors said on Wednesday.
Michael Babich, who resigned as the Arizona-based drugmaker's CEO in 2015 and was due to face trial next month, has agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy and mail fraud charges, federal prosecutors in Boston disclosed in a court filing.
Five former Insys executives and managers indicted along with Babich, including John Kapoor, the company's founder and former chairman, remain scheduled to go on trial in late January. They have pleaded not guilty.
The terms of Babich's plea deal were not disclosed, and it was unclear whether he would agree to cooperate with prosecutors and testify at that trial, as has another former Insys executive who recently pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy.
Prosecutors requested a Jan. 9 plea hearing. A lawyer for Babich, 42, declined to comment.
The case centers on Subsys, Insys' under-the-tongue spray for managing pain in cancer patients. It contains fentanyl, an opioid 100 times stronger than morphine.
Prosecutors allege that from 2012 to 2015, Kapoor, Babich and others conspired to bribe doctors in exchange for prescribing their patients Subsys. Prosecutors said they also defrauded insurers into paying for Subsys.
Prosecutors allege Insys paid doctors kickbacks in the form of fees to participate in speaker programs ostensibly meant to educate medical professionals about Subsys that were actually shams. 
The case has been brought amid a national opioid addiction epidemic. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids were involved in around 47,600 overdose deaths in 2017.
Babich, who was originally indicted in 2016, is married to a former Insys sales representative, Natalie Babich, who in 2017 pleaded guilty to conspiring to pay kickbacks and became a government witness.
She testified this month at the trial of Christopher Clough, a former physician assistant in New Hampshire accused of accepting kickbacks from Insys. A federal jury in Concord, New Hampshire convicted Clough on Dec. 18.

In August, Insys said it had agreed to settle a related U.S. Justice Department probe for at least $150 million.

Following Wall Street's worst-ever Christmas Eve drop in the previous session, the advance was also fueled by investors' reversing bets against a wide range of stocks. By the close, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq had notched their largest daily percentage gains in nearly a decade.

Concerns about the economic growth outlook, the U.S.-China trade dispute and rising interest rates have dogged stocks since the end of summer, and the major indexes are still down more than 10 percent this month alone, with three more trading days left in the year.
Traders and investors said technical market factors also contributed to the rally. By some technical measures, the S&P was its most oversold in years following Monday's sell off.
U.S. 2018 holiday sales rose 5.1 percent from a year ago to over $850 billion, the strongest gain in six years, according to a Mastercard (NYSE:MA) report. The S&P 500 retailing index <.SPXRT> jumped 7.4 percent, while shares of online retailer Amazon (O:AMZN), which touted a ""record-breaking"" season, climbed 9.4 percent.
Stocks found their footing after wobbling in morning trade. The S&P 500 came within 2 points of being down 20 percent from its late-September closing high, the threshold commonly used to define a bear market. 
""The market is extremely oversold where we left it"" on Monday, said Brett Ewing, chief market strategist at First Franklin Financial Services. ""You cannot make the assumption that this correction is over, but today's action is definitely a very positive signal.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 1,086.25 points, or 4.98 percent, to 22,878.45, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 116.6 points, or 4.96 percent, to 2,467.7, and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 361.44 points, or 5.84 percent, to 6,554.36.
The previous record point gain for the Dow was 936.42 on Oct. 13, 2008, during a period when markets were whipsawed almost daily by developments in the financial crisis, which was then in full swing. Over the two sessions following that gain, the Dow dropped more than 800 points. 
On Wednesday, short-covering was feverish as the Thomson Reuters United States Most Shorted Index <.TRXUSPMSHRT> enjoyed its best percentage rise in its six-year history.
""The move you see is just everybody trying to get out of these super, super bearish positions that they have been in, that have been easy to make money in. ... This is a short-covering rally,"" said Michael Antonelli, managing director of institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird.
""These kind of moves, as fun, as exciting as they are, you just don't see this kind of stuff in healthy, normal markets,"" he said. 
All 11 major S&P 500 sectors ended in positive territory, with the technology sector (SPLRCT), after being beaten up during the recent pullback, rising 6.1 percent. Only one of the S&P 500's components,  Newmont Mining  (N:NEM), finished down on the day. 
The S&P broke a four-session streak of declines. But despite Wednesday's surge, it remained on pace for its biggest monthly percentage drop since February 2009, during the throes of the financial crisis.
""Given the two months we’ve been through, it’s hard to look at one day and say it’s all over,"" said Christopher Smart, head of macroeconomic and geopolitical research at Barings.
Indeed, S&P 500 futures  weakened modestly when trading resumed later on Wednesday to kick off the overnight session. 
Even so, Smart said, “If you look at simple valuations in this market, it’s clearly much more attractive than it was over the summer and I think it means that it’s hard to see a lot more downside from here.”
The head of the U.S. Federal Reserve faces no risk of losing his job and President Donald Trump is happy with his Treasury secretary, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said in an apparent attempt to calm Wall Street nerves.
The most recent decline in stocks followed the Fed's policy meeting last week when the U.S. central bank raised interest rates again, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell did not soften his tone about the outlook for further financial tightening to the degree investors had hoped. 
""I think the market is realizing that the Fed is open to being more flexible,"" Ewing said.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.84-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.80-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 194 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded eight new highs and 529 new lows.

About 9.5 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 9.1 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

817,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2018 06:09PM ET</span>","In Japan, a scramble for new workers disrupts traditional hiring","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO(Reuters) - It's a rite of spring in Japan: Major corporations hire fresh university graduates en masse every April, starting them all at the same salary with assurances of rising pay and lifetime employment.
But lately, some companies, including Rakuten (T:4755), SoftBank (T:4726) and Line Corp (T:3938), are breaking with that tradition, signing up new employees with coveted technical skills months earlier - and paying them more than other new recruits.
As competition for workers grows in Japan's shrinking labor pool, traditional seniority and group dynamics are giving ground to the more individualized, merit-based employment system found in the West.
It is a welcome sign for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government and the central bank, which have been pushing for a more flexible labor market that would boost wages and revive consumption.
Takashi Murakami, a 23-year-old producer at  Mercari  (T:4385), which developed a popular flea market app, says seniority-based pay and lifetime employment are relics.
""I'm grateful that the company seems to value me with pretty good pay,"" he said. ""I already got a pay hike after joining the company, which motivated me to work even harder. Merit-based pay is more fitting to the times.""
In recent years, Mercari said, it has been hiring college students throughout the year to grab workers with needed skills. The company even offers jobs to some second-year or third-year students.
Mercari also has a program called ""Mergrads"" to provide internships and training to improve new graduates' skills.
And since April, it started offering higher pay to some job candidates with skills in information technology engineering and computer programming, said Ayano Okuda of Mercari, who is in charge of hiring new graduates. She declined to discuss the company's pay scale.
""The competition is surely heating up,"" she said. ""We judge each individual's ability and offer them attractive salaries reflecting their skills."" 
MASS HIRING
For decades, Japan's traditional spring hirings underpinned the economy and provided a clear corporate and social ladder, grounded in - and reinforcing - the cultural emphasis on loyalty and conformity.
Under Japan's often choreographed business practices, the Keidanren, the largest business lobby, had a ""voluntary"" timetable that many companies followed: Start recruiting new employees on March 1, begin job interviews with fourth-year students on June 1 and informally offer jobs on Oct. 1 - six months before graduation.
Labour ministry data show the entry-level salary stands at about 200,000 yen ($1,775) a month, compared with roughly 30,000 yen in 1968, or 130,000 yen in today's money. 
Demand for workers is stronger now than it has been in decades; there are 1.62 jobs available per applicant, nearly a 44-year high.
In response, the Keidanren decided to ditch its timetable guidelines by spring 2021, meaning member companies are expected to follow them until then.
But more companies, particularly in ""new economy"" industries such as technology and e-commerce, have adopted much more flexible hiring practices, including offering select employees higher pay.
DISPARITY
Internet advertising firm  CyberAgent Inc  (T:4751) scrapped its uniform starting pay scale in April.
Now it offers annual starting salaries ranging from 4.5 million yen ($40,000) to 7.2 million yen ($64,000) or more for IT engineers, who account for about 40 percent of its 5,000-person workforce. 
""We face stiff competition in securing able workers,"" said Yuko Ishida of CyberAgent.
That means some young, incoming employees are paid more than their older co-workers. CyberAgent pays exclusively based on ability without taking seniority into account, Ishida said.
""Our competitors are also offering better salaries for high-quality workers, so we believe we can attract able workers by offering appropriate salaries,"" she said. 
Although some say Japan is long overdue for a shift toward a more flexible, merit-based employment system, it could upset long-standing social order.
""If it spreads throughout corporate Japan, it would mean a collapse of Japan's employment system,"" said Hisashi Yamada, a senior economist at Japan Research Institute and an expert on labor issues.
""That would cause a disparity among workers, causing uneven distribution of work and loss of motivation among those who feel left behind,"" he said.
To sustain long-term growth, he said, companies will need to balance maintaining ""in-house order"" with rewarding performance and valued skills, while the government must step up efforts to make Japan's job market more flexible.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Coast Guard said on Wednesday it was searching for a British crew member who went overboard from a  Royal Caribbean  Cruises Ltd (N:RCL) cruise ship in the Atlantic Ocean.
Arron Hough, 20, went overboard 267 miles (430 km) off the northwest of Puerto Rico on Tuesday, a spokesman for the Coast Guard 7th District told Reuters in a telephone interview. 
At the time the Coast Guard became aware of the incident, the Harmony of the Seas ship was traveling from its home port of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to its first stop of St. Maarten island on its seven-day Caribbean itinerary, the Miami Herald newspaper had reported earlier.
The Coast Guard said it continued its search for Hough with an airplane and cutter ship. 
Royal Caribbean Cruises said the missing person was a member of the ""entertainment team"" onboard Harmony of the Seas and that he did not show up for work on Tuesday.
""We are saddened to report that after a review of the ship's closed-circuit camera footage, he was observed entering an area on Deck 5 at around 4am and was not seen again"", Royal Caribbean told Reuters in an emailed statement. 
""Local authorities were notified and a ship-wide search for the crew member was conducted.""

The UK Foreign Office said it was providing assistance to the family of the missing person, according to a statement cited by Sky News.

CARACAS (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) said on Wednesday its oil drilling and development activities offshore Guyana were unaffected by a weekend incident in which Venezuela's navy stopped two exploration vessels the company had hired.
Venezuela's navy halted seismic data collection by the boats on Saturday. The governments of each of the two South American neighboring countries said the exploration vessels were in their territorial waters.
A century-long border dispute has heated up in recent years as Irving, Texas-based Exxon has discovered more than 5 billion barrels of oil and gas off Guyana's shores and said it could be producing 750,000 barrels of oil by 2025 from wells there. 
Its 10 oil finds are at least 110 km (68 miles) away from the northwest part of the Stabroek block where the incident took place, the company said. The company has a permit from Guyana to explore the Stabroek block.
""Exploration and development drilling is continuing in the southeast area of the Stabroek Block,"" the company said in a statement. An Exxon spokeswoman declined to say whether the two vessels, owned by Norway's Petroleum Geo-Services (OL:PGS), planned to continue their survey. 
Exxon shares rose about 4 percent on Wednesday as oil prices jumped, both recovering from sharp declines earlier in the week.  Hess Corp  (N:HES), which owns 30 percent of the project, also surged 9.3 percent after plunging more than 12 percent on Monday. 
Markets were closed on Tuesday for the Christmas holiday.
Venezuela's foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday that it had sent a formal protest to Guyana's government over its decision to allow ""unilateral and arbitrary"" exploration and other activities in the area without consultation. 
The ministry said it had previously protested to Georgetown over a ""notice to mariners"" that it said was issued Dec. 6 and which it said detailed how Exxon's Guyana subsidiary would start a seismic survey in the area lasting until Dec. 31. Guyana's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
A notice of the survey published on Guyana's Maritime Administration Department's website was dated Dec. 7, and said the work was scheduled for a six-month period. Venezuela's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the discrepancies over the dates.
In OPEC-member Venezuela, crude output is near its lowest levels in 70 years amid an economic crisis and mismanagement under military rule.

Critics say socialist President Nicolas Maduro is using the dispute over the Essequibo, a sparsely populated jungle region making up two-thirds of Guyana's land which Venezuela also claims, to distract from hyperinflation and shortages of basic goods that have prompted millions of Venezuelans to emigrate.

SEOSAN, South Korea (Reuters) - South Korea's  SK Innovation  (KS:096770), a supplier of electric vehicle (EV) batteries to  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), aims to boost production capacity more than tenfold by 2022, betting on global demand.
The company expects the battery business to break even in 2020, a senior manager said at a news conference on Wednesday at the company's plant in Seosan, a three-hour drive from Seoul.
The outlook comes days after Mercedes maker Daimler said it would buy battery cells worth more than 20 billion euros ($23 billion) by 2030 as it readies mass production of hybrid and electric vehicles.
Daimler and other European automakers are aggressively expanding in electric vehicles as European regulators clamp down on diesel emissions. 
SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won has put more focus on the conglomerate's EV battery business as its memory-chipmaking unit SK Hynix (KS:000660) faces a slowdown in demand from smartphone makers after a two-year-long boom.
On a wall at the Seosan plant, a handwritten message from Chey reads: ""Til the day when all vehicles run with our batteries, and replace gasoline (vehicles), SK's battery team will be up and running."" 
Late to the EV battery market compared with rivals LG Chem (KS:051910) and Samsung (KS:005930) SDI (KS:006400), SK Innovation has announced investment plans worth about $3 billion since late 2017, to build new factories in China, Hungary and the United States.
China's pledge to phase out subsidies for electric and plug-in hybrids by 2020, and an increase in the country's EV sales quota will benefit SK Innovation, said Lee Du-beom of the company's battery team.
Currently, EVs using South Korean batteries are not eligible for generous subsidies in China.
""We are not that worried about the China market,"" Lee said. ""We believe that global automakers as well as Chinese carmakers will need to obtain batteries from foreign battery manufacturers.""
SK Innovation plans to boost annual battery production capacity to 55 gigawatt-hours by 2022, from 4.7 gigawatt-hours a year currently, said Kim Tae-hyeon, who heads SK Innovation's battery business team.
The company, which also owns South Korea's top refiner SK Energy [SKENGG.UL], counts  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) as a client.

(Reuters) - Stocks and oil prices rebounded on Wednesday as the Trump administration attempted to shore up investor confidence and markets welcomed a report on strong U.S. holiday spending.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 2.57 percent, while both U.S. and Brent crude rose about 8 percent, their largest one-day increase since Nov. 30, 2016. [O/R]
Benchmarks for both oil and stocks hit their lowest in more than a year on Monday, with the S&P 500 on the cusp of being declared officially in a bear market during what is usually a calm week of trading shortened by the Christmas holiday. Markets in Britain, Germany and France were closed on Wednesday.
Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said on Wednesday that U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's job was not in jeopardy. Just two days ago President Donald Trump described the Fed as the ""only problem our economy has"" as the central bank raises interest rates.
Investors have been unnerved by the potential for weaker economic growth and a partial U.S. federal government shutdown. Trump has largely laid the blame for economic headwinds on the Fed, openly criticizing a chairman he appointed.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also raised market concerns by convening a crisis group following the sharp pullback in stocks.
One economist said the Fed holds the key to calming markets.
""In the end, we believe that the Fed is the only presence capable of ending the current confusion in the markets,"" Kenta Inoue, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities, said in a note. ""The White House will probably keep making gestures intended to halt the rout in stocks, but the federal government is likely to remain shut into the new year. The U.S.-China trade war also shows no signs of a resolution.""
A Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) report that sales during the U.S. holiday shopping season rose 5.1 percent to over $850 billion in 2018, the strongest in the past six years, helped stocks, as did the higher crude prices. Investors also often sell assets that have done the best and buy those that have done the worst at the end of the quarter to ""rebalance"" to a target position.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1,086.25 points, or 4.98 percent, to 22,878.45, the S&P 500 gained 116.6 points, or 4.96 percent, to 2,467.7 and the Nasdaq Composite added 361.44 points, or 5.84 percent, to 6,554.36. (N)
U.S. government bonds, a beneficiary of the risk-off move in recent weeks, fell in price on Wednesday. Bonds maturing well into the future and sensitive to inflation and risk sentiment declined faster than short-term debts more influenced by Fed policy.

""Breathe on these markets and corrective rebounds could ensue,""  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) analysts Bill O'Donnell and Ed Acton said in a note, as investors react to a Fed tightening policy and rising rates.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Fresh misconduct allegations brought by Tokyo prosecutors against ousted Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn center on the use of company funds to pay a Saudi businessman who is believed to have helped him out of financial difficulties, two company sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Prosecutors arrested Ghosn for a third time on Friday, accusing him of aggravated breach of trust in transferring personal investment losses to the automaker. 
The prosecutors' statement said they believe that around October 2008, Ghosn was trying to deal with losses on paper of 1.85 billion yen ($16.6 million) incurred on a swap contract he had with a bank which it did not name.
A person helped arrange a letter of credit for Ghosn and a company run by the person later received $14.7 million in Nissan funds in four installments between 2009 and 2012, the statement said, adding that the payments were made in Ghosn's and the person's interests. 
""By doing so, (Ghosn) behaved in a way that breached trust, and inflicted damage on the property of Nissan,"" the statement said. The statement also said Ghosn had earlier sought to have Nissan shoulder the appraisal losses directly.
According to the Nissan sources who have knowledge of the company's probe into its former chief, the person who helped Ghosn is Khaled Al-Juffali, vice chairman of one of Saudi Arabia's largest conglomerates, E. A. Juffali and Brothers, and a member of the board at the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority.
He is also majority owner of a company called Al-Dahana which owns half of a regional joint venture called Nissan Gulf with the other half held by a wholly owned unit of Nissan Motor.
Sheikh Khaled Juffali has no comment on this subject, according to an emailed statement from E. A. Juffali and Brothers.
Ghosn's Tokyo-based lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, was unavailable for comment on this article, according to a person who answered the phone at his law office. A representative for the Ghosn family declined to comment.
Other media have said Ghosn has through a lawyer denied that he shifted losses to Nissan and has told investigators that the four payments were for legitimate business purposes, including a reward for handling problems at Nissan dealers in Saudi Arabia. 
Tokyo prosecutors declined to comment. Asked about Ghosn's reported comments, a Nissan spokesman said: ""We cannot comment on matters related to Ghosn's arrest for breach of trust. Nissan's own investigation is ongoing, and its scope continues to broaden.""
'PROSECUTORS KNOW MORE'
Ghosn's re-arrest – the latest twist in a saga that has jolted Nissan' alliance with France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) – came a day after a Tokyo court unexpectedly rejected a request from prosecutors to extend Ghosn's detention. 
Unlike his previous arrests on allegations of under-reporting his compensation which he faced together with former representative director Greg Kelly, prosecutors have leveled these latest accusations against Ghosn only.
The Nissan sources with knowledge of the matter said the automaker's investigators concluded that Ghosn was unsuccessful in his attempt to have Nissan shoulder the losses directly. 
Japan's Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission had at some stage flagged Ghosn's attempt to have Nissan directly shoulder the losses as illegal, one of the sources said. It was not immediately clear what the SESC deemed illegal. A SESC spokesman said he could not comment on specific cases.
The sources declined to be identified as the results of Nissan's internal investigation have not been made public yet.
Ghosn then gained help from Al-Juffali who used his personal assets to provide collateral for a bank to issue a letter of credit that Tokyo-based Shinsei Bank had required of Ghosn, the sources said. A spokesman for Shinsei said he could not comment on specific cases. Reuters was not able to determine the identity of the bank which issued the letter of credit.
The four payments arranged by Ghosn were made through a Nissan internal discretionary fund, known within the company as the 'CEO Reserve', to a Nissan unit which then paid a company owned by Al-Juffali, one of the sources said, without specifying the names of the companies.
The first payment of $3 million was made in fiscal 2009, followed by payments of $3.6 million, $3.9 million and $4.2 million in the three subsequent years, the sources added.
The sources said the Nissan investigators initially had not been looking at the transactions with the urgency prosecutors displayed last week.
""Prosecutors know more about this than we do,"" one of the sources said.
E. A. Juffali and Brothers was founded in 1946. The company set up electric power supply and telecommunications to some of Saudi Arabia's major cities and expanded into construction, insurance, vehicle manufacturing and distribution. 
Established in October 2008, the Nissan Gulf joint venture was originally responsible for Nissan's marketing and sales strategy and dealer development in Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, and Bahrain but the scope of the business has since been reduced to Kuwait and Bahrain for reasons that weren't immediately clear, one of the sources said.
Kelly was released on bail late on Christmas day but Ghosn remains in detention. After the latest allegations, prosecutors were granted permission to hold him for 10 days on Dec. 23 and will typically ask for another 10 days, which is usually approved.

Japanese prosecutors often arrest individuals repeatedly on different allegations linked to the same case. The practice allows them to hold suspects while they pursue their investigation and also means they can continue interrogations without the presence of a lawyer.

869,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2018 11:39AM ET</span>",U.S. holiday shopping season best in six years: report,"By Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) - Sales in the 2018 U.S. holiday shopping season rose 5.1 percent to over $850 billion, the strongest in six years, according to a Mastercard report on Wednesday, as shoppers were encouraged by a robust economy and early discounts.
The data follows Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's announcement of a ""record-breaking"" selling season, with the online retail giant shipping a billion items for free through its Prime membership in the United States.
Amazon's shares jumped as much as 5 percent, while those of Kohl's Corp rose 4.2 percent. Macy's Inc gained 3.6 percent,  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN) 3 percent, and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc rising over 1 percent.
The strong sales numbers indicated that rising market volatility due to concerns over slowing global growth and political deadlock in Washington has not impacted consumer confidence so far.
""I don't see that (volatility in the markets and Government shutdown) as having any impact ... but I am cautiously optimistic for the consumer going into 2019,"" said Steve Sadove, senior adviser for Mastercard.
The 5.1 percent sales growth included in-store and online sales between Nov. 1 and Dec. 24. The National Retail Federation had forecast U.S. holiday retail sales to rise between 4.3 percent and 4.8 percent in November and December.
Low unemployment rates and rising wages have been boosting consumer confidence, which in October hit its highest in nearly two decades.
""From shopping aisles to online carts, consumer confidence translated into holiday cheer for retail,"" said Sadove. 
Online sales posted strong gains, rising 19.1 percent, according to the SpendingPulse retail report, published by Mastercard's analytics arm.
""This season was our best yet,"" Jeff Wilke, Amazon's CEO Worldwide Consumer, said on Wednesday.
In contrast, sales at department stores fell 1.3 percent after two years of modest growth, largely due to store closures. But online sales grew 10.2 percent for the group, indicating that heavy investments in ecommerce to counter continuing drop in store traffic were bearing fruit.
""Many retailers are benefiting from the increase in online sales, but none are benefiting as much as Amazon is,"" said Joel Bines, global co-head of retail consulting firm AlixPartners.
Apparel sales grew 7.9 percent, the best in nearly a decade, according to Mastercard, sending shares of  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO) Inc and Abercrombie & Fitch Co higher.
Another top performer was spending on home improvement, which grew 9 percent during the season. Shares of  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) and Lowe's Cos Inc, the top two U.S. home improvement chains, rose nearly 2 percent.
However, sales of electronics and appliances dipped 0.7 percent, compared with a 7.5 percent rise last year. 
The SpendingPulse report tracks spending by combining sales activity in Mastercard's payments network with estimates of cash and other payment forms and excludes automobile sales. 

The spending data also boosted shares of U.S. payment networks. Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) and  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) were both up nearly 2 percent.

870,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2018 11:39AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley unit to pay $10 million fine for anti-money laundering violations,"By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - Wall Street's industry funded watchdog fined the U.S. brokerage unit of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) $10 million on Wednesday for compliance failures in the firm's anti-money laundering program, the regulator said.
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) said the lapses spanned more than five years, from January 2011 until April 2016.
Morgan Stanley, which agreed to the fine as part of a settlement, did not admit nor deny FINRA's charges, but consented to the entry of the regulator's findings.
""We are pleased to have resolved this matter from several years ago,"" Morgan Stanley said in a statement. 
FINRA rules require brokerages to have policies and procedures in place to comply with a federal law aimed at detecting and curbing money laundering.
A Morgan Stanley automated surveillance system did not receive important data from other Morgan Stanley systems, FINRA said. The lapse impaired the firm's overall tracking of tens of billions of dollars of wire and foreign currency transfers, FINRA said.
Those transactions included transfers to and from countries known for money laundering risk, FINRA said.
In 2015, a consultant that Morgan Stanley hired to test its surveillance identified several ""high risk"" issues, according to the settlement agreement. Morgan Stanley did not fix one of those problems until at least February 2017.
Morgan Stanley's other violations include failing to ""reasonably monitor"" customers' deposits of 2.7 billion shares of penny stock between 2011-2013, FINRA said.
Low-priced securities, such as penny stocks, are often subject to efforts by fraudsters to falsely inflate trading volume and share prices, a securities law violation that is frequently a precursor to money-laundering, according to anti-money laundering compliance professionals.

Morgan Stanley has taken ""extraordinary steps"" since 2013 to improve its anti-money laundering programs, including a new automated process for monitoring of penny stock transactions and potential insider trading, FINRA said in the settlement.

The lawsuit was filed on Monday in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, on behalf of the estate of Sudibyo Onggo Wardoyo, who died when Lion Air Flight 610 crashed into the Java Sea after taking off from Jakarta on Oct. 29.
All 189 people on board the plane were killed.
The lawsuit alleges that the two-month-old Boeing aircraft was unreasonably dangerous because its sensors provided inaccurate data to its flight control system, causing its anti-stall system to improperly engage. 
It also alleges Boeing failed to provide adequate instructions to pilots on how to respond to and disengage the plane's anti-stall system.
""It was like Boeing first blindfolded and then tied the hands of the pilots,"" said lawyer Thomas Demetrio of Corboy & Demetrio, which is representing Onggo Wardoyo's estate on behalf of the victim's parents and three siblings.

Boeing did not immediately return requests for comment.

878,By Business Insider,"<span>Dec 26, 2018 10:11AM ET</span>",It's 'something you really can't model for': The sudden prospect of a Trump impeachment has hedge funds scrambling,"Recently, a new worry has cropped up: a possible Trump impeachment.
At least three Wall Street hedge funds and asset managers have started talking about the possibility of the impeachment of US President Donald Trump as a potential market catalyst in 2019, according to people familiar with their thinking.
It's an unwelcome development for hedge fund managers, who are finding it difficult to adjust their strategies to fit the increasingly uncertain political reality thanks to a soon-to-be Democrat-controlled House of Representatives. They can handle normal macro factors like central bank activity and trade tensions, but they view impeachment as a wild card — and it's thrown a wrench into their best-laid plans.
""That's something you really can't model for,"" said Larry Newhook, the CEO of Alpha Innovations. The firm runs a managed account platform for institutions to access smaller strategies and funds.
It's a relatively new market catalyst, coming after the midterms which saw Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives and ever-present turmoil in the administration. In betting markets, the odds that Trump will be booted from office next year  are shortening. After the midterms that saw Democrats flip the House and pick up dozens of seats, oddsmaker Bovada increased the likelihood of an impeachment, with a $100 bet on a Trump impeachment only paying out $125 compared to a $160 payout before November. Currently, the oddsmaker has a $100 impeachment bet paying out $150. 
It's now also enough of a possibility to land on the radar of big investors.
""Internally, we're talking about this because it's interesting, but if it gets more significant we will talk about it more,"" said one London-based asset manager at a Wall Street firm. ""I'm not sure it's a market positive, but it may not be a market negative. And it will take a long time.""
Markets can react sharply to big geopolitical and global economic events, leading to big paydays for so-called ""macro"" investing strategies. A Trump impeachment would be behind other, more pressing macro risks next year, the asset manager said, such as, in order of magnitude:  Fed policy, the US-China  trade war, the ""leveraged loan"" boom,  eurozone drama,  emerging market turmoil and volatile  oil prices. (The person added that  Brexit is much higher on that list for UK-focused investors).
Newhook said that even comparing it to Bill Clinton's impeachment in 1998 wouldn't do much good because the market has changed so much in the years since.
Correctly gauging price moves from geopolitical events can be incredibly profitable. Big macro funds like Jeffrey Talpins' Element Capital have posted stellar returns in a year when the average hedge fund through the end of November has declined 2%.
But the last quarter of 2018 has been brutal for investors of all stripes — the average macro fund, according to data from Hedge Fund Research, lost 4.1% through November. Even one of the world's best macro traders, George Soros, is  reportedly pulling back on the strategy. Soros Fund Management has cut its allocation to macro investments to $500 million compared to $3 billion last year.
""All you can do is say 'Hey, do I want to be aggressive with my risk-taking or not?'"" said Newhook, who was formerly the head of due diligence for hedge-fund giant Steve Cohen. ""The one thing you don't want to be doing if you think impeachment is possible is be  short volatility. The bottom line is that this is just another source of volatility."""
879,By Business Insider,"<span>Dec 26, 2018 10:11AM ET</span>","Stocks are teetering on the brink of bear-market territory, and Trump says it's a 'tremendous opportunity to buy'","President Donald Trump put on his market-strategist cap on Christmas Day and said investors could view the current environment as a buying opportunity.
""I have great confidence in our companies,"" he told reporters on Tuesday,  according to a Reuters report.
""We have companies, the greatest in the world, and they're doing really well. They have record kinds of numbers. So I think it's a tremendous opportunity to buy.""
Trump's comments come as the major averages in the US plunged more than 2% on Monday, making for their worst Christmas Eve on record. The dismal performance came  one day after Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said in an unusual statement that he'd called leaders of the six largest US banks to confirm they were in solid condition.
Those losses ran the major averages to the brink of bear-market territory, with the S&P 500 closing about 20% below its all-time high from late September. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite are down 19.1% and 23.9% from their respective record peaks.

Trump has previously said he considers the stock market's performance to be indicative of his success in office, as a sort of report card for his presidency.
""You live by the sword, you die by the sword, to a certain extent,""  he told the AP in early 2017.
This isn't the first time someone in the Trump administration has made a stock-market call. Trump's son Eric Trump  earlier this year said the February sell-off appeared to be a ""great period to buy."" The S&P 500 rallied roughly 14% to a record high of 2,940.91 in the more than seven months following his call before rolling over.
Despite the recent downturn, the S&P 500 is up 3.9% since Trump took office in January of 2017, and up almost 10% since Election Day in November of 2016.

893,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2018 08:02AM ET</span>",Buying and holding volatility usually hurts; then came 2018,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The big uptick in stock market gyrations this year has made a surprise winner out of a trade that has rarely delivered a win - buying and holding volatility.
Stock market ructions over the last decade have been few and fleeting, requiring great feats of timing to generate profits from volatility buying.
Not so this year. 
Frequent bursts of market gyrations have kept things lively in the volatility space and has made betting on enduring turmoil hugely profitable.
While the S&P 500 (SPX) is getting crushed to a degree not seen since the financial crisis a decade ago - the index is down 19 percent in the last three months - a trader who took a flyer on volatility early this year could be pocketing a profit of 70 percent or more.
""The thing that worked in the volatility space this year is the thing that almost never works - just buy and hold volatility,"" said Matt Thompson, co-head of commodity trading adviser Typhon Capital Plc's volatility group in Chicago.
Since volatility usually rises when stocks fall, owning volatility is a form of insurance and just like any other insurance there is a cost attached to it.
""Usually it costs a lot to own volatility,"" said Jim Carney, chief executive officer at New York-based hedge fund Parplus Partners.
Most volatility instruments, including options, futures and exchange-traded notes (ETNs), lose value rapidly when stocks are calm or rising.
But with the stock market in the grips of almost daily wild swings, for the first time in years it has paid to own volatility, said Carney.
One example of how well that trade has worked is the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (P:VXX), which is up about 72 percent this year. The ETN tracks the performance of the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), a widely followed options-based barometer of expected near-term volatility for stocks.
VXX follows an index that tracks the price of two near-term VIX futures and seeks to maintain a constant one-month exposure to volatility by repeatedly selling first-month futures to buy second-month contracts.
""When the front month VIX future is below the second month there's a huge cost to owning the product, but now with the front month around the same level of the second month, or above it, there is no cost,"" said Carney.
Under normal conditions, first-month VIX futures are priced lower than second-month contracts as uncertainty about how stocks will fare leads traders to boost the volatility embedded in further-out expirations.
That is a problem for VXX, which essentially is constantly selling the relatively cheaper first-month contract and buying the more expensive second-month contract.
This constant erosion in value has caused VXX to hemorrhage money like few other products. A $100,000 invested in VXX at its inception in 2009 would be worth about $40 now.
But during times of market stress, such as now, first-month contracts become even more pricy than contracts with expirations further out. That gives VXX a fillip.
The VXX is on pace this year to finish up for the first time in its decade-long existence.
OMINOUS PORTENT
VXX's success this year bodes ill for the overall stock market. While the ETN has only been around since 2009, estimating how the index might have fared in previous years paints a bleak picture for the near-term outlook for U.S. stocks.
""It wasn't trading then, but 2007 and 2008 would have been up years,"" said Vance Harwood, who runs the alternative investment website Six Figure Investing and has studied VIX products extensively.
Harwood estimates that VXX would have gained about 40 percent in 2007 and more than doubled in price in 2008, as the stock market got hit by the global financial crisis.
Others also see the similarity.
""This year looks a lot like 2007,"" said Typhon's Thompson.
""I am not predicting a 2008 next year but we had a pretty fundamental transition this year from the old low volatility regime to the new higher volatility regime,"" Thompson said.
Regardless of whether VXX's strong performance is a portent of trouble for stocks next year, higher levels of daily stock gyrations should draw more investors to the ETN, analysts said.
""With volatility in the 20s for the VIX, I think it is an excellent product to be long,"" said Parplus' Carney.
Presently, more than 50 million VXX shares change hands every day and the ETN has about $800 million in assets under management.

""I wouldn't be surprised to see it bump up into the $1 billion to $1.5 billion range,"" said Harwood.

894,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 26, 2018 06:47AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Point to Bounce as Trump Sees ‘Tremendous’ Buy Opportunity,"Investing.com - U.S. futures pointed to a higher opening on Wednesday after a sharp decline that President Donald Trump suggested was a buying opportunity.
The blue-chip Dow futures gained 98 points, or 0.45%, to 21,798.0 points by 6:41 AM ET (11:41 GMT), while S&P 500 futures rose 13 points, or 0.55%, to 2,354.62 points. Meanwhile the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 26 points, or 0.44%, to 5,918.12 points.
Monday's shortened pre-Christmas trading session saw U.S. equities suffer their worst Christmas Eve ever, with the Dow plunging more than 600 points, while the S&P 500 closed on the brink of bear market territory.
Trump blamed the decline on the Federal Reserve, saying that “they're raising interest rates too fast because they think the economy is so good. But I think that they will get it pretty soon.”
Trump also expressed his optimism that stocks would bounce back.
“I have great confidence in our companies. We have companies, the greatest in the world, and they're doing really well. They have record kinds of numbers. So I think it's a tremendous opportunity to buy,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday.
But analysts remained skeptical in the face of political turmoil in Washington which led to a partial government shutdown on Saturday as Trump insisted on Democrats granting him funding for a southern border wall.
“I can't tell you when the government is going to reopen,” Trump said, speaking after a Christmas Day video conference with U.S. troops serving abroad. “I can tell you it's not going to reopen until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it. I'll call it whatever they want, but it's all the same thing. It's a barrier from people pouring into the country, from drugs.”
He added: “If you don't have that (the wall), then we're just not opening.”
Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management said ""markets are now having to grapple with growing turmoil in the White House which has raised political risk.''
Wednesday’s economic calendar is relatively thin with the latest report on home prices from S&P/Case-Shiller due at 9:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT), followed by the Richmond Fed’s monthly report on manufacturing activity at 10AM ET (15:00 GMT).
Ahead of the data, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, was up 0.25% to 96.25 by 6:41 AM ET (11:41 GMT).
Gold futures rose 0.37% to $1,276.55 a troy ounce, while crude oil advanced 1.18% to $43.03 a barrel.

895,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 26, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>","With Trump Preaching Buy the Dip, Stocks Look Cheapest in Years","(Bloomberg) -- The flip side of what’s been the third-worst month for American stocks in the postwar era is that prices are a whole lot cheaper than they were before the rout.
While it may take a strong stomach to nibble at U.S. equities, they do offer the most attractive valuations since 2013, measured by the price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 Index in data compiled by Bloomberg. At little more than 13 times the coming year’s estimated earnings, American stocks are also looking less of an outlier versus other advanced markets than earlier this year.
“Relative to the stretched valuations we have seen for U.S. indices in 2017, the current levels certainly appear more attractive,” said Jingyi Pan, market strategist at IG Asia Pte. in Singapore. “That being said, just as markets overlooked the high valuations and focused on the growth potential through to the peak this year, the current lowered valuations alone do not make for buying reasons.”
President Donald Trump was less equivocal about American companies at the White House Tuesday: “They have record kinds of numbers. So I think it’s a tremendous opportunity to buy. Really a great opportunity to buy.”
In retrospect, the last time valuations were around current levels certainly proved a great chance to get in. The S&P 500 has handed investors a 56 percent return since the start of the final quarter of 2013, a period that includes the near 15 percent tumble in the index this month. And earnings growth has been much stronger this year than earlier this decade, a trend that many see continuing thanks to solid U.S. job and consumption growth.
“You’ve just got to wait for prices to get down to a level where somebody’s going to buy it -- I think it’s gone too far,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, referring to the U.S. stock market. “I expect it to recover from here certainly.”
Some sectors have dropped so much they’re even cheaper on an historical basis than the broad big-cap index. Financial shares have been beaten down thanks to a flattening in the U.S. yield curve, where Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes have pushed up shorter-dated rates while turmoil in stocks has contributed to haven demand for longer-dated Treasuries.
Valuations on energy stocks are also around their lowest since early this decade, hammered by the $30-plus a barrel collapse in the price of West Texas Intermediate crude since early October. Others aren’t as much of a bargain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index was less expensive as recently as early 2016, as was the Nasdaq Composite.
While few economists see elevated danger of an impending recession in the U.S., and indicators ranging from the job market to manufacturing PMIs suggest solid growth will continue, what gives some investors pause is broader concern about policy maker errors. Back in 2013, the Fed unsettled markets by warning that its quantitative easing was coming to an end. This time around, it’s an accelerating global withdrawal of liquidity, alongside unexpected question marks around the longevity of U.S. policy makers, that’s hurting confidence.
""After an extraordinary period of eight, nine years of quantitative easing from the major central banks, which topped out earlier in the year at $24 trillion -- that’s about a third of the market capitalization of all global equities -- now we’ve started seeing that go into reverse,"" said Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon in London, on Bloomberg Radio.
Futures trading Wednesday in European hours suggested limited odds for a bounce in U.S. stocks as trading resumes after the Christmas break. Contracts on the S&P 500 climbed as of 10:07 a.m. in London Wednesday after swinging between gains and losses during the Asia trading day. Headlines raising doubts about Trump’s confidence in Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were the latest source of disquiet, days after Bloomberg reported the president discussed firing Chairman Jerome Powell out of frustration over interest-rate hikes.
“Destabilization in institutions that we’ve come to rely on” is the key worry, said Julia Coronado, president and founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC in New York. For now, the market correction hasn’t fed through to damage business confidence, but it will be important to monitor investment and spending plans, she said."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan director Greg Kelly was being examined in a hospital on Wednesday, a source said, a day after he was released on bail from a Tokyo jail where his former boss Carlos Ghosn is still being detained.
Kelly, an American who was released late on Christmas Day after more than a month in detention, has been charged with conspiring to under-report Ghosn's income. He posted bail of 70 million yen ($640,000).
Their Nov. 19 arrests jolted the global car industry and has strained Nissan's (T:7201) alliance with French car maker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA). Nissan's board last month fired Ghosn as chairman and Kelly as representative director, although both men technically still remain board members who can only be removed by shareholders.
Kelly suffers from spinal stenosis, causing numbness, tingling and shooting pain in his extremities, according to a video message last week from his wife, Dee Kelly, appealing for his release. The condition compresses or pinches the spinal cord.
Those symptoms worsened during his five weeks in the Tokyo Detention Center, his wife said, citing Kelly's lawyer. 
Kelly was scheduled to have surgery on Dec. 7 in Nashville, Tennessee, but flew to Japan last month after being told that he was needed in person at a board meeting, Dee Kelly said in the video. Kelly was arrested soon after his arrival.
Under the conditions of his bail, Kelly is barred from traveling overseas and his residence must be restricted to a designated place, the Tokyo District Court said. Lawyers say that travel exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis.
Kelly walked out of the detention center around 10:45 pm (1345 GMT) Thursday night wearing a light-colored jacket and was whisked away in a black taxi. Japanese media showed footage of Kelly entering a hospital around midnight. 
After his release from detention, Kelly issued a statement through his lawyer saying he had not falsified any documents and looked forward to restoring his honor in court. ""I believe my innocence will be revealed in the trial,"" he said.
Kelly also said in the statement he wanted to see a doctor immediately and get the appropriate treatment or operation originally scheduled for early December.
The office of his lawyer, Yoichi Kitamura, did not respond to requests for comment.
Ghosn was re-arrested on Friday based on suspicions that around October 2008 he shifted personal trades to Nissan to make it responsible for 1.85 billion yen ($16.6 million) in appraisal losses, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors also said Ghosn had inflicted damage on Nissan by having it deposit a total of $14.7 million on four occasions between June 2009 and March 2012 into a related bank account.
Ghosn said through his lawyer that he was not guilty of the allegations, for which he has not been formally charged. He will remain in Tokyo's main detention center until at least Jan. 1, although prosecutors can request to extend his detention.
A Nissan spokesman said the company is not in a position to comment on the latest twist in the more-than-month-long saga.

""The company's own investigation uncovered substantial and convincing evidence of misconduct, resulting in a unanimous board vote to dismiss Ghosn and Kelly as chairman and representative director. Our investigation is ongoing,"" a spokesman said on Tuesday.

903,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 25, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",Venezuela calls U.S. comments on Guyana dispute 'interventionist',"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's foreign ministry on Tuesday described as ""interventionist and disrespectful"" U.S. comments on a weekend incident in which the country's navy stopped two ships exploring for oil for  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) off Guyana's coast.
Each of the neighboring South American countries says the incident on Saturday occurred within its territorial waters. In response to the event, the U.S. State Department said Venezuela had behaved ""aggressively"" and called on the country to ""respect international law and the rights of its neighbors.""
""It is evident that the U.S. government is interfering in a matter that is not at all incumbent upon it, with the goal of promoting corporate interests closely linked to the Washington ruling elite,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement. 
Socialist President Nicolas Maduro has accused the United States of plotting to invade Venezuela and overthrow his government, while Washington has placed sanctions on Venezuela's debt and members of Maduro's government over accusations of corruption, human rights violations and election-rigging.
A century-long territorial dispute between Venezuela and Guyana has flared up in recent years with Exxon's discovery of more than 5 billion barrels of oil and gas off Guyana's coast. In OPEC-member Venezuela, crude output is hovering near 70-year lows amid a severe economic crisis.
Guyana says Caracas gave up its claim to the Essequibo, a sparsely populated jungle area making up two-thirds of Guyana's territory, after an 1899 ruling by an international tribunal, but Venezuela later backtracked on that decision. The U.N. this year referred the dispute to the International Court of Justice.
Two vessels owned by Norway's Petroleum Geo-Services (OL:PGS) and under contract by Exxon Mobil were conducting seismic survey work in the area. The ships stopped their work and turned east after the Venezuelan navy told them Guyana did not have jurisdiction there. 
When asked on Monday if there were plans for the vessels to resume their activities, Guyana Foreign Affairs Minister Carl Greenidge said the government was ""in discussion"" with Exxon. Neither Exxon nor PGS immediately responded to requests for comment on Tuesday, and the U.S. State Department declined to comment.
On Monday, the Caricom group of 15 Caribbean nations including Guyana - many of which have historically received subsidized oil from Venezuela under Caracas' Petrocaribe program - said it viewed the ""interception"" by Venezuela's navy ""with grave concern."" 
""Such acts violate the sovereign rights of Guyana under international law,"" the group said in a statement.

908,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 25, 2018 10:08AM ET</span>",Nissan's Kelly released on bail as Tokyo court rejects prosecutors' plea,"By Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) - Former Nissan Motor Co Representative Director Greg Kelly has been released on bail after more than a month in detention on financial-misconduct charges, as a Tokyo court rejected prosecutors' request to keep the American executive in custody.
Kelly and Carlos Ghosn, the automaker's ousted chairman, were detained upon arrival in Japan on Nov. 19 on suspicion of understating Ghosn's income in financial statements for several years. 
The arrests jolted the global car industry and strained Nissan's alliance with French car maker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA). Ghosn remains in custody. 
A crowd of Japanese and international reporters and camera crews had gathered since Tuesday morning waiting for Kelly's release. He left the Tokyo Detention Center with his lawyer, Yoichi Kitamura, by taxi at around 10:45 p.m. (1345 GMT), a Reuters witness said. 
Kelly said in a statement that he had not falsified any documents and looked forward to restoring his honor in court, adding that he wanted to return to his family as soon as possible, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported. 
There was no answer at Kitamura's office when contacted by Reuters for comment. 
The ruling by the Tokyo District Court came after an appeal by Kelly's family in Tennessee. He paid bail of 70 million yen ($640,000) in cash, the court said.
But he could be barred from leaving Japan or talking to people related to the case, NHK said earlier in the day, although exceptions can be made for overseas travel on a case-by-case basis.
Kelly's wife, Dee Kelly, appealed for his release in a video statement last week, saying her husband had been ""wrongly accused as part of a power grab by several Nissan executives"", that he and Ghosn ""fully believe that they did not break the law"" and citing her husband's need for surgery for spinal stenosis.
A Nissan spokesman said the car maker was not in a position to comment on the latest twist in the more-than-month-long saga.
""The company's own investigation uncovered substantial and convincing evidence of misconduct, resulting in a unanimous board vote to dismiss Ghosn and Kelly as chairman and representative director. Our investigation is ongoing,"" the spokesman said. 
Both Kelly and Ghosn remain on the Japanese car maker's board but without representative rights. 
The court on Sunday extended Ghosn's detention for 10 days, following fresh allegations of making Nissan shoulder personal investment losses.
Ghosn was re-arrested on Friday based on suspicions that around October 2008 he shifted personal trades to Nissan to make it responsible for 1.85 billion yen ($16.6 million) in appraisal losses, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors also said Ghosn had inflicted damage on Nissan by having it deposit a total of $14.7 million on four occasions between June 2009 and March 2012 into a related bank account.

918,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 25, 2018 02:10AM ET</span>",Stock Angst Snowballs as Japan's Nikkei 225 Enters Bear Market,"(Bloomberg) -- The Nikkei 225 Stock Average plunged below the 20,000 level and entered bear market territory, as Japanese equities headed for their worst December on record.
The Nikkei 225 fell 5 percent to close at 19,155.74 in Tokyo, with all but two members in the red. The blue-chip stock gauge dropped below 20,000 for the first time since September 2017 and closed 21 percent lower from an Oct. 2 high, joining the broader Topix index in a bear market.
“It’s just like panic selling,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, head of investment information at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. “The equity markets are pricing in concerns over a slowdown in the global economy and a downward revision in corporate earnings in advance. Some investors are reducing their exposure to equities in their portfolio” by increasing cash or bonds.
Japanese stocks have been caught in a global market rout, spurred by concerns about everything from the U.S.-China trade war to global central banks’ moves to tighten monetary policy. Sentiment has deteriorated in December, with foreign investors offloading billions of dollars in the country’s shares.
Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said the financial markets may be overreacting and he’s not overly worried about recent market moves. Officials from the Bank of Japan, Finance Ministry and Financial Services Agency will meet today at 6 p.m. local time, according to an emailed statement from Ministry of Finance.
Adding to market woes, an emergency margin call was triggered for Japan index futures, according to Japan Securities Clearing Corp.
“Market players on futures need to either reduce their trade volumes or pay emergency margins, which may make it difficult for them to actively trade,” said Hajime Sakai, chief fund manager at Mito Securities Co. Futures contracts on the Nikkei 225 fell below 19,000 as of 3:15 p.m. in Tokyo.
Some superlatives after a harrowing day:
The S&P 500 plunged almost 3 percent Monday after news that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called top executives from the six largest U.S. banks to discuss liquidity and a Bloomberg News report that President Donald Trump inquired about firing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. The U.S. government was partially shut down for a third day, amid a lack of urgency to resolve Trump’s demand for border wall funding.
“The Trump bubble, which has brought gains in U.S. stocks and the dollar, is collapsing,” said Mitsushige Akino, an executive officer at Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “The more stocks fall, the more investor sentiment gets worse, so there’s more people who need to sell temporarily, such as stop-loss selling.”
‘Just Psychological’
The Nikkei falling back through the 20,000 level is “not very” important, said Jaiganesh Balasubramaniam, a market technician at Cashthechaos.com. “It’s just psychological. Round numbers.”
“It’s more a reaction to the yen,” Kerry Craig, a Melbourne-based global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, said of the Nikkei’s recent declines. Craig said he’s positive on Japanese stocks in the longer term, because of positive earnings forecasts and the country’s corporate governance overhaul. But more immediately, he said, it’s hard to escape the global stock rout.
Mizuho’s Kuramochi said the equity markets are approaching a “selling climax.” Yet, the markets need a catalyst, such as an end to the U.S. government shutdown or a positive outcome from trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, so any rebound may wait until after New Year, he said.

Chinese shares slid in the morning along with equities in Japan, where the Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell into a bear market. The losses were triggered by the S&P 500 Index suffering its worst final session before the Christmas holiday on record.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Guyana's government is ""in discussion"" with  Exxon Mobil  after two ships searching for oil off the South American country's coast halted work following a weekend confrontation with Venezuela's navy, Guyana's foreign minister said on Monday.
Both neighboring South American countries said the Saturday incident had occurred within their territorial waters. A century-long border dispute has heated up in recent years as Irving, Texas-based Exxon (N:XOM) has discovered more than 5 billion barrels of oil and gas off Guyana's shores.
Guyana Foreign Affairs Minister Carl Greenidge said he could not ""for the moment"" say whether the two ships owned by Norway's Petroleum Geo-Services (OL:PGS) and hired by Exxon would resume their seismic survey, or if they would return to the area where the incident occurred, citing the ongoing talks with Exxon. 
When asked if Guyanese authorities would provide the vessels with protection if they continue exploration, he said Guyana is ""committed to resolving territorial disputes by peaceful means."" 
""We will therefore first try to explore and exhaust Diplomatic channels,"" Greenidge said in an emailed response to questions from Reuters. ""Guyana is a small state of less than a million persons compared with Venezuela's population of 30 million."" 
Earlier on Monday, Exxon declined to say when the survey would restart, referring questions to PGS. Bard Stenberg, a PGS senior vice president, declined to comment on any resumption of the work or if the company has sought to have Guyana provide protection for its vessels. 
There were two PGS ships involved in the confrontation, the Ramform Tethys and Delta Monarch, Stenberg said on Monday. 
""A couple hours later we learned that the Venezuelan navy had withdrawn from the area,"" he added. 
Critics of Venezuela's socialist President Nicolas Maduro say he has rekindled tensions with its eastern neighbor over the Essequibo region, a sparsely populated area making up two-thirds of Guyana's territory that is also claimed by Venezuela, to distract from a severe economic crisis in the OPEC-member nation. 
Venezuela is home to the world's largest crude reserves, but production is hovering near its lowest levels in 70 years due to underinvestment, hyperinflation, and mismanagement under military control of the company. 

Saturday's confrontation recalled an October 2013 incident when Venezuela's navy seized a ship carrying out a seabed survey for Texas-based Anadarko Petroleum Corp (N:APC) in Guyana, accusing it of violating its maritime territory. Venezuela freed the vessel a week later.

923,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2018 08:17PM ET</span>",Trump calls Fed 'only problem' in U.S. economy; markets slump,"By Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump blasted the Federal Reserve on Monday, describing it as the ""only problem"" for the U.S. economy, as top officials convened to discuss the growing rout in stock markets caused in part by the president's attacks on the central bank.
Stocks fell again on Monday amid concern about slowing economic growth, the government shutdown and reports that Trump had discussed firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whom he has repeatedly criticized for raising interest rates.
U.S. stocks have dropped sharply in recent weeks on concerns over weaker economic growth. The S&P 500 index (SPX) was on pace for its biggest percentage decline in December since the Great Depression.
In a tweet that did nothing to ease market concerns about the Fed's cherished independence, the Republican president laid the blame for economic headwinds firmly at the feet of the central bank.
""The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don't have a feel for the market,"" Trump said on Twitter. ""The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can't score because he has no touch - he can't putt!""
In addition to frequently criticizing the Fed's rate hikes this year, Trump has gone after Powell several times, telling Reuters in August he was ""not thrilled"" with his own appointee. The Fed hiked interest rates again last week, as had been widely expected.
A crisis call on Monday between U.S. financial regulators and the Treasury Department did more to rattle markets than to assure them.
All three major indexes ended down more than 2 percent on the day before the Christmas holiday. The S&P 500 ended down about 19.8 percent from its Sept. 20 closing high, just shy of the 20 percent threshold that commonly defines a bear market.
Oil prices followed equities down, tumbling more than 6 percent to the lowest level in over a year.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin hosted a call with the president's Working Group on Financial Markets, a body known colloquially as the ""Plunge Protection team,"" which normally only convenes during times of heavy market volatility.
Regulators on the call said they were not seeing anything out of the ordinary in financial markets during the recent sell-off and also discussed how they will continue critical operations during the partial government shutdown, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
On Sunday, Mnuchin made calls to top U.S. bankers and got reassurances that banks were still able to make loans, the Treasury said.
MARKETS LOWER AGAIN 
If Mnuchin’s efforts were meant to soothe markets, that was not evident on Monday.
""When the Dow is down 600 points it's hard to say it was a positive,"" said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. ""Although his intention was a very good one, the net feeling I think was, ‘Is there a bigger problem that we don't know about?’"" 
Representative Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, said in a statement that Trump and Mnuchin's actions ""have been erratic and are creating uncertainty and instability in the markets.""
Wall Street is closely following reports that Trump had privately discussed the possibility of firing Powell, who became the Fed chief early last February after being appointed by Trump and has continued the path of gradual rate hikes started by his predecessor, Janet Yellen.
Mnuchin said on Saturday that Trump told him he had ""never suggested firing"" Powell. 
Still, just the public suggestion that Trump might try to interfere so deeply with the Fed was unsettling to financial markets that have long operated on the presumption of the U.S. central bank's independence from political meddling.
Adding to the disquiet is the lack of clarity over whether Trump could in fact dismiss Powell.
Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University, said it was “ambiguous legally” whether Trump could remove Powell from the chairman role.
The Federal Reserve Act is clear that Powell can only be removed from the Fed’s board of governors “for cause,” which is generally understood to mean malfeasance, rather than disagreements over interest rates, Binder said.
But it may be lawful for Trump to remove Powell from the chairman role, Binder said. When Congress last amended the statute in 1977, it did not address whether removal from the chairman role must be “for cause,” she said. 
Troubles in Washington have escalated in recent days with a partial government shutdown that began on Saturday following an impasse in Congress over funds for a wall on the border with Mexico. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis' resignation on Thursday after Trump's surprise decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria also unsettled investors.
But Mnuchin's response to the market concerns was seen as an overreaction in Wall Street circles. 

""It seems unexpected, abrupt and unnecessary,"" said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co in Greenwich, Connecticut.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 tumbled to the brink of a bear market on Monday as U.S. stocks extended their steep sell-off in a pre-holiday shortened session, with investors rattled by the U.S. Treasury secretary's convening of a crisis group and by other political developments.

Investors also were grappling with the federal government shutdown and reports that President Donald Trump privately discussed the possibility of firing the Federal Reserve chairman.
“The headlines we are seeing today, yesterday, over the weekend are not great,” said Vinay Pande, global head of trading strategies at UBS Global Wealth Management.

Last week, the S&P 500 suffered its biggest weekly percentage drop since August 2011, while the Dow had its biggest weekly drop since October 2008.
All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished down on the day on Monday, and all were in negative territory for the year. The index posted its lowest closing level since April 2017.
Roughly three-fourths of the S&P 500 was trading in bear market territory. All 30 components of the Dow industrials finished in the red on Monday.
For the third straight day, more than 2,600 New York Stock Exchange- and Nasdaq-listed stocks hit 52-week lows, reflecting a depth of selling not seen in the market since the height of the financial crisis a decade ago.
Mnuchin spoke on Sunday with the heads of the six largest U.S. banks, who confirmed they have enough liquidity to continue lending and that ""the markets continue to function properly.""

Adding to jitters, Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, on Sunday said a partial U.S. government shutdown could continue to Jan. 3, when the new Congress convenes and Democrats take control of the House of Representatives.
The stock market closed at 1 p.m. EST (1800 GMT), ahead of Tuesday's Christmas holiday.

Trump on Monday blasted the independent U.S. central bank, saying on Twitter that the ""only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don't have a feel for the market.""
Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate has been unable to break an impasse over Trump's demand for funds for a wall on the border with Mexico, and a senior official said the resulting government shutdown could continue into January.
U.S. stocks followed broad indexes in Europe and Asia lower on Monday, with markets in Germany and Italy closed.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 653.17 points, or 2.91 percent, to 21,792.2, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 65.52 points, or 2.71 percent, to 2,351.1 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 140.08 points, or 2.21 percent, to 6,192.92. (N)
""Markets (are) still under pressure from last week's more hawkish Fed update, exacerbating fears about slowing growth and more expensive refinancing following years of stimulus,"" said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets.
The political uncertainty has only added to the air of risk aversion, with benchmark 10-year Treasury notes (US10YT=RR) rising 14/32 in price to yield 2.7418 percent.
The gap between two and 10-year yields has shrunk to fewer than 0.15 percentage point, a flattening of the curve that has sometimes heralded coming recessions in the past.
""Many of the financial and economic indicators that turn first around business cycle peaks are now flashing red in advanced economies,"" said Simon MacAdam, global economist at Capital Economics.
""This is consistent with our view that the recent loss of momentum in the world economy will develop into a more severe slowdown in 2019.""
The flight to safe havens again boosted the yen, with the dollar hitting its lowest level against the Japanese currency since August. The yen  strengthened 0.81 percent versus the greenback at 110.33 per dollar.
Gold also has regained its appeal, holding near six-month highs  over $1,268 per ounce.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were down $3.02 a barrel at $50.80. U.S. crude futures (CLc1) fell $2.94 to trade at $42.65.

Brent fell 11 percent last week and hit its lowest since September 2017, while U.S. futures slid to their lowest since July 2017, bringing the decline in the two contracts to 35 percent so far this quarter.

943,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 24, 2018 01:15PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Tumbles Again as Mnuchin Saps the Market’s Holiday Spirit,"Investing.com – It was Scrooge, not Santa, who ruled Christmas Eve on Wall Street, as stocks tumbled on concerns about Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin raising the question of bank liquidity.
The Dow Jones fell about 2.9%, more than 650 points. The S&P 500 lost about 2.64%, moving to to right at bear market territory, while the Nasdaq Composite, which was already there, fell about 2.2%.
All of the S&P 500 sectors were in the red, with the S&P 500 Utilities index the biggest loser, dropping about 4.3%. And every Dow component closed lower.
Mnuchin spoke with the chief executive officers of the six largest U.S. banks Sunday, who confirmed they have enough liquidity to continue lending and that ""the markets continue to function properly.""
But Mnuchin’s statement raised worries rather than allayed them, as few in the market were concerned about liquidity in the first place.
""It seems unexpected, abrupt and unnecessary,"" said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co.
""We are not in a crisis. Compared to 2008, the economic data is like at the other end of the spectrum. We have banking stability, we have volatile but functioning markets. We had an ugly December but it's not a function of any systemic thing along those lines.""
The partial federal government shutdown also weighed on stocks as it looks increasingly likely the impasse will continue into the new year.
""The main factor on investors' minds is the government shutdown and what the resolution can be,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital. “It's really fear of the unknown that has given investors grief.""
Looking to individual stocks, tech took it on the chin again.

964,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2018 10:41AM ET</span>",Italy's Carige bank discussed failed cash call approval with ECB: source,"By Valentina Za
MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's Banca Carige (MI:CRGI) has discussed with European Central Bank supervisors the rejection of a cash call needed to safeguard the troubled Italian lender's future, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday.
The fate of the Genoa-based bank is in question after its biggest investor, the Malacalza family, blocked approval for a 400 million euro ($456 million) new share issue at a shareholder meeting on Saturday.
Carige said on Sunday CEO Fabio Innocenzi and Chairman Piero Modiano would discuss the outcome of the meeting with the authorities.
The source said the discussion had taken place without giving any details of its content. 
Italy's 10th largest bank is under the direct oversight of the ECB.
A spokesman for Banca Carige declined to comment. 
Modiano and Innocenzi, a former UBS banker, took over in September after the Malacalzas pushed out a third chief executive in as many years.
The family of local entrepreneurs has invested more than 400 million euros in Carige since 2015 to build a 27.6 percent stake which was worth just 25 million euros at Friday's market price.
A representative for the family's holding company told Saturday's meeting they did not oppose a new recapitalization but needed more details first on the bank's new business plan, merger options and any potential new losses or capital demands from the regulator.
The ECB will set a new capital threshold for 2019 for Carige, as for other lenders, early next year.
Governance problems have compounded Carige's troubles, which stem from decades of mismanagement and an excessive exposure to the suffering local economy.
Following the rejection, directors Lucrezia Reichlin and Raffaele Mincione resigned from the board.
The bank said on Sunday the board remained committed to protecting the interests of customers and shareholders.
Carige has raised 2.2 billion euros from investors in three share issues since 2014.
The latest stock issue was meant to allow Carige to convert into equity a 320 million euro subordinated bond it sold to other Italian lenders last month as part of an industry-financed rescue plan.
Italian banks were keen to stave off a crisis at a time when market pressure is already intense due to a spike in borrowing costs under a populist government.
Carige's failure to issue the bond on the market earlier this year meant it was in breach of regulatory requirements over its second-tier capital.
The conversion would have helped Carige beef up its core capital ratio, which stood at 10.8 percent at the end of September - above a minimum requirement of 9.63 percent set by the ECB but below the ECB's suggested level of 11.18 percent.
Under the terms of the bond the bank's supervisors have the power to decide its conversion into equity.
The reaction of depositors and investors after Christmas will be key for any regulatory decision on Carige. The bank suffered a large deposit flight a year ago when it almost failed to secure backing for its latest cash call.
On Friday, the ECB gave Carige until the end of 2019 to durably meet its requirements, urging the lender to complete the capital strengthening and actively seek a merger partner.

Carige, which lost 1.3 billion euros from 2014 to 2017 mainly due to bad loans, posted a 189 million euro loss for the first nine months after its new management booked 219 million euros in loan writedowns following an ECB audit.

966,By Business Insider,"<span>Dec 24, 2018 10:14AM ET</span>",Tesla sinks after Musk says it'll reimburse customers for missed tax credits and some Model 3 prices get cut in China," Tesla shares were sliding Monday morning, down 6.17% at $300.63, after CEO Elon Musk said the company would reimburse customers if production delays caused them to miss out on tax breaks and after the company lowered prices in China for the third time in the last two months.
In a tweet on Saturday, Musk said, ""If Tesla committed delivery & customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference."" Earlier this year, the company said any orders made by October 15 would be delivered by the end of the year and eligible for a $7,500 tax credit. The tax credit drops to $3,750 next year.
On Sunday, the electric-car maker said on its Chinese website on Sunday that it had  dropped the price of certain Model 3 sedans by as much as 7.6%, Reuters reports. The starting price for Tesla's mass-market vehicle in China is now 499,000 Chinese yuan ($72,000). 
In November, Tesla announced  price cuts for its Model S and Model X vehicles in China by between 12% and 26% as a way to offset the impact of tariffs enacted in the US-China trade war. And earlier this month,  the automaker cut prices on those models again after the Chinese government temporarily removed the additional 25% tariff that was levied against US autos as part of the trade spat. 
Tesla's stock has been on a roller-coaster ride in 2018. Shares rallied to more than $387 a share in early August after CEO  Elon Musk tweeted he was considering taking the company private at $420 a share. They fell to less than $250 by the middle of October, shortly after  Musk settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission following allegations that he made ""false and misleading statements."" As part of the settlement, Musk neither admitted to nor denied the allegations, agreed to pay a $20 million fine, and stepped aside as Tesla's chairman for at least three years.
Tesla was up 0.78% this year through Friday."

973,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 24, 2018 09:33AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Falls as Mnuchin Haunts Markets on Christmas Eve,"Investing.com - The stock market opened lower Monday as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin brought out the Christmas ghosts of past (equity selloff), present (concerns about the tenure of Fed chief Jerome Powell) and future (a sudden worry about bank liquidity).
The S&P 500 fell about 0.5% and the Dow Jones lost about 0.7%. The Nasdaq Composite was down about 0.55%.
But trading could be volatile, with many investors on the sidelines for the holiday-shortened week. Volume is expected to be low as the markets close at 1:00 PM ET (18:00 GMT) today and are closed tomorrow for Christmas.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke with the chief executive officers of the six largest U.S. banks, who confirmed they have enough liquidity to continue lending and that ""the markets continue to function properly.""
But the surprise move by Mnuchin raised worries rather than allayed them, as few in the market were concerned about liquidity in the first place.
And with no earnings reports or economic indicators for investors to trade off of, the market focused on his remarks.
Mnuchin’s actions may have been prompted by reports that President Donald Trump was considering firing Powell.
The drop in markets picked up last week after the Federal Reserve raised rates for the fourth time this year and said it would largely continue with its rate hike path and slim down its vast holdings of bonds.
Mnuchin later said Trump does not believe he has the power to remove Powell.
""It is unusual for the U.S. president to dictate the Federal Reserve and it is harmful for Trump to look into the ways of firing the chairman of the Fed. It will only shatter the market confidence further,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK.
Mnuchin will convene a call on Monday with the president's Working Group on financial markets, which includes Powell and the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The group, formed following the stock market crash of October 1987, is known more commonly as the ""Plunge Protection Team"" and met in 2009 in the latter stages of the financial crisis.
Looking to individual stocks, tech again looked shaky.
Among the FAANGs, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was off 2% following a report from The Wall Street Journal that it is among a number of companies being questioned about its revenue, specially its Amazon Prime revenue, by the SEC.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) slumped 0.8%, despite a report from The Guardian that it will surpass satellite broadcaster Sky in subscribers in the UK.
And Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fell 1.4%. Wedbush took the stock off its Best Ideas list, but maintained its outperform rating.

974,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 24, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>",Analysts Say Brace for a Steeper Plunge as Shutdown Drags On,"(Bloomberg) -- The year-end rout in financial markets may get worse with S&P futures falling as much as 0.9 percent in a volatile morning session. Analysts and strategists say investor sentiment is weakening further amid the federal government shutdown, with no quick end in sight.
The S&P 500 Index has fallen more than 12 percent just in December, on pace for the steepest monthly decline since October 2008, as fear of a possible slowdown in the new year gripped the market. Recent cautious commentary from economic bellwether FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX). stoked concerns, with warnings about slowing global trade and weakness in the European economy. Investors are also possibly pricing in the impact of a policy error by the Federal Reserve and a weak Chinese economy.
Given the bearish backdrop, a prolonged shutdown can only mean one thing: more sell-off.
“Risk aversion is now extreme; even though the Street may point to a ‘less dovish’ FOMC and concerns about a U.S. government shutdown as possible reasons for the selloff, the apparent lack of positive drivers and headlines has curbed risk appetite,” Nomura strategist Masanari Takada wrote in a note. “While sentiment looks to be skewed towards fear, most market participants seem to be looking for a plausible excuse to sell.”
The bone of contention in the standoff between the two parties is the funding for President Donald Trump’s border wall with Mexico. The next possibility for votes in the House and Senate is Dec. 27, but Democrats have indicated the two sides are far from a deal.
“Best/unlikely case to end partial U.S. Government shutdown would be post-Christmas deal when Congress returns Thursday,” Cowen analysts Roman Schweizer and Cai von Rumohr wrote in a note to clients. “Worst/likely case is after Jan. 3 when Democrats get the House back. We do not see Democrats funding Trump’s Wall.”
Government contractors such as technology service providers may feel some pressure, although Cowen expects any financial impact to be very minor. Science Applications International Corp. might be among the most exposed as its three large NASA programs account for an estimated 7 percent of sales, but Cowen expected the impact to be modest.
While the current shutdown affects only nine out of the fifteen cabinet level departments, and excludes the Department of Defense, the uncertainty will be an overhang on defense stocks.
Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu sees “an overhang around the fiscal 2020 budget negotiations that will require compromise on both sides of the aisle and a Budget Agreement to repeal the Sequester.” Defense stocks suffered a setback last week after Secretary of Defense James Mattis resigned following Trump’s announcement about withdrawing troops from Syria.
Mattis’s resignation could be a “material negative event” for 2020 budget negotiations,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Robert Spingarn said on Dec. 21, noting that Mattis enjoyed broad bipartisan support. The S&P Supercomposite Aerospace and Defense Industry Index (S15AERO) has dropped over 13 percent this month, paced by Triumph Group Inc., Arconic Inc.,  Textron Inc  (NYSE:TXT)., and General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD)."

OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) announced a $230 million cost savings program on Monday along with steps including the refinancing of one Boeing (N:BA) 787 Dreamliner that the budget airline said would generate more than $30 million in liquidity.
It also said it was making several changes to its route portfolio as well as to its capacity.
""Combined these measures should improve the financial performance from the start of 2019,"" it said in a statement.
The fast-growing carrier has been under pressure over the past 18 months to control costs and shore up its balance sheet as it looks to crack the transatlantic market by undercutting established rivals. 
It said its new cost-saving program was expected to generate savings of at least 2 billion crowns ($229 million) in 2019. The airline said it would provide an update on the program on April 25 with its first-quarter results. 
Norwegian's long-haul operations have been disrupted by challenges with the Rolls-Royce (L:RR) engines on the Dreamliner. 
""The Company has now reached an agreement with Rolls-Royce which will have a positive effect from the first quarter of 2019. The commercial terms of the agreement remain confidential,"" said Norwegian Air. 
It also said it had secured financing for all aircraft deliveries due in the first half of 2019. 
""This also includes refinancing of one of the delivered (Boeing) Dreamliners, resulting in a positive liquidity effect of NOK 275 million in December 2018,"" it said.
Norwegian has embarked on an ambitious expansion plan by ordering more than 200 new planes yet investors worry it is pushing up costs quickly without producing higher returns.
The process of selling aircraft continued, it said, with ""significant"" expressions of interest in its existing fleet as well as future deliveries. 
""The Company recently signed a letter of intent for the sale of two aircraft with delivery in the first quarter of 2019. The discussions about forming a joint venture for aircraft ownership also continues with full force,"" it said.
Its share price is roughly back to the level it was a year ago having erased gains made in April after British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) said it was interested in bidding for Norwegian Air.

The shares were not traded on Monday as the Oslo bourse was closed.

Meanwhile, market focus will stay attuned to developments out of Washington DC after the failure by the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump to agree to a spending bill by midnight Saturday resulted in a partial U.S. government shutdown.

980,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>",Two million job ads missing? China's 51job criticizes 'improper' research,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese recruitment service provider  51job  (O:JOBS) on Monday rejected claims that more than 2 million job ads had disappeared from its website this year due to an economic slump, saying a Chinese securities firm was smearing economic prospects.
In a statement posted on its official social media account on Wechat, 51job said Wuhan-based Tianfeng Securities <601162.SS> had made an ""improper"" analysis of the platform's data using a web crawler program in a research note published in November.
Tianfeng said it found the number of job listings on 51job shrank from 2.85 million to just 830,000 in six months, from April to September. 
""The content of that research is contrary to facts,"" 51job said in a statement, criticizing the research approach as loose and irresponsible, stressing it owns multiple recruitment websites besides the main 51job website.
It cited the company's robust earnings as evidence that the numbers were false. In both the second and third quarters, 51job's revenue from online recruitment rose more than 30 percent from a year earlier, it said.
It did not give details on actual changes of job listings, however.
Tianfeng Securities could not be immediately reached by Reuters for comment. 
""Our research department has always strictly observed relevant regulations and rigorously and objectively analyzed data,"" Tianfeng was quoted as saying in a response to 51job after being contacted by its lawyers, according to 51job's statement.
51job said Tianfeng had declined to make a public apology after deleting the research note from its own platform.
Tianfeng's share fell 2.66 percent on Monday from the previous trading day. 
Tianfeng's findings had misled the market and raised widespread concerns about employment stability and the health of the broader economy, 51job wrote in its statement. 
""Who gave Tianfeng Securities the guts to do this?"" it wrote, adding it had not been asked to verify the numbers before the research was posted.
China's economy has been under growing pressure lately from a combination of domestic deleveraging policies, a campaign to shut polluting industries, and a protracted trade dispute with the United States. 
Stability-minded policymakers have vowed to prevent extensive job losses, including rolling out measures to reduce costs for struggling companies that choose not to cut staff.
China aims to maintain its urban survey-based jobless rate below 5.5 percent in 2018, while keeping the registered unemployment rate, another official gauge, below 4.5 percent.

Many analysts say, however, that the government figure is an unreliable indicator of national employment conditions as it measures only employment in urban areas and does not take into account millions of migrant workers.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares fell on Monday as worries over slowing economic growth and tighter monetary conditions kept the region's equities on course for their biggest yearly loss in a decade
Activity was thin, however, with many markets closed or trading for a half-day only before the Christmas holiday.
By 0956 GMT, Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) was down 0.6 percent, while France's CAC (FCHI) and Spain's IBEX (IBEX) had eased 0.9 and 0.6 percent respectively. Germany's DAX (GDAXI) and Italy's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) were shut.
""Markets still under pressure from last week's more hawkish Fed update, exacerbating fears about slowing growth and more expensive refinancing following years of stimulus,"" said Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets.
European shares are down nearly 14 percent year-to-date and on track for their worst year since 2008, having fallen back to a two-year-low on last week's rate outlook from the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Corporate news was thin but the pan-European exchange operator  Euronext  (PA:ENX) said it aimed to buy the Oslo stock exchange for 625 million euros. Euronext (PA:ENX) shares fell as much as 0.7 percent before recovering most of its losses.
Advertising companies WPP (L:WPP) and Publicis (PA:PUBP) were among the biggest losers, down 2.3 and 2.6 percent. 
S4 Capital (L:SFOR), the marketing venture set up by former WPP boss Martin Sorrell, was flat on its first trading day on the London Stock Exchange's main market.

(KS:005380) expects growth in the Russian auto market to slow sharply next year, the head of its Russian branch said on Monday. 
Automakers have warned Russia's plan to raise value added tax in 2019 would hit car sales, which have only just started to recover from four years of stagnation.
Hyundai forecasts car sales in Russia will grow 5-6 percent in 2019, after an expected increase of 12.8 percent this year, the company's Russian managing director Alexei Kalitsev told reporters.

Hyundai plans to keep its 10 percent market share in Russia next year and increase sales to 190,000 cars from 180,000 in 2018.

The mistake, reported in Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger and confirmed by the insurer on Monday, resulted from an error that occurred between AXA and its house bank, the insurer said. Employees can either return the money or take it as an advance on their January paychecks.
AXA did not immediately say how much money was incorrectly paid out, but based on the average Swiss salary of around 85,000 Swiss francs per year, the error could have amounted to more than 30 million Swiss francs ($30 million) in overpayments.

""There are worse things,"" an AXA spokesman told Tages-Anzeiger. ""The main thing is, all employees got their December pay on time before Christmas.""

The government set the range for the Goods and Service Tax from 28 percent to 5 percent on most items when the signature reform was introduced last year. 
""Multiple slabs were fixed transiently in order to ensure the tax of no commodity goes up radically. This contained the inflation impact,"" Jaitley wrote in his blog.
""A future road map could well be to work toward a single standard rate instead of two standard rates of 12 percent and 18 percent. It could be a rate at some mid-point between the two.""
He also said the country should look toward having slabs of zero, five percent and a standard rate for luxury and sin goods (alcohol, drugs, cigarettes, etc.). 

The government will also look at transferring cement into a lower tax slab as the next priority, he wrote.

Now the bull is on life support and the search for its killer is on.
And while many on Wall Street share the president’s frustration with the man atop his markets enemies list, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, they say Trump himself risks making things worse with too much aggression when equities are one bad session away from a bear market.
“You would think that after coming off of the worst week for the markets since the financial crisis in 2008, he would look to create some stability,” said Chuck Cumello, CEO of Essex Financial Services. “Instead we get the opposite, with this headline and more self-induced uncertainty. This coming from a president who when the market goes up views it as a barometer of his success.”
Click here to see all of Trump’s tweets on the economy and markets.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin moved to reassure markets late Saturday that Powell wouldn’t be ousted, after four people familiar with the matter said Trump has repeatedly discussed firing the central bank chief in recent days. In a pair of tweets, Mnuchin quoted Trump as saying: “I never suggested firing Chairman Jay Powell, nor do I believe I have the right to do so.” White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney on Sunday echoed the comments.
To be sure, equities remain solidly higher since Trump took office. Even with its 17 percent drop over the last three months, the S&P 500 has risen 18 percent since Election Day. The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 25 percent with dividends. True, volatility has jumped to a 10-month high, but market turbulence was significantly worse for three long stretches under Barack Obama.
The S&P 500 slumped 7.1 percent last week and the Nasdaq Composite Index spiraled into a bear market. As of 2:28 p.m. in Hong Kong, futures on the S&P 500 were up 0.6 percent while Nasdaq 100 contracts added 0.5 percent.
While Trump seems to have found his villain in Powell, blame is a dubious concept in financial markets, as anyone who has tried to explain the current rout can attest. Along with the Fed chairman, everything from rising bond yields, trade tariffs, falling bond yields, Brexit, tech valuations and Italian finances have been implicated in the downdraft that has erased $5 trillion from American equity values in three months.
Whatever’s behind it, nothing has been able to stop it. And while many on Wall Street credit the president for helping jump-start the market after taking office, they say he should look in the mirror to see another person creating stress for it right now.
“Trump was gloating how much good he had done for the economy and the market. Now he’s blaming Powell for the decline instead of himself,” said Rick Bensignor, founder of Bensignor Group and a former strategist for  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). “Half his key staff has been fired or quit. The markets are off for a variety of reasons, but most of them have Trump behind them.”
If Trump is bent on getting rid of Powell, there may be ways of doing it that don’t risk kicking a volatile market into hysteria, said Walter “Bucky” Hellwig, a senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.
“It doesn’t have to be firing, it could be someone else taking Powell’s job. That could be a net positive for the markets,” Hellwig said. “A friendly change in the head of the Fed may cause some turbulence short-term but it may be offset with the markets repricing the risk associated with two rate hikes in 2019.”
For now, the turmoil shows no signs of letting up. In the Nasdaq 100, home to tech giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), there have been 17 sessions with losses greater than 1.5 percent this quarter, the most since 2009. Small caps are down 26 percent from a record, while the Nasdaq Biotech Index has dropped at least 1 percent on seven straight days, the longest streak since its inception in 1993.
It’s been a long time since anyone in the U.S. has lived through this protracted a decline. Including Trump.
”It’s impossible to tease out what the proximate causes are,” said Kevin Caron, a senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors. “The normal ebb and flow of financial markets are all part of the mix. It’s impossible just to point to the chairman as the only input.”

991,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2018 12:05AM ET</span>",South Korea to file complaint against BMW for 'delayed' response to engine fires,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's transport ministry said it would file a complaint against German luxury carmaker BMW (DE:BMWG) with prosecutors for allegedly delaying recalls and concealing defects that led to several engine fires in the country this year. 
The ministry also fined BMW 11.2 billion won ($9.96 million) over ""delayed recalls"".
A faulty exhaust treatment system in BMW diesel cars caused 52 vehicle fires in South Korea as of end-November, prompting the company to recall 172,080 models and issue an apology.
The government said an investigation showed that a faulty design in BMW's Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) unit sparked the fires, adding it will decide whether to order more recalls. 
BMW denied design defects and said it recalled models in a timely manner. 
""We embarked on recall measures without hesitation at the time when the root cause of fires was confirmed,"" BMW's Korean unit said in statement on Monday. 
BMW said it first acknowledged in July this year the faulty EGR system causing fires, but the government said BMW was aware of the problem since 2015 when it created a task force to address the issue. 
BMW announced the recall of 106,317 vehicles in July, but the automaker did not recall an additional 65,763 vehicles that use the same engines until October, the government said. 
The rate of BMW vehicles catching fires was 0.14 percent in South Korea, similar to 0.19 percent in Germany and 0.17 percent in the United Kingdom, and lower than those in the United States and China, South Korea said. 
BMW's South Korean sales fell nearly 10 percent to 47,569 vehicles from January to November from a year earlier. This compared with the imported car market's 13 percent growth and Hyundai Motor's (KS:005380) 3 percent sales gain. 
BMW is the second-biggest imported car maker after Mercedes Benz (DE:DAIGn) in South Korea. 

German automakers have in recent years achieved breakneck sales growth in South Korea, long dominated by Hyundai, fueled by their strength in fuel-efficient diesel vehicles and the country's free trade deal with the European Union and the United States.

Sources also told Reuters Trump has privately discussed the possibility of firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, a move that would likely roil financial markets.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin felt it necessary to personally call the heads of the six largest U.S. banks to calm nerves and made plans to convene a group of officials known as the ""Plunge Protection Team.""

GLOBAL SLOWDOWN
The political uncertainty has only added to the air of risk aversion, punishing equities to the benefit of bonds.
The Nasdaq (IXIC) has fallen nearly 22 percent from its Aug. 29 high and into bear territory, while the S&P 500 (SPX) was on track for its worst December since the Great Depression.
At the same time 10-year Treasury yields were near their lowest since August at 2.79 percent , having fallen over 40 basis points in just six weeks.
The gap between two- and 10-year yields has shrunk to only 14 basis points, a flattening of the curve that has sometimes heralded economic turning points in the past.
""Many of the financial and economic indicators that turn first around business cycle peaks are now flashing red in advanced economies,"" warned Simon MacAdam, global economist as Capital Economics.
""This is consistent with our view that the recent loss of momentum in the world economy will develop into a more severe slowdown in 2019.""
The flight to safe havens was again boosting the Japanese yen, with the dollar near a three-month trough at 111.02 yen  on Monday.
It fared better on the euro, which was undermined by a run of poor data out of Europe. The single currency hovered at $1.1376 (EUR=), after being as high as $1.1485 last week.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar index was a shade softer at 96.835 (DXY).
In commodity markets, gold held near its recent six-month peak as the dollar eased and the threat of higher U.S. interest rates waned. Spot gold  stood at $1,261.05 per ounce.
Oil prices were near their lowest since the third quarter of 2017, having shed no less than 11 percent last week. [O/R]

995,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 23, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>",Mnuchin Bid to Calm Markets Risks Making Bad Situation Worse,"(Bloomberg) -- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin looked to quash big-bank worries over recent plunging stock markets and reports that President Donald Trump might move on his Federal Reserve chief by reassuring the financial community on Sunday that market liquidity is in good shape.
Some market participants, however, questioned why Mnuchin answered a question that no one seemed to be asking. By confirming there was ample liquidity to stave off any shocks to the system, was he suggesting that liquidity has in fact become an issue?
Mnuchin tweeted late Sunday afternoon that he’d called the chief executive officers of the nation’s six largest banks and that those chiefs “confirmed they have ample liquidity available for lending to consumer, business markets, and all other market operations.” Treasury also said Mnuchin would convene a call on Monday with the President’s Working Group on financial markets.
Even with U.S. stock markets on the skids for weeks, and the federal government in a partial shutdown since Saturday, that left many market-watchers wondering whether there is something more systemic going on that they hadn’t realized.
“My initial instinct is this isn’t necessarily a positive thing because it portrays that there’s worries that there is a bigger, broader issue than what I think is just typical re-positioning toward the end of the year,” said Nathan Thooft, Manulife Asset Management’s head of global asset allocation. “When you see it and investors look at it, I don’t think they’re going to view it as, ‘Oh, this is the saving grace of what’s going to cause the catalyst to turn markets around.”’
Mnuchin’s calls - and announcement of a Monday meeting - capped a chaotic weekend that started with plunging markets and got a jolt from a Bloomberg report that Trump was discussing firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Mnuchin had issued a statement by Twitter Saturday evening quoting the president as saying he wouldn’t fire Powell and disavowing authority to do so.
A Treasury spokesman said Mnuchin initiated the calls with the bankers because he felt that having conversations with major market participants, as well as holding the Working Group call, was prudent given considerable market volatility.
The group, which includes officials from the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, was created after the 1987 U.S. stock market crash by an executive order signed by President Ronald Reagan.
The group worked overnight during the global financial crisis of 2008 -- in October of that year it issued a statement saying it was taking multiple actions to stabilize the financial system.
But even after recent market losses -- the S&P 500 fell 7.1 percent last week, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index entered a bear market -- a liquidity squeeze or a fresh financial crisis hadn’t been on the market’s mind.
“The Secretary of Treasury calling the nation’s top bankers on a Sunday to confirm they have cash to lend. Not exactly confidence inspiring,” said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group.
According to the Treasury, the chief executives Mnuchin spoke with on Sunday were: Brian Moynihan of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC); Michael Corbat of Citi; David Solomon of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS); Jamie Dimon of  JP Morgan Chase  ; James Gormanof  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS); and Tim Sloan of  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).
A spokesman for Goldman Sachs, as well as spokeswomen for  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Wells Fargo, declined to comment. 
A spokesman for JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)., the nation’s biggest bank, who was contacted before Mnuchin’s tweet, also declined to comment. Representatives from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley didn’t immediately return requests for comment.

996,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2018 07:11PM ET</span>",Index futures little changed ahead of holiday-shortened week,"By Imani Moise
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. equity index futures were little changed late on Sunday as electronic trading resumed to kick off a holiday-shortened week following reports over the weekend that President Donald Trump has privately discussed firing the head of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
In early trading, the benchmark S&P 500's e-mini futures contract  was up about 0.1 percent, retracing a modest drop when trading resumed at 6 p.m. ET. Futures tracking the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) had also drifted up a bit after opening lower as well.
With investors worried about a litany of factors, including a partial federal government shutdown, the U.S.-China trade dispute and interest rate hikes by the Fed, U.S. stocks have plunged in December. The S&P 500 (SPX) has suffered its largest monthly loss so far since the financial crisis a decade ago and is on pace for the largest loss in any December since the Great Depression.
""More than anything else right now Washington and politics are absolutely driving investor sentiment and market direction and that can turn on dime,"" said Oliver Pursche, a board member at Bruderman Asset Management.
As of Friday's close, the Nasdaq alone is down nearly 22 percent from its record high close in late August and is now formally in a bear market. The Dow and S&P are not far off those levels.
The drop in futures came after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke with each of the chief executive officers of the largest U.S. banks, the Treasury said, and those institutions confirmed they have enough liquidity to continue lending to consumers and corporate clients.
Mnuchin late Saturday had issued a tweet saying Trump does not believe he has the power to remove Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Trump has been irate with Powell, his own appointee, since the Fed has raised interest rates four times this year and continues a process of slimming down the vast holdings of bonds it accumulated to help battle the deep recession caused by the financial crisis a decade ago.
Most economists and investors assert that any attempt by Trump to fire Powell would have significant repercussions in financial markets, which have long operated on the principle that the U.S. central bank's independence is integral to its mission and to market stability.
Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, said Mnuchin’s acknowledgement that the White House does not have the ability to remove Powell was more reassuring for investors than trying to say it did not want to remove the Fed chair. 
""The administration hasn’t been all that stable when it comes to changing their mind,” he said. “Politically these are very strange times.""
Mnuchin will convene a call on Monday with the president's Working Group on financial markets, a group that includes Powell and the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The group, formed following the stock market crash of October 1987, is known more commonly as the ""Plunge Protection Team"" and met in 2009 in the latter stages of the financial crisis.
Still, Meckler says markets are likely to face headwinds as long as there are open questions about the looming trade war and when the government shutdown will end.
""Most of the statements are only saying that the worst case is unlikely, which isn’t the same as saying something positive,"" he said.

Last week, KKR cut its A$1.8 billion buyout proposal for the struggling Australian company. This came seven weeks after KKR upped its indicative bid to access MYOB's financial records.
MYOB's acceptance comes after it initially said on Thursday it would reject the new suggested price of A$3.40 per share, which was slashed from A$3.77.
Shares of the Melbourne-based company tumbled 14 percent following KKR's lowered offer price and last traded at A$2.870 on Friday, representing a 18.5 percent discount to the new price.
KKR cut its offer price at a time when global technology players such as  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Google owner Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) have fallen sharply amid concerns about incursions on privacy, sparking a sell-off across the broader sector.
MYOB Chairman Justin Milne said the proposal was in the best interest of shareholders, considering ""market uncertainty and the longer-term nature of the strategic growth plan the Company has embarked upon."" 
He added that ""the unique provisions of the agreement with KKR provide a level of certainty for our shareholders.""
In its statement, MYOB also said it expects revenue growth in the 2018 financial year of about 7 percent, while it sees its EBITDA margin between 42 percent and 43 percent. 

Under a scheme of arrangement, MYOB has agreed to ""go shop"" provisions with KKR, which allows MYOB to seek alternate superior proposals until Feb. 22, 2019.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) chief executive Elon Musk said the electric car company will reimburse customers if delays to car deliveries cause them to miss out on a significant tax credit. 
Under a major tax overhaul passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress late last year, incentives in the way of tax credits that lower the cost of electric vehicles are available for the first 200,000 such vehicles sold by an automaker. The tax credit is then reduced by 50 percent every six months until it phases out.
Earlier this year, Tesla said orders for cars placed by Oct. 15 would be eligible for the full tax credit of $7,500 and that customers would receive their cars by the end of the year. From Jan. 1, 2019, the tax credit drops to $3,750.
With only a few days of 2018 remaining, some customers still waiting for their vehicles have used social media to complain about the delays and what they called a lack of communication by the company.
Responding on Saturday to a Twitter user who asked what will happen if cars did not arrive in time, Musk replied: ""If Tesla committed delivery & customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference.""

Also on Saturday, Musk said on Twitter that the company should have all orders for the mid-range Model 3 - a mass-market sedan that Tesla hopes is its key to success - delivered by the end of the year.

999,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2018 12:55PM ET</span>",Italy rejigs measures to spur sale of green cars,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italy will offer subsidies of up to 6,000 euros ($6,820) to buyers of new low emission vehicles while slapping taxes on the purchase of larger petrol and diesel cars, according to measures approved in parliament.
The measures, contained in Italy's 2019 budget passed by the upper house on Sunday, made changes to rules proposed by Rome earlier this month which drew criticism from the car industry.
Unions and auto sector associations have warned about the proposed new tax, saying it could hurt not only carmakers but also the entire supply chain and could cost jobs.
Italy's ruling parties - the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League - have been at odds over the issue, with the latter opposing any new taxes on cars, while the pro-environment 5-Star has encouraged the new rules.
In their new form, the taxes proposed for cars running on traditional fuels will no longer apply to small family cars but only to larger high-powered vehicles, including SUVs.
A tax of 1,100 euros will be slapped on new petrol and diesel cars that generate 161-175 grams of CO2 emissions per kilometer. That will rise to 1,600 euros for emissions of 176-200 and to 2,000 euros for emissions of 201-250.
Incentives for electric and hybrid vehicles, meanwhile, will vary according to emissions generated and will not apply to models that cost more than 50,000 euros ($57,000).
The new measures, which still need to be approved in the lower house, will come into effect on March 1 and last to the end of 2021.
Electric, hybrid and methane gas-powered cars currently make up only around 7 percent of Italy's car sales.
Italy's Fiat Chrysler, which at present sells no electric or hybrid cars in Europe, said in November it was planning to spend more than 5 billion euros on new models and engines in Italy between 2019-2021.
In December, in reaction to the original measures, Fiat said it could review its Italian investment plan if Rome raised taxes on petrol and diesel cars. Fiat has not commented since changes to the original proposals were made. 
Italy's 2019 budget is expected to be approved by the lower house of parliament this week.

1000,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>","Kraft Heinz, Mondelez make the cut in Campbell Soup's international business auction: sources","By Greg Roumeliotis and Harry Brumpton
(Reuters) - U.S. food companies Kraft Heinz Co (O:KHC) and  Mondelez International Inc  (O:MDLZ) have been short-listed to participate in the second round of  Campbell Soup  Co's (N:CPB) auction of its international business, people familiar with the matter said.
The development boosts Campbell Soup's chances of divesting its international portfolio, which includes its Australian cookie brand Arnott's and Danish baked snacks maker Kelsen Group, with one deal, two sources said on Sunday. 
Both Kraft Heinz and Mondelez are interested in the assets so they can expand their global footprint. Based on the first-round bids received, Campbell Soup could fetch close to $3 billion for its international business, the sources added.
Private equity firms Bain Capital LP, KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) and FinTrek Capital Hong Kong Co Ltd also made the shortlist to participate in the second round of the auction for Campbell Soup's international business, according to the sources.
Nutella maker Ferrero SpA, which had previously also expressed interest in the assets, is currently in talks with Campbell Soup over whether it will remain involved in the auction process, the sources added.
Campbell Soup could wrap up the auction for its international business in the first quarter of 2019, the sources said, asking not to be identified because details of the process are confidential.
Campbell Soup, Kraft Heinz, Mondelez, Ferrero, Bain, KKR and FinTrek Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Under pressure from investors to boost its profitability and stock performance, Campbell Soup announced in August it would make preparations to divest its international portfolio as well as its ""fresh"" business, which includes Bolthouse Farms and Garden Fresh Gourmet.
This will allow it to reduce its $8 billion debt pile and focus on its core North American market, as well as its snacks, meals and beverages businesses. Most of the debt weighing on Campbell Soup is the legacy of its $6.1 billion acquisition in March of snack maker Snyder's-Lance Inc. 
Last Thursday, Campbell Soup named Mark Clouse, the former CEO of Pinnacle Foods, as its new chief executive, in another key step in the company's efforts to regain market share and boost profits. The pick had the backing of Campbell Soup shareholder Third Point LLC.

In November, Campbell Soup settled a proxy contest against Third Point by agreeing to add two of the activist hedge fund's nominees to the food company's board, and giving the investor a say in selecting Campbell Soup's next CEO.

Ghosn was re-arrested on Friday based on suspicions that around October 2008 he shifted personal trades to Nissan to make it responsible for 1.85 billion yen ($16.6 million) in appraisal losses, prosecutors said.

They said the move inflicted damage on Nissan by having it deposit a total of $14.7 million on four occasions between June 2009 and March 2012 into a related bank account.

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2018 01:22PM ET</span>",Top shareholder in Banca Carige blocks crucial cash call,"By Andrea Mandala and Valentina Za
GENOA, Italy (Reuters) - The top investor in Banca Carige (MI:CRGI) on Saturday blocked a crucial cash call at the troubled Italian bank from being approved because it wanted more clarity on the lender's future before backing a new capital injection.
The 400 million euro ($455 million) stock issue was part of a rescue plan financed by Italy's lenders to stave off a crisis that would have hit the industry at a time of already intense market pressure.
A representative for Carige's top investor Malacalza Investimenti, the holding company of local businessman Vittorio Malacalza, told shareholders that it did not oppose in principle a further cash call at Carige, but wanted to have more details on the bank's new business plan and merger options first.
""Malacalza has invested more than 400 million euros for a stake that is worth very little,"" the representative said.
""...We don't doubt your good faith but there are missing elements.""
During a dramatic meeting, the Malacalza family ignored pleas from the bank's top executives to change their mind over the cash call.
The rejection casts a new shadow over Italy's banking sector, which is wrestling with rising funding costs and a hit to capital buffers due to the shrinking value of lenders' Italian bond portfolios after a populist government drove away foreign investors.
Carige has fallen behind in the restructuring process which has seen peers clean up their balance sheets in recent years.
Heavily exposed to the suffering local economy and plagued by governance problems, the Genoa-based bank lost 1.3 billion euros from 2014 to 2017, mainly due to bad loans.
It raised 2.2 billion euros from investors over the same period in three successive cash calls. The bank was worth 90 million euros at Friday's market price.
The latest stock issue was meant to allow Carige to repay in shares a costly subordinated loan that Italian lenders subscribed to last month to help replenish Carige's second-tier capital buffers.
Carige had failed to sell the bond on the market due to the excessive returns demanded by investors. The bond's 13 percent coupon rises to 16 percent now that Carige failed to approve the stock issue needed to convert the bond into equity.
CEO Fabio Innocenzi told shareholders that the stepped-up coupon would cost the bank 51 million euros a year in interest payments.
The European Central Bank on Friday had given Carige until the end of 2019 to durably meet its capital requirements, urging the lender to complete the capital strengthening and actively seek a merger partner, while continuing to shed bad debts and other non-core assets.
Malacalza has built a 27.6 percent stake in Carige since running to its rescue back in 2014. In September Malacalza pushed out a third CEO in as many years in an attempt to solve a governance crisis which had drawn complaints from the ECB.
""Malacalza Investimenti has confidence in this board ... but this is a transaction which would require us to invest... more than 100 million euros...to avoid a strong dilution of our stake,"" the representative said.
A deep recession in Italy and a global slump in the shipping industry have hit Genoa's local economy, which is now grappling with the fallout from the deadly collapse of a bridge that severed the port's main artery to Europe.

According to public news agency Agencia Estado, Federal Judge Therezinha Cazerta suspended a decision which had suspended the sale earlier in the week. Her decision came in response to a request from Brazil's solicitor general, known as the AGU, which argued that the injunction would hurt the economy and the previous decision represented government overreach into the free market.
Legal challenges to the deal, which would reshape the global passenger aviation market, have been plentiful and are common in Brazilian dealmaking in general.
Boeing and Embraer said on Monday they had finalized theterms of the agreement, valuing the Brazilian planemaker's commercial division at $5.26 billion. [nL1N1YM097] The agreement needs approval from the Brazilian governmentbecause it holds a so-called golden share in Embraer that gives it veto power over strategic decisions and any change inits controlling interest.

LONDON (Reuters) - Police have arrested a man and a woman after rogue drone operators crippled London's Gatwick Airport for three days by repeatedly flying onto the airfield, sparking a major security response. 
Britain's second-largest airport was back in operation on Saturday after it was forced to close its runway in the run up to Christmas when drones flew near the site south of London in the most disruptive incursion from unmanned aerial vehicles at any major airport. 
Police said they had made two arrests late on Friday, a 47-year-old man and a 54-year-old woman who were from the local area. They remained in custody on Saturday on suspicion of disrupting civil aviation services. 
No group has claimed responsibility for the disruption, which forced the cancellation or diversion of around 1,000 flights, affecting 140,000 passengers over three days. 
The airport, which shut its runway for spells on Wednesday and Friday and for all of Thursday, said it aimed to run a full schedule on Saturday. 
However, it warned that passengers should expect delays and cancellations as it continues to recover from the biggest disruption since an Icelandic volcanic ash cloud in 2010. 
""We continue to urge the public, passengers and the wider community around Gatwick to be vigilant,"" Superintendent James Collis said in a statement.
""Our investigations are still on-going, and our activities at the airport continue to build resilience to detect and mitigate further incursions from drones, by deploying a range of tactics."" 
The pre-Christmas travel disruption began late on Wednesday when Gatwick was forced to cancel all flights after spotting small drones near the airfield. Every time the airport sought to reopen the runway on Thursday, the drones returned. 
Authorities finally regained control over the airfield after the army deployed unidentified military technology to guard the area, reassuring the airport that it was safe enough to fly.
""Safety is Gatwick's top priority and we are grateful for passengers' continued patience as we work to get them to their final destination in time for Christmas,"" the airport said. 
The drones caused misery for travelers, many sleeping on the airport floor as they searched for alternative routes to holidays and Christmas family gatherings. A Reuters photographer at the airport on Saturday said it was busy before Christmas but operating smoothly. 
The biggest airlines operating at Gatwick include easyJet (L:EZJ), British Airways (L:ICAG) and Norwegian (OL:NWC) and have said it is too early to determine the financial impact.

Unmanned aerial vehicles have become a growing menace at airports across the world. In Britain, the number of near misses between private drones and aircraft more than tripled between 2015 and 2017, with 92 incidents recorded last year.

He said that target was within reach.
""With that, we will stand out in a cross-comparison with other banks in Europe,"" Rohner told the Neue Zuercher Zeitung (NZZ), referring to measures such as winding down the bank's Strategic Resolution Unit, a home for assets that have been a drag on the bank’s performance.
ROTE was 6.3 percent in the first nine months of 2018.
A lawyer, Rohner has been Credit Suisse's chairman since 2011. He told the newspaper he would like to remain in the post until 2021, but said that would be up to shareholders.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) said on Friday that incoming Chief Executive Mark Clouse, a food industry veteran, could be paid as much as $7.4 million in compensation for fiscal 2019.
Clouse, the former chief of frozen food maker Pinnacle Foods, was named Campbell's new CEO on Thursday after a seven-month search to replace former CEO Denise Morrison, who left abruptly in May.
Campbell said in a filing that Clouse's pay-packet included a base salary of $1 million and a potential bonus of $1.4 million. On Jan. 22, the day he starts working at Campbell, Clouse will also get a long-term incentive award of $5 million.
At Pinnacle Foods - where Clouse's tenure was marked by a 54 percent rise in stock value - he earned $5.22 million in 2017 and $14.1 million in 2016.
Clouse, 50, began working in the food industry over two decades ago.
His appointment comes just weeks after Campbell and activist hedge fund Third Point LLC settled a bitter proxy contest. Campbell has reported years of weak earnings, trailing the rest of the food industry. 
""Campbell needs someone who can shake up the way the company is run, clean house and reinvigorate the brands,"" Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said on Thursday.
Under Clouse's watch earlier this year, Pinnacle was sold to ConAgra Brands Inc (N:CAG) for $8.1 billion. 
On Thursday, Conagra CEO Sean Connolly said since buying Pinnacle, he realized the business would be ""significantly"" less profitable than initially expected. Connolly said Pinnacle's problems were to do with innovation at its top brands, including Birds Eye and Duncan Hines.
That ""muddies Clouse's track record a little, but he's had a good track record for years and he's still an ideal candidate for Campbell,"" Weissman said.

Shares in Campbell fell 5.1 percent on Friday and have tumbled about 26 percent this year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) confirmed on Friday it is in a bear market for the first time since 2008, underscoring fears that the longest bull run in history for U.S. stocks could soon be over.
The index finished the day down 21.9 percent from its Aug. 29 record closing high, exceeding the 20 percent decline considered the threshold for a bear market.
The Nasdaq is the first of the three major U.S. stock indexes to cross that threshold, with its drop in less than four months the latest sign that the bull market that began during the financial crisis a decade ago could be almost done.

The S&P 500 is down 17.5 percent from its Sept. 20 record high close, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) is down 16.3 percent from its Oct. 3 record. 
The Nasdaq's fall reflects a sharp move by investors away from what had been the market's leaders - the so-called FAANG group of five favorite technology and internet stocks.
""It's the old saying, the generals finally got hit,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.

The latest round of selling, which on Friday dragged the Nasdaq down nearly 3 percent to its lowest closing level since August 2017, comes two days after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for a fourth time this year, as the U.S. central bank continues to unwind the low interest-rate policy that supported stocks for nearly a decade.
Concerns of slowing economic growth have also led investors to flee stocks high-valuation sectors such as technology and communication services.
In Nasdaq's record-long bull market, which ended with its all-time-high close on Aug. 29, the index gained more than 539 percent from its post-financial-crisis low on March 9, 2009. Including reinvested dividends, it delivered a total return of more than 611 percent in that time. 
By contrast, in that same period, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained just 331 percent, with a total return of 425 percent. Even with the drop since late August, Nasdaq is nearly 400 percent above its March 2009 low, with a total return of more than 456 percent.
""Nasdaq is your more growth-oriented story, so the biggest stocks are driving the overall market because they're a bigger chunk of it,"" said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. 
Past Nasdaq bear markets have lasted a long time and cut deeply. For instance, the Nasdaq fell 55.6 percent during its last bear market, which ran from Oct. 31, 2007, to March 9, 2009.
Some investors are not convinced the current bull market is over for the S&P 500. Many strategists still are forecasting the S&P 500 will end next year with modest gains.

""The market is caught up in this hysteria,"" said Ken Polcari, managing principal at ButcherJoseph Asset Management in New York. But ""it's an overreaction,"" he said, ""and if you're a long-term investor, the last thing you should be doing right now is selling.""

(Reuters) - HNA Group Co [HNAIRC.UL] is in talks to sell Ingram Micro Inc to private equity firm Apollo Global Management Llc (N:APO), a source familiar with the matter said on Friday, as the Chinese conglomerate continues to scale back operations.
HNA hopes to sell the U.S. electronics distributor for $7.5 billion, including $1.5 billion in debt, the source said, adding that it is currently in talks with Apollo after rebuffing an earlier offer that it considered too low. 
HNA has already pushed ahead with asset sales that have so far included real estate and stakes in hotels groups.
Apollo declined to comment and Ingram was not immediately available for comment. HNA was not available for comment outside normal business hours in China.
The Wall Street journal first reported https://www.wsj.com/articles/hna-in-talks-to-sell-ingram-micro-to-apollo-global-11545425703?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1 the news on Friday.
Earlier this month, Reuters reported that China Development Bank was leading a team to supervise HNA's asset disposals as the heavily indebted conglomerate unwinds a $50 billion acquisition spree and scales back to a point that will leave it holding only core assets.
Bad debt managers  China Cinda  Asset Management Co (HK:1359) advised HNA and has been involved in talks with potential buyers for Ingram, which HNA bought for $6 billion in 2016, Reuters reported in November. 

HNA Technology Co (SS:600751), which owns Ingram, said in September it had $3.55 billion of outstanding debt from the purchase of the firm, of which $350 million was due for payment this year.

1017,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 04:54PM ET</span>",Nasdaq confirms bear market; economic worries sink Wall Street,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks fell sharply in volatile trading on Friday, with the Nasdaq confirming it is in a bear market, as concerns of slowing economic growth led investors to flee stocks in high-valuation sectors such as technology and communication services.
The major U.S. stocks indexes accelerated declines in the last hour of trading after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said the United States and China might not reach a trade deal at the close of a 90-day negotiating window unless Beijing can agree to a profound overhaul of its economic policies.
With Friday's losses, the Nasdaq has fallen nearly 22 percent from its Aug. 29 high. The tech-heavy index dropped to its lowest level since August 2017.
The benchmark S&P 500 index, already on pace for its biggest percentage decline in December since the Great Depression, hit its lowest level since July 2017. It is now down 17.5 percent from its closing high on Sept. 20. The Dow Industrials fell to its lowest level since October 2017 and has declined 16.3 percent from its Oct. 3 closing high.
The mid-cap S&P 400 also confirmed it is in a bear market.
Navarro's comments added to already-mounting concerns over political uncertainty and the possibility of a slowdown in economic growth.
""That's definitely a weight on the market,"" said Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at Boston Private, of Navarro's comments. ""For investors, there's a heck of a lot of small storms to be sailing ships through.""
The increasing likelihood of a partial government shutdown injected further pessimism into U.S. stock markets. President Donald Trump said there was a very good chance a government funding bill, which includes funding for a wall along the Mexico border, would not pass the Senate.
The looming shutdown threat, along with Navarro's comments, overshadowed remarks from New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) that the Fed was open to reassessing its views, which provided a fleeting boost to the markets.
Technology and communication services stocks bore the brunt of the sell-off, falling 3.0 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively.
The FAANG group of momentum stocks fared poorly.  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) shares tumbled 6.3 percent, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares slid 5.7 percent and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares sank 5.4 percent. Shares of both Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc dropped more than 3 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 414.23 points, or 1.81 percent, to 22,445.37, the S&P 500 lost 50.84 points, or 2.06 percent, to 2,416.58 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 195.41 points, or 2.99 percent, to 6,333.00.
For the week, the S&P 500 fell 7.05 percent, the Dow dropped 6.87 percent, and the Nasdaq declined 8.36 percent.
For the second day in a row, more than 2,600 New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq-listed stocks hit 52-week lows. The day before, nearly 3,000 stocks hit their low for the year, the most in any one day since October 2008.
Adding to volatility was ""quadruple-witching,"" when options on stocks and indexes as well as futures on indexes and stocks expire. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 15.18 billion shares, its highest level in nearly two-and-a-half years, compared to the 8.81 billion average over the last 20 trading days. 
Among Wall Street's advancers were shares of  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), which jumped 7.2 percent after the company's quarterly results beat Wall Street estimates.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.57-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.77-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 174 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded five new highs and 857 new lows.

1018,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 04:43PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Ends Brutal Week Deeply in Red Amid Government Shutdown Fears,"Investing.com - The Dow ended a brutal week with a steep selloff Friday as President Donald Trump threatened a ""very long"" government shutdown just hours ahead of the midnight deadline.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.8%, and 6.4% for the week. The S&P 500 fell 2.14%. While the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.99% and entered bear-market territory for the first time since 2008 as it has lost more than 20% since its August peak.
President Trump told reporters that there's a very good chance the House funding bill will fail to pass in the Senate and that the administration is prepared for a long shutdown.
The bill requires Democratic votes to clear the Senate, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stressed that congressional Democrats will not support funding for the wall, raising the prospect of a partial government shutdown.



The selloff was led by tech on the back of a plunge in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), off 6%, as Wall Street continued to be bearish on the scandal-hit social media company.
Needham cut its price on target on Facebook stock to $170 from $215 on expectations for ongoing margin pressure and the rising risk of increased litigation costs and regulatory oversight as global scrutiny on the social media company intensifies.
The Washington Post, citing people familiar with the matter, reported Wednesday that Karl Racine, attorney general for the District of Columbia, filed a claim against the Facebook for farming out its users' data to Cambridge Analytica.
Among other FANG stocks, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) fell 5.5%, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell 3.2% and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell 5.7%.
But there was some reason for optimism as  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) surged 7% on the back of its better-than-expected fiscal second quarter earnings and revenue, sparking a bid a in retailer  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL), which rose 1.75%.
Analysts said Nike's report highlighted key positives for Foot Locker including the Jordan brand returning to growth in North America, continued product innovation launches and clean North American channel inventory.
Wall Street reversed early session gains, which had followed decidedly dovish comments from New York Fed President John Williams.
Williams said the Federal Reserve will go into next year with its “eyes wide open” and reconsider programs such as its balance sheet reduction in the event of a weaker backdrop for economic growth.
Mixed economic data, meanwhile, drew a muted reaction somewhat as U.S. gross domestic product increased at a 3.4% annual rate in the July-September period, the Commerce Department said in its final estimate, below a previous estimate of 3.5%.
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, rose 1.9% in the 12 months through November.
Top S&P 500 Gainers and Losers Today:
Nike (NYSE:NKE), CarMax (NYSE:KMX) and Abiomed (NASDAQ:ABMD) were among the top S&P 500 gainers for the session.
Perrigo (NYSE:PRGO), ConAgra Foods (NYSE:CAG) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) were among the worst S&P 500 performers of the session."

(Reuters) - Get ready for a long and ugly ride.
On Friday, the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) closed almost 22 percent below its record high daily close on Aug. 29, signaling a nearly nine-and-a-half year bull market run for the index ended in late summer. 
That cumulative loss indicates Nasdaq is now in a bear market, typically defined as a decline of 20 percent or more from a 52-week or longer high close. 
Nasdaq has endured 10 previous bear markets since it was launched in February 1971. Six of them lasted a year or longer. In three of them the index lost more than half its value. 
If this one bears any resemblance to its predecessors, investors should expect another eight to nine months of declines and their losses to deepen significantly from here.
(Graphic: Past Nasdaq bear markets - https://tmsnrt.rs/2SgqhtU)
Some key facts of past Nasdaq bear markets:
* On average, they have featured a decline of 39.74 percent over 248 trading days, roughly the length of a calendar year.
* The median decline has been 32.25 percent over 266 trading days.
* The great dot-com bust of the early part of the century still stands as the index's biggest and longest-lasting collapse. Nasdaq lost a gut-wrenching 77.93 percent over 674 trading days between March 2000 and October 2002.
* The most mild bear market saw a decline of 20.37 percent over 44 days between Sept. 13, 1978, and Nov. 14, 1978.
* The shortest one lasted just 34 days from Feb. 8, 1980, to March 27, 1980. The index fell 24.91 percent in that span.
* Over its nearly 48 years in existence, Nasdaq has spent roughly 20 percent of the time - more than 2,500 trading days - in bear market territory.

1020,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 04:36PM ET</span>",Automakers boost Takata air bag recall completion rates,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Automakers in the United States repaired more than 7.2 million defective Takata air bag inflators in 2018, as companies have ramped up efforts to track down parts in need of replacement, a report from an independent monitor released on Friday said.
Out of 37 million vehicles with 50 million inflators under recall, 16.7 million air bag inflators remain to be replaced. Average repair rates rose by 30 percent, said deputy National Highway Traffic Safety Administration chief Heidi King.
At least 23 deaths worldwide have been linked to the rupturing of faulty Takata air bag inflators, including 15 in the United States. The issue has sparked the largest auto industry safety recall in history, involving about 100 million inflators among 19 major automakers.
The issue will not end any time soon as automakers will add close to 10 million additional inflators to the record-setting recalls in January, said the report from monitor John Buretta. 
More than 290 injuries worldwide have been linked to Takata inflators that can explode, spraying metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks.
To date, 21 deaths have been reported in Honda Motor Co (T:7267) vehicles and two in  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) vehicles. Both automakers urged some drivers of older vehicles not to drive them until they got inflators replaced.
Repair rates for recalled 2006 Ford Rangers increased from 6 percent in January to 82 percent by October 2018, while recalled high-risk 2001–2003 Honda vehicles reached a repair rate of 96 percent, the report said.
Some automakers have canvassed neighborhoods in high-risk areas to try to find unrepaired models. The report also found that letters from state motor vehicle agencies had helped dramatically boost completion rates.
Additional exposure of inflators to high heat and humidity degrade the inflators, making them more prone to deadly ruptures.
""There is still a challenging road to travel ahead, and the clock is ticking for drivers and passengers with defective inflators still in their vehicles,"" Buretta wrote.

The defect led Takata to file for bankruptcy protection in June 2017. In April, auto components maker Key Safety Systems completed a $1.6 billion deal to acquire Takata. The merged company is now known as Joyson Safety Systems and is a subsidiary of Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (SS:600699).

1024,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: City Financial's hedge fund Decca to shut down - letter,"By Maiya Keidan
LONDON (Reuters) - London-based fund firm City Financial and the chief investment officer of its Decca Fund, Shahraab Ahmad, have decided to wind down the credit-focused strategy after it ""did not deliver the performance that you expect of us"", according to a letter to investors reviewed by Reuters.
City Financial was hit hard earlier in 2018 when Decca, one of its main funds, lost 21 percent in February alone after a wrong-way bet on volatile markets, according to a Bloomberg report.
The so-called February ""Volmaggedon"", which saw a steep drop in the value of financial instruments that bet on stock market volatility, was for many hedge funds a terrible month, and for some strategies the worst on record.
""Since launching the fund in 2015, we sought to deliver the types of returns that we have enjoyed with success since my first buyside experience started in 2005,"" Decca's Ahmad said in the letter. 
""However, 2018 was a challenging year across strategies and sectors, and we did not deliver the performance that you expect of us and that we are capable of.""
Decca's assets under management stood at around $1.2 billion at the start of the year, said a source familiar with the matter. 
City Financial's co-founder Andrew Williams (NYSE:WMB), who returned to an executive role at the company in October, started a strategic review of the rest of the business with newly appointed CEO Ed Orlebar, said a source with direct knowledge.
Current CEO Rob Hain will retire from the business following a period of regulatory transition, said the source.
As a result of that review, City Financial will shut its New York office, the source added.
New York-based $200 million opportunistic value fund Shaolin will continue as a standalone, independent manager while City Financial is in talks to sell Hong-Kong based long-short equities strategy PivotBase, which manages around $150 million, the source said.
After Decca's closure and the restructuring the City Financial's assets will total around $1.2 billion, down from $3.3 billion a year earlier, the source said.
""We have conducted an in-depth strategic review to ensure that City Financial is best positioned to operate in the current market environment and to serve our investors in the years ahead,"" Williams told Reuters.
A spokesman for Decca declined to comment.

1025,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 04:15PM ET</span>",Hedge fund Latimer Light says it is shutting down,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund Latimer Light Capital, which specialized in picking stocks, is closing its doors, becoming the latest casualty in an industry pummeled by the recent stock market sell-off.
New York-based Latimer Light told investors it plans to shut down in a letter it emailed on Friday, according to people familiar with the matter. A spokesperson for the firm declined to comment.
The firm was founded three years ago by Scott Phillips, who spent nearly a decade working for Stephen Mandel's Lone Pine Capital, one of the industry's most respected hedge funds.
Now Phillips joins a growing list of managers in the $3 trillion industry to call it quits as tumbling markets are prompting ever more hedge fund clients to ask for their money back. In the last months Highfields Capital and Tourbillon Capital announced plans to shut down.
Latimer Light had been operating for three years and at the end of last year, the firm had roughly $555 million in capital, according to a regulatory filing.
It invested primarily in stocks of high-growth companies or companies with solid businesses that were under-managed, the regulatory filing said. 
At the end of the third quarter it owned computer software and services company PTC Inc., and video game holding company Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. among other stocks, according to another regulatory filing.
This year has been especially tough for hedge funds. The stock market sell-off in the fourth quarter cost many a lot of money and prompted clients to run for the exits.
The average fund lost 2.1 percent in the first 11 months of the year, according to data from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). For December, the numbers suggest even more pain, with data showing that U.S. funds specializing in stock trading lost 5.5 percent this month.
Not only were hedge funds unable to keep pace with rising markets in recent years but now that stocks are tumbling, fueled by fears about corporate profits and interest rate movements, they failed to protect capital on the downside, industry investors said.
Criterion Management and Frontlight Capital also said recently that they are shutting down. More funds shut down than opened up this year, according to data from Eurekahedge.
Investors said fund managers faced with poor returns and redemptions are now deciding more often to shut down immediately instead of trying to raise cash for redemptions and then trying to raise new money to keep going.

1027,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 03:44PM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs CEO to employees: our compliance is strong,"NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) Chief Executive David Solomon on Friday defended the bank against criticism of its compliance and oversight related to dealings with the sovereign wealth fund 1MDB, according to a message sent to employees obtained by Reuters. 
""We believe our culture and our processes around our due diligence and compliance was strong at the time, and is even stronger today,"" Solomon said in the video message, reported earlier Friday by Bloomberg. ""We will not allow the culture to be defined by those who break our rules and don't uphold the values we hold dear.""
Solomon's comments come after the Malaysian government filed criminal charges against Goldman on Monday, the first charges to be brought against the bank, which has consistently denied wrongdoing.
The U.S. Department of Justice estimates that $4.5 billion was misappropriated from Malaysia's 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB, by high-level fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014. 
In November, after the Justice Department brought fraud charges against two former Goldman employees for their involvement, Solomon told employees in a voice message that he was ""personally outraged"" that any bank official would take the actions alleged by the department.

Goldman's stock has taken a beating, falling 28 percent since the charges were announced on Nov. 1, to $161.85 from $225.76.

1028,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 03:44PM ET</span>","SEC sanctions robo-advisers Wealthfront, Hedgeable","By Anna Irrera
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday it had settled charges with automated investment management providers Wealthfront Advisers LLC and Hedgeable Inc to resolve allegations that the companies had made false disclosures to their customers.
In its first enforcement actions against robo-advisers, the SEC fined Wealthfront $250,000 and Hedgeable $80,000, the regulator said. The companies did not admit or deny the SEC's findings.
An SEC order alleged that Wealthfront, one of the largest independent robo-advisers, had made false statements about a tax-loss harvesting strategy it offered to clients. The company had told clients using the service that it would monitor all clients' accounts for transactions that might trigger a sale of securities that would diminish the benefits of the tax-loss strategy but it failed to do so, the SEC alleged.
For a period of over three years these sales occurred in at least 31 percent of accounts enrolled in the company's tax-loss harvesting strategy, the SEC alleged.
The SEC's order also alleged that Wealthfront paid bloggers for client referrals without the required disclosure, improperly re-tweeted client testimonials and did not maintain a compliance program reasonably designed to prevent securities laws violations. 
Wealthfront, which manages over $11 billion in assets, acknowledged in a statement that it did not have the proper disclosure in a white paper on its tax-loss harvesting strategy but said the alleged violations had minimal impact on the tax losses harvested for client. 
""During the period January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016, wash sales made up approximately 2.3 percent of tax losses harvested for the benefit of clients,"" the statement said. ""Therefore the average Wealthfront client would have received 5.67 percent of the total annual harvesting yield versus 5.8 percent."" 
In a separate order the SEC alleged that New York-based Hedgeable made a series of misleading statements about its investment performance. 
Hedgeable, which had around $81 million in client assets under management, declined to comment. 
From 2016 to April 2017, the company posted on its website and on social media performance comparisons between itself and two competitors, the order alleged. The comparisons were misleading because they included less than 4 percent of its clients' accounts, which had higher-than-average returns, the order alleged.
The regulator also alleged that Hedgeable did not maintain required documentation and did not maintain a compliance program reasonably designed to avoid violations of securities laws.

1036,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 02:50PM ET</span>",Biotech swoon adds to Nasdaq's pain as bear market looms ever closer,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) continues to stumble its way toward a bear market, biotech shares are worsening the collapse of the tech-heavy index.
While the declines in big tech and internet names such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) have been in the spotlight, the Nasdaq Biotechnology index (NBI) has fallen about 25 percent since hitting its closing high for the year in late August, a greater decline than the broader Nasdaq in that period.
Biotech shares had been a bright spot supporting the Nasdaq's strong run for about three-quarters of this year. But as they falter, analysts say that broad macro uncertainty is undermining the sector's appeal more so than any industry-specific setbacks.
Healthcare represents about 11.5 percent of the Nasdaq, and the vast majority of those stocks are biotech or small pharmaceutical companies, according to Refinitiv data.
The biotech index on Friday touched its lowest point since January 2017, as it shed another 2.9 percent. As of early afternoon trade, it was down about 14 percent for the year.
Salim Syed, biotech analyst with Mizuho, said investor concerns about the broad economic and political climate, including trade tensions between the United States and China and rising interest rates, have weighed relatively heavily on biotech shares.
“Largely the impact has been macro and/or political headlines that have impacted the sector, but fundamentals haven’t really changed,” Syed said.
Jeff Jonas, a healthcare portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds, said a broad ""risk-off"" sentiment could be hurting biotech shares, with investors possibly more concerned that a weakening economy will dry up deal-making activity in the industry or money from other sources.
“The biotech funding environment has been wide open for a couple of years now,"" Jonas said. ""If we do go into a recession, that would be a much tougher environment.”
Only 11 of the 190 names in the Nasdaq biotech index have posted a positive return since Sept. 30, Brian Skorney, a biotech analyst with Robert W. Baird, said in a research note on Friday.
""Our sense is that folks have basically given up for the year and are resigned to watching a 2008-like collapse,"" Skorney wrote in his note.

The broader Nasdaq appeared poised on Friday to confirm a bear market, defined as a 20 percent decline from its previous high. The Nasdaq Composite was down 21 percent from its Aug 29. closing high, falling about 2 percent on the day.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) said it accepted combined fines of 10.5 million euros ($11.9 million) by a Frankfurt court in an insider trading case involving the German stock exchange operator's former Chief Executive Carsten Kengeter.
The court issued fines of 5 million euros and 5.5 million euros against the company over an alleged breach of the insider trading ban in December 2015 and for not making a public disclosure announcement in January 2016, the company said late on Friday.
It added that the court had terminated an investigation into Kengeter as a person, but declined to provide details because he was no longer with the company.
""The company remains firmly convinced that the allegations were unfounded,"" Deutsche Boerse said in a statement late on Friday.
""However, after a detailed examination and weighing all relevant aspects, Deutsche Boerse AG concluded that a termination of the proceedings on this basis is in the best interest of the company,"" it added.
The investigations into insider trading were prompted by Kengeter's purchase of Deutsche Boerse shares in December 2015, two months before the German company announced it was in talks to combine with  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE), though the merger plan eventually fell through. 
Under pressure from the investigation, Kengeter stepped down in October 2017.

Kengeter has denied any wrongdoing and has said he bought the shares through an official executive compensation program.

1041,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 01:33PM ET</span>","As FAANG stocks falter, fund managers make bets on survivors","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A bear market in the so-called FAANG stocks - Wall Street's most popular trade going into the year - is pushing fund managers into searching for the next big growth companies that can lead the overall market higher. 
Shares of  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) reached record highs in July. 
Since then, problems ranging from Facebook's data privacy scandals to Apple's declining iPhone sales to Netflix's rising cash burn rate have cratered the stocks, helping push the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index to the edge of a bear market. The Nasdaq lost another 1.7 percent in midday trading Friday.
With shares of the FAANGs down by an average of 25.6 percent since the start of the quarter, fund managers and analysts are starting to reconsider their approach to growth, treating the FAANG stocks less like a single bloc and more on their individual merits. 
""This was a year when at the start of it you had to own the FAANG names and at the end of it you don't want to own any of them,"" said Kevin Landis, portfolio manager at the Firsthand Technology Opportunities fund. 
Landis, who has been trimming his position in Apple yet still holds Amazon.com and Alphabet among his 10 largest positions, said that the FAANG group is breaking down as the companies mature and their growth plateaus. 
As a result, he is trimming his position in Netflix and instead adding to his position in streaming television company  Roku  Inc (O:ROKU), which has a market value of approximately $3.3 billion, compared with Netflix's market value of $116.3 billion. 
""It's hard to see Netflix growing here by an order of magnitude, but it's easy to see Roku growing by an order of magnitude as the cord-cutting trend picks up steam,"" he said. 
FAANG FUNDAMENTALS
There are still things to like about each FAANG stock, of course. Netflix surprised analysts with its subscriber growth in its most recent quarter, for instance, while Facebook is continuing to grow quickly overseas and Amazon's profitability came in higher than Wall Street had predicted. 
Yet each company is also facing hurdles that belie the notion that they will continue to dominate the stock market. Netflix, for instance, is trying to weather a faster cash burn rate as the cost of content increases, while revenue growth for Google's search and YouTube advertising is slowing amid stronger competition from Amazon. 
Facebook is facing higher costs and greater regulatory scrutiny, while Apple grapples with a slower-growing market for smart phones and Amazon is weighed down by higher spending costs. 
It's been a ""slow motion train wreck,"" said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. 
The steep slide in the stock market will likely break apart the popularity of investing in the stocks as a single trade, he said. ""Facebook has almost daily scandals and Netflix has the impending loss of Disney/Fox content, but the others have really done nothing wrong at all,"" he said.
Tom Plumb, portfolio manager of the Plumb Equity fund, said that he has largely stayed away from the crowded FAANG stock trade because of their high valuations. Yet of the group, he expects that Facebook is the least likely to rebound quickly, cracking the group further. 
""Companies  that have depended on the social media advertising are going to see some incredible regulatory scrutiny and I'd like to see a couple more quarters at least to see how they've adjusted their business models"" before buying their shares, he said. 
Instead, he is increasing his position in companies with strong recurring revenue streams such as Adobe Inc (O:ADBE),  Visa Inc  (N:V), and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT).

""You don't get to buy companies at panic prices unless there's a panic, and I think there's an incredible amount of anxiety in the market right now,"" he said.

1042,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",Junk Bonds Endure an Awful Day But Live to Tell About It,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Bond traders have a technical name for what just happened to the U.S. high-yield bond market. They call it a “puke.”
The yield spread on junk bonds widened 33 basis points on Thursday, the biggest jump in more than seven years, to 508 basis points, according to Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) data. As recently as Dec. 14, high-yield investors were holding on to a slight gain for 2018. Now they’re down 2.2 percent, on track for the first annual loss since 2015. Funds tracking U.S. corporate high-yield debt lost $788.5 million in the week ended Dec. 19, the fifth consecutive week of outflows, according to Lipper data. That followed a massive $2.06 billion withdrawal the previous week. And speculative-grade borrowers are steering clear of the meltdown entirely: December is shaping up to be the first month in 10 years with no bond sales.
Total returns in the junk bond market had remained positive for so long that some wondered whether the debt could provide shelter from equity-market volatility. At a certain point on Thursday, investors realized that wouldn’t be the case. Maybe it was because of a perceived misstep by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, or the price of oil finally starting to bite, or any number of other reasons. Regardless, trading in the biggest high-yield funds shows exactly when the “puke” happened: Around 11:21 a.m. Here’s Bloomberg News’s Carolina Wilson on what exactly took place.
A trader sold close to 4 million shares worth $322 million of the iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, ticker HYG, at 11:21 a.m. in New York Thursday. About five minutes later, 8 million shares worth $267 million of the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF, ticker JNK, were sold. Then, another $350 million worth of HYG was unloaded at 1:39 p.m.
By the time the dust settled, trading volume in HYG soared to an all-time high, and the fund’s discount to its net asset value reached the largest since February. JNK, too, had one of its biggest days ever by both metrics. Both fund prices are the lowest since early 2016, when the market was just starting to bounce back from a collapse in the price of oil to less than $30 a barrel.
The marriage of relatively illiquid junk bonds and the instantaneous nature of exchange-traded funds has always been a dicey subject, with some investors expressing concern about how the products would react in a sharp sell-off. Thursday may have provided an answer: It’s painful, but not apocalyptic. For those who have doubts about how much stress the market is under, consider this: December is on track to the be the first-ever month in which high-yield ETFs experienced net outflows. Usually, enough money comes in, seeing the lower price as an attractive entry point.
One complicating factor, and a reason it might not be the time to dump everything high yield, is that the markets are approaching the end of the year, which means thin trading volume. “Right now, nobody wants to be a hero,” Randall Parrish, a senior portfolio manager at Voya Investment Management, told Bloomberg’s Claire Boston on Dec. 14, when junk bonds still had a positive return for 2018. That wound up being the right call.
Things could get worse, starting first and foremost with energy-sensitive bonds, given crude oil’s slide to $46 a barrel from more than $75 in early October. On the other hand, there’s no shortage of investors who appear ready to go bargain hunting when the calendar turns. It doesn’t hurt that New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) not so subtly sought to calm financial markets with his comments Friday, potentially alleviating some concerns that the central bank is making a policy mistake.
Markets don’t feel better immediately after puking, but it’s the most violent part of repricing to a better level. Now that junk bonds have gotten that out of their system, expect a calmer ride the rest of the year as investors assess whether to step back in come January."

Nike (NYSE:NKE) reported fiscal second-quarter earnings of 52 cents per share on revenue of $9.37 billion, above analysts' estimates of 46 cents a share and $9.18 billion in revenue, sending its shares more than 6% higher.
Wall Street turned bullish on Nike following the earnings release, with Pivotal Research Group upgrading the sportswear giant to buy from hold and slapping an $80 price target on the stock.
Analysts touted further optimism ahead of the upcoming year, forecasting the company will continue to claw market share away from rivals like Adidas and UnderArmour, led by ongoing momentum from product innovation, the global rollout of its digital initiatives like NikePlus membership and the SNKRS app, supply chain benefits and digital growth.
But not everyone is convinced Nike's stock is on a path to runaway growth.
B. Riley FBR said it would hold off pulling the trigger on the sportswear giant's shares amid concerns about valuation.
Still, Nike's positive quarter also rubbed off on retailer  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) as its shares rallied more than 5%.
Analysts said Nike's report highlighted key positives for Foot Locker including the Jordan brand returning to growth in North America, continued product innovation launches and clean North American channel inventory.
Nike's optimism on growth opportunities in core footwear in moderate channels such as Kohl's was viewed as a negative for rival  Under Armour , Canaccord said in a note. Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) fell 3%.

1061,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",India’s Stock Market Leapfrogs Germany's to Become World’s Seventh-Biggest,"(Bloomberg) -- India’s ascent on the global stage has claimed another victory after its stock market overtook Germany to become the seventh largest in the world.
The Asian giant edged past the equity market of Europe’s largest economy for the first time in seven years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That means, after the U.K. leaves the European Union in March, the bloc would have only one country -- France -- among the seven biggest markets.
The move reflects India’s positive returns this year as companies’ reliance on domestic demand enabled them to avoid the meltdown in other emerging markets spurred by Federal Reserve tightening and a trade war between the U.S. and China. It also highlights the challenges facing the EU, including its future relationship with the U.K., a standoff with Italy over budget allocations and separatist clashes in Spain.
While the MSCI Emerging Markets Index is heading for a 17 percent decline this year, India’s benchmark S&P BSE Sensex is up 5 percent after seesawing throughout the year amid oil-price volatility.
In a year dominated by trade protectionism and punitive tariffs by Donald Trump’s administration on China, it’s little wonder that investors have turned cautious over countries with a heavy dependence on exports.
Germany derives more than 38 percent of its gross domestic product from exports, based on 2017 data from World Bank. The corresponding ratio for India is only 11 percent, meaning much of the stock-market opportunity in the country comes from domestic consumer stories.
The reliance on local demand and entrepreneurship also puts India ahead in growth sweepstakes. The south Asian nation is projected to grow 7.5 percent this year and 7.3 percent in 2019, a far cry from German growth of 1.6 percent for each year.

LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The European Union's data watchdog will decide in coming weeks if financial regulators around the world can routinely swap information to keep markets clean without getting tangled up in the EU's new data protection regime.
The EU introduced its General Data Protection Regulation in May to strengthen personal data privacy rights, giving consumers greater control over their personal information.
But U.S. finance regulators have warned that the EU's data rules have started to adversely affect the exchange of cross-border information.
Securities and Exchange Commission chair Jay Clayton said at an event earlier this month that the SEC had had to strip out personal data from some items in order facilitate information exchanges.
Since May regulators have had to use a ""public interest"" exemption to exchange information on a case-by-case basis for tackling fraud like insider trading or attempts to rig market benchmarks.
Spanish markets regulator CNMV said that relying on the public interest exemption means that swapping data has to be done on a case-by-case basis, which was working smoothly as a temporary fix.
The EU's European Securities and Markets Authority has said this exemption could be used until a solution proposed by global regulators and known as an ""administrative arrangement"" is approved, but some regulators elsewhere in the world are worried about falling foul of data privacy rules due to legal uncertainty.
The European Data Protection Board will have to decide if EU regulators can use the administrative arrangement to swap sensitive market data with counterparts outside the bloc.
""This will be discussed and dealt with in the first quarter of 2019,"" a spokeswoman for the EDPB said.
A source at a European regulator said the data watchdog was expected to approve the new arrangement at the end of January or mid-February. Approving the administrative arrangement would give reassurance when swapping data cross-border.

ESMA had no comment.

1076,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",Nike shares rise as strong quarterly results allay China demand concerns,"By Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) -  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) shares rose 9 percent on Friday, after the company's solid quarterly results eased worries that escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing would weigh on China demand and hurt the sportswear maker's growth story.
The company's double-digit percentage growth in China was in addition to strong demand in North America, Nike's biggest and most competitive market, where sales got a boost from higher full-priced sales and a rebound in Jordan sneakers.
In a note titled ""A perfect quarter in an imperfect world,"" Jefferies analyst said that Nike's results this quarter were perfect amidst global trade disruption cited by FedEx. 
Earlier this week, FedEx Corp (N:FDX) stunned markets with a drastic cut in its full-year profit forecast, citing global trade worries.
On a post earnings call with analysts on Thursday, Nike's Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion said that the company had not seen any impact from the ongoing trade friction.
""Clear indications of better sales in the U.S. and elsewhere, including China, should help to comfort investors increasingly worried about the potential for macro slowdown,"" Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel said.
Nike has focused on new launches as well as on a direct-to-customer model of own stores and online sales to temper the hit from bankruptcies of sports retailers and competition from the likes of Adidas AG (DE:ADSGn) and  Under Armour  Inc (N:UAA) in the United States.
Its efforts have borne fruit. The company engineered a rebound in its North America market, clawing back market share from global rivals.
""Nike is boxing out its competition ... the results illuminate the progress that Nike has made, and the guidance, which appears conservative, highlights the opportunities ahead,"" Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser wrote in a note.
For 2019, Nike forecast revenue to rise in the high single-digit percentage range and potentially touching double-digit growth.
At least two brokerages upgraded Nike stock to their highest rating following its better-than-expected results.
Wall Street's sentiment on the stock is bullish, with 24 of the 37 analysts covering the stock rating it ""buy"". The median price target on the stock is $87, while Nike's shares were trading at $73.76 in morning trading.
Nike shares were the biggest boost to the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) and the S&P 500 Index (SPX) on Friday.
The results also lifted shares of its retail partners.  Foot Locker  (N:FL), which gets two-thirds of its merchandise from Nike, was up 5 percent, while Britain's biggest sportswear chain JD Sports (L:JD) rose 6 percent.
""In the end, China sales concerns have been diminished and Nike is executing solid strategies which should continue to drive increasingly profitable global market share gains,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Christopher Svezia said.

Danish newspaper Politiken said the fund was Canada's Health Care of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP). The tax agency declined to confirm the name or nationality of the fund. HOOPP could not immediately be reached. 
Denmark last month widened its investigation of a massive stock trading scam, as the state attempts to recover $2 billion of tax reclaims it was tricked into paying.
Danish authorities have already subpoenaed more than 420 companies and people they suspect of involvement, freezing hundreds of millions of euros of assets around the globe.
The tax agency said that it assessed that the fund had not made fraudulent transactions and was not part of the massive scam, but that it had received money it was not entitled to. 
""The Tax Agency does not consider it to be a fraud case because, contrary to the fraud cases, this is an actual pension fund with around 300,000 members,"" it said.
HOOPP has 339,000 members.
The tax agency said the fund had claimed a further 1.3 billion crowns in dividend tax refunds after 2014, but that those money where never paid out.
The tax agency said it had been in a dialogue with the pension fund but had not been able to reach an agreement and that it therefore subpoened the fund to get the money.
It said it disagreed with the fund over whether it was actually the owner of the share at the time it had seeked refunds.

1082,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",Mnuchin Forgot to Check His Figures on Stock Volatility,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is concerned about market volatility.
So concerned, in fact, that he said in a roundtable interview at Bloomberg’s Washington office on Tuesday that he plans to ask the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which he oversees, to look into what’s causing the turbulence. His working hypothesis is that high-speed traders and the Volcker Rule are to blame.
If Mnuchin was concerned on Tuesday, he must be spooked by now. The S&P 500 Index fell 1.5 percent on Wednesday and an additional 1.6 percent on Thursday. And the market expects more pain. The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, which measures expected volatility over the next 30 days, closed at 28.38 on Thursday, up 73 percent since Dec. 3 and 11 percent since Tuesday. 
But here’s the reality: There’s nothing amiss about the recent volatility, and if anything, volatility has been lower than usual in recent years, not higher.
High-speed trading is a popular bogeyman for a variety of market ills, but there’s no reason to believe that higher volatility is one. High-frequency trading represented a small portion of total stock trades in the U.S. before the mid-2000s. The 30-day trailing volatility for the S&P 500, as measured by annualized standard deviation, averaged 15.3 percent from 1928 to 2004. Since then, volatility has averaged — wait for it — 15.3 percent.
Similarly, the Volcker Rule, which generally prohibits banks from trading for their own accounts or owning hedge funds and private equity funds, hasn’t had any discernable impact on volatility, either. Before the rule went into effect in April 2014, the 30-day trailing volatility for the S&P 500 averaged 15.5 percent. Since then, it has averaged 11.7 percent. 
And it doesn’t matter what yardstick you use. The volatility numbers before and after high-speed trading and the Volcker Rule are nearly identical when looking at one-, three-, six- or 12-month trailing volatility.
Nor is there anything unprecedented about the market’s recent gyrations. The 30-day trailing volatility for the S&P 500 is 22.2 percent through Thursday. Since 1928, it’s been as high or higher 15 percent of the time.
It’s even less unusual when measured over longer periods. The three-month trailing volatility of 20.4 percent has been as high or higher 18 percent of the time. And the six- and 12-month volatilities have been as high or higher 37 percent and 35 percent of the time, respectively.
It’s also worth noting that there’s nothing worrisome about the fact that “a normal trading day now is a 500-point range,” as Mnuchin complained. Sure, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at 10,000, a 5 percent move might be distressing. But when the Dow is at 26,000, as it was just a month ago, a 500-point move is a mere 2 percent. That’s well within the market’s normal range. 
The fact is, the market swoons occasionally. It can’t help, however, that the White House is fighting with the U.S.’s trading partners, particularly when the big multinational companies that dominate the Dow and S&P 500 generate much of their revenue overseas and investors are counting on those revenues to justify lofty stock prices.
It may or may not be possible to quiet the market, as Mnuchin apparently wants to do, but calling the FSOC is surely the wrong place to start."

""They (the Uzbek government) met with investors in late November and the feedback was positive from most,"" said one of the sources. ""It is an improving credit and investors are not viewing it as a Russian proxy.""
A formal deal roadshow will take place early next year, the source said, with the deal set to be marketed to investors in Europe and the United States.
Uzbekistan's new BB- rating puts it in line with big emerging market debt issuers such Turkey, whose benchmark bonds now trade at a yield of around 7.5 percent.
It is also in between neighbors Kazakhstan with its 'investment grade' BBB-, and Tajikistan, with its B- rating, six notches below investment grade.
Tajikistan issued its first $500 million 10-year dollar bond in September last year, when emerging markets were on a charge, and paid 7.125 percent interest.
A volume of $500 million would make the new Uzbek bond eligible for JP Morgan’s widely-tracked EMBI global emerging debt benchmark, one of the sources said.

1084,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 09:55AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Global traders halt new Iran food deals as U.S. sanctions bite - sources,"By Jonathan Saul and Parisa Hafezi
LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - Cargill,  Bunge  and other global traders have halted food supply deals with Iran because new U.S. sanctions have paralyzed banking systems required to secure payments, industry and Iranian government sources say.
Food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies are exempt from sanctions Washington reimposed this year after U.S. President Donald Trump said in May he was walking away from a 2015 international deal over Iran's nuclear program.
But the U.S. measures targeting everything from oil sales to shipping and financial activities have deterred many foreign banks from all Iranian business, including humanitarian deals. Many smaller banks that had dealt with Iran under a previous round of sanctions have also stopped dealings this time.
""There is no real chance of being paid using the existing mechanisms and many international traders are unable to do new business for the moment,"" said one European source with knowledge of the situation, who declined to be identified.
Western and Iranian trade sources said U.S. groups Cargill (CARG.UL) and Bunge (N:BG), as well as Singapore's Olam (SI:OLAM), were among those which could not conclude new export deals for wheat, corn, raw sugar or other commodities because Western banks would not process payments with Iran.
Cargill, Bunge and Olam all declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
U.S. sanctions took full effect on Nov. 5 after a winding-down period, although Washington has issued temporary waivers for some of its allies which depend on imported Iranian oil.
CLOSING DOWN CHANNELS
Iran, which relies heavily on imported food staples, has years of experience working around U.S and other Western sanctions, which were progressively tightened between 2012 and 2015 until Iran reached a deal over its nuclear program. Many sanctions were lifted in 2016 after the pact.
Under the earlier round of sanctions, Iran had turned to a dwindling number of foreign banks that continued to act as a conduit for payments to keep food and other trade flowing.
But this time round, many of those foreign banking channels are closing down. Three Iranian officials told Reuters that banking issues were to blame for halting food and other trade.
An official with Iranian Industry, Mines and Trade Industry said only a ""handful of small European banks"" with no or little interaction with the United States were still doing business with Iran, and they were only involved in small-scale purchases.
""We are in talks with Europeans to expand this network of banks and financial institutions,"" the ministry official said. 
""But right now, many companies including Cargill and Bunge have informed us about (banking) difficulties that will force them to stop their dealings with Iran,"" he said.
Swiss lender Banque de Commerce et de Placements (BCP), one of those banks that had been involved in humanitarian-related dealings in the past, said in May it was suspending all new business with Iran.
Washington blacklisted Germany-based Europaeisch-Iranische Handelsbank AG (EIH) in November, shutting out an institution that financial sources said had been involved in limited business with Iran between 2012 and 2016.
EIH did not respond to requests for comment.
Several Western banks that had started business with Iran since 2016 have reversed course. Austria's Oberbank (VI:OBER), one of the first European banks to reach a deal on new business with Iran, said in June it was stopping.
Other banks have followed suit, including Denmark's  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) and Germany's DZ Bank. 
Belgium's KBC (BR:KBC) said in June it would limit Iran-related transactions to humanitarian trade.
The bank did not say if it was still processing such payments when asked by Reuters in December, but said it ""reviews its policy on a regular basis in full respect of all relevant regulations"".
Dutch bank ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) said it had facilitated transactions related to food, healthcare, medical equipment and agriculture to a limited extent and with specific clients. But it also told Reuters ""the recent restrictive measures on Iranian banks do pose challenges.""
CAUTION
For many foreign banks, it is easier to end any Iranian activity than try to navigate the U.S. sanctions rulebook and run the risk of slipping up and facing penalties, bankers said.
""There is super caution now,"" said a European financial source involved in Iranian transactions in the past, saying rules on food and other humanitarian dealings were complex.
""If goods are shipped for instance to an Iranian distributor, who then sells them on and not directly to an end buyer, banks will increasingly look at such a transaction as commercial rather than humanitarian,"" the source said.
A U.S. Treasury spokesperson said Washington offered broad authorizations and exceptions under sanctions that enabled sales of agricultural commodities, food, medicine and medical devices to Iran by U.S. and non-U.S. citizens.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in November the Belgium-based SWIFT financial messaging service could be used for humanitarian deals, but added: ""Banks must be very careful that these are not disguised transactions or they could be subject to certain sanctions.""
The European Union, a signatory to the nuclear pact and which urged Washington not to walk away, said its efforts to set up a mechanism to facilitate trade and circumvent U.S. sanctions could be in place by the end of the year.
EU diplomats have said the mechanism could focus on humanitarian items rather than the oil trade.
Switzerland is also working on a humanitarian payment channel, but no timeframe has been given.
However, banks remain cautious.
""Even deals that were already concluded earlier this year are affected and vessels carrying goods can't discharge as payments can't be processed or take a long time to clear,"" said another European source with trading activities in Iran.
Data on Dec. 21 from global shipping intelligence platform MarineTraffic showed 16 ships had been waiting to unload cargoes of commodities and goods, including foodstuffs, for at least two weeks at Iran's ports of Bandar Abbas and Bandar Imam Khomeini. Four of the 16 vessels had been waiting since October.
Washington says its sanctions are part of an effort to force Iran to curb its nuclear and missile programs, as well as end Tehran's support for proxy forces in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East.
Iran insists its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes and its missiles are defensive. It also blames what it calls U.S. meddling for turmoil in the Middle East.

MOSCOW/DUBAI (Reuters) - Japan's Mitsui & Co Ltd (T:8031), Russian sovereign wealth fund RDIF and Saudi Aramco are in talks to buy stakes in Novatek's (MM:NVTK) Arctic LNG 2 project, with the size of the investments still to be decided, sources familiar with the talks told Reuters. 
Novatek plans to start producing LNG at Arctic LNG 2 in 2022-2023. The plant, which is expected to cost around $25.5 billion, will have an annual production capacity of 19.8 million tonnes and will be Novatek's second LNG plant after Yamal LNG. 
Novatek owns a 90 percent stake in the project, with France's  Total  (PA:TOTF) holding the other 10 percent. Novatek intends to keep a 60 percent stake in Arctic LNG 2, offering 30 percent to other investors. 
However, under certain conditions Novatek may cut its stake further, although not to below 50 percent in order to keep control over the project.
Two sources familiar with the talks said that Mitsui, Saudi Aramco and the Russian Direct Investment Fund are in talks with Novatek over taking stakes in the project, which should bring the Russian gas company closer to its goal of producing as much LNG as Qatar, one of the world's top LNG suppliers. 
""Mitsui, Saudi Aramco and RDIF are interested to buy a stake in Arctic LNG 2 but there is also an interest from South Asia,"" one of the sources said. 
Japan is the world's top LNG consumer, with Russia among its key LNG suppliers. There are currently two LNG plants operating in Russia: Novatek's Yamal LNG and Gazprom's Sakhalin 2 and Moscow has ambitions for more. 
A third source confirmed Mitsui's interest in the project. Three other sources familiar with the talks confirmed the interest from Saudi Aramco and RDIF.
""Saudi Aramco is currently holding technical due-diligence. When the commercial talks approach, RDIF will join(in),"" one of the three sources familiar with the talks said. 
While RDIF will invest in the project, its contribution is likely to be less than Aramco's, the second of the three sources familiar with the talks told Reuters. 
Saudi Aramco and Novatek could not immediately respond to a Reuters request for a comment on Friday. RDIF declined to comment. 
""We have a general interest in the project and we are exchanging our opinions with parties involved,"" a Mitsui spokesman said when asked whether the company planned to invest in the project.
This week, Novatek awarded a 2.2 billion euro ($2.51 billion) contract to Italian energy contractor  Saipem  (MI:SPMI) and Turkish oil and gas services firm Renaissance for the construction of gravity-based structure platforms that will stand on the seabed to support the LNG processing units.

The Federal Reserve's plan, announced Wednesday, to keep raising interest rates was an added headache for investors already fearful that trade wars and other geopolitical concerns would grind economic and corporate growth to a halt.
The U.S. central bank's view that the economy is strong will be tested amid a slew of economic data, including third-quarter GDP and November consumer spending, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation.

The total investment could add up to around 60 billion yuan, or $9 billion, most of which would be shouldered by the Zhuhai government through subsidies and tax breaks, the Nikkei said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Zhuhai is a city in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong near to Macau.
The plans to build the cutting-edge plant comes amid the trade dispute between the U.S. and China, which includes concerns about China expanding the production of microchips.
Foxconn is expected to form a joint venture for the project with Japanese electronics group Sharp, which it acquired in 2016, and the Zhuhai government, Nikkei said, citing an industry source. 
Sharp is the only Foxconn subsidiary with experience of chip manufacturing, Nikkei said. However, the Japanese company stopped developing semiconductor technology when it ran into financial problems in 2010.
A source close to the matter told Reuters that Sharp is not involved in the talks. 
Foxconn, formally known as  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd, is planning to start the construction as early as 2020, the report said.
Representatives of Foxconn were not immediately available for comment.
Foxconn, the world's largest contract manufacturer, has been interested in the chip business, but many in the industry doubt the company has the resources to enter the field due to the high capital expenditures needed.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) (CNPC.UL) may stop its banking unit from conducting most of its Iranian-related financial services because of concerns over U.S. sanctions, two persons with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. 
Bank of Kunlun, which has been the main official channel for money flows between China and Iran since before the last round of sanctions which started in 2012, is majority owned by CNPC's listed financial arm CNPC Capital (SZ:000617).
U.S. President Donald Trump in May ordered sanctions to be reimposed after withdrawing from a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran that ended the previous round of restrictions. The U.S. left the accord because of concerns over the country's ballistic missile program and its support for Syria's embattled leader Bashar al-Assad and rebel fighters in Yemen.
Iran was the world's fourth-largest producer of liquid hydrocarbons, including crude oil, in 2017, according to data from  BP  (LON:BP) Plc. China is the country's biggest oil buyer.
With U.S. authorities applying increasing pressure on global institutions to cut off trade with Iran, CNPC now views the bank's Iran business as a liability that is hindering the company's other regular financial services that cover insurance and leasing, the sources said. 
Reuters reported in October that Kunlun, which started in a remote oil town in northwest China, stopped handling payments from Iran because of the sanctions.
However, Kunlun still holds an Iranian central bank account into which Chinese national oil companies make about $18 billion worth of payments for annual oil imports.
The sources said CNPC is lobbying Beijing to let one or more smaller Chinese commercial banks take over the business, or put it directly under a government agency.
""CNPC is exploring the possibility of having some mid- or small-sized bank or banks that barely handle any dollar-denominated transactions take over (Iran transactions),"" said one of the sources, who has direct knowledge of CNPC's internal discussions over Kunlun's Iran business.
The bank may continue to handle only CNPC's own investment in Iranian oil fields.
The sources did not identify potential candidates or indicate if CNPC has initiated any discussions with them, adding that it would not be easy to find local banks willing to take over the business. 
A CNPC spokesman declined comment. 
The secretary of CNPC Capital's Board of Directors did not respond to an email seeking comment. The Bank of Kunlun did not respond to repeated requests for comment. 
A second source, who is involved in discussions about China's Iranian financial settlements, said the bank has become a talking point in trade negotiations between China and the United States. 
CNPC Capital in late 2016 injected 5.848 billion yuan ($849 million) into Kunlun Bank and holds a 77.09 percent stake, CNPC Capital said in its 2017 annual report. 
CNPC Capital said in the same report that its financial status could be adversely affected due to Kunlun's Iranian ties. 
""Subsidiary units such as Kunlun Bank... may fall under local laws and sanctions from other countries because of their operations in politically unstable regions... that will have unfavorable impact on the company's financial performance,"" it said.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks extended a steep sell-off on Friday as the threat of a U.S. government shutdown and further hikes in U.S. borrowing costs compounded investor anxieties over the trajectory of global economic growth.
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were off half a percent, indicating a lower open on Wall Street. Nasdaq futures were down 0.6 percent.
European shares traded in negative territory, following in the footsteps of U.S. and Asian markets. The pan-European STOXX 600 fell over half a percent, continuing its slide towards lows not seen since the end of 2016. 
It had last pared some losses to trade 0.2 percent lower. (EU)
Most European bourses and industry indexes were in the red after the S&P 500 fell overnight, heading for its worst quarter since the dark days of the financial crisis in late 2008, with a loss of 15 percent so far. The Nasdaq has shed 19.5 percent from its August peak, just shy of confirming a bear market.
Oil prices, which slid just over 4 percent on Thursday, tumbled to their lowest since the third quarter of 2017 on Friday. The dollar, which had suffered its biggest one-day drop on the yen since November 2017 on Thursday, lost a further 0.1 percent against the yen.
""China is cooling and the euro zone is slowing down, and some of the economic indicators from the U.S. have been a bit soft recently, but yet the Fed hiked rates and suggested that two more interest rate hikes were lined up for 2019,"" said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London.
He said speculation the U.S. economy could be headed for a recession has picked up, dampening global sentiment. ""Fear about a U.S. government shutdown is playing into the mix too.""
Eyes will be on U.S. inflation numbers due at 1330 GMT on Friday, which include the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of core inflation. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.2 percent.
The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.2 percent on the day. It was set for its worst week since March.
Japan's Nikkei lost 1.1 percent to close at its lowest since mid-September last year, after giving up 5.6 percent this week. Australian stocks slipped 0.7 percent, hovering just above a two-year trough hit earlier in the session.
Chinese blue chips lost 1.4 percent, in part after the United States accused Beijing of orchestrating the hacking of government agencies and companies around the world.
Sentiment had turned sour on Thursday when the U.S. Federal Reserve largely retained plans to increase interest rates despite mounting risks to growth.
Markets were further spooked when U.S. President Donald Trump refused to sign legislation to fund the U.S. government unless he received money for a border wall, thus risking a partial federal shutdown on Saturday.
""Political brinkmanship in Washington is further heightening market uncertainty,"" said Westpac economist Elliot Clarke.
""Friday will be a tense day in Washington, and for financial markets, as a last-minute compromise is sought.""
Adding to the air of crisis was news U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had resigned after Trump announced a withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Syria and sources said a military pullback from Afghanistan was on the cards.
The brittle mood showed on Wall Street where the Dow ended Thursday with a loss of 1.99 percent. The S&P 500 dived 1.58 percent and the Nasdaq 1.63 percent. (N) 
STAMPEDE FOR THE EXITS
The mood change has triggered a rush out of crowded trades, including massive long positions in U.S. equities and the dollar and short positions in Treasuries.
Lipper data on Thursday showed investors pulled nearly $34.6 billion out of stock funds in the latest week and were heading for the biggest month of net withdrawals on record.
There was also a sense of capitulation in currency markets as the dollar dived 1.1 percent on the yen on Thursday to hit a three-month trough at 110.80. It was last changing hands at 111.16 having shattered several layers of chart support.
The euro dipped 0.2 percent to $1.1420, having jumped to its highest in over six weeks at $1.1485. Against a basket of currencies the dollar regained lost ground, up 0.3 percent at 96.563 after suffering its largest single-session fall in two months.
Yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury were back up to 2.792 percent after hitting their lowest since early April at 2.748 percent on Thursday's bid to safety. As recently as October, they had been at a seven-year top of 3.261 percent.
The gap between two- and 10-year yields was back up to just 12.8 basis points, after flattening to 9 basis points overnight.
The rally in longer-dated bonds has been fueled by the huge slide in oil prices, which will pile downward pressure on inflation at a time when the global economy is already slowing.
Both Brent and U.S. crude futures reached their lowest in more than a year overnight, but edged higher on Friday on talk that production cuts by OPEC might be larger than first thought.
U.S. crude fell 1 percent to $45.44 a barrel, while Brent fell 2.3 percent to $53.10. [O/R]

Japanese media reported this month that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) (T:7011) was set to scrap the Sinop nuclear project in Turkey as cost estimates had nearly doubled to around 5 trillion yen ($44 billion).
Last week, Hitachi (T:6501) was reported to be considering whether to scrap its 3 trillion yen Horizon nuclear project in Britain as cost estimates had risen, while Toshiba (T:6502) liquidated its UK project this year. 
A source involved in the Turkish project told Reuters MHI had effectively abandoned it. 
He said the deal, signed in 2013 between Turkish leader Tayyip Erdogan and Japan's Shinzo Abe, had been too ambitious. The project, earmarked for a country with no nuclear tradition, would have been the first to use the untested Atmea reactor developed by MHI and France's Areva (PA:EDF), the source noted. 
    MHI Chief Executive Shunichi Miyanaga said this month it was up to the Turkish and Japanese governments to decide on the project, adding that Turkey was examining a feasibility study MHI had submitted.
Hitachi's Horizon project to build reactors at two UK sites - the first at Wylfa Newydd, Wales - is now also uncertain. Hitachi has said it will make a final decision next year.
Horizon said it had been in talks with the UK government since June, when business minister Greg Clark said Britain may invest directly in the project. 
""We've been in negotiations with the government regarding financing of Wylfa Newydd,"" a spokesperson said. 
The government declined to elaborate. 
Hitachi is seeking new investors for Horizon so the company can cut its stake to below 50 percent, but the project cannot be profitable under current conditions, a Hitachi executive said.
Hitachi hopes Britain will make up its mind by April. 
""The political situation makes it impossible for the government to take action now ... but there are limits to how long Hitachi can wait,"" the executive said, referring to Britain's protracted negotiations on leaving the European Union. 
Nuclear cooperation will be on the agenda of Prime Minister Abe's visit to Britain next month.
Hitachi hopes a group of Japanese investors and Britain each will take a third of the equity portion of the project. A company source said the project would be financed one third by equity, two thirds by debt.
Japanese media have reported Hitachi would need to book a 270 billion yen ($2.4 billion) loss if it abandoned Horizon. An industry source said Hitachi had already spent $2 billion on it. 
A second Hitachi executive said the company cannot walk away from Horizon as it has other business interests in Britain. 
""The company may freeze the project unless conditions are met, but can never walk away,"" the source said.
Toshiba last month scrapped its British NuGen project after its U.S. reactor unit Westinghouse went bankrupt and it failed to sell NuGen to South Korea's KEPCO (KS:015760).
RUSSIA, CHINA FACE-OFF 
With Japan's export prospects severely curtailed, the global nuclear market is virtually in the hands of Russia's Rosatom and two Chinese reactor builders. 
Two other privately owned Western nuclear firms - Westinghouse and France's Framatome (PA:EDF) - were restructured following losses and have no new foreign orders at the moment. 
""Without Horizon, Japan is left without a nuclear project abroad ... this is becoming a Russia/China-dominated industry,"" said a consultant who advises one of Japan's nuclear groups.
China has a foot in the door in Britain, where state-owned CGN co-finances EDF's (PA:EDF) Hinkley Point project and has a deal to build its own reactor, which would be the first Chinese reactor constructed outside Asia. 
Russia and China are already facing off in Latin America, where a Chinese deal to build a reactor in Argentina seems to be unravelling and Russia is muscling in. https:// An industry source familiar with the situation said China-Argentina talks had stalled. ""Something fell apart. It is not an accident that the Russians are there now,"" he said.  A Beijing-based nuclear industry consultant said it was significant that Chinese President Xi Jinping did not mention nuclear in a recent speech about China-Argentina cooperation. ""The Chinese project, if it is not canceled, it is at least postponed,"" the consultant said.

1098,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 06:56AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Continue Decline as Government Shutdown Looms,"Investing.com - U.S. futures pointed to a lower open on Friday as investors’ sour mood continued ahead of a looming government shutdown. Trade was expected to be thin as many investors packed up for the Christmas holiday, but key economic data was apt to keep some traders at their desk before heading off for the long weekend.
The blue-chip Dow futures fell 56 points, or 0.24%, to 22,940.50 points by 6:52 AM ET (11:52 GMT), while S&P 500 futures lost 8 points, or 0.33%, to 2,478.00 points. Meanwhile the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 25 points, or 0.40%, to 6,300.25.
“China is cooling and the euro zone is slowing down, and some of the economic indicators from the U.S. have been a bit soft recently, but yet the Fed hiked rates and suggested that two more interest rate hikes were lined up for 2019,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London.
He said speculation the U.S. economy could be headed for a recession has picked up, dampening global sentiment. “Fear about a U.S. government shutdown is playing into the mix too.”
Although the U.S. House of Representatives passed a temporary funding measure on Thursday that included funding for the proposed southern border wall, odds were low that the Senate would give its approval, causing fears that an agreement would not be reached to avoid a government shutdown ahead of Friday’s midnight deadline.
The House passed a bill to keep the government running until Feb. 8, but the Senate, which convenes at 12:00 PM ET (17:00 GMT), would likely shoot down the proposal precisely because of the more than $5 billion in funding for the wall.
U.S. President Donald Trump refused to sign off on any temporary funding that lacks payment for border security.
Despite the upcoming holiday season, Friday’s session will be replete with a deluge of economic data.
First up, the Commerce Department will report on durable goods orders for November at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
On average, economists expect that orders for long-lasting goods rose 1.6% last month and that core durable goods orders, which exclude autos, rose 0.3%.
The final measure of third-quarter GDP will also be released at that time, with forecasts for it to stay at its previous estimate of growth at an annual rate of 3.5%.
At 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT), the November figures on personal spending and income will be published, with both expected to have risen 0.3%. The core PCE price index, the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, is forecast to tick up to an annual rate of 1.9%, just below the Fed’s target.
Also coming in at that time will be the final measure of the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index for December. Economists expect it rose slightly from its preliminary measure to 97.6.
Ahead of the data, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, was up 0.33% to 96.05 by 6:54 AM ET (11:54 GMT).
In company news and amid the downbeat mood in U.S. equities,  Nike  provided a ray of hope when it reported strong earnings after Thursday’s close. Shares in Nike (NYSE:NKE) soared more than 8% in premarket trade on Friday.
Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) stock also wowed investors with better-than-expected quarterly results that saw shares jump 5% in extended trade.
In the negative, shares of CalAmp (NASDAQ:CAMP) plummeted nearly 9% with quarterly results that missed consensus and a weaker-than-expected guidance.
In commodities, gold futures fell 0.37% to $1,263.15 a troy ounce, while crude oil lost 0.96% to $45.44 a barrel.

1099,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>","Trump’s Tax Cuts Have Boosted Bottom Lines, But Not Much Else","(Bloomberg) -- Critics of President Donald Trump’s tax law centerpiece -- slashing the corporate rate -- argued the savings wouldn’t spur big companies to expand dramatically. One year later, some key metrics show they were right.
For companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the profits they’ve made from sales this year through September -- after accounting for production costs but before paying taxes -- have been flat. But, their net profit margins -- which include the tax savings -- have continued to climb. If they were spending more to hire workers and build U.S. factories, those net margins would be lower.
Before the pitchforks come out, put yourself in the shoes of a chief executive officer of a major company. The economy is in the ninth year of an expansion that’s already one of the longest in U.S. history, and in 2018 you get a big pile of money dropped in your lap. Does expanding make sense when you’re already worried about this being the top of the economic cycle?
For the average CEO, it didn’t. America’s biggest companies instead chose to protect their profits by using their tax savings to offset risings costs, including for labor, transportation and imports caught up in Trump’s trade disputes. While they may be politically unpopular after the president and GOP leaders promised their tax law would unleash expansion in the U.S., analysts see those moves as prudent.
“They have been criticized for not investing in America, but you don’t want them to make unproductive investments at the top of the cycle,” said Tim Drayson, head of economics for Legal & General Investment Management, a money manager. The tax overhaul was a “one-off boost to earnings, whereas politicians were selling it as transformational.”
A slogan like “tax cuts to save the bottom line” wouldn’t win over many voters. But that’s exactly what corporations did with the billions of dollars they received after the Republican tax law cut the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. And that helped to push the average net margin for S&P 500 firms to its highest level since at least 1990, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The benefits of the tax cuts “have gone straight to the bottom line, as we had anticipated,” Maneesh Deshpande, Barclays Plc’s head of U.S. equity and global derivatives strategy, said in a research note last month. This came at the expense of spending more on items like capital expenditures and wages, Deshpande said.
The Trump administration continues to defend its tax law and the associated economic benefits. During a call with reporters on Wednesday celebrating the one-year anniversary of the overhaul, Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett said capital spending was on track to contribute 1 percent to economic growth this year and survey data shows companies’ spending plans over the next six months to a year are “very strong.”
S&P Decline
Companies have also been spending on buybacks -- another way to puff up earnings. S&P 500 companies boosted buybacks during the first three quarters of the year by 49 percent to $577.9 billion compared to a year ago. Still, as a percentage of market value, the purchases are in line with previous years.
The overall effect of companies protecting profits and doing buybacks helped to drive the S&P 500 to a record high in early September, only for it to sell off amid trade tensions and recession worries. Now the index is headed for its biggest annual decline since the 2008 financial crisis.
Expecting companies to unleash spending just because they got a tax cut isn’t how firms operate, despite what they might tout in press releases. They generally invest based on market conditions, not goodwill or national pride. They expand when they see growth coming and pull back when demand wanes. Within the S&P 500, cash flows are surging, but a lower percentage of that money is being spent on capital expenditures.
Take General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).’s response to market realities. The automaker’s plan to close U.S. factories and cut 14,000 jobs was driven by declining sales of some models and the decision to protect margins by maintaining operations in Mexico’s cheaper labor market. The automaker’s income tax expense was $366 million in the third quarter on $2.6 billion of profit, which equals a tax rate of 11.9 percent. GM has invested $22 billion in the U.S. since 2010, said spokesman Tom Henderson, who declined to provide additional comment.
Companies are also trying to use the tax cuts to gloss over disappointing results. After a weak third quarter, AT&T Inc (NYSE:T). CEO Randall Stephenson tried to re-focus investors away from an unexpected loss of subscribers to big gains in cash flow, which he said would mean more money for shareholder dividends and paying down debt.
“If you look at the cash flows for the quarter, I feel really good about the results,” Stephenson said on Oct. 24.
What Stephenson might not feel so good about: If AT&T’s tax rate had remained the same, it would have paid $2.3 billion more in taxes through September of this year. That would have reduced its 20 percent gain in free cash flow to just a 1 percent increase.
Meanwhile, this year AT&T has boosted buybacks by 25 percent, and has also said it will spend about $22 billion on capital expenditures, which as a percentage of sales would be lower than each of the past five years. Part of the decline may be the result of acquiring a business that had fewer investment needs. An AT&T spokeswoman declined to comment.
‘Better to Wait’
At home-improvement retailer Lowe’s Co.s (NYSE:LOW)., operating margin narrowed by 20 percent this year -- but by saving $671 million in taxes, the retailer was able to boost its net margin by 5 percent. At the same time, it canceled capital projects, shuttered weak-performing stores and laid off workers -- all part of new CEO Marvin Ellison’s plan to increase profits after an activist investor pushed out his predecessor for lackluster results.
Still, the retailer said it plans to boost capital spending by about 30 percent next year. A Lowe’s spokeswoman declined to comment.
Beyond companies in the S&P 500 Index, other surveys show capital expenditures have been disappointing. Nonresidential business investment rose 2.5 percent in the third quarter, the smallest increase since the final three months of 2016. While such spending picked up in early 2018 after plodding along for years, a string of weak reports raises questions about the outlook.
For economist Drayson, this all goes back to the timing of the tax cuts.
“From a pure economy basis, it would have been better to wait until the next downturn before doing this,” Drayson said."

1101,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 05:25AM ET</span>",Explainer: Arrested again: What are the new allegations against Nissan's Ghosn?,"By Malcolm Foster
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese prosecutors arrested Nissan's (T:7201) ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn for a third time on Friday, accusing him of aggravated breach of trust in transferring personal investment losses to the automaker.
The move came just as it had appeared that he might be released on bail. Prosecutors are likely to ask a Tokyo court that Ghosn be detained for 10 days and after that ask for a 10-day extension.
WHAT IS AGGRAVATED BREACH OF TRUST?
Aggravated breach of trust is when a company director or officer violates his or her legal duty for the purpose of self-interest or that of a third party in a way that causes financial harm to the company.
In this case, prosecutors say Ghosn is suspected of shifting personal investment losses of about 1.85 billion yen ($16.6 million) to Nissan Motor Co Ltd around October 2008.
Ghosn's Japan-based lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, has not responded to a Reuters request for comment. 
If Ghosn is formally charged on this count, prosecutors would need to prove that he had intended to cause a loss to Nissan and/or intended to benefit personally from the action, said Shin Ushijima, an attorney and former prosecutor.
HOW CAN GHOSN BE RE-ARRESTED?
Japanese prosecutors often arrest individuals repeatedly on different allegations linked to the same case. The practice allows them to hold suspects while they pursue their investigation and also means they can continue interrogations without the presence of a lawyer.
Ghosn was initially arrested on Nov. 19, and formally charged on Dec. 10 with under-reporting his income for five years through March 2015.
He was then re-arrested on Dec. 10 on allegations of under-reporting his income for the subsequent three years, but has not yet been indicted for this. 
The maximum penalty for both understating compensation and aggravated breach of trust is up to 10 years in prison and/or a fine of 10 million yen ($89,800).
HOW MUCH LONGER WILL GHOSN BE DETAINED?
Prosecutors have 48 hours to ask the Tokyo District Court that Ghosn be detained for 10 days, which would expire between Dec. 30 and Jan. 1, depending on when permission was granted.
Prosecutors typically ask for another 10 day extension.
The court usually approves such requests. But on Thursday it decided not to extend the detentions of Ghosn and former Nissan director Greg Kelly for 10 additional days on the previous allegations.
WHAT IS THE BAIL PROCESS IN JAPAN? 
Once a detention period is up, lawyers can ask the judge to release Ghosn on bail.
Gaining bail is still rare in Japan but is occurring more often. Suspects are regularly denied bail and held for months through an entire trial process.
If Ghosn was to be freed on bail, it would likely be a large sum, experts say. For example, activist fund manager Yoshiaki Murakami, arrested in 2006 for insider trading, paid an initial 500 million yen in bail.
In general, suspects released on bail are banned from overseas travel, but public broadcaster NHK said travel permission could be obtained on a case-by-case basis. 
WHAT ABOUT GREG KELLY?
The new accusations against Ghosn do not include Kelly, which means he could be released in the coming days.
Kelly's lawyer, Yoichi Kitamura, told Reuters that Kelly was unlikely to be released before Tuesday because there had not been enough time to complete procedures ahead of a long weekend in Japan.

1103,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 05:11AM ET</span>",Toshiba has no immediate plans to sell memory chip stake: CEO,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp (T:6502) has no immediate plans to sell its 40.2 percent stake in Toshiba Memory Corp, its chief executive told Reuters, as the world's No. 2 producer of NAND flash memory chips prepares to go public within the next three years.
Toshiba's stake is seen by some analysts as a concern at a time when overcapacity in NAND memory chips, used in smartphones and data storage servers, has pressured prices and forced companies to give a dull near-term outlook.
But Toshiba - which sold the chip business in June for roughly $18 billion and then reinvested $3.1 billion to gain voting rights - sees the stake as a boon. 
The stake allows Toshiba to account for its former unit in its earnings, without having to further invest in it, CEO Nobuaki Kurumatani said in an interview.
""We're now in a position to benefit 40 percent of their profits while exempt from investment burdens,"" he said. 
""I think we have an appropriate balance.""
Toshiba sold the business to a Bain Capital-led consortium that included South Korean rival SK Hynix (KS:000660), Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Dell Technologies (N:DVMT) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), to plug a multi-billion-dollar hole in its balance sheet after an accounting scandal and the collapse of its U.S. nuclear unit.
The company will reassess its plans for its stake in the chip business when Toshiba Memory's initial public offering (IPO) comes closer, Kurumatani said.
""We still have time to examine the situation with Chinese chipmakers and market conditions,"" he said.
The chief of Toshiba Memory had in September reaffirmed the company's plan to go public in two to three years, saying it had started preliminary work to prepare for an IPO, brushing aside concerns about weak fundamentals.
After a two-year boom in the market, oversupply is weighing on NAND flash chip prices amid weak consumer and business demand for phones and computers. NAND flash memory contract prices fell about 10 percent over July-September, according to market research firm TrendForce.
U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology Inc (O:MU) recently forecast quarterly sales and profit well below market estimates. Hynix too has offered a gloomy outlook.
Market leader  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) in October slashed 2018 capex by more than a quarter and warned of lower profit until early next year. 
Samsung is also considering converting some of its NAND production lines to make DRAM chips next year. DRAM memory chips are used in servers, gaming PCs and cryptocurrency mining devices to process large amounts of data. 

Shares of Samsung, Micron and Hynix have lost about 20-25 percent this year. Toshiba's stock has slipped just 4 percent, underpinned by relief over the chip unit sale and aggressive share buybacks.

1104,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2018 04:19AM ET</span>","Ghosn re-arrested on fresh allegations, likely to spend Christmas in detention","By Kiyoshi Takenaka and Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese prosecutors arrested Nissan Motor Co Ltd's (T:7201) ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn again on Friday on new allegations of making Nissan shoulder $16.6 million in personal investment losses, dashing chances he would be released on bail before Christmas.
Prosecutors also raided Ghosn's residence in Tokyo on Friday in search of evidence, broadcaster TV Asahi reported.
The latest twist in a saga that has jolted the global auto industry and Nissan's alliance with France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) came a day after a Tokyo court unexpectedly rejected prosecutors' request to extend Ghosn's detention.
That rejection had raised the possibility that the prominent businessman could go free on bail as early as Friday.
The re-arrest, however, means he could be detained for at least another 10 days in a Tokyo jail, where he has been confined since he was arrested last month on initial allegations of financial misconduct. 
The Tokyo prosecutor said the fresh arrest was based on suspicions that around October 2008, Ghosn shifted personal trades to the automaker to make it responsible for 1.85 billion yen ($16.6 million) in appraisal losses, and inflicted damage on Nissan by having it deposit a total of $14.7 million on four occasions between June 2009 and March 2012 into a related bank account. 
His lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, was not available for comment. Otsuru has previously declined to return calls about the Ghosn case.
Kyodo news agency said that when the allegation that Ghosn had shifted the paper losses first surfaced in media reports late last month, Otsuru said his client had denied it.
Ghosn had considered the move but did not do so after being told by financial authorities that it would be illegal, Kyodo quoted Otsuru as saying then.
""RESTORE MY HONOR""
Also on Friday, the Tokyo court said in a statement that the lawyer for Ghosn's former deputy Greg Kelly, who was arrested along with Ghosn, has requested his client's release. Kelly's detention extension was rejected along with Ghosn's.
The lawyer, Yohei Kitamura, later told Reuters that Kelly was unlikely to be released before Tuesday because there was not enough time to complete procedures, including the payment of any bail that might be set.
The dramatic turn of events came hours after Ghosn, through his lawyer and quoted by Japanese public broadcaster NHK, vowed to restore his good name in court and to hold a news conference after his release.
""Things as they stand are absolutely unacceptable,"" he was quoted as saying. ""I want to have my position heard and restore my honor in court.""
Television camera crews had gathered outside the Tokyo jail on Friday morning in hopes of catching sight of Ghosn being released.
Ghosn was initially arrested on Nov. 19 for allegedly understating his income by about half over a five-year period from 2010. He was later re-arrested for a similar alleged crime covering the past three years.
The maximum penalty for both understating compensation and the latest accusation - aggravated breach of trust - is up to 10 years in prison and/or a fine of 10 million yen.
Nissan said after his initial arrest that it unearthed multiple instances of possible wrongdoing in an internal investigation triggered by a whistleblower. 
The internal probe is ongoing, and has included allegations of diverting company funds to pay for personal expenses. Sources have told Reuters that investigators have been looking into the use of an internal ""CEO Reserve"" fund and the role of overseas subsidiaries in alleged financial misconduct.
DOWNFALL
The Ghosn case has put Japan's criminal justice system under international scrutiny and sparked criticism for some of its practices, including keeping suspects in detention for long periods and prohibiting defense lawyers from being present during interrogations, which can last eight hours a day.
The case also marked a dramatic fall for the leader of the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) alliance who was once hailed for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy. Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa has since called for changes to weaken the clout of controlling shareholder Renault.
Documents seen by Reuters showed that some discussions about compensating Ghosn out of the public eye were not confined to Nissan, but also included Renault executives.
While Nissan ousted Ghosn from his role as chairman shortly after the initial arrest, Renault has so far not replaced him.

A Nissan spokesman declined to comment on the re-arrest, saying only that the internal investigation was ongoing and expanding into new areas. Renault declined to comment.
