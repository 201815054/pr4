0,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 06:20PM ET</span>",U.S. judge denies bail to two men accused of aiding Ghosn escape,"By David Shepardson and Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - A U.S. district judge on Friday denied bail to two Massachusetts men accused of helping orchestrate former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Chairman Carlos Ghosn's escape from Japan.
Judge Indira Talwani rejected bail for U.S. Army Special Forces veteran Michael Taylor and his son, Peter Taylor after Japan had sought their extradition. A magistrate had also previously denied their release. 
Ghosn fled to Lebanon, his childhood home, after being charged in Japan with engaging in financial fraud by understating his compensation in Nissan's financial statements. He denies wrongdoing. 
Lawyers for the two men did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""While the Taylors may well seek to remain in the United States to fight extradition through available legal channels, they have also shown a blatant disregard for such safeguards in the context of the Japanese legal system and have not established sufficiently that if they find their extradition fight difficult, they will not flaunt the rules of release on bail and flee the country,"" Talwani wrote.
The Taylors are charged with implementing a sophisticated plan assisting Ghosn, who paid them, to jump bail, which Talwani noted included hiring a private jet in the United Arab Emirates and ""Peter Taylor making seven trips to Japan to meet with Ghosn multiple times and to set up and participate in Ghosn’s escape plan.""
It also included, she added, Michael Taylor in Japan ""checking with airport staff about security procedures and giving an airport worker a bundle of Japanese yen, secreting Ghosn out of a hotel room in a large box and bringing him aboard the private jet, and flying Ghosn to Turkey.""

A prior ruling said the Taylors appeared to have ""substantial resources"" they could exploit to potentially flee, including about $860,000 that Ghosn appears to have wired to a company co-managed by Peter Taylor before the escape.

Investing.com – Wall Street notched a weekly gain after hobbling to close just higher on Friday as investors weighed data showing the economic recovery remained intact against signs that lawmakers remain far apart on talks concerning the next wave of fiscal stimulus.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.17%, or 46 points. The S&P 500 gained 0.06%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.87%.
The US economy added a better-than-forecast 1.76 million jobs in July, reinforcing investor expectations that the labor market remains steady despite recent data including a weaker jobless claims report earlier this week suggesting otherwise.
While the bullish jobs report added credence to the economic recovery, stalled talks among lawmakers on the next virus relief package threatens to stifle growth and weighed on investor optimism.     
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reportedly said an offer to reduce the $3.4 trillion package by $1 trillion was rejected by the White House, marking a blow to hopes of lawmakers meeting a self-imposed Friday deadline to resolve key sticking points. 
The slow pace of negotiations on Capitol Hill, rising U.S.- China trade tensions - in the wake of President Donald Trump's decision to target Chinese tech - also took a toll on growth stocks, with tech, in particular coming under pressure.
Trump on Thursday issued executive orders against Chinese tech firms TikTok and WeChat, which he claimed would curb the ""threat"" they pose to U.S. national security.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) sidestepped the broader market weakness, while the rest of the so-called Fab 5, floundered with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) nursing losses for the day.
Energy also played its role in pressuring the broader market, falling 1% as oil prices ended the day in the red on worries that U.S.-China tensions could hurt the nascent recovery in crude demand.
On the earnings front, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) slumped 5.2% following a wider-than-expected loss in the second quarter as its core ride sharing business saw bookings plummet 73% amid pandemic-led weakness.
T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) popped 6.5% to hit new 52-week highs after the wireless provider delivered better-than-expected quarterly earnings and said it had usurped AT&T (NYSE:T) as the second biggest mobile carrier in the U.S."
4,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 04:05PM ET</span>","Exclusive: FAA employees report industry pressure, question agency safety push in survey","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) safety employees reported facing ""strong"" external pressure from industry and raised alarms the agency does not always prioritize air safety, according to an independent survey seen by Reuters on Friday.
The survey report gives ammunition to critics who argue in the aftermath of two fatal Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes that the U.S. aviation safety regulator has not done enough to insulate employees from industry pressure.
The survey quoted one anonymous employee as saying that the message was, ""Don't rock the boat with Boeing.""
The report found employees believe aviation safety leaders ""painted 'too rosy of a picture'"" after the 737 MAX crashes ""and did not acknowledge the needed changes to FAA safety-related policies and processes.""
The survey, turned over to Congress on Friday, found that many aviation safety employees believe that ""senior leaders are overly concerned with achieving the business-oriented outcomes of industry stakeholders and are not held accountable for safety-related decisions.""
""It is completely unacceptable that there are employees who lack confidence that their safety concerns are taken seriously,"" FAA Administrator Steve Dickson, who took over in August 2019, said in a letter to Congress on Friday, adding the agency is moving to create a Voluntary Safety Reporting Program - a confidential ""non-punitive environment that encourages open reporting of aviation safety issues and concerns."" 
The FAA commissioned the survey after it announced plans in April 2019 to improve safety culture following the second fatal Boeing crash. The agency noted the survey was ""designed specifically to encourage candid feedback.""
The safety culture survey, conducted in late 2019 and in focus groups in early 2020, said employees and managers reported ""external pressure from industry is strong and is impacting"" the safety culture. ""They shared that there is an unwritten code to be more 'liberal-minded' (versus conservative) when assessing safety risks, and there is pressure to find win-win solutions that benefit industry,"" the survey found.
""Many reported that industry will escalate issues to senior leadership and/or Congress if FAA employees are perceived as 'getting in their way,” which directly leads to decisions that are friendlier to industry (i.e., to help meet timelines and manage costs of industry applicants and operators),"" the survey added.
Nearly half of survey respondents disagreed that the FAA makes data-driven decisions on safety regardless of external pressure.
Agency employees said they can be ""over-powered in meetings with industry,"" with one unnamed employee saying: ""It feels like we are showing up to a knife fight with Nerf weapons. It is a challenge to be an equal match with Boeing in the meetings/conversations.""
The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, which represents FAA aviation safety workers, said it appreciated the FAA taking the report's findings seriously. It noted the union is working with FAA ""to develop a more robust voluntary safety reporting program.""
The MAX has been grounded since March 2019 after two crashes in five months, in Indonesia and Ethiopia, killed 346 people. Several reports have raised concerns about  Boeing Co  employees performing FAA certification tasks facing undue pressure.
The survey said FAA employees' perception was that ""no one at FAA has taken responsibility or been held accountable for"" the 737 MAX.
Boeing declined comment on Friday on the findings, but said earlier it created a new organization to centralize investigations of undue pressure allegations. The FAA on Wednesday proposed fining Boeing $1.25 million after the agency alleged Boeing exerted undue pressure on workers who handle FAA safety oversight work.
U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, in December said an FAA whistleblower reported ""Boeing applied undue pressure on FAA managers to overrule those managers’ own safety engineers and experts on safety-critical matters.""
Dickson has noted the United States has an ""unprecedented"" aviation safety record; the United States has reported just one fatality in a U.S. passenger airline accident since 2009.
In June, the Transportation Department's inspector general said Boeing failed to submit certification documents to the FAA detailing changes to a key flight control system tied to both crashes. The Justice Department has an ongoing criminal investigation into the MAX.

5,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 03:00PM ET</span>",'Bull everything' rally leaves investors wondering what to own,"By April Joyner and Ira Iosebashvili
NEW YORK (Reuters) - With assets of all stripes rallying and the S&P 500 Index (SPX) approaching fresh records, investors are facing a dilemma: stay in or get out.
Surging U.S. stocks, Treasuries and gold prices have come to the brink of simultaneously notching record highs for the first time in history, while rallies in once beaten-down assets like oil, financial stocks and the euro have accelerated. The S&P 500 is up 50% from its late March lows.
""We are in the 'bull everything' trade,"" said Christopher Stanton, chief investment officer at Sunrise Capital Partners. ""There are very few losers. Only laggards.""
The broad-based gains have presented investors with a conundrum. While many are uneasy owning assets that appear richly valued or trade at record highs, holding too much cash or an outsize allocation to underperforming stocks has hampered portfolio performance during the recent rally. 
Another concern is the possibility of a broad reversal where assets that appreciated in tandem sell off simultaneously, leaving investors with few places to shelter. 
Such market action was seen at various times during the coronavirus-fueled sell-off in March, when gold, stocks and Treasuries tumbled together as frightened investors went to cash.
STAYING THE COURSE
Plenty of investors believe the rallies are likely to continue as long as interest rates remain low and the Federal Reserve keeps pumping out stimulus - factors that have benefited everything from technology-related stocks to commodities such as oil and gold. 
And while some investors worry that the S&P 500 (SPX) has become increasingly skewed towards technology (SPLRCT) and communication services (SPLRCL) - which make up about 39% of the benchmark index's market capitalization - these sectors also accounted for about 39% of the index's second-quarter earnings, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""We still like businesses that are tech-focused and creating efficiencies in a post-COVID world,"" said Conor Delaney, chief executive of financial advisory network Good Life Companies. 
Among his holdings are shares of  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (O:ZM), a bet that the shift to work-from-home prompted by the coronavirus is unlikely to reverse anytime soon. 
Meanwhile, a 9% decline in the Dollar Index (=USD) from its high this year has given another tailwind to gold , which is denominated in the U.S. currency and becomes cheaper to foreign buyers when the greenback depreciates. 
George Gero, managing director at RBC Wealth Management, has periodically advised clients to raise allocations in the haven metal to hedge against everything from political uncertainty to a future surge in inflation. 
""We are staying the course,"" he said. ""I believe gold goes higher.""
GETTING OUT
Others believe the answer is to sell now and wait for things to get cheaper. 
Analysts at BofA Global Research noted that August kicks off what has historically been the weakest three-month stretch of the year for equities, where the average historic return stands at about 0%, according to the bank's data. 
Investors pulled a net $6.5 billion out of U.S. equities in the last week, the largest outflows in a month-and-a-half, the bank said. 
Persistent buying on dips and wild rallies in the shares of companies ""that make no sense"" have convinced Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea, that markets may be entering a euphoric phase that tends to precede corrections.
""We have been telling our investors they should lighten positions slowly and prudently,"" he said. 
Other potential flashpoints for volatility include a reversal of the dollar's downtrend, a worsening coronavirus outbreak or a contested U.S. presidential vote, investors said.
THE VALUE OF VALUE
Some have shifted their orientation to so-called value stocks, which are concentrated in economically-sensitive sectors that have tended to mount powerful rallies during rebounds from recessions.
John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, owns financial (SPSY) and industrial (SPLRCI) stocks alongside technology shares in hopes that a COVID-19 vaccine will spur economic recovery next year.
Past rebounds in value names have often come at the expense of momentum stocks, said Solomon Tadesse, head of quantitative equities strategy for North America at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
One such move came during a three-month stretch in 2009, when value stocks saw a 25% gain while momentum names lost about 30%, Tadesse said.

""It's a short window and if you miss it, you miss it,"" he said.

Airlines are suffering their worst crisis in history due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which decimated air travel demand and crushed the U.S. economy in the second quarter.
The fallout has put tens of thousands of airline jobs at risk as carriers warn an industry recovery could take years.
Atlanta-based Delta last month reported a 91% plunge in second-quarter revenue and a $3.9 billion adjusted pre-tax loss.
Delta would need at least 3,000 of its roughly 20,000 flight attendants to take unpaid leave of up to 12 months, among other options outlined in a memo reported earlier by CNBC. 
A person with direct knowledge of the matter confirmed the contents of the memo to Reuters. A representative for Delta did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Delta told pilots last month it would avoid furloughs if they agreed to reduced guaranteed minimum pay. 

More than 17,000 workers at Delta, which had more than 91,000 employees in 2019, are taking voluntary departure packages, including more than 1,700 of 7,900 pilots, Reuters reported last month.

7,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 01:27PM ET</span>",Oil Drilling Shrinks to 15-Year Low With Shale Spending Falling,"(Bloomberg) -- Drillers cut exploration in U.S. oil fields to a 15-year low as some of America’s most prolific shale explorers vowed to show restraint amid a stabilization in oil prices.
The number of active oil rigs in the U.S. fell by four to 176, the lowest since 2005, according to Baker Hughes Co. data released Friday. Beyond the addition of a single rig two weeks ago, explorers have been shutting off rigs for four and half months.
Explorers are channeling cash into dividends and other shareholder-friendly initiatives at the expense of drilling to appease investors fed up with years of poor returns.
“North American E&Ps are in a battle for investment relevance, not a battle for global market share,” Matt Gallagher, chief executive officer at  Parsley Energy  (NYSE:PE) Inc., told analysts during a conference call this week. “Allocating growth capital into a global market with artificially constrained supply is a trap our industry has fallen into time and time again.”
Worldwide lockdowns to prevent the spread of Covid-19 had a devastating impact on crude demand at a time when shale explorers were already struggling with too much debt and restive shareholders. While benchmark U.S. oil futures have roughly doubled to $40 a barrel since the start of May, prices are still down by more than 30% for the year.
The rig count is a closely watched metric because it’s long been considered indicative of future crude production. The relationship is imperfect, however, because of the time lag between drilling a well and commencing production, as well as other factors such as the turning off of existing wells in response to price movements.

Investing.com – Wall Street struggled on Friday, as better-than-expected job gains were cast aside by a lack of progress among lawmakers on the next round of coronavirus stimulus and souring U.S.-China trade relations.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.26 %, or 69 points. The S&P 500 slipped 0.30%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.21%.
The US economy added a better-than-forecast 1.76 million jobs in July, reinforcing investor expectations that the labor market remains steady despite recent data including a weaker jobless claims report earlier this week suggesting otherwise.
But a lack of progress among lawmakers on another pandemic stimulus relief, which is key to sustaining the U.S. economic recovery, prompted investors to rein in their bullish bets.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reportedly said an offer to reduce the $3.4 trillion package by $1 trillion was rejected by the White House, marking a blow to hopes of lawmakers meeting a self-imposed Friday deadline to resolve key sticking points.
As well as the slow pace of negotiations on Capitol Hill, rising U.S.- China trade tensions - in the wake of President Trump's decision to target Chinese tech - weighed on investor sentiment.
President Donald Trump on Thursday issued executive orders against Chinese tech firms TikTok and WeChat, which he claimed would curb the ""threat"" they pose to U.S. national security.
The sluggish day on Wall Street was exacerbated by weakness in tech stocks, which have led much of the rally since the recent lows seen in March.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) sidestepped the broader market weakness, while the rest of the of the so-called Fab 5 floundered, with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) nursing losses.
Energy also played its role in pressuring the broader market, falling 1% as oil prices look set to the end the day in the red as U.S.-China tensions added a layer of uncertainty to the crude demand outlook.

10,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>","Canada to impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, hopes for resolution","By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will slap retaliatory tariffs on C$3.6 billion ($2.7 billion) worth of U.S. aluminum products after the United States said it would impose punitive measures on Canadian aluminum imports, a senior official said on Friday.
Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told a news conference the countermeasures would be put in place by Sept. 16 to allow consultations with industry.
The move marks the latest ruction in what has been a sometimes choppy relationship between the two neighbors and close allies since President Donald Trump took office in 2017.
Trump moved on Thursday to reimpose 10% tariffs on some Canadian aluminum products on Aug 16 to protect U.S. industry from a ""surge"" in imports. Canada denies any impropriety.
""At a time when we are fighting a global pandemic... a trade dispute is the last thing anyone needs - it will only hurt the economic recovery on both sides of the border. However, this is what the U.S. administration has chosen to do,"" said Freeland.
""We do not escalate and we do not back down,"" she said later, variously describing the U.S. decision as ""entirely unacceptable,"" absurd and ludicrous.
The Canadian list of goods that might be subject to tariffs includes aluminum bars, plates, refrigerators, bicycles, washing machines and golf clubs. Trump is a keen golfer.
""I think the very best outcome would be for the United States to reconsider,"" said Freeland, adding that she was confident common sense would prevail.
The list of goods subject to tariffs is narrower than the last time Ottawa struck back at Trump because the two sides agreed in 2019 to limit the scope of retaliation in disputes over steel and aluminum, said a Canadian government source who requested anonymity.
In 2018, Ottawa slapped tariffs on C$16.6 billion ($12.5 billion) worth of goods ranging from bourbon to ketchup after Washington imposed sanctions on Canadian aluminum and steel.
Ottawa may be calculating its measures will be short-lived. A source briefed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office said Canadian officials are increasingly sure Trump will lose the Nov. 3 presidential election.

Trump acted just weeks after a new continental trade pact between the United States, Canada and Mexico took effect. The North American economy is highly integrated and Canada sends 75% of all its goods exports to the United States.

12,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>",U.S. businesses in China face uncertainty as White House bans WeChat,"By Pei Li
HONG KONG (Reuters) - As Tencent (HK:0700) assesses how its business might be impacted by a U.S. decision to ban its messenger app WeChat in the country, American companies in China may become unintended casualties due to their heavy reliance on the app, experts said.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled sweeping bans on U.S. transactions with owners of WeChat and video-sharing app TikTok, which his administration has called ""significant threats"".
It's not clear to what extent the executive orders, which go into effect in 45 days, would impact WeChat's business and whether Tencent's large fleet of investments in the U.S. and other parts of the world would come as collateral.
But if the ban covers U.S. companies doing businesses on WeChat, it would do more harm to U.S. firms such as Walmart (N:WMT) and Starbucks (O:SBUX) than to Tencent, said Chengdong Li, a Beijing-based tech analyst.
WeChat is an all-in-one mobile app that combines services similar to Facebook (O:FB), WhatsApp, Instagram and Venmo. The so-called super app is almost essential for daily life in China and boasts more than 1 billion users.
American brands, big and small, from  Nike  (N:NKE) to KFC (N:YUMC), Starbucks (O:SBUX) and Amazon (O:AMZN) use WeChat's embedded 'mini-app' programmes to facilitate transactions and engage consumers in China.
Users of the mini-app programmes do not need to download such retail apps separately as they can access those apps stored in WeChat's cloud.
""The revenue Tencent got from these mini-apps for Walmart and Starbucks is minuscule in comparison to Tencent’s video games revenue domestically,"" Li said.
""The ban would hurt Walmart and Starbucks more significantly as they rely on Tencent to get traffic.""
While Walmart's ""Scan-and-Go"" payment service is offered via its own app in the United States, the retail giant embedded the service into WeChat in China.
Walmart said last year the service, which enables customers to pay with their smartphones by scanning the bar code on items and skip queuing up at the cash register, made more than 30% of its transaction in China. 
It aligned itself with Tencent so much that in 2018 it dropped Alibaba-linked Alipay in all its stores in the western region of China.
While it's unclear whether and how much U.S. companies will be impacted, Raymond Wang, managing partner at Beijing law firm Anli Partners, said American businesses on WeChat might be able to survive the ban ""as long as their entities linked to WeChat are registered outside U.S.""
If the ban only covers WeChat businesses in the United States, it would inflict limited impact on both Tencent and U.S. companies relying on the app in China, as it is not heavily used by non-Chinese individuals in the United States.
""While we are not in a position to judge the future evolvement of this issue, we believe the current EO (executive order) seems to be targeting only WeChat, and if we are correct, the impact to Tencent's financials would be limited,"" Citi analysts wrote in a note Friday.

Yet Trump's order sent shares of Tencent, Asia's second-most valuable company with a $686-billion market capitalisation, tumbling as much as 10% on Friday.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 retreated from a near six-month high in choppy trading on Friday with data showing a sharp slowdown in U.S. employment growth, while U.S.-China tensions escalated with President Donald Trump's move to ban WeChat and TikTok.
With the benchmark index now about 1% below its record high, gains were led by utilities (SPLRCU), communication services (SPLRCL) and real estate <.SPLRCR> stocks. Energy (SPNY) was among the biggest decliners in morning trading.
The Labor Department's closely watched report showed nonfarm payrolls increased 1.76 million in July. While that was better than the 1.6 million jobs economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast, it was much lower than the record 4.8 million in June.
""Expectations of a negative jobs print had been hanging over investors for the past month, preventing them from fully enjoying the run of strong economic data,"" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors in London.

However, Democrats and Trump's top aides have so far failed to make substantial progress, with differences partly centered around continuing an extra $600-per-week in unemployment benefits.

18,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 11:21AM ET</span>",Exclusive: South Africa tries to recover over $23 million from SAP for 'unlawful' contracts,"By Alexander Winning
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African investigators are seeking to recover more than 400 million rand ($23 million) from German software firm SAP (DE:SAPG) for two government contracts they allege were entered into unlawfully, court documents seen by Reuters show.
Although the amount of money sought is small for a company with a market value of around 162 billion euros, the move by the authorities is another headache for SAP, which in 2018 admitted to misconduct over deals with South African state firms during former president Jacob Zuma's tenure.
SAP, a major global business software company, had said it was reviewing all its public sector deals in South Africa dating back to 2010, but it has not publicly flagged wrongdoing over the agreements in 2015 and 2016 with the Department of Water and Sanitation.
Investigators say those contracts should be declared invalid because government regulations were contravened, according to the court papers, reported here for the first time.
SAP did not comment on the specific allegations. In a statement to Reuters the company said: ""SAP continues to cooperate with South African authorities/law enforcement and remains committed to the highest standards of business ethics.""
""Our policy is, and always will be, to carry out all company activities in accordance with the letter and spirit of applicable laws.""
The Special Investigating Unit (SIU), which is investigating the contracts, told Reuters that evidence pointing to contravention of regulations by water ministry officials had been referred to prosecutors.
The SIU has been probing SAP's work for the water ministry for roughly two years, after President Cyril Ramaphosa authorised inquiries into possible procurement irregularities and corruption.
RECOVERING PUBLIC FUNDS
In court papers filed late last week, the SIU asked the Special Tribunal, a court Ramaphosa established to fast-track recovery of misspent or stolen public money, to order SAP to reimburse roughly 128 million rand for the 2015 agreement and 285 million rand for the 2016 agreement, plus interest.
In its review, included in the court documents, the SIU found the water ministry's 2015 contract with SAP was concluded despite the ministry still having a year left to run on an existing agreement with the German company. For the 2016 contract, the SIU cited a senior technology official as saying neither the ministry nor its entities had received services from SAP despite the 285 million rand paid.
A SIU principal forensic lawyer said in an affidavit that investigators were still probing possible corruption related to SAP's work for the water ministry. But he said they had decided to launch civil proceedings in the Special Tribunal now because taxpayer money was at stake.
The acting director-general of the water ministry said in an affidavit that a high turnover of directors-general since 2016 meant ""the obvious illegality related to the conclusion of the SAP contracts"" was not addressed sooner. 
A ministry spokesman declined further comment.
In March 2018, SAP admitted to paying more than $9 million to intermediary companies linked to the Guptas, a family at the centre of a political corruption scandal in South Africa, in relation to software deals with state power utility Eskom and state logistics firm Transnet.
The SIU said it was also investigating SAP contracts at Eskom and Transnet. The companies did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
The Guptas, close friends of former president Jacob Zuma, have denied corruption allegations but their relationship to the former president is one of the main areas of focus of a state corruption inquiry that began after Ramaphosa succeeded Zuma in February 2018.
Zuma also denies involvement in any corruption.
Ramaphosa has staked his reputation on cleaning up public life in South Africa but a spate of tender scandals during the coronavirus crisis has made some analysts question whether much progress has been made.
The COVID-19 pandemic has poleaxed an already weak economy and set the stage for a record budget deficit in the post-apartheid era.
This week the SIU and Eskom took steps to try to recoup 3.8 billion rand they allege was diverted from the utility by former Eskom executives and the Guptas.

The Guptas have denied unduly winning contracts with government entities, including Eskom, during Zuma's time in office.

(Reuters) - U.S. companies' profit growth forecasts for the next five years are still intact, according to Refinitiv data, suggesting that the impact inflicted on companies by the coronavirus pandemic is likely to be more fleeting than that in previous crises.
According to consensus estimates data available on Refinitiv, companies in the MSCI United States index <.dMIUS00000PUS> are likely to post annualized profit growth of 12% in the next five years, double the rate in the past five. 
Analysts have not slashed five-year growth estimates in any month this year.
Five-year growth expectations fell over six percentage points between November 2018 and October 2019 on worries over U.S-China trade war. They declined about three percentage points between July 2008 and June 2009 during the global financial crisis.
Graphic - Five-year growth estimates: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbvgbyqxpq/eJ0Bo-u-s-companies-5-year-growth-estimates.png
""The current consensus expectation is that earnings will recover sharply from 2021 onwards and that the coronavirus impact will be limited to 2020,"" Alain Bokobz, head of global asset allocation at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), said in a report. 
""In the previous two recessions, the U.S. equity market took around three years to reclaim pre-crisis earnings peak.""
U.S shares have climbed over 40% since March-lows, largely on the back of massive fiscal and monetary stimulus. 
SocGen's Bokobz said double-digit earnings growth is required for U.S. stocks to deliver a 7% total return in the next five years.
Graphic - U.S. companies' profit growth: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklpydlxavg/profit%20recovery.png
Analysts expect the recovery will be disproportionate across sectors.
""For sectors like consumer staples and technology, the recovery will be much shorter than the 2008 recession. The reason we may see a swift economic recovery is due to pent-up demand from consumers who have been holed up in their homes for a number of months and have limited spending,"" said Matta Fox, founder and wealth adviser at Ithaca Wealth Management.
""For sectors like energy and basic materials, the recovery may take longer.""
As the second-quarter earnings season crossed the halfway mark, U.S. companies had beaten second-quarter earnings expectations by a whopping 24.7%. So far, they have posted a 33.6% decline in net income in the second quarter over last year.
Graphic - Sectorwise earnings growth: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjpqwgqqpx/sectorwise.png
Sam Hendel, president at investment firm Levin Easterly Partners, said he expects a W-shaped recovery instead of a V-shaped recovery, and a lot will depend on the speed and efficacy of a COVID-19 vaccine.

""This recession is driven by main street due to the necessity to change behavior during the pandemic, and we are fortunate to have a well-capitalized banking system.""

Investing.com -- Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) popped 10% after the Food and Drug Administration accepted its Alzheimer's disease treatment application. 
A decision on approving aducanumab is expected by March 7. Biogen had previously shelved the treatment, but brought it back a few months later.  
The advisory committee meeting for aducanumab will be “one of the biggest events in biotech in the next six months,” RBC biotech analyst Brian Abrahams said, according to STAT, a health news site. If approved, aducanumab would become the first medicine to slow the cognitive decline of Alzheimer’s, the site said.   
Shares have been on a bumpy ride since Biogen brought back aducanumab in October, when they surged almost 30%.
Biogen has nine buy ratings, 16 holds and three sells, with an average price target of $309.30.

Biogen's shares were up 10% at $306 before the bell.
If approved, aducanumab would be the first treatment designed to delay progression of the fatal, mind-robbing disease, which is expected to affect 13.9 million Americans or 3.3% of the country's population by 2060, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
It has been several years since the FDA reviewed an application for a new Alzheimer's treatment, as drugs that were tested failed trials. The agency is expected to take a decision by March 7, but intends to act early on it if possible, the companies said.
Biogen in October revived plans to seek approval for the treatment, months after scrapping the development of the drug following disappointing study results.
Wall Street analysts have been divided about the data from the clinical studies.
""There still are a ton of questions surrounding the aducanumab dataset,"" Stifel analyst Paul Matteis said.
The drug regulator would consult a panel of outside experts on a yet-to-be-determined date for the approval of the drug, the companies said. The agency is not required to follow the panel's recommendation, but often does.
""We largely view an advisory committee as one of the big 'clearing events' and predict it will be 'mixed,' leaving the Street in limbo,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Michael Yee said. 
The FDA has granted a priority review, which allows it to accelerate the review of an application for drugs aimed to treat an unmet medical need.

Biogen said it did not use its priority review voucher for the aducanumab application.

LONDON (Reuters) - Thousands of British Airways staff will be sent letters telling them they have lost their jobs on Friday, as the airline pushes ahead with a plan to cut employee numbers by 29% in the face of bitter opposition from unions. 
British Airways, owned by IAG (L:ICAG), said in April it would need to axe up to 12,000 of its 42,000 staff to survive the COVID-19 pandemic and remain competitive. 
But the plan has met fierce resistance from cabin crew union Unite which said on Friday it would also keep fighting against pay cuts for existing staff. 
BA said that 6,000 employees had decided to take voluntary redundancy, while thousands of others would receive a letter in the coming days to tell them their fate.
Following a selection process, staff will hear whether they still have a job or not, and if they do, whether they will be required to accept a new contract or stay on their old one.
Unite has accused BA of ""industrial thuggery"" and it is trying to win support from lawmakers to strip BA of airport slots.
BA is currently only flying about 20% of its normal schedule and burning through 20 million pounds per day. 
""We are having to make difficult decisions and take every possible action now to protect as many jobs as possible,"" a spokesman for BA said.
Rival airlines Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and Air France-KLM have also announced job cuts.
Unite, which has already threatened BA with strike action, called on the airline to offer the same deal that it has agreed with its pilots to other staff. 
""We will do everything in our power to prevent compulsory redundancies and attacks on workers' wages by a boardroom with billions in the bank,"" Unite said in a statement. 

British Airways agreed a deal last week with pilots union BALPA for a pay cut of about 20% and some compulsory job cuts estimated around 270.

Gilead is aiming to supply enough of the drug by the end of the year to treat more than 2 million COVID-19 patients, and agreed to send nearly all of its remdesivir supply to the United States through September. 
But hospital staffers and politicians have complained about difficulties getting access to the drug, which is one of only two to have demonstrated an ability to help hospitalized COVID-19 patients in formal clinical trials.
Earlier this week, a bipartisan group of state attorneys general urged the U.S. government to allow other companies to make Gilead's remdesivir, to increase its availability and lower the price of the antiviral drug.
Gilead said its manufacturing network for the drug had grown to more than 40 companies in North America, Europe and Asia to add capacity. 
Separately on Friday, Britain's  Hikma Pharmaceuticals  (L:HIK) said it has started manufacturing remdesivir at its Portugal plant.
Pfizer will provide contract manufacturing services through its McPherson, Kansas plant, the drugmaker said. It was not immediately clear if Pfizer would supply only for the U.S. market.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Friday after a modestly better-than-expected jobs report for July failed to allay concerns that the economic recovery may be stalling. 
The U.S. created 1.763 million jobs in the month through mid-July, down from a revised 4.791 million in June. While that was marginally stronger than the 1.60 million average forecast, and while it was a relief after an alarmingly weak report on private payrolls from ADP earlier in the week, it still pointed to a clear loss of momentum in the labor market last month, when a surge of Covid-19 infections across the south and west of the U.S. forced a number of states to freeze or even partially reverse their economic reopening plans. 
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 73 points, or 0.3%, at 27,314 points. The S&P 500, which has closed in this week on a new all-time high, retreated 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2%.
The jobs report was unable to lift the gloom created by President Donald Trump's latest blast at China and by the failure of lawmakers in Washington DC to agree on a new round of relief measures for the economy, most importantly the extension of unemployment benefits for the millions who have last their jobs since March. 
Trump on Thursday had raised tensions with China again on Thursday by banning U.S. residents from interacting with ByteDance, the owner of the TikTok app, on security grounds. He also issued a similar ban on the WeChat messaging app, which is owned by U.S.-listed Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY). Tencent ADRs fell 7.0% in early trading.
Other Chinese ADRs also fell after a Trump administration panel recommended that Chinese companies be forced to delist if they don't open their books to U.S. auditors.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) ADRs and Nio (NYSE:NIO) ADRs both fell 4.0%.
Another stock under pressure was Uber (NYSE:UBER), which reported a widening loss in the second quarter as its booming food delivery business failed to compensate for a 75% drop year-on-year in bookings for its core ride-hailing business. The Uber Eats business, which has become more and more essential to CEO Dara Khosroshahi's growth narrative, is still not profitable, but Khosroshahi stuck to his revised target of breaking even on an adjusted EBITDA level by the end of next year. Uber stock fell 5.1%.
The biggest gainers included Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) stock, which rose 15% to a five-year high as the online realtor reported better-than-expected numbers for the second quarter."

FLORENCE/PARIS (Reuters) - Leading producers Italy and France are looking to slash premium wine output from the upcoming harvest to shore up prices after the coronavirus pandemic hammered sales and led to a glut of stock.
In Italy domestic demand for wine is expected to fall by almost a third after lockdown forced the closure of hotels, restaurants and wine bars for months, and with tourists still all but absent. Exports have also fallen and wine makers fear a loss of around 1 billion euros this year, or 9% of total sales.
Rome, aiming for a production cut of around 5% compared to last year, has earmarked 100 million euros ($119 million) to compensate vintners who throw away between 15% and 50% of their grapes, but wine makers' associations say take-up is likely to exceed the available funds. 
For bottles classified as higher quality, such as Chianti Classico and Prosecco, growers can get 1,100 euros per hectare of land on which the grape harvest is partly destroyed.
Some high-end consortia, like that producing Brunello di Montalcino, which sells for up to 200 euros a bottle, have set their own production quotas. 
Brunello growers have agreed to a 12.5% reduction in output for the upcoming harvest, with an industry source saying they had only sold half of their 2020 target. 
Applications for compensation must be made by August 10.
""The 100 million euros earmarked by the government will certainly not be enough,"" Luca Pollini, chairman of the Avito association of high-end Tuscan wine makers, told Reuters.
Tuscany also this week put on the table 6 million euros to help wine makers build extra storage space, but Pollini said a lot of vintners would rather throw away their grapes. 
The region alone already had excess stock equivalent to around 2 million bottles of wine from the previous harvest, he said.
LESS FIZZ 
Although France has not put in place a compensation scheme, the harvest of champagne grapes which starts this month is also set to be smaller - though champagne houses and growers have yet to agree by how much. 
Champagne producers' group CIVC estimates that as many as 100 million bottles will go unsold this year, with turnover down by more than 1.7 billion euros.
Its data shows that more than one billion bottles are piled up in champagne cellars, representing several years of potential sales. 
The Union des Maisons de Champagne (UMC), which promotes the interests of major Champagne houses including LVMH's Moet & Chandon and Dom Perignon, wants the maximum yield for the 2020 harvest to drop by up to 40% compared to last year.
However, growers do not want to cut their yield by more than 17%, according to local media reports.
UMC Chairman Jean-Marie Bailliere declined to comment on the negotiations but told Reuters he was confident a deal would be struck at a meeting scheduled for Aug. 18.
Rome and Paris have also set money aside for producers who distil surplus wine into alcohol for use in hand sanitisers and perfumes, and France this week topped up financial support for growers to 250 million euros, saying cash needs were ""pressing"".
The country's wine industry was already hurting as U.S. tariffs, part of a wider trade dispute between Washington and the European Union, curbed exports.
Italian wines have not been subject to the tariffs but officials said fears that could change had boosted exports to the United States earlier this year, inflating stocks and depressing prices.

""The weather has been favourable this year so the harvest should be good but the question for growers is whether they can sell their bottles at the right price,"" said Ottavio Cagiano de Azevedo, director general of the Federvini wine association.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) on Friday lowered its previously stated quarterly earnings as the bank set aside more money to pay for its settlement with the Malaysian government over the multi-billion 1MDB scandal.
Goldman lowered its net earnings applicable to common shareholders to $197 million from $2.25 billion, in a filing published on Friday. https://reut.rs/3h0Scd7
The revised earnings reflect a larger-than-previously-announced provision for legal and regulatory costs due to a $3.9-billion settlement the bank reached with the Malaysia government. https://reut.rs/3jzmhCJ
The bank said it set aside $2.96 billion in the second quarter for legal and regulatory costs, up from the $945-million Goldman said it set aside on July 15 during its second quarter earnings announcement. 
The bank's stock was down 0.1% in pre-market trading.
On July 24, Goldman agreed to pay the Malaysian government $2.5 billion cash and return at least $1.4 billion in proceeds from assets linked to sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), in exchange for Malaysia dropping all criminal charges against the bank.
U.S. and Malaysian authorities estimate $4.5 billion was stolen from the fund between 2009 and 2014. Goldman helped the fund raise $6.5 billion in two bond offerings, earning itself $600 million in fees, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Goldman faces a separate investigation by the DOJ, which is reportedly looking at whether the bank violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars U.S. companies from paying foreign government officials for help in getting or keeping business.

While it remains unclear if the bank's reserves could cover another settlement, the DOJ has pledged in recent years to consider parallel settlements when calculating corporate penalties. A source told Reuters in December that Goldman was in talks with U.S. officials to possibly pay up to $2 billion to resolve the investigation. https://reut.rs/2PCLAqJ

Movie theaters across the world were shuttered since mid-March when several countries imposed strict lockdowns and social distancing measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
""We already have resumed operations in more than 130 theaters in all of the countries we serve in Europe and the Middle East. That is more than one-third of our international theaters,"" Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron said.
The world's largest movie theater chain's plans come as studios push to make their movies available in living rooms sooner than the typical timeline of roughly 90 days after they debut in cinemas. Last week, AMC and Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s Universal Pictures agreed to a major shift that will allow the studio's movies to be made available to U.S. audiences at home after just three weekends in cinemas.

Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co said on Tuesday its live-action epic ""Mulan"" will skip most of the world's movie theaters and go directly to its streaming platform in September, due to uncertainty about when big movie theater chains will reopen.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has unveiled sweeping bans on U.S. transactions with the Chinese owners of messaging app WeChat and video-sharing app TikTok, escalating a high-stakes confrontation with Beijing over the future of the global tech industry.
The executive orders announced Thursday and effective in 45 days come after the Trump administration this week flagged increased effort to purge ""untrusted"" Chinese apps from U.S. digital networks, calling Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd's (HK:0700) WeChat and Bytedance's popular TikTok ""significant threats.""
China said on Friday the companies comply with U.S. laws and regulations and warned that the United States would have to ""bear the consequences"" of its action.
""The U.S. is using national security as an excuse and using state power to oppress non-American businesses. That's just a hegemonic practice,"" foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a media briefing.
TikTok has come under fire from U.S. lawmakers over national security concerns surrounding data collection as distrust between Washington and Beijing grows. Reuters on Sunday reported that Trump has given  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) 45 days to complete the purchase of TikTok's U.S. operations.
""We are shocked by the recent Executive Order, which was issued without any due process,"" TikTok said in a statement on Friday, adding that it would ""pursue all remedies available to us in order to ensure that the rule of law is not discarded"".
The ban on U.S. transactions with Tencent, one of the world's biggest internet companies, portends further fracturing of the global internet and severing of long-standing ties between the tech industries in the United States and China. 
""This is the rupture in the digital world between the U.S. and China,"" said James Lewis, a technology expert with Washington-based think-tank Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
""Absolutely, China will retaliate.""
On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expanded a program dubbed ""Clean Network"" to prevent various Chinese apps and telecoms firms from accessing sensitive information on U.S. citizens and businesses.
Trump's new orders appeared coordinated with Pompeo's announcement, Lewis said.
""We are reviewing the executive order to get a full understanding,"" a Tencent spokesperson said.
ByteDance declined to comment.
BIGGEST TARGET
WeChat has been downloaded a relatively small 19 million times in the United States, showed data from Sensor Tower. In China, however, the app is ubiquitous as a medium for services as varied as games and payment. It is also a common platform to communicate with individuals and businesses outside China.
U.S. social media and messaging services such  Facebook Inc 's (O:FB) WhatsApp and Messenger are blocked in China, where a ""great firewall"" prevents citizens from freely accessing the worldwide web, and where online communication is routinely monitored and censored.
U.S. concerns about China's tech industry had until recently focused on telecom equipment vendor Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL]. As relations soured over a host of economic and human rights issues, it has sanctioned numerous other Chinese tech firms.
Tencent is the biggest target yet. It is Asia's second most-valuable company after  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) with a market capitalization of $686 billion, and is among the world's largest social media and video game companies. It opened a California gaming studio this summer and owns minority stakes in numerous gaming and internet firms around the world, including U.S. messaging app operator  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP).
Trump's order sent Asian stock markets lower on Friday, with Tencent shares falling as far as 10.1% before recouping some of its losses in afternoon trade. [MKTS/GLOB]
The yuan , a barometer of Sino-U.S. relations, posted its steepest drop since the United States expelled China from its Houston consulate a little over two weeks ago. [CNY/]
SWEEPING POWER
Trump issued the orders under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law that grants the administration sweeping power to bar U.S. firms or citizens from trading or conducting financial transactions with sanctioned parties.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will identify transactions covered after the orders take effect in mid-September.
Tension has been simmering between the two powers for months, with the United States taking issue with China's handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak and moves to curb freedoms in Hong Kong. The increasingly aggressive posture towards China comes as Trump bids for re-election in November.
Trump said this week he would support Microsoft's efforts to buy TikTok's U.S. operations if the U.S. government got a ""substantial portion"" of the proceeds. He nevertheless said he will ban the popular app on Sept. 15, though some Republicans have raised concerns about potential political fallout.
The app may be used for disinformation campaigns that benefit the Chinese Communist Party, and the United States ""must take aggressive action against the owners of TikTok to protect our national security,"" Trump said in one order.
In the other, Trump said WeChat ""automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users. This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information.""
The United States is not alone in its concern about Chinese internet apps: WeChat and TikTok were among 59 mostly Chinese apps that India outlawed in June for threatening its ""sovereignty and integrity"".
The WeChat order would effectively ban the app in the United States by barring ""to the extent permitted under applicable law, any transaction that is related to WeChat by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, with Tencent Holdings Ltd.""
It was not clear whether the sanction would effect Tencent's other holdings in the country.
INCONVENIENCE
Meanwhile, WeChat users in the United States were quickly evaluating alternatives.
""Banning WeChat is against America's liberal principles,"" Jeason Ma, a 33-year-old in Los Angeles who obtained U.S. citizenship in November, told Reuters. ""Most of our family and friends are in China. This will cause significant inconvenience to our lives.""
Ma has been sharing his account information for WhatsApp and messaging rival Line Corp (T:3938) with friends and family, fearing he could lose access to WeChat.

The order ""calls TikTok a national security threat,"" said Derek Scissors, an expert on Sino-U.S. economic relations at the American Enterprise Institute think-tank. ""Either we've missed the threat for three years or it just became one and yet we are waiting 45 days.""

32,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>","Brazil's biggest lenders delay $44 billion in loan for consumers, companies","By Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's top four listed lenders are giving months-long extensions for consumers and companies to repay 235 billion reais ($43.98 billion) in outstanding loans, a move to give financially squeezed borrowers breathing room.
The loans subject to forbearance programs, which range from 13% of  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA's (SA:SANB11) portfolio to 10% of Itau Unibanco Holding SA's (SA:ITUB4), are an indicator of potential defaults. It was unclear how many borrowers, squeezed during the coronavirus crisis, will be able to pay their debts once the grace periods end.
The extensions, granted between March and June, vary from 60 to 180 days, depending on the bank. That echoes the situation at their U.S. cohorts, some of which acknowledge more loans may go bad as forbearance plans expire. 
Banco do Brasil SA (SA:BBAS3) has offered extensions on 11.6% of its portfolio, while Banco Bradesco SA (SA:BBDC4) has done so on 12.75%. 
Executives have declined to make firm predictions for future losses. They have said defaults may be smaller than initially feared, pointing to preliminary signs the Brazilian economy could recover.
Still, bank CEOs speaking in conference calls over the past two weeks were unanimous in predicting that 90-day default ratios would spike by year-end or the beginning of 2021, when the forbearance periods end. The ratio stands at around 3% for the country's biggest lenders.
They were divided over how bad things could get, with 
Itau's CEO Candido Bracher expecting default ratios to reach all-time highs, while Bradesco's CEO Octavio de Lazari said in an interview it is likely to be around 3.7%.
""Loan delinquency rates are likely to be worse than in previous crises, but recovery should also be faster,"" said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' equity analyst Tito Labarta. 
Brazil's declining benchmark interest rates, cut again on Wednesday to a record low of 2%, could make debt burdens more manageable than in the past, Lazari added. In 2016, amid Brazil's most recent recession, interest rates were at 14.25%. 
Brazil's four biggest lenders have already set aside 18.9 billion reais in extra COVID 19-related loan provisions in the last two quarters, depressing profits.
""In Latin America, Brazilian banks should have the best performance amid the coronavirus crisis, as they have already increased provisions a lot,"" said Labarta.

LONDON (Reuters) - Activist shareholder ValueAct Capital Management has sold out of British aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce (L:RR), a source familiar with the matter said on Friday, ending its relationship with the company five years after it became its biggest shareholder. 
Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 and Airbus 350, was beginning to see positive results from a four-year turnaround process earlier this year when the coronavirus pandemic struck, halting air travel and wreaking new havoc on its finances.
ValueAct, which invested in the company in 2015 at the height of its turmoil when it issued multiple profit warnings, is believed to have sold its remaining 4.5% Rolls stake in April, the source said.
Rolls has had a difficult time during the pandemic. It said in July it is looking at options to bolster its balance sheet after burning through 3 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) in the first half of the year as planes stopped flying, cutting the revenues it receives from flying-hours.
Reuters has reported that Rolls-Royce is planning a share issue to raise up to 1.5 billion pounds.
Shares in Rolls-Royce fell 2.8% in morning trading on Friday to 246 pence, putting the stock at its lowest level for 11 years, after a report that ValueAct had sold out.
ValueAct was not immediately available for comment on the stake sale, initially reported by the Financial Times. No regulatory filings are required when a stake is already under 5%. ValueAct had previously owned a 9.48% stake in Rolls. 

Rolls-Royce declined to comment.

At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), US 500 Futures traded 11 points, or 0.4%, lower, Nasdaq 100 Futures down 43 points, or 0.4%. The Dow Futures contract fell 105 points, or 0.4%. 
Late Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump announced bans on U.S. residents' transactions with China's ByteDance, owner of video-sharing app TikTok, and on messenger app WeChat, owned by Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY).
The bans would start 45 days from now, and are explained as being valid because the companies offer ""significant threats"" to U.S. national security.
China responded Friday that the companies comply with U.S. laws and regulations and warned that the United States would have to ""bear the consequences"" of its action.
Tension has been simmering between the two powers for months, with the U.S. upset primarily over China's handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak and moves to curb freedoms in Hong Kong.
Additionally, U.S. lawmakers have once more failed to make any real substantial progress on a new coronavirus aid bill, raising the possibility that President Trump will use executive powers to provide some limited aid.
""If we conclude tomorrow that there's not a compromise position on the major issues, the president has alternatives in executive orders,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday.
The official employment report will also be in focus Friday, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), with July’s payrolls expected to come in at 1.60 million - that's around one-third of the previous month's 4.80 million. This would suggest that the resurgence in coronavirus infections is undermining the economic recovery.
Earnings season continues, with the likes of DISH Network, Fluor and Icahn Enterprises due to release numbers Friday.
Oil prices traded lower Friday, amid concerns about demand destruction and not helped by  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) cutting the price of its flagship Arab Light crude by 30 cents a barrel.
That said, the two benchmark crude contracts are both set for weekly gains of at least 4%, the most since the week ending July 3.

LONDON (Reuters) - Energy prices are set to fall for millions of British households from October after the energy regulator said it would lower its cap on the most widely used tariffs by about 7.5%.
A cap on electricity and gas bills came into effect in January 2019 and was aimed at ending what former British Prime Minister Theresa May called ""rip-off"" prices by energy firms.
The reduction, to the lowest level since the cap began, was due to a fall in wholesale gas prices since February as lockdowns on business and homes hit demand, Ofgem said.
""The COVID-19 crisis has depressed energy demand although wholesale gas prices have started to recover since hitting 20-year lows in the spring,"" the regulator said in a statement.
The cap for average annual consumption on the most common tariffs, used by around 11 million households, will fall by 84 pounds ($110) to 1,042 pounds, while for some 4 million homes on pre-payment energy meters it will fall by 95 pounds to 1,070 pounds a year, Ofgem added on Friday.
Ofgem calculates the cap using a formula that includes wholesale gas prices, energy suppliers network costs and costs of government policies, such as renewable power subsidies.
Graphic - Breakdown of a British dual fuel (gas and electricity) bill% : https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/dgkpldzzrpb/Pasted%20image%201596782287268.png
However, Ofgem warned that with wholesale prices beginning to rise the cap is likely to be increased at the next review, which comes into affect in April.
Under legislation the cap could be lifted from 2020 and no later than 2023.
Ofgem on Friday recommended it should remain in place next year, with an ultimate decision to be taken by the government by the end of October.
""Our assessments shows this is not the right time to remove the cap,"" Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem's chief executive, told reporters on a call.
He said the regulator would like to see a more competitive market, better customer engagement and more technology such as smart meters deployed before the cap is removed.
Despite the cap, Ofgem said those seeking cheaper energy prices may still find better deals by shopping around.

38,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 05:51AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Rightmove, Halifax Show Signs Of Life in U.K. Housing","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The U.K. housing market is enjoying a post-reopening bounce. 
Investors in the U.K.’s biggest online real estate portal certainly seemed intent on enjoying it while it lasts on Friday, pushing the stock up nearly 8% to a five-month high in response to a quarterly report that showed house-hunters releasing their pent-up demand with abandon.
Since May 13, when the U.K. government announced the relaxation of lockdown measures that had stopped the crucial viewings process,  Rightmove  PLC (LON:RMV) has broken its own record for customer traffic on 65 days. Visits to the site in June were up 50% from a year earlier. For the months of June and July, demand for sales properties was up 50% from a year earlier, while demand for rental properties was up 20%.
Clearly, these are not figures that can be sustained forever. Some degree of mean reversion seems inevitable. Government employment subsidy schemes will expire and unemployment will rise. The holiday on stamp duty, which has acted as a defibrillator for a moribund market, will have to be put back in its holster one day, as Treasury chief Rishi Sunak implicitly acknowledged on Friday. Sunak said the U.K. can’t sustain the current level of borrowing indefinitely.  
However, Rightmove gave a tantalizing glimpse of a brighter future even after the first wave of pent-up fades, as the pandemic triggers what could be a major long-term shift in consumer preferences, as people flee densely-populated big cities in search of the perceived safety and greater comfort of the suburbs. A structural shift to working from home increases the premium on living space that is actually liveable, after all.
The company said its data suggests “that the significant increase in activity is being driven not only from the pent up demand from the period of lock down, but an increased number of home hunters who have decided to move following the experience of lock down.”
If this trend establishes itself, then Rightmove can look forward to a structural support in transaction volumes that could cushion the longer-term hit from falling prices caused by an economic downturn whose duration and severity still can't be judged with any confidence.
The company may not even have to worry about an aggregate fall in prices, at least in nominal terms. While locals sell up in London to look for cheaper space further outside the capital, past evidence suggests that there will always be enough foreign buyers for London property to put a floor under prices there - especially if sterling cheapens (as the current mix of fiscal and monetary policy suggests it ought to).
The house price index compiled by Halifax, one of the country’s biggest mortgage lenders, broke a streak of four straight monthly declines with a 1.6% increase in July, the second-biggest rise in 17 months. On an annual basis, prices rose by 3.6%, the fastest clip since February."

Western Australia's industrial safety regulator said the inspection orders were for trains one and three and had to happen before August 21.
It was not immediately clear whether Chevron would have to shut down trains 1 and 3 at the 15.6 million tonnes a year plant, one of the world's largest LNG projects, to conduct the inspection and any necessary repairs.
""We are evaluating, based on the learning that we've got, how to best address trains 1 and 3,"" Chevron Vice President Jay Johnson told analysts on an earnings call on July 31.
Last month, Australia's Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety (DMIRS) said it would inspect the plant following calls by a trade union to shut it down, after the company reported it had found a weld problem in the propane kettles on train 2 while the unit was undergoing maintenance.
The department's Dangerous Goods and Petroleum Safety Director Steve Emery said in a statement that the nature of reported cracking in train two could mean ""there may be similar defects in trains one and three"".
""The short-term measures Chevron has taken to mitigate the consequences of any potential gas leaks appear sufficient until the welds are inspected,"" Emery said.
Chevron confirmed it received the notices from the regulator relating to improvements on the propane heat exchangers of Gorgon train 2 and remediation notices for trains 1 and 3. 
""We are working closely with the regulator in planning and implementing repair work at Gorgon that was identified by Chevron in a safe and efficient manner,"" the company said in an email.
Chevron said it planned to restart train 2 in early September after completing repairs.

Gorgon is 47.3% owned and operated by Chevron.  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) each own 25%, and the rest is held by Japanese firms.

The bank has exited its short position on the dollar index (=USD) (DXY) which measures its value against a basket of currencies, while also closing long positions on the euro and Australian dollar versus the greenback.
It added moreover that risks appeared to be building for the equity rally, following improving company earnings and investment inflows in the past fortnight.
A sentiment gauge called the Combined Market Timing Indicator was now giving a 'sell' signal for the first time since January 2018, Morgan Stanley said.

41,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 05:18AM ET</span>",S&P 500 Near Record Sets Stage for ‘Critical’ U.S. Jobs Report,"(Bloomberg) -- Today’s jobs report could be make-or-break data for U.S. equities.
The S&P 500 is 1.1% below its closing high in February as investors head into the July nonfarm payrolls report at 8:30 a.m. New York time Friday. The data is crucial after a five-day rally that has looked past escalating U.S.-China tensions and instead toward the economic rebound, strong earnings and chances that Congress will approve a new stimulus plan.
The report is “one of the more consequential NFP releases in recent memory and represents a critical update on the state of the labor market recovery,” said Ian Lyngen, a strategist at BMO Capital Markets.
The biggest economy is expected to have added almost 1.5 million jobs in July, with the unemployment rate dropping to 10.6% from a prior 11.1% and average hourly earnings declining 0.5%, according to the median of estimates compiled by Bloomberg News.
Here’s what some strategists see for markets around the report:
Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital
Results of BMO’s pre-payrolls survey “suggest a degree of downside is already reflected” in Treasury yields, “which raises the bar for any weakness in Friday’s number to truly shock investors. This does not preclude a robust report from inspiring a sell-off, but we suspect that would only further cement the trading range.”
“46% see a retest of 3,000 in the S&P 500 before reaching 3,600, while 54% anticipate an extension of the bullishness in equities to reach that threshold before any revisit to 3,000,” Lyngen said about the split in responses in the survey.
Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda Asia Pacific Pte.
“With stocks enjoying a multi-day rally, and the dollar under a constant artillery barrage all week, the risks are that a disappointing number and or a massive downward revision to last month, sets of a potentially ugly short-term correction. That could see the U.S. dollar jump, stocks retreat and also knock gold off its record-highs perch. An aggressive fall by U.S. stocks would be a stern test for gold, as recent times suggest the two have a high correlation in such circumstances.”
Shawn Quigg, strategists at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.
“With an extended unemployment package still in debate, it could weigh on economic optimism” and fuel market moves around the jobs report. In particular, “energy stocks continue to be volatile around important economic releases given the perceived importance to a continued economic recovery.”
The strategists recommend buying straddles on the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. shares, and selling straddles on  Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR)., ahead of the report.
Brian Price, head of investment management for Commonwealth Financial Network
Expectations for a strong jobs data “could be low considering how weak the ADP report was earlier this week. The ADP report is not always a great leading indicator for the employment report but we’ll see if there is a higher correlation this month. If the number surprises on the downside and the unemployment rate doesn’t dip below 11% then we could see a market pullback on the news.”"

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks ended four days of gains on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump cranked up simmering tensions with China by banning U.S. transactions with two popular Chinese apps, Tencent's WeChat and ByteDance's Tiktok.
Chinese stocks led losers in Asia and its currency slumped after Trump issued the executive orders. His administration said this week it was stepping up efforts to purge ""untrusted"" Chinese apps from U.S. digital networks and called TikTok and WeChat ""significant threats.""
""The U.S. pressure on China's tech sector appears likely to continue in the presidential elections, injecting volatility in the sector and opening the door to escalatory retaliation,"" UBS strategists said.
European stocks opened lower, with major indexes down between 0.2% to 0.4% in early trading (STOXX) (FTSE).
MSCI's broadest index of world stocks (MIWD00000PUS) fell 0.2% on Friday after up four consecutive days of gains. It was less than 3% away from a late February peak. 
Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fell 1%, with mainland Chinese indexes down more than 1% each, even though Chinese trade data for July showed exports beat expectations.
Risk appetite was also subdued on Friday with hopes fading for a quick deal by U.S. policymakers on stimulus worth at least $1 trillion to support the country's fragile economy. The White House and Democrats remained far apart on the size of the stimulus package and what to include.
The risk-off mood pushed U.S. Treasury yields lower and offered a brief respite to the struggling dollar, which has been under pressure in recent weeks. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) dipped 1.1 basis points to 0.5198%, near Thursday's five-month low of 0.504%. 
Closely watched U.S. non-farm payrolls data, due at 1230 GMT, is expected to show an increase of 1.58 million in July, compared with 4.8 million in June.
Gold  hit a record high of $2,075.2 per ounce XAU= before succumbing to profit-taking to slip to $2,063.
Silver dropped 1.7% to $28.452 per ounce  following its rise to a seven-year high of $29.838.

Oil prices were little changed, with Brent futures (LCOc1) down 0.1% at $45.04 per barrel.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African gold miners are looking to cut debt and boost dividends as bullion hits record highs, with analysts and fund managers predicting a sectoral growth spurt over the next two years amid rising investor interest.
Shunned by investors due to mines that are old, deep, and difficult to extract, the country's gold miners have traded at a discount to their global peers for years.
Higher prices, as spot gold  roared past $2,000 an ounce for the first time, coupled with a weaker rand currency, comes as a lifeline.
Interviews with companies executives, analysts and fund managers show that higher gold prices could see some local miners bring their net debt to zero and pay healthy dividends over the next 18 to 24 months.
""Gold mining companies will spew a lot of cash in the next 12 months,"" said Franco Lorenzani, an independent mining analyst.
 Sibanye  Stillwater (J:SSWJ), which has battled high debt, said it achieved its leverage target in the first quarter, ahead of plan.
Its net debt, which stood at 20.964 billion rand ($1.2 billion) in 2019, dropped 40% year-on-year in the first quarter.
Higher prices have also made more marginal ounces profitable for Sibanye, spokesman James Wellsted told Reuters, adding the company was looking at other ways to benefit from favourable market conditions.
""Maybe mining secondary reefs ... might be viable at these prices,"" said Wellsted.
 Pan African Resources  (L:PAFR) is hoping to be net debt free by June 2021 and plans to increase its dividend payout to 5% from 1% last year, its head of investor relations Hethen Hira said. Its net debt dropped 49% to $62.5 million at end December.
Gold Fields (J:GFIJ) has flagged hefty gains from the gold rally, with half-year profits seen up more than 300%.
(GRAPHIC - Percentage change of gold price vs JSE's gold index Percentage change of gold price vs JSE's gold index: https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/qmyvmkybbvr/chart.png) 
Rene Heichreiter of Noah Capital said he was advising his clients to continue to invest in local gold miners, predicting a exponential jump in revenues in the coming months.
Some investors have already turned bullish.
Factsheets of fund managers seen by Reuters show South Africa's Fairtree increased its exposure to  Harmony  Gold (J:HARJ) by 0.78% between March and June, while U.S.-based ASA Ltd, which invests in gold mining companies globally, increased its investments in South Africa to 10.7% in June from 9.9% in January.
But the operating environment remains risky.
While power cuts and regulatory uncertainty have always hung over operations, the mining sector is also battling rising COVID-19 cases in underground mines where social distancing is a challenge. 
This could threaten output, as some analysts warn the frenzy over high prices could backfire as investments add to costs. 

""Whenever the gold prices go up the costs tend to go up with it,"" said Nedbank mining analyst Arnold Van Graan.

The new agreement will see revised terms for the conversion of 1.5 billion Swedish crowns ($172 million) in existing hybrid notes into common shares and an option for holders of a 2.25 billion crown, senior unsecured fixed rate bond to convert their holdings into new commercial hybrid notes, SAS said. 
""SAS has continued to work intensively on a revised recapitalization plan and has, after discussions and negotiations with certain major holders of hybrid notes and bonds, reached an agreement in principle which has been approved by the Board of Directors,"" it said in a statement on Friday.
SAS said it was in discussions with the governments of Sweden and Denmark, its two largest shareholders, over the revised plan and would announce further details and a timetable as soon as possible. 
The recapitalization will be subject to approval by the European Commission.
The airline said in late June that it had agreed a 14.25 billion Swedish crown plan with top shareholders, including Sweden and Denmark, to shore up its finances.
This included a discounted share issue to its main owners and a broader rights issue, as well as the conversion of the outstanding bonds and hybrid notes into shares. 
But SAS had to restart negotiations with bondholders who were not expected to agree to the initial terms.

The new agreement also includes an increase in the interest rate on 6 billion crowns of state hybrid notes that SAS will issue to major shareholders.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded mixed Friday, with hope of a prompt Brexit deal helping the U.K. market outperform, while mounting tensions between China and the U.S. and faltering progress toward a new U.S. virus relief package weighed.
At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 0.3%. 
A trade deal between Britain and the European Union is still possible in September, Britain's finance minister Rishi Sunak said on Friday.
""On Brexit, as you will have heard recent reports, we remain confident that it's possible to get a deal in September,"" he told Sky News.
The thought of Britain ending the year without a deal with its nearest and largest trading partner has hit confidence in the U.K. economy.
Adding to the positive European news was strong German industrial production growth, climbing 8.9% in June, ahead of the 7.4% growth seen the previous month. French and Spanish output also rebounded by more than expected, although economists warned that further gains will be harder to achieve.
Overnight, U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled bans on U.S. transactions with China's ByteDance, owner of video-sharing app TikTok, and on messenger app WeChat, owned by Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY).
Tension has been simmering between the two powers for months, with the United States unhappy with China's handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak and moves to curb freedoms in Hong Kong. The original cause of their tension - China's trade surplus - surged back toward record levels in July, with exports surging 7.2% from a year earlier.
Meanwhile, negotiations on a U.S. virus relief deal ended Thursday night with the White House and Democrats making little headway.
In corporate news, Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) stock dropped 3.9% after the Financial Times reported that activist shareholder ValueAct Capital Management has sold its stake in the company.
On the flip side, Deutsche Telekom  (DE:DTEGn), which owns 43% of T-Mobile, rose 2.3% after the U.S. firm impressed with its monthly phone subscriber additions.
Markets will focus later on the release of the official U.S. employment report, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have increased by 1.6 million jobs in July, which would be a sharp step-down from the record 4.8 million in June. 
Oil prices weakened Friday, amid uncertainty over the new stimulus package in the U.S. and the impact that would have on fuel demand growth given the recent  resurgence of coronavirus infections. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $41.86 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.2% to $45.01. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $2,059.90/oz, retreating a touch after hitting a record $2,077.85 an ounce earlier in the session. Gold has rallied more than 33% in 2020, putting it on track for the biggest annual gain in over four decades.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Richemont  (S:CFR), the owner of Cartier, gave details of its proposed shareholders' loyalty scheme on Friday, where it will give warrants to investors which later can be converted into newly created stock.
The luxury goods maker said it would ask shareholders at its annual general meeting on Sept. 9 to authorise the creation of new shares which can be exchanged for the warrants after three years.
Richemont proposed the scheme to preserve cash during the COVID-19 pandemic after halving its dividend to 1 Swiss franc per share.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening largely lower Friday, amid a major escalation of tensions between China and the U.S. and with little progress towards a new U.S. virus relief package. However, losses may be stemmed by signs of industrial revival in Germany.
At 2:10 AM ET (0610 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% lower, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%, while CAC 40 futures in France were largely unchanged.
U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping bans late Thursday on U.S. transactions with China's ByteDance, owner of video-sharing app TikTok, and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), operator of messenger app WeChat. These bans go into effect in 45 days.
Earlier this week President Trump said he would support the sale of TikTok's U.S. operations to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) if the U.S. government got a ""substantial portion"" of the sale price. 
Tension has been simmering between the two powers for months, with the United States unhappy with China's handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak and moves to curb freedoms in Hong Kong. The original cause of their tension - China's trade surplus - surged back toward record levels in July, with exports surging 7.2% from a year earlier.
Meanwhile, negotiations on a U.S. virus relief deal ended Thursday night with the White House and Democrats making little headway. Investors will be keen to see whether an agreement can be reached before the end-of-the-week deadline, with President Trump threatening to issue an executive order if this deadline passes with no agreement.
German industrial production also impressed, climbing 8.9% in June, ahead of the 7.4% growth seen the previous month.
""The industrial sector is continuing to work its way out of the trough in production,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said after Ifo published a survey showing that the mood among industrial companies improved for a third straight month in July.

52,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 01:20AM ET</span>",Picking pennies: Dollar slump lifts U.S. bond returns for foreigners,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss, Saikat Chatterjee and Dhara Ranasinghe
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - A 10% decline in the value of the U.S. dollar since March has boosted returns for foreign investors in the world's largest government bond market at a time when U.S. Treasury yields are near record lows.    
German and Japanese buyers of U.S. government debt can pocket a few basis points in yield after hedging their foreign exchange exposure back to their home currencies, despite a 140 basis-point drop in 10-year Treasury yields so far this year.     
For Japanese investors, buying U.S. 10-year debt and hedging back to yen using three-month currency forwards would net a total yield of 10 basis points, Neuberger Berman data showed. It was -74 basis points a year ago, and negative for nearly three years before that, due to higher U.S. interest rates.        
The situation is roughly similar for a German investor. Buying U.S. 10-year Treasuries and hedging back to euros showed a yield of -20 basis points, up from nearly -100 basis points a year earlier. 
Going out the curve helps, though, with a positive yield of 48 basis points if one buys U.S. 30-year bonds and hedges back to euros, compared with -43 basis points last year, according to Refinitiv data.    
""There is an incentive to hedge more in U.S. fixed income because the dollar is weak,"" said Ugo Lancioni, head of global currencies at Neuberger Berman, which oversees $357 billion in assets.      
""U.S. bonds have become more attractive now on a hedged basis in absolute terms, specifically for Japanese and European investors, than they were pre-COVID.""    
Hedges are typically done through forwards that specify the rate at which currencies can be exchanged at the end of a contract period -- usually three to six months. Interest rate differentials determines the forward rate.      
A few basis points in yield pick-up can make a big difference for investors in the euro area and Japan, where deeply negative yields effectively mean paying governments there to buy their debt. But leaving U.S. bonds unhedged could also wipe out foreign investor gains if the dollar weakens further.    
A big part of the equation to hedge more is the drop in hedging costs after the Federal Reserve slashed U.S. rates to near-zero in March to mitigate the economic havoc caused by the coronavirus pandemic.    
For most of the 2017-2019 period, a European bond investor who swapped German Bunds for 10-year Treasuries and hedged the dollar exposure back to euros would have seen steep hedging costs erode any U.S. yield advantage, said Rob Robis, chief global fixed income strategist, at BCA Research.     
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were at 1.93% in November 2018, six times the 0.34% available in their German counterparts. But the fat U.S. yield advantage was wiped out if hedging costs of about 3% are considered.    
Many foreigners had eschewed hedging their FX risks when buying U.S. debt because of the higher yield and expectations of a sturdy dollar, which has surged 30% against its rivals (=USD) since the 2008 global financial crisis.    
But the March rate cuts have steepened the U.S. yield curve compared with its Japanese counterpart for the first time ""in years, making this kind of FX-hedged investments attractive,"" said Oliver Brennan, TS Lombard macro strategist.
(GRAPHIC - Yield Curves: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegvbaeympq/Yield%20Curves.JPG)
To be sure, some analysts warned a further deterioration in the U.S. economic outlook could sour investor appetite for dollar-denominated assets.    
Massive U.S. fiscal stimulus could spur inflation, which should tarnish the attractiveness of long bonds, while last month's landmark agreement on a 750 billion-euro European recovery fund for COVID-19, has boosted sentiment on euro-based assets. 
There are already signs foreign investors are favoring some European assets. Excluding those in Europe, offshore investors bought almost a third of new Italian 10-year government bonds in June.
For now, U.S. bonds remain king despite fiscal challenges and slowing growth momentum. 
""There are often no alternatives for investors who maneuver large pools of money through global financial markets,"" said Robert Brauns, portfolio manager for multi-strategy fixed income at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management.
He believes the ongoing U.S. recovery from the virus-induced recession ""has room to extend further,"" which should take asset valuations higher the next six to 12 months as the economy goes back to normal.

53,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 12:45AM ET</span>",Rio Tinto didn't inform cave blast owners of other mine plans: CEO,"By Melanie Burton
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto (AX:RIO) did not tell Aboriginal traditional owners of two ancient caves destroyed to mine iron ore about three alternative mine plans, its CEO told an inquiry on Friday, despite saying it had won fully informed consent for blasting.
Rio Tinto CEO Jean-Sébastien Jacques faced an Australian Senate inquiry after the miner in late May legally destroyed the sacred caves which sat atop a high grade ore body it planned to mine, against the wishes of the traditional owners.
The destruction of the sites, which showed evidence of 46,000 years of human habitation, fuelled a public furore and became a facet of Black Lives Matter protests in Australia, sparking the parliamentary inquiry.
Jacques, who apologised at the start of the hearing for the destruction of the site, said the company had four options for its mine plan and chose the most valuable one, which gave it access to $135 million of ore. 
""The difference between option 4 and the other three options was in the vicinity of 8 million tonnes of high grade iron ore. The economic value at the time of the decision ... was around $135 million of net present value,"" he said.
Jacques also confirmed that the Puutu Kunti, Kurama and Pinikura (PKKP) people were not made aware that the iron ore giant had considered three other mine plans, but were only presented with the option that would destroy the caves.
""How could it be possibly be seen that they were given free, prior and informed consent under those circumstances?"" Senator Warren Snowden asked.
Rio had said in a submission to the inquiry that it believed it had obtained free, prior and informed consent from the PKKP, a United Nations-backed principle on the rights of indigenous peoples that the miner has pledged to uphold. 
Jacques told the inquiry there was no doubt the company could have made better decisions.
""This is a defining moment for Rio Tinto. We are absolutely committed to learn and change,"" he said.
He stopped short of explicitly committing to absolve traditional owner groups from historic agreements that restrict them from publicly objecting to mining development on their land.
Critics say such agreements, which are widespread in Western Australia, mean traditional owners are unable to raise concerns when government officials call for public objections to inform their decisions over whether to allow a site to be destroyed.
Rio Tinto, which has faced criticism from major shareholders over the blasts, is conducting its own independent board review into the incident, due to be completed in October. It has pledged to make the findings public.
The Senate inquiry chairman Warren Entsch indicated that Rio would likely be called back to a later hearing.

The potential seizure stems from a 2018 ruling by South Korea's Supreme Court ordering the steelmaker to compensate four plaintiffs - a ruling that has triggered diplomatic tension and trade friction between the Asian neighbours. 
Japan argues the ruling violates international law because all claims for compensation arising from Japan's 1910-1945 colonisation were settled under their 1965 diplomatic treaty. It warned on Tuesday it would have to respond if the assets were seized.
The South Korean government says the ruling must be respected as a decision by an independent judiciary. 
In a move widely seen as retaliation for the 2018 ruling, Japan last year said it would stop preferential treatment for shipments to South Korea of some key high-tech materials whose production it dominates and which are used by firms such as Samsung Electronics Co (KS:005930).
Talks to resolve the export curbs have stalled and South Korea is proceeding with a complaint to the World Trade Organization.
Nippon Steel was ordered to pay 100 million won ($84,150) each to four South Koreans as compensation. Its shares in the joint venture with Korean steelmaker POSCO (KS:005490), called PNR, have been targeted for seizure and are worth about 400 million won at face value.

The appeal by Nippon Steel was filed with the District Court in Daegu, a court official said.

China’s largest gaming and social media company shed more than $45 billion of market value after sliding by the most since October 2011 on an intraday basis. The vaguely worded executive order could potentially hammer not just the use of WeChat and WeChat Pay in the U.S. but extend to business relationships with some of America’s largest corporations.
Tencent ranked as the world’s biggest games publisher by revenue in 2019, according to Newzoo data, and it collaborates with U.S. industry leaders like Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI). and Electronics Arts Inc. It also holds a large stake in Fortnite maker Epic Games Inc. and owns League of Legends developer Riot Games Inc. Though some confusion remains about the extent of the ban, at its most extreme it would prevent any U.S. entities from transacting with Tencent, effectively freezing billions of dollars of commerce.
Trump’s order on WeChat came after a similar injunction against ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, the viral video service the White House accuses of jeopardizing national security. But Tencent is at the heart of communications between people and businesses within China and abroad, as the operator of WeChat.
“A ban on WeChat would be consequential because it would practically shut down communication between the U.S. and China,” said Graham (NYSE:GHM) Webster, China Digital Economy Fellow at think tank New America. “There are real data, privacy, and security concerns but they go well beyond these two Chinese apps and these orders just wrap the real issues up in political theatre.”

56,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 11:54PM ET</span>","Tencent Sinks With Chinese Stocks, Yuan After Trump’s WeChat Ban","(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong and mainland stocks fell after the Trump administration said it would ban U.S. residents from doing any business with China’s Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.
Tencent, one of the most valuable stocks in the world and Asia’s biggest primary listing, tumbled as much as 10%, the most since 2011. That sent the Hang Seng Index to a loss of 2.4%. China’s tech-heavy ChiNext Index dropped 2.6% in Shenzhen to erase its gain for the week. The yuan weakened as much as 0.3%, the most in two weeks.
The U.S. has in recent days extended its efforts to curb the influence of Chinese tech to include Tencent, whose all-purpose WeChat messaging app is one of the most popular in the world with more than 1 billion users.
President Donald Trump signed a pair of executive orders prohibiting U.S. residents from doing any business with WeChat or TikTok, the popular video app owned by ByteDance Ltd., or the apps’ Chinese owners beginning 45 days from now, citing the national security risks related to personal data. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo earlier this week described TikTok and WeChat as “untrusted Chinese apps.”
“The U.S. government is expected to follow up with more measures targeting Tencent; more negative headlines will come out and could potentially further hurt sentiment toward Tencent, as well as the overall market,” Steven Leung, executive director at UOB Kay Hian (Hong Kong) Ltd., said by phone. “Tencent’s overseas expansion map now looks a bit uncertain, since some M&A deals, especially if its targets are based in the U.S., will face challenges.”
Tencent is one of China’s largest tech companies, and it carries the biggest weighting on the Hang Seng Index.
Its WeChat app has become essential for daily life in Chinese cities in the past few years, used for everything from paying rent to replacing email. Banning WeChat in the U.S. could have far greater implications to cross-border business involving Chinese and American companies, impacting everything from the manufacturing of medical face masks and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s iPhones to the inking contracts of lawyers and bankers.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were down on Friday morning, ending the week on a low over the latest mounting of tensions between the U.S. and China.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued two executive orders earlier in the day banning U.S. transactions with ByteDance, owner of wildly popular video-sharing app TikTok, and Tencent, owner of the WeChat app, with stiff penalties for any U.S. resident or company engaging in any transactions with TikTok, WeChat, or their owners once the orders take effect in 45 days.
Trump’s move comes a day after Secretary of State Michael Pompeo urged U.S. businesses to remove the apps from their stores, and the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets panel recommended tighter disclosure requirements for Chinese companies listed on U.S. exchanges.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 1.45% by 11:31 PM ET (4:31 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component was down 1.23%.
Elsewhere in the Greater China region, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 2.28%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.83% and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.31%
Down Under, the ASX 200 was down 0.71%. The Reserve Bank of Australia issued a warning in its quarterly statement on monetary policy published earlier in the day that the latest lockdown in Melbourne could shave off at least two percentage points from the current quarter’s national growth.
Meanwhile, investor skepticism over the U.S. economic recovery continues to build, with the U.S. Congress still not close to reaching a consensus over the latest stimulus measures. Investors will see whether an agreement is reached before the end-of-the-week deadline later in the day, and before Trump acts on his pledge to issue an executive order if the deadline passes with no agreement.
“It is a possibility that we have a sort of buy the rumor, sell the news on fiscal policy,” Gina Martin Adams, chief equity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, told Bloomberg.
“With a momentum driven market you have to naturally be a bit suspicious, particularly when it is very policy related.”"

A veteran of the Mitsubishi conglomerate, Masuko joined the automaker in 2004, and became president in 2007. He oversaw the creation of the partnership between Mitsubishi and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201) in 2016, which saw Nissan take a controlling stake in the company. 
The 71-year-old would stay on at Mitsubishi as a special adviser, the company said in a statement. It did not specify what Masuko was ailing from.
Masuko was at the helm of Mitsubishi during a 2016 scandal in which the automaker was found to have overstated the mileage on its vehicles. An investigation uncovered slack governance and pressure on resourced-starved engineers as chronic issues at the company.
The scandal was Mitsubishi's third in two decades, and pummelled profits and tarnished the automaker' s brand. At the height of the scandal, Nissan lent its smaller rival a lifeline by offering the company $2.2 billion for a 34% controlling stake.
The deal was agreed between Masuko and then Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn, and brought Mitsubishi in as a junior partner in the Nissan-Renault automaking alliance. 
Masuko later denounced his ties with Ghosn following Ghosn's 2018 arrest in Japan over financial misconduct. Ghosn has denied the charges.
All three members of the alliance are currently mired in financial problems after years of aggressive expansion policies under Ghosn's leadership resulted in falling vehicle sales.

A further drop in global car demand due to the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated these problems, and Mitsubishi, Nissan and  Renault  (PA:RENA) are each bracing for steep annual operating losses this year.

59,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 09:50PM ET</span>","Trump reimposes tariffs on raw Canadian aluminum, Canada promises retaliation","By Jeff Mason and Julie Gordon
CLYDE, Ohio/OTTAWA (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday moved to reimpose 10% tariffs on some Canadian aluminum products to protect U.S. industry from a ""surge"" in imports, angering Ottawa and some U.S. business groups.
Canada pledged retaliation as tensions heightened between the close allies just weeks after a new continental trade deal between the United States, Mexico and Canada came into effect.
During a speech at a Whirlpool Corp (NYSE:WHR) washing machine factory in Ohio to tout his ""America First"" trade agenda, Trump said he signed a proclamation reimposing the ""Section 232"" national security tariffs. The step was ""absolutely necessary to defend our aluminum industry,"" he said.
Ohio is a critical swing state that Trump won in 2016. Polling shows a tight race with Democrat Joe Biden in the state ahead of this year's Nov. 3 presidential election. 
Trump trails the former vice president in national polls and is competing with him for blue-collar working class voters. The tariff announcement could be aimed at showing those voters he intends to fight for their jobs and upend trade policy further if he remains in office.
But some prominent business groups criticized the move as counterproductive and unhelpful to U.S. interests.
The U.S. Trade Representative's office said the 10% tariffs apply to raw, un-alloyed aluminum produced at smelters. The tariffs do not apply to downstream aluminum products. 
""Several months ago, my administration agreed to lift those tariffs in return for a promise from the Canadian government that its aluminum industry would not flood our country with exports and kill all our aluminum jobs, which is exactly what they've done,"" Trump said. ""Canadian aluminum producers have broken their commitment.""
Canada has a natural advantage in primary aluminum production because of its ample supply of hydroelectric power.
Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said the tariffs would hurt workers and regional economies already hit by the coronavirus pandemic and pledged Ottawa would retaliate as it had done in 2018, when Trump first imposed punitive measures on Canadian steel and aluminum.
""In response to the American tariffs, Canada intends to swiftly impose dollar-for-dollar countermeasures,"" Freeland said in a statement.
Freeland - in overall charge of relations with the United States - will formally respond to the tariffs at 11 am (1500 GMT) on Friday, her office said in a statement.
Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), Canada's largest aluminum producer, said the tariffs are ""unfortunate"" as they only increase prices for U.S. consumers and undermine market confidence in secure supplies of aluminium in North America.
""We are working with our U.S. customers to minimize any negative impacts to the integrated supply of aluminium in North America,"" a Rio Tinto spokesman said.
In 2018, Canada slapped tariffs on C$16.6 billion ($12.5 billion) worth of American goods ranging from bourbon to ketchup. Trump lifted the sanctions in 2019.
Trump peppered his remarks with criticism of Biden and predicted ""depression time"" if the Democrat won, higher taxes and put more regulations.
""To be a strong nation, America must be a manufacturing nation and not be led by a bunch of fools. That means protecting our national industrial base,"" Trump said.
Trump has sparred with close U.S. allies over trade throughout his presidency.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce called the move ""a step in the wrong direction"" that would raise costs on companies and consumers.
The Aluminum Association, which says it represents companies that produce 70% of the aluminum and aluminum products shipped in North America, said the move undermined the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement at a time when domestic demand was already down nearly 25% year-to-date.

Michael Bless, chief executive of Century Aluminum (NASDAQ:CENX), one of the few remaining U.S. primary aluminum smelting companies and which lobbied for the tariffs, said the move ""helps to secure continued domestic production of this vital strategic material"".

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) is seen returning to profitability in the first quarter on Tuesday as the value of its listed holdings rise, three months after faltering tech bets via its Vision Fund pushed the group to a record annual loss.
The Japanese conglomerate will likely record operating profit of 171 billion yen ($1.62 billion) for April-June, showed the average of three analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv. That would represent a 75% drop from the last time it made a quarterly profit, in April-June last year.
The performance of the $100 billion Vision Fund's public assets is likely to return SoftBank to profit, said analyst Kirk Boodry at Redex Research. 
Positive news include insurance startup  Lemonade Inc 's (N:LMND) successful July listing. Food delivery service DoorDash has also filed for a listing, testing the market's appetite for money-losing startups. 
Analysts grapple with uncertainty over how the Vision Fund values its portfolio. The fund recorded a 1.9 trillion yen operating shortfall in the year ended March as Chief Executive Masayoshi Son's bets on startups such as shared office space firm WeWork went awry.
GRAPHIC: SoftBank and the Vision Fund https://tmsnrt.rs/39YQo2j
Son has pivoted as plans faltered, jettisoning satellite operator OneWeb and launching a share buy-back funded by asset sales to support SoftBank's share price.
The group has sold down stakes in e-commerce firm  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) and wireless carriers SoftBank Corp (T:9434) and T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS).
It is also looking at selling chip designer Arm, media reported, in a possible break from a firm Son praised as closely aligned with his vision but that has turned money losing under his watch.
SoftBank has struggled to attract capital for a second mega-fund given poor performance of the first and so has been investing its own money.
""With the amount of assets that have been sold, the next logical step is to move forward on Vision Fund 2,"" Boodry said.

The value of SoftBank's assets has returned to pre-coronavirus levels, Son said in June, referring to his preferred measure of success.

""Pompeo has uttered anti-China remarks almost every day, and constantly played tricks to intensify conflicts between China and the U.S., and display Trump administration's toughness toward China,"" the editorial read.
The U.S. State Department on Wednesday published an expanded update of a plan called the ""Clean Network"" calling for telecom companies, cloud service providers, and mobile apps of Chinese origin to be kept out of the United States.
""From the long-term perspective, it's incredible that the U.S. information industry could totally detach from the Chinese market,"" the Global Times wrote.
""It would pose a severe test for U.S. companies if U.S. chips, software, and terminal equipment become irrelevant to the Chinese market.""
If enacted, the plan would mark an escalation in the ongoing tech spat between the United States and China. 
Washington has already banned Shenzhen-based Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HTW.UL] from building out 5G telecommunications networks in the United States.
It is also in the process of forcing a sale of TikTok, a popular social media app created by Beijing-based ByteDance to  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT).

The major problem might be getting enough of it.
Stena Immortal, a medium-range tanker that can transport around 40,000 tons of fuel, made a 10-day voyage from Rotterdam to the U.S. earlier this year. It used a marine biofuel produced by Dutch company GoodFuels.
The fuel costs around $100 a ton more than the blend of marine gasoil and low-sulfur fuel oil that the Stena Immortal usually runs on, and it used 22 tons a day, according to Stena Bulk Chief Executive Officer Erik Hanell. That translates to a 30% higher fuel bill, according to Bloomberg calculations based on marine gasoil prices in Rotterdam.
Given those numbers, the used cooking oil won’t be economic on its own. Rather, the Swedish shipper plans to offer it as part of a carbon-credit scheme. The fuel may not necessarily be used on the vessel carrying the client’s cargo, but on any Stena Bulk ship to reduce the amount of carbon-emitting petroleum used on the customer’s voyage, Hanell said. No contracts have been signed yet, he said.
“We want to be ahead of the curve for shipping,” Hanell said in an interview. The fuel is currently only available at Rotterdam, but Stena is looking for sources of biofuels near other major ports, he said.
Stena Bulk’s efforts are part of a broader shipping industry push to de-carbonize after the International Maritime Organisation pledged to halve greenhouse gas emissions from 2008 levels by 2050. Shipping accounts for around 2.2% of these emissions, the IMO said.
There’s an increasing interest in biodiesels produced from cooking oil and blended with very low-sulfur fuel oil across the shipping industry, said Douglas Raitt, a regional advisory services manager at Lloyd’s Register Singapore Pte. However, high prices, scalability and understanding the true sustainability of these fuels may be hurdles to their uptake, he said.
“Without more specific legislation, the drive to use these ‘low carbon drop-in-now’ fuels may not really take a hold in the market unless the consumer demands it,” Raitt said.
GoodFuels, majority-owned by Finco Fuel Holding BV, also supplies the fuel to several other shippers including Denmark’s Norden A/S, which trialled it on its merchant vessels in 2018. It’s sourced from restaurants and also residual oil from the production of cosmetics or other biofuels across Europe and Asia, said Chief Technology Officer Bart Hellings. Getting enough of the feedstock is the main challenge, he said.
The company is aiming to produce 30,000 to 50,000 tons of the fuel this year, Hellings said. That compares with a total marine fuel market of around 400 million tons a year, according to IHS Markit.
”Looking at the demand side, I can say that we are basically permanently sold out,” Hellings said. To increase production, GoodFuels is looking to build a first-of-its-kind facility that could make shipping fuel from sawdust, he said.

(Reuters) - A California judge signaled on Thursday he might be leaning against a request for a preliminary injunction forcing Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) to classify drivers as employees rather than contractors.
In a hearing in San Francisco Superior Court, the companies said the classification would irreparably undermine their business models, with Lyft's lawyer Rohit Singla saying it ""would make things worse"" for drivers and riders.
Judge Ethan Schulman said he would try to rule within ""days"" on the injunction request from California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and the cities of Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, in their lawsuit filed May 5.
But he suggested caution before rushing into a potentially ""sweeping"" injunction that could affect hundreds of thousands of people.
""I feel like I'm being asked to jump into a body of water without knowing how deep it is, how cold the water is, and what's going to happen when I get in,"" he said.
Uber and Lyft were accused of violating a new state law requiring companies to classify workers as employees if they controlled how workers did their jobs, or the work was part of their normal business. {nL1N2CN1JT]
Several hundred thousand ""gig"" workers, including many at ride-hailing companies and app-based food delivery services, are affected by the law, Assembly Bill 5 (""AB5""), which had broad support from organized labor. It took effect on Jan. 1.
California is Uber's and Lyft's largest U.S. market.
The plaintiffs have said the contractor classification deprives drivers of essential benefits such as a minimum wage, overtime, sick leave, unemployment insurance and workers' compensation insurance.
They have also said it gives Uber and Lyft, which are not profitable, an unfair competitive advantage.
The companies have said most drivers would oppose being classified as employees, and job losses could be significant.
Matthew Goldberg, a lawyer for San Francisco, told Schulman that Uber and Lyft ""dramatically overstated"" the threat of negative fallout.
He also said drivers deserved benefits not available under federal law, even during the coronavirus pandemic.
""The full range of California safety net protections are what we think drivers are entitled to,"" Goldberg said.
Uber's lawyer Theane Evangelis countered that AB5 ""did not outlaw independent work,"" and Uber was not a ""hiring entity"" covered by that law.
""Our platform is nothing like the caricature painted by the plaintiffs,"" she said.

Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates are spending more than $110 million to support a November ballot measure in California, Proposition 22, to classify app-based drivers as contractors.

(Reuters) - T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc added more monthly phone subscribers than expected in the second quarter and said on Thursday it has overtaken rival AT&T Inc as the second-largest wireless provider in the United States.
T-Mobile got a boost as more people used its services to stay connected and work remotely during coronavirus lockdowns, sending shares up 5.4% to $114.02 in extended trading. 
The company said it has overtaken AT&T across postpaid, in which customers pay a recurring monthly bill, and prepaid phones - customers paying for service in advance.
T-Mobile reported 98.3 million customers in those categories, while AT&T had nearly 93 million postpaid and prepaid subscribers in its second quarter.
Subscriber figures between U.S. carriers can be difficult to compare given the variety of plans offered. AT&T declined to comment.
T-Mobile added 253,000 net new phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, compared with 710,000 additions a year earlier.
Analysts had expected 169,200 new subscribers, according to research firm FactSet. 
The carrier, which completed its merger with Sprint in April, reported the quarterly results as a combined company for the first time. 
T-Mobile said during the earnings call with analysts that more than 10% of network traffic from Sprint's postpaid customers have been migrated to T-Mobile.
The carrier has sought to attract budget-constrained customers with its cheaper phone plans after the pandemic left millions of people in the United States unemployed. 
T-Mobile's second-quarter net income fell to $110 million, or 9 cents per share, from $939 million, or $1.09 per share, a year earlier, due to Sprint merger costs.

Revenue jumped 61% to $17.67 billion, above analysts' estimates of $17.61 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

69,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 04:38PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: 3 Things to Watch for August 7,"By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com  --   The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved higher on Thursday, along with the other indexes, as investors and traders await an economic relief package from lawmakers. 
Politicians are working on the next fiscal stimulus package, but the timeline remains somewhat murky ahead of a self-imposed Friday deadline. The big sticking point is whether or not to resume the enhanced $600-a-week unemployment benefit that was rolled out in March but has since lapsed.   
Investors still love megacap tech stocks, which just keep going strong, and pushed the NASDAQ Composite to its first close above 11,000. Energy stocks, on the other hand, weakened on lower oil prices. 
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1. Economic indicators
Signs of a slowdown in the recovery may show up in July's non-farm payrolls, which are expected to come at 1.58 million. That's less than one-third of the previous month's 4.8 million. The level of unemployment may have fallen slightly to 10.5% from the previous 11.1%. The jobs report is due out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
2. Earnings run
 DISH Network  Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) is expected to report earnings per share of 59 cents on sales of $3.14 billion for the quarter. Shares have almost doubled since March. 
 Icahn Enterprises  LP (NASDAQ:IEP) should report earnings per share of 45 cents on revenue of $2.4 billion. Results were hammered last quarter, when the company reported a loss per share of $6.34 compared to the expected 79-cent loss.
Beer maker  Kirin Holdings Co Ltd  (OTC:KNBWY)is set to report earnings per share of 27 cents on sales of $4.17 billion. Cheers.
3. Somewhere in Middle America
You'll have to wait another day (it's Saturday, not Friday) but all eyes will be on Omaha to see what else Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway  B (NYSE:BRKb) plans for its $137 billion cash pile. Berkshire scooped up Dominion Energy Inc (NYSE:D) assets last month and $2.1 billion of Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) stock more recently. Investors will be curious to see if Buffett's conglomerate is buying back its own stock.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares on Wall Street shrugged off a sluggish start and closed higher on Thursday, with the Nasdaq ending the session above 11,000 for the first time as investors hoped for a new fiscal stimulus package.
Tech and tech-related heavyweight stocks such as Apple (O:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) <.FB.O> helped pace gains on the indexes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq clinched a new record high in early trading, and closed above the 11,000-mark for the first time after initially climbing above it on Wednesday. 
The benchmark S&P 500 and blue-chip Dow were about 1% and 7% away from their own peaks scaled in February.
""Markets have been incredibly resilient, there is a big fear of missing out and it is the old stalwarts, the technology leaders that keep driving the market higher,"" said Sal Bruno, chief investment officer at IndexIQ in New York. 
Economic data released on Thursday painted a mixed picture as U.S. Labor Department numbers showed a first fall in jobless claims in three weeks, although a separate report showed a 54% surge in job cuts announced by employers in July. The data comes ahead of the government payrolls report on Friday.
Investors are looking to the next fiscal aid package to further cope with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday Republicans and Democrats remained far apart over what to include in another wave of relief.
Senate Republicans have been told that negotiators have until Friday to reach agreement. ""If there's not a deal by Friday, there won't be a deal,"" Republican Senator Roy Blunt told reporters on Wednesday.
""I’m not sure people are taking the drop dead date seriously because most people probably view that as a negotiating ploy and people realize the government is going to have to do something,"" said Bruno.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 185.66 points, or 0.68%, to 27,387.18, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 21.39 points, or 0.64%, to 3,349.16 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 109.67 points, or 1%, to 11,108.07.
Ahead of the deadline for a new stimulus package, the focus now shifts to July jobs report Friday morning, with analysts forecasting a rise of 1.58 million new jobs last month and a decline in the unemployment rate to 10.5%. 
As major averages continue to rally off their March lows, powered by heaps of fiscal and monetary stimulus and better-than-feared second-quarter earnings, the Dow and S&P notched their fifth straight daily gain, with the Nasdaq climbing for a seventh consecutive session. 
The corporate results season is now in its final stretch, with about 424 S&P 500 firms having reported so far. Earnings have been about 22.5% above analyst expectations, according to IBES Refinitiv data, the highest on record since 1994.
Communication services (SPLRCL) and technology (SPLRCT) were the best performing of the 11 major S&P sectors on the day. 
Among individual shares, Becton Dickinson and Co (N:BDX) dropped after posting quarterly revenue below estimates as delayed elective procedures during coronavirus-led lockdowns squeezed demand for some of its devices. 
 Western Digital  (O:WDC) sank after the hard drive maker reported weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue and forecast a soft current quarter.
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (N:BMY) gained after the drugmaker raised its annual profit forecast on hopes of a recovery in demand for its hospital-administered drugs.

ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc (O:VIACA) jumped after beating analysts' estimates for quarterly revenue due to high demand for streaming.

Uber Tech announced a loss per share of $1.02 on revenue of $2.24 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated a loss of 80 cents a share on revenue of $2.09 billion.

Uber Eats, however, benefited from the pandemic-led surge in food delivery demand, with gross bookings up 106% for the quarter compared to last year.
Monthly active platform consumers, a tally of each consumer who completed a ride or ordered a meal, declined 44% to 55 million in the quarter.
Despite the wider loss, the company said it had continued confidence that it ""will achieve adjusted EBITDA profitability before the end of 2021.”

77,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>","Airbus shareholders in U.S. file fraud lawsuit over disclosures, corruption probes","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) was sued on Thursday by shareholders who accused the European planemaker of securities fraud for misleading them about its ability to avoid and manage corruption accusations over nearly 4-1/2 years.
The proposed class action was filed by shareholder Andrew Kornecki in the federal court in Newark, New Jersey, and seeks unspecified damages for Airbus' alleged violations of U.S. securities laws.
Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury and his predecessor, Tom Enders, as well as Chief Financial Officer Dominik Asam and his predecessor, Harald Wilhelm, were also named as defendants.
Spokesmen for Airbus did not immediately respond to requests for comment on behalf of all defendants.
Airbus agreed in January to a $4 billion settlement of corruption charges by U.S., U.K. and French authorities stemming from more than one dozen countries, and which a U.S. judge called a ""pervasive and pernicious bribery scheme.""
In July, the U.K.'s Serious Fraud Office announced corruption charges against Airbus' GPT Special Project Management unit and three people over a contract to provide communications services for the Saudi Arabian National Guard.
Thursday's complaint accused Airbus of concealing shortfalls in its compliance controls, exposing it to greater risk of probes on whether bribery and corruption helped boost revenue and profit.
It said this resulted in various regulatory actions and settlements that caused Airbus' stock price to fall.
The complaint seeks damages for holders of Airbus' American depository receipts from Feb. 24, 2016 to July 30, 2020.
It is common in the United States for shareholders to sue companies over investment losses they attribute to false, misleading or inadequate disclosures.
The case is Kornecki v Airbus SE et al, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No., 20-10084.

82,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 01:54PM ET</span>","Calpers CIO Exit Followed Judgment Lapse, Controller Says","(Bloomberg) -- The California State Controller said Ben Meng’s departure from the California Public Employees’ Retirement System followed an unspecified “lapse in both judgment and adherence to standard conflict-of-interest policies.”
Betty Yee issued a statement Thursday after Calpers announced the chief investment officer’s exit, citing his wish to focus on his health and family. Yee didn’t elaborate.
“I have called for an emergency board meeting to discuss this situation, review these policies, the CEO’s oversight and implementation of these policies, and any additional safeguards necessary to ensure this does not happen again,” said Yee.
A spokeswoman for Calpers declined to comment. Meng didn’t return an email seeking comment.
Meng’s departure, after less than two years in the role, marks the end of a volatile period for him and Calpers. During his short tenure, the pension fund produced lackluster investment returns and Meng was targeted by accusations that he had links to the Chinese government.
Calpers reported a return of 4.7% for the 2019-2020 fiscal year, short of the annual 7% gain needed to meet its long-term liabilities for a second year running. The increase was the lowest since the 12 months ended June 30, 2016, when the fund rose 0.6%.
In the statement early Thursday, Calpers said Meng had helped the fund beat its “benchmark of 4.3% during a time of extreme financial market volatility sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.” Later in the day, the organization thanked Meng for his service and said he “put us on a positive path forward.”
Earlier this year, Meng, a U.S. citizen who grew up in China, was accused by Republican Congressman Jim Banks of being a tool for the Chinese government, funneling American money into Chinese hands.
The allegations centered around a three-year stint Meng did from 2015 helping oversee China’s $3 trillion in currency reserves. During that time, he was deputy CIO of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE.
Meng was hired for his job at the Chinese fund via a government recruitment plan known as the Thousand Talents Program. That, according to Banks, likely includes a lifelong mission to support Chinese authorities.
Meng rejected Banks’s claims and said his connections with Thousand Talents ended when he left SAFE. He was supported by prominent Wall Street investors including Oaktree Capital Group LLC founder Howard Marks, and Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive officer of private equity firm Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc.
Calpers manages pension money for about two million current and former California public servants. According to its own research, it needs to alter its approach or it’s likely to come up shy of its target over the long haul.

“We are approaching holiday cautiously,” Louvet said in an interview. “We really want to make sure we’re aligning inventory to expected demand. We don’t want to be in a situation where we need to discount.”
With Black Friday just over 100 days away, the urgency is palpable. The holiday season represents about 20% of annual retail sales each year, and stores need some relief after enduring months of turmoil as the health crisis roiled the world economy.
At least 25 major retailers have gone bankrupt this year, including household names like Neiman Marcus Group Inc., J.C. Penney Co. and Lord & Taylor. Many retailers of non-essential goods, meanwhile, are under intense pressure as they cope with falling sales.
Three Scenarios
Bergh said he’s never experienced such uncertainty going into the holidays in his 30-year career in retail. Currently, Covid-19 has yet to be contained and state restrictions on business are fluctuating. For the first time ever, he doesn’t have a reliable forecast, so he’s running the multi-billion dollar denim business based on three scenarios: high, medium and low, each with its own set of assumptions on the economic and viral trajectory.
Department stores are also trying to manage their inventories to avoid a buildup of products that later prove hard to sell. Macy’s Inc. took a $300 million write-down on inventory in the first quarter of the year, which included the initial phases of the Covid-19 shutdowns. Executives said on a call with analysts last month that, with so much uncertainty, the business needs to be conservative with inventory and remain flexible.
“Everything is on the table right now,” said Macy’s CEO Jeff Gennette.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Daniel Loeb's hedge fund Third Point (NYSE:TPRE) LLC took new positions in technology companies including  Alibaba  (N:BABA) and Amazon (O:AMZN) and reported strong returns in the second quarter after he took back the reins as sole chief investment officer in May.
The billionaire investor who founded Third Point a quarter century ago also told clients in a letter seen by Reuters that he bought a stake in The Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) where streaming services are creating the company's ""biggest market opportunity ever.""
""Disney's dominant position in the global media landscape sets up the company to take a meaningful chunk of the growing DTC streaming market, shown by the early success
of Disney+,"" the letter said. Loeb said revenue could grow to $500 billion over a growing market of 750 million broadband homes outside of China.
Loeb said Third Point bought great companies at attractive prices and is betting on Disney which is in the throes of a big change. The investments reflect change at Third Point as well where Loeb, who founded the firm 25 years ago, took back sole control of the portfolio in May following double-digit losses earlier in the year amid panic selling sparked by the Coronavirus.
The firm's Third Point Offshore portfolio climbed 10.8% in the second quarter and gained more in July to trim the year-to-date loss to 3.7% at the end of July.
The firm also said that it took a new equity position in U.S. utility Pacific Gas & Electric as it was emerged bankruptcy through a PIPE transaction. Loeb said that while shares have traded lower, he expects the sharp discount to shrink as the company finds new investors and a permanent chief executive officer.
Third Point's investment in British insurer Prudential (NYSE:PUK), where it is calling for a breakup of its U.S. and Asia operations, ranked as one of the quarter's biggest winners. Investors will better appreciate the two firms as pure-play operations, Loeb said.
Months after having shifted a chunk of the portfolio into credit after the Coronavirus sell-off, Loeb said that he still expects to see opportunities in structured credit. Since March, Loeb said the firm has ""alternat(ed) between investing in securities and loans."" He said he has a negative view of commercial real estate financials given occupancy and cash flow.

Loeb also said that firm veteran Scott Leslie has been named Director of Equity research three months after he said that Munib Islam, who had been his co-chief investment officer, was leaving the firm.

The aircraft were all narrow-body jets, highlighting a dearth of demand for the industry's biggest models, which last month prompted Airbus to trim A350 production for a second time.
The month's deliveries included 47 A320neo-family jets.
Airbus also scored its first orders in three months as it sold two A320neos to an undisclosed customer and two A321neos to Lufthansa Technik, the modification and repairs business of German carrier Lufthansa (DE:LHAG).
So far in 2020, Airbus has delivered 245 jets and sold 369, or 302 after cancellations.
Demand for aircraft has been crippled by the coronavirus crisis and its heavy impact on air travel.
Airbus is boosting deliveries on a monthly basis despite the industry's worst crisis as it negotiates deals with airlines.
But although deliveries are rising compared to the trough seen in April, several bankers and analysts have questioned how many of the aircraft are being placed into service as airlines struggle to save cash. Some are said to go straight to storage.
Airbus has issued default notices and threatened to sue airlines that refuse to collect planes already built while showing flexibility in deferring jets not yet in the factory..

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced on Thursday it had fined  World Acceptance  (NASDAQ:WRLD) Corp, a consumer loan company, $21.7 million for paying bribes in Mexico.
The SEC said in a statement that the company's Mexican subsidiary paid over $4 million in bribes to Mexican government and union officials in exchange for business lending to government employees.
The South Carolina-based company agreed to the penalty without admitting or denying guilt. The company agreed to overhaul its internal operations, as well as pay $17.8 million in disgorgement, nearly $2 million in interest, and a $2 million penalty.
“This long-running bribe scheme did not happen in a vacuum. Through a lack of adequate internal accounting controls and a culture that undermined its internal audit and compliance functions, World Acceptance Corporation created the perfect environment for illicit activity to occur for nearly a decade,” Charles Cain, a senior SEC enforcement official, said in a statement. 
The SEC said that the company's Mexican subsidiary would deposit money into bank accounts linked to the officials or distribute bags of cash. The expenses were then recorded as legitimate business expenses. 
The SEC charged that the company's internal controls were insufficient to detect the activity, and management ""lacked the appropriate tone"" on compliance.

In a statement, the company's general counsel, Luke Umstetter, said he was pleased to have resolved the issue and that the company has addressed those past issues.

Earnings per share of 44 cents compared to the expected loss per share of 58 cents on sales of $294 million versus the average forecast of $197 million, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.

98,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 10:45AM ET</span>",City of London faces messy future with the EU,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's future access to European Union financial markets is looking increasingly patchy, as Brussels tries to limit the activities which can be carried out from London, prompting more business and jobs to cross the channel.
The City of London's unfettered access to its biggest customer - worth around 26 billion pounds ($34 billion) annually - ends on Dec. 31 when Brexit transition arrangements expire.
While London is expected to remain Europe's biggest financial centre with trillion-dollar foreign exchange trading and derivatives clearing staying put for now, recent moves by the EU to limit other trading activities to within the bloc have dashed the finance industry's hopes of a wider agreement.
Central to the argument is whether Brussels deems UK financial rules ""equivalent"" or aligned with the EU's. Britain says this should be straightforward given both sides have the same rules at the outset.
But last month Brussels said it wouldn't allow banks in London to offer wholesale investment services to EU investors, piling pressure on the City to shift more activity to continental hubs. 
""Firms need to carry on doing their 'no deal planning'...it will make cross border business outwards from the UK dependent on country by country analysis and so complicated,"" said Jonathan Herbst, a financial services lawyer at Norton Rose Fulbright.
ING and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) have since announced they will move more trading jobs out of London. 
""Selling financial services from the UK to EU clients will not be allowed,"" BNP Paribas said last week as it announced it would create 400 new jobs in the EU.
Around 330 financial firms had already relocated some business from Britain to the EU, affecting 5,000 staff by October last year, ahead of a short COVID-19 induced pause, said think tank New Financial.
The Bank of England weighed in on Thursday, warning Brussels' move risked disruption to cross-border banking and derivatives trading come January, even if equivalence in other areas was agreed.
""The best that can be expected is a few equivalence agreements by the end of the year,"" said Karel Lannoo, CEO of think tank CEPS in Brussels.
WEAPONISATION
Another big unknown is whether EU investors can continue trading EU listed shares on platforms run by Cboe, Turquoise and Aquis in London, rather than on a platform inside the bloc.
All three have opened EU hubs as insurance, with final decisions on equivalence not expected until a wider free trade agreement that includes fisheries and other sensitive sectors is hammered out, something that is likely to drag on until at least October.
Aquis is prepared for the worst case scenario of having to switch trading to its new Paris unit, its head of regulation David Attew said.
The European Commission, which wants to deepen the bloc's own capital market, said the EU would grant access when it was in its own interests to do so.
The ""weaponisation"" of equivalence so far was a taster of what's to come, a UK banking official said. ""Are you going to be comfortable with building a business model on that?""
Britain also needs to decide what access EU firms will have to its financial markets. 
""For business coming in, it all depends on how the UK authorities react to a world of what is effectively one way access,"" Herbst said.
Britain's finance ministry has said it is ready to reach comprehensive findings of equivalence as soon as the EU is able to clarify its own position.
But Conor Lawlor, Capital Markets and Brexit Director at banking lobby UK Finance, said lenders should focus on getting ""match fit"" for Britain's updated regulatory regime, which weaves EU financial rules into UK law, to avoid snarls next January.

""The industry continues to plan on the basis that there will be a minimalist approach to equivalence decisions,"" Lawlor said.

100,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 10:30AM ET</span>","ViacomCBS beats estimates for revenue, profit on streaming boost","By Neha Malara and Kenneth Li
(Reuters) - ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc's (O:VIACA) quarterly results demonstrated a level of resilience, buoyed by demand for streaming, even as the coronavirus pandemic ravaged media businesses globally, sending shares up 5% at the open.
Although it logged a 12% drop in revenue, dragged down by a steep decline in advertising, the fall was less than expected and ViacomCBS Chief Executive Bob Bakish told analysts the second quarter was the bottom for ad declines. 
Revenue and profit surpassed Wall Street expectations.
The company declined to give financial guidance for the year but said that advertising trends had improved since April. 
""June was strong, and we're encouraged by what we're seeing so far in Q3,"" Bakish said. ""We believe this reflects not only economic optimism for a gradual recovery but also the power of our portfolio and the significant value we bring to advertisers.""
Stay-at-home orders have boosted demand for streaming services in the absence of live events and theater releases, with Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) reporting strong streaming subscriber additions.
ViacomCBS U.S. streaming subscribers reached 16.2 million in the second quarter, up from 13.5 million in the prior quarter. The company said it now expects to reach 18 million customers by the end of the year. 
To fuel growth, the company is preparing to launch new streaming platforms by early next year to consolidate programming across the portfolio. It will also launch an international subscription streaming service in 2021 in Australia, Latin America and the Nordics, Bakish said. 
""While advertising businesses are suffering amid the pandemic, the companies with strong streaming products are benefiting from the stay-at-home environment,"" said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com. ""Since the merger, ViacomCBS has built an attractive streaming portfolio which is helping the company to weather this downturn.""
Streaming and digital video revenue, which includes subscriptions to CBS All Access and Showtime, rose 25% to $489 million in the quarter, ViacomCBS said.
Advertising fell 27% across the company as marketers slashed spending and as live sports disappeared from TV screens.
Revenue from its filmed entertainment division, which includes Paramount Pictures, fell 26% to $647 million, hurt by a near complete absence of theatrical sales as cinemas shut down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. 
The company said the fees it collected from cable and satellite operators rose 2% to $2.19 billion in the quarter. 
Revenue fell 12% to $6.28 billion in the second quarter but exceeded estimates of $6.27 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.25 per share, beating analysts' estimates of $0.93 per share, according to IBES data.

102,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 10:09AM ET</span>",Busted Retailers Use Bankruptcy to Break Leases by the Thousands,"(Bloomberg) -- With the pandemic intensifying the plight of U.S. retailers, companies from J. Crew Group Inc. to the owner of Ann Taylor are using Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings to quickly get out of costly, long-term leases and shutter thousands of stores.
By seeking court protection, firms like Neiman Marcus Group Inc. and the parent company of Men’s Wearhouse avoid the headache of protracted negotiations with individual landlords. But the moves threaten to upend huge swaths of the real estate market and the half-trillion dollar market for commercial mortgage-backed securities.
“This is now black-letter law -- a debtor can cram down a landlord,” said Melanie Cyganowski, a former bankruptcy judge who’s now a partner at law firm Otterbourg PC. “If this becomes a tsunami of retailers rejecting their leases, it’s going to trigger another part of the sea change -- the mortgages held by the landlords.”
As bankrupt firms like J.C. Penney Co. and Brooks Brothers Group Inc. look to jettison leases, landlords are already feeling the consequences. CBL & Associates Properties Inc., owner of more than 100 shopping centers in the U.S., is preparing its own bankruptcy filing after rent collections cratered. And 16% of retail property loans bundled into CMBS were delinquent in July, according to research firm Trepp.
Filing Surge
At least 25 major retailers have filed for bankruptcy this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The most recent additions include Tailored Brands (OTC:TLRDQ) Inc., owner of Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank, which is seeking to close about a third of its more than 1,200 stores, and Lord & Taylor parent company Le Tote, which said it could shut down all of the department store’s remaining locations.
“It’s economical, it’s efficient and it allows retailers to rationalize their footprint quickly,” said Fred Ringel, co-chair of the business finance and restructuring practice at the law firm Robinson Brog Leinwand Greene Genovese & Gluck P.C. Ringel, who works for landlords, said he’s busier than ever renegotiating leases and in some cases persuading tenants to forgo cancellations and stay under modified terms.
Take vitamin retailer GNC Holdings Inc. It operates hundreds of stores across the country, mostly in strip malls. Since filing for bankruptcy in June, GNC has asked to reject at least 500 leases, along with more than 50 franchise agreements and subleases, according to court records.

Meanwhile, CEC Entertainment Inc., the parent company of Chuck E. Cheese, is negotiating with its landlords after its June bankruptcy filing. It won court approval this week to defer rent payments as it evaluates which locations it wants to keep open.
And the U.S. unit of Spanish retailer Desigual said it was forced to file after struggling to get rent abatements from its landlords. “Unfortunately, DUSA had little success in getting landlords to realize the new reality that most tenants -- especially those in retail -- cannot afford to pay pre-Covid-19 rent,” a representative for the firm said in court papers.
Landlords, in turn, have their own mortgages to worry about, which were also underwritten with pre-pandemic assumptions about rent collections. Amid the stress, Barry Sternlicht’s Starwood Capital Group missed payments on securitized debt linked to five shopping malls, and Saks owner Hudson’s Bay Co. also skipped interest due on certain CMBS. Delinquencies on retail mortgages bundled into bonds climbed to 16% in July, from 3.8% in January, according to Trepp.
Tenant Power
Some retailers can work out rent abatements and other lease modifications including terminations without filing for bankruptcy. However, negotiating hundreds of deals outside of a court process can be challenging, especially for big retail chains that may have hundreds of landlords to deal with, said Navin Nagrani, an executive vice president at Hilco Real Estate.
Bankruptcy flips the power from landlords to tenants. Retailers can legally reject a swath of leases in court, sometimes leaving building owners to collect just pennies on the dollar. Firms can also sell off favorable contracts to other parties to help repay creditors.
“Sometimes a bankruptcy is the most advantageous way to get out of those leases,” Nagrani said.
As many as 25,000 stores are expected to close in the U.S. in 2020, mostly in shopping malls, according to Coresight Research. Department stores and fashion boutiques are seen as the most endangered.
More than half of mall department stores could close for good by the end of 2021, according to an April report from real estate research firm Green Street Advisors. J.C. Penney said last month that it would shutter more than 150 locations, while Neiman Marcus plans to pull out of New York’s Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Yards development and close three other U.S. locations.
The closures so far are “just the tip of the iceberg,” said Garrick Brown, head of Americas retail research for Cushman & Wakefield. Over the next two years, at least 1.2 billion of square feet -- 10% of already-occupied store real estate -- will go vacant, he said. “Worst-case scenario, that could double.”

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets inched higher on Thursday as a stronger-than-expected set of jobless claims numbers for last week failed to ignite any meaningful increase in risk appetite.
By 10:10 AM ET (1410 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 63 points or 0.2% at 27,246 points, while the S&P 500  rose less than 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite edged 0.1% higher.
Earlier, the Labor Department had reported that initial claims for unemployment benefits had fallen to their lowest level since March at only 1.18 million. The number of continuing claims also undershot expectations.
However, analysts pointed out that the total number of people claiming benefits, which include the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, actually rose by nearly half a million to 31.31 million. With nearly 13 million people on the PUA program, there is considerable fear that the interruption in benefits caused by lawmakers’ haggling over how to extend them in the future will lead to a real drop in household consumption and another new wave of layoffs.
The market also failed to react markedly by comments from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who told CNBC that he still expected a deal over the relief package in the near future because both sides agree that ""the economy needs a lift.""
Among individual companies,  Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC) stock fell 16.6% after the hard drive maker gave disappointing guidance for the rest of the year, while video streaming device maker  Roku  's (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock likewise fell 6.1% after it warned that advertising spending on its platform could take over a year to recover to pre-pandemic levels.
Website maker Wix.Com (NASDAQ:WIX) stock also fell 10% after swinging to a loss in the second quarter, as it spent more heavily to meet the challenges of fast-growing demand. 
Among the gainers,  Plug Power  (NASDAQ:PLUG) stock rose 14.5% after the fuel cell maker said its net loss more than halved from a year ago in the second quarter. It also upheld its guidance on deliveries and revenue for the full year. The stock has returned to favor in recent days, rising nearly 50% since the start of the month after a month of gentle declines. Volumes are still nowhere near where they were during the first leg of its rally back in June, however.
Elsewhere, gold mining companies were struggling to squeeze any more gains out of the yellow metal's rally. Newmont Goldcorp (NYSE:NEM) stock rose 0.6%, while Barrick Gold  (NYSE:GOLD) stock fell 0.3%, even as the metal surged 1.6% to a new record high over $2,060 an ounce.

The U.S. drugmaker said it was expecting demand for its drugs from new patients as well as for its products administered by doctors to recover in the third quarter and stabilize in the fourth quarter.
 Pfizer  and  Merck & Co  (N:MRK) are also expecting medical visits by patients to return to normal by the fourth quarter.
Bristol now expects full-year adjusted profit of $6.10 to $6.25 per share, up from its prior forecast of $6 to $6.20 per share.
Shares of the company rose nearly 4% in trading before the bell after the company's second-quarter adjusted profit of $1.63 per share beat analysts' average estimate by 15 cents. 
Bristol's total revenue also rose 61.5% to $10.13 billion, above estimate of $9.97 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, mainly due to its $74 billion buyout of Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG). 
Sales of its cancer drug Opdivo, however, fell 9% to $1.65 billion, roughly in line with analysts' estimates. Sales of Eliquis rose 6% to $2.16 billion.
Bristol reported a net loss of $85 million, or 4 cents per share, in the quarter ended June 30, compared with a profit of $1.43 billion, or 87 cents per share, mainly due to amortization of assets and higher costs from the Celgene deal.
On Wednesday, a court upheld the company's patents on blockbuster blood thinner Eliquis, which its shares with Pfizer Inc (N:PFE).

LONDON (Reuters) - Stocks slipped on Thursday as investors waited for signs of agreement on a U.S. aid package to counter damage from the coronavirus pandemic, with poor corporate earnings reports also weighing on European shares.
The Euro STOXX 600 fell 1%, with London's FTSE shedding 1.6% as the pound jumped to a five-month high. The Bank of England had earlier left interest rates unchanged, saying it was still weighing the risks of cutting rates below zero to revive growth.
Paris fell 1.2% and Frankfurt 0.9% after worse-than-expected corporate earnings reports. 
Europe's mining index fell 2.4% after Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) scrapped its dividend. AXA slumped 4.4% after it dropped its 2020 earnings target and said it wouldn't make additional payouts to shareholders in the fourth quarter.
Almost 60% of STOXX 600 companies that have reported results so far have topped lowered estimates, according to Refinitiv data. In a typical quarter, half beat estimates.
S&P 500 futures turned negative.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, fell 0.2% and was on course to end three straight days of gains. 
Markets are waiting for cues on the shape of a U.S. fiscal recovery package, currently subject to political wrangling in Washington, said Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. 
Top congressional Democrats and White House officials appeared to harden their stances on the relief plan on Wednesday, with few hints of compromise or that an unemployment benefit as generous as $600 a week could be reinstated.
""Stocks are really struggling to find direction until we know the outcome of those negotiations,"" Gimber said. ""The clock is ticking for U.S. policymakers to get something done.""
Fears that economic recoveries across major economies are diverging have been playing out in currency markets, with the dollar's two-year supremacy at risk.
With figures on jobless claims in the U.S. labour market looming at 1230 GMT, the dollar fell in early trading to a two-year low as investors weighed whether the U.S. economic recovery from the coronavirus hit was lagging other major economies. 
By late morning it had recovered and was last up 0.1% at 92.914.
The euro climbed to its highest against the dollar since May 2018 before giving up its gains. It was last down 0.2% at $1.18430.
That weak dollar, strong euro trend is set to continue into next year, a Reuters poll showed, on expectations the U.S. economic recovery is flagging, especially compared with Europe.
BoE STEADY 
The British pound rose to a five-month high against the dollar after the Bank of England left interest rates at 0.1% and warned about possible risks from taking rates below zero.
Negative rates ""are part of our toolbox ... But at the moment we do not have a plan to use them,"" Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey told reporters. 
The BOE offered less grim predictions on unemployment and GDP contraction than it had in May, but it said the British economy would not recover to its end-2019 size until the end of next year. In May, it had said that milestone would be reached during the second half of 2021.
""More important for pound performance in the near-term were the BoE's comments on the likelihood of further policy easing later this year,"" analysts at MUFG wrote. ""The comments did not send a strong signal that the BoE is moving closer to adopting negative rates. 

Sterling was last up 0.4% at $1.3170.

BEIJING/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Shenzhen Kangtai Biological Products (SZ:300601) will produce AstraZeneca Plc's (L:AZN) potential COVID-19 vaccine in mainland China, the British drugmaker said on Thursday, its first deal to supply one of the world's most populous countries.
The deal underscores Astra's frontrunner position in a global race to deliver an effective vaccine, given that Chinese ventures are leading at least eight of the 26 global vaccine development projects currently testing on humans.
Under the agreement Shenzhen Kangtai, one of China's top vaccine makers, will ensure it has annual production capacity of at least 100 million doses of the experimental shot AZD1222, which AstraZeneca co-developed with researchers at Oxford University, by the end of this year, AstraZeneca said.
The Shenzhen-based company must have capacity to produce at least 200 million doses by the end of next year as part of the exclusive framework agreement, its statement on the Chinese social media site WeChat said.
The two companies will also explore the possibility of cooperation on the vaccine candidate in other markets, AstraZeneca said.
They did not respond to requests for further comment. 
There are no approved vaccines for COVID-19, the highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus.
AstraZeneca has signed manufacturing deals globally including the United States, Britain, South Korea and Brazil, resulting in a target to make more than 2 billion doses of the vaccine.
For China, this marks another major deal to secure access to a COVID-19 vaccine developed by a foreign company as the country's other potential shots under development enter late stage of human trials.
Other collaborations between Chinese and Western players include a tie-up between Germany's BioNTech (O:BNTX) and Fosun (SS:600196) (HK:2196), as well as one between Inovio Pharma (O:INO) and Beijing Advaccine Biotechnology.
The scramble for treatments and vaccines to curb the pandemic has boosted global pharmaceutical companies' shares, particularly those in China.
Shenzhen Kangtai's market value has surged almost 90% to about $20 billion over the past month, with shares hitting all-time highs on Tuesday. The Shenzhen-listed stock was down 10% on Thursday.
In 2019, the company, whose main products are vaccines for Hepatitis B, flu and measles and rubella, reported net profits of 574.5 million yuan ($82.68 million) on revenue of 1.94 billion.

Demand for transportation fuels and lubricants stabilized and improved late in the quarter as compared to the end of the first quarter of 2020, the company said in a statement. 
Refiners are witnessing a gradual recovery in fuel demand worldwide as economic activity resumes and lockdowns ease.
The company's net loss attributable to shareholders was $176.7 million, or $1.09 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30 compared with a profit of $196.9 million, or $1.15 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company posted a loss of 25 cents per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of a loss of 55 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
HollyFrontier recorded impairment charges of $429.5 million related to its Cheyenne Refinery and Petro-Canada Lubricants business in the quarter.
The company in June had said it would cease refinery operations at Cheyenne in July and cut around 200 jobs to curb costs.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to weaken at the open Thursday, consolidating after gains in the previous session, with investors wary amid few signs of progress over the next virus relief bill and ahead of the latest employment data.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), US 500 Futures traded 8 points, or 0.3%, lower, Nasdaq 100 Futures down 29 points, or 0,3%. The Dow Futures contract fell 70 points, or 0.3%. 
On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4% to hit a new 1-month high. The S&P 500 index gained 0.6%, and the NASDAQ Composite index climbed 0.5%, just shy of 11,000, to post its 31st closing high this year.
The focus remains on Washington amid political stalemate over the shape and size of the next U.S. fiscal recovery package, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to float the idea of extending unemployment benefits and eviction protection by executive order.
""Stocks are really struggling to find direction until we know the outcome of those negotiations,"" said Hugh Gimber, global markets strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, reported by Reuters. ""The clock is ticking for U.S. policymakers to get something done.""
The politicians were also given a nudge by Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester Wednesday, when she called for more fiscal help from Congress as “downside risks” to the economy were on the rise.
Evidence of those risks came in the form of the ADP employment data Wednesday, which showed that payroll gains at U.S. companies slowed sharply in July, suggesting the pickup in coronavirus cases is putting a brake on the job market.
More jobs numbers are due later Thursday, in the form of the weekly initial claims release. Friday sees the release of the monthly official employment report. 
Meanwhile, the earnings season continues, but the airlines sector looks likely to be in the spotlight after President Trump expressed support for a proposal for another $25 billion in federal aid to support the industry in keeping people employed.
Oil prices edged lower Thursday, consolidating after hitting five-month highs the previous session on the back of lower-than-expected U.S. crude stocks.
The Energy Information Administration reported a much bigger than expected drop in U.S. crude stockpiles late Wednesday - a 7.37 million-barrel draw in crude oil inventories, more than double the 3 million-barrel draw forecast.
U.S. Crude futures traded 1.1% lower at $41.73 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent fell 0.5% to $44.95.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.6% to $2,050.20, posting new all-time highs, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1837, down 0.2%.

The company's RevPAR - a key performance measure for the hotel industry - fell 81.0% in the second quarter.
Hilton's results come amid rising coronavirus cases in the United States and an extended disruption to travel from COVID-19 leading to tighter corporate travel budgets, an increasing pace of group cancellations and dearth of new group bookings.
The pandemic has forced Hilton and other hotel operators including Marriott International Inc (O:MAR) and  Hyatt Hotels Corp  (N:H) to lay off or furlough thousands of employees as bookings plunged.
Hilton reported a net loss attributable to stockholders of $430 million, or $1.55 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, compared with net income of $260 million, or $0.89 per share, a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, Hilton posted a loss of $0.61 per share.

The country, which has recorded at least 158,561 COVID-19 deaths and about 4.8 million cases so far, is running only 800,000 diagnostic coronavirus tests daily, while 6-10 million tests per day are needed, by various estimates.
Revenue in Becton's diagnostics systems unit rose nearly 19% to $184 million, the company said.
Becton Dickinson, which sells a variety of COVID-19 tests, said it was working to ramp up testing capacity for many of them in the event of a second wave of infections in the fall.
The company also benefited from orders received from the United States, UK and Canada for millions of its syringes and needles for COVID-19 vaccination programs.
Excluding items, the company earned $2.20 per share, beating analysts' estimates of $2.04 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Sales fell to $3.86 billion from $4.35 billion, compared with the average analyst estimate of $3.94 billion.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Fashion conglomerate Shandong Ruyi, best known for its ambition to be the LVMH of China, has brushed aside a sale of textile maker Lycra proposed by Lycra's creditors and is instead looking to publicly float the business, two people with direct knowledge told Reuters.
Debt-laden Shandong Ruyi Technology Group (Ruyi) bought control of The Lycra Company (Lycra) from U.S. conglomerate Koch Industries for $2.6 billion in 2019, borrowing about $1 billion for the deal.
Lycra's weakening financial performance has prompted some of its creditors to hire restructuring firm Alvarez and Marsal (A&M) as an adviser, fearing Lycra may default, said the two sources.
A&M had over the past two months sounded out potential buyers for Lycra，said one of the people, who declined to be identified due to confidentiality constraints.
But no deal materialized as Ruyi opposed the idea and preferred to hold on to the company while it looks for other means of rescue, the people said.
One of the sources said Ruyi believed Lycra would be better valued via an IPO, rather than a trade sale. Last year Ruyi had suggested it could list the company on China's new tech-focused STAR market.
The sources declined to be named because the information was not public. Ruyi and A&M declined to comment.
Moody's (NYSE:MCO) in April downgraded Lycra's debt ratings by two notches to Caa2 with a stable outlook, having already dropped it by two notches in December.
The ratings agency cited the weak global economic outlook exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic but said Lycra's high leverage, as well as the indebtedness of Shandong Ruyi, were also factors.
Ruyi is rated Caa3 by Moody's. In a note this week, the agency estimated Ruyi's debt to Ebitda ratio - a measure of leverage that compares borrowings to operating profits - to reach between 25-30 in the next two years, from 10 in 2019.
Ruyi holds 53.4% of Lycra, with Koch Industries holding 22.2% and Itochu Group subsidiary CFC holding 15.5%. Minority shareholders own the remaining 8.9%.
Ruyi's and Lycra's woes have been reflected in sharp drops in the bonds sold to pay for Lycra's purchase. The mid price on Lycra's 7.5% May 2025 bond fell from about 80 cents at the end of 2019 to about 55 cents in April, according to Refinitiv. It was quoted at 69.375 cents on Thursday.
LVMH hopes
Ruyi, whose roots are in the textiles industry, began a buying spree in 2015 that has included French fashion house SMCP, Aquascutum and Savile Row tailor Gieves & Hawkes.
In 2018, Ruyi chairman Qiu Yafu told Reuters that LVMH was the company's role model, adding ""we are still a far cry from it but that's our vision.”
But Ruyi has been struggling with the debt taken on to fund the deals. The firm narrowly met a December deadline to repay $345 million in offshore bonds while creditors of 1 billion yuan ($143.94 million) in onshore notes have agreed to extend a repayment due in March to December.
In May, Japanese apparel company Renown, which Ruyi owns, filed for bankruptcy.

120,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>","Slippers to work? Health kick, home office help Adidas","By Emma Thomasson
BERLIN (Reuters) - German sportswear firm Adidas (DE:ADSGn) said on Thursday it expected to bounce back to profitability in the third quarter assuming there are no new major lockdowns as it benefits from more people exercising and dressing down as they work from home.
About half of the 18-34 age group say they plan to exercise more as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted told journalists, adding that around three-quarters of companies plan to keep allowing home office.
""The work environment will have changed for ever,"" he said, noting that sales of plastic slip-on Adilette bath sandals had tripled during the crisis.
Adidas still took a big hit in the first half of 2020 as most of its stores were closed and major sports events like the Olympics and European soccer championships were postponed.
But Rorsted said the company already returned to growth in its home market Germany last month and it expects a recovery in third-quarter sales assuming more than 90% of stores stay open, with the fall compared to 2019 set to be less than 10%.
Shares in the company, which are down 17% this year, were up 4% at 0926 GMT, the biggest German blue-chip gainer.
A second-quarter operating loss of 333 million euros ($396 million) was bigger than average analyst expectations, while a sales decline of 35% to 3.579 billion euros, beat forecasts.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst James Grzinic said the sales decline was much less than feared in Europe and North America - down 40% and 38% respectively - due to strong ecommerce.
Online sales jumped 93% and remained at a very high level even as stores started to reopen. Sales were flat for the second quarter in China, where it saw double-digit growth in May and June.
It expects an operating profit of between 600 million euros and 700 million euros in the third quarter but it declined to give an outlook for the full year.
Inventories hit 5.2 billion euros at the end of June, up 20% from the end of March, which finance chief Harm Ohlmeyer said should be managed down to a more normal level by the close of this year. 

To that end, Adidas plans to repurpose some stock for 2021, such as soccer jerseys for the European championship, push back launches of products designed by singer Beyonce, and shift the rest at its factory outlets or during online sales.

121,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 05:40AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Glencore's All-in Bet on Oil Consumes Its Dividend, For Now","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Glencore became the latest natural resources giant to slash payouts to shareholders on Thursday, saying it won’t pay a dividend for the first half, even though a highly profitable trading performance in the period cushioned the blow from asset writedowns, lower prices and production disruptions caused by the pandemic.
 Glencore  PLC (LON:GLEN) stock fell 4.9% by mid-morning in London, as the divergence in its fortunes from those of its peers in the mining world became ever starker. The company reported a net loss of $4.2 billion for the first six months. BHP Billiton (NYSE:BHP) had managed to defend its payouts, while Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) – with some bravado – actually raised its dividend last month.  Anglo American  (LON:AAL), meanwhile, had to cut its payout by half. 
BHP, Rio and – to a lesser extent – Anglo are all strong in iron ore, a global business where they have an effective oligopoly along with Brazil’s Vale (NYSE:VALE). The relatively prompt rebound in Chinese demand has allowed them to raise prices and gives them a greater degree of confidence over future cash flows.
Glencore’s main business is copper, which is more fragmented globally, weakening the pricing power of its mines. Earlier this year, it asked the Zambian government for permission to mothball its Mopani project due to low prices, but the government refused. Fortunately for both parties, copper prices have followed iron ore upward since then. Another positive update on Thursday was that the ramp-up of operations at its Katanga project in the Democratic Republic of Congo is still on track.
But Glencore’s decision to cut its dividend is more a statement of the outlook for trading than for mining. Its oil trading business, in particular, has profited from the extraordinary volatility in crude prices in the spring to buy product for pennies, confident of selling it later at higher ones.
But the company needs working capital to hold such vast amounts of oil, in order to meet margining requirements and storage fees. That pushed the company’s net debt up 12% to $19.7 billion from $17.6 billion three months earlier.  Its target range is $10 billion to $16 billion. At 1.8 times underlying EBITDA, net debt is now uncomfortably close to its hard cap of 2x.
Glencore said on Thursday that “given current healthy levels of operating cash flow before working capital changes,” it expects net debt to be inside the target range by end of 2020 and down from the start of the year.
However, for that forecast to come good, it needs the oil market to play along. This week’s U.S. inventory data may have allayed fears about a fresh global glut for a while, but with the ‘OPEC+’ bloc and other producers starting to restore shut-in production, the risk of tipping the market back into surplus is real. 
Optimists will say that creates another opportunity for Glencore’s trading department. But the company has enough ongoing risks – with multiple investigations into suspected corrupt practices and an ongoing generational change at top management – without levering up any further in the uncertain waters of the post-Covid world.  Even so, if Glencore's oil bets pay off, the dividend suspension is likely to be short-lived."

In comments embargoed for release on Thursday, Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) CEO Tan Boon Gin told reporters in a video conference that the frontline regulator is seeking to introduce and implement the changes over the next six months.
""SGX RegCo is acutely aware of the perception that few public enforcement actions have taken place in recent years. We are proposing to widen the scope of direct disciplinary actions available to us so as to speed up the disciplinary process,"" Tan said.
Currently, an independent listings disciplinary group comprising senior lawyers, bankers and company executives is tasked with issuing public sanctions, while SGX RegCo's powers are largely confined to private actions.
Delays in hearing cases and conflicts of interests in the group had made enforcement actions protracted, Tan said, leading SGX to seek additional powers. Fines can still be imposed only by the disciplinary committee.
SGX has taken many measures in recent years to shore up market liquidity, improve the quality of listings and strengthen its regulatory framework after a penny stocks crash in 2013 battered investor confidence.

SGX RegCo said it will also require all listed companies to put in place and disclose details of their whistleblowing practices. It is consulting the market on the latest changes.

PARIS (Reuters) - Free2Move, the car rental and car-sharing business developed by French automaker PSA Group (PA:PEUP), now has the capacity to start to court new outside investors, its chief executive Brigitte Courtehoux said. 
Created as a brand in 2016, the business became a fully fledged legal entity within the  Peugeot  (OTC:PUGOY) owning-group last week. It offers a range of so-called mobility services, which include taxi rides, as well as rentals and car-sharing. 
The new status grants it greater autonomy to develop its own apps and opens the way to seek new investors. 
""It remains completely open,"" Courtehoux said in an interview. ""It's one of the possibilities, but we aren't there yet."" 
""We're really in stage one (which consists in) profitable growth and pulling it all together.""
Free2Move's car sharing service competes with French start-up Drivy, Share Now, jointly controlled by  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and BMW (DE:BMWG),  Renault 's Zity (PA:RENA) and Europcar's Ubeeqo (PA:EUCAR), in what has become an increasingly crowded and fast-evolving landscape. 
It also competes with taxi app Uber (N:UBER) and U.S. car-sharing company Zipcar. Free2Move employs 150 tech experts specialised in data, design and e-commerce.
The company's first-half revenues grew by 23%, Courtehoux said, in spite of the novel coronavirus outbreak that led to the suspension of its car-sharing service in Paris and Madrid. 
Courtehoux declined to provide any specific financial figures but Free2Move's sales remain tiny compared to the ones generated by PSA's main car brands, Peugeot, Opel and Citroen. 
The health crisis compelled it to postpone to 2021 plans to extend its car-sharing network, which also includes Washington DC and Lisbon, to a new unnamed big European city. 
FCA (MI:FCHA), with which PSA hopes to merge in the first-half of 2021, has its own rental and car mobility entity, Leasys. 

""We're very complementary, we have a very common vision of what we want to do in the world of mobility,"" Courtehoux said, without elaborating.

The group aims to reduce administrative costs across all units by more than 10%, according to a document dated in July outlining the initiative, which will cut expenses from business travel to hospitality.
Such goals are to remind employees of the current ""tough days"" and ""to actively deal with the internal and external change of the environment,"" the group wrote in the document.
The initiative will be led directly by top leadership including Zhu Hexin, the group's newly appointed chairman and a former vice governor of the central bank, and Xi Guohua, the group's new president, the document showed.
The document was verified by two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
CITIC Group did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
State-owned enterprises have been told by the government to cut costs and make sacrifices for the economy to deal with the economic fallout of the pandemic.
Founded in 1979, CITIC has more than 7 trillion yuan in assets and is involved in businesses including finance, energy, manufacturing and real estate.
Its Hong Kong-listed entity CITIC Limited (HK:0267) reported HK$53.9 billion yuan ($6.95 billion) in profit last year, according to its annual report, generated mainly by its financial business.

125,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>",Korean Air’s Quarterly Profit Defies Coronavirus Travel Slump,"(Bloomberg) -- Korean Air Lines Co. provided some rare positive news for the devastated global aviation industry Thursday, reporting a quarterly profit after flying planes loaded with products from South Korean technology giants to homebound consumers around the world.
The carrier’s operating profit was 148.5 billion won ($125 million) for the April-June period. Cargo sales climbed 95% from a year earlier to 1.23 trillion won. Asiana Airlines Inc. could follow suit with an operating profit of 43.7 billion won when it reports next week, according to the average estimate of analysts tracked by Bloomberg.
The profit comes as other airlines are reporting record losses; slashing routes, jobs and salaries; or collapsing altogether because of the impact Covid-19 has had on travel. The crisis has forced some carriers to retrofit their planes to haul more cargo and generate much-needed cash from surging airfreight rates.
“The cargo business has come to the rescue yet again when things are going bad,” said Um Kyung-a, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities Co. “Countries will be in need of goods to restart their economies as many emerge from shutdowns due to the outbreak.”
Hedge-fund manager David Einhorn is on board, telling investors he bought a stake in Atlas Air (NASDAQ:AAWW) Worldwide Holdings Inc. in the second quarter because he expects the cargo carrier to benefit from a shortage of airfreight capacity.
Korean Air and Asiana benefit from enormous demand for smartphones, TVs and components from Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co. and memory chips from SK Hynix Inc., said Bang Min-jin, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul. South Korea’s overseas shipments of semiconductors, its biggest export, rose 2.9% in June from May, while mobile equipment jumped 20%, according to the Ministry of Trade, Energy and Industry.
Samsung (KS:005930) and LG Electronics Inc. both beat earnings estimates for the quarter ending June, as did Hynix, which said profit tripled after clients snapped up its products to meet demand from people locked down at home. Online commerce is booming:  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS). posted its biggest one-day share gain in 20 years last week after beating earnings estimates, while Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). posted a record profit and 40% jump in sales.
Korean Air and Asiana have strengthened cargo networks from Vietnam to transport gadgets made at Samsung and LG factories there, Um said. There’s also been strong demand for medical supplies, fresh fruit and seafood, she said.
Falling fuel prices helped drive down expenses, with every dollar adjustment impacting earnings by $33 million, according to Korean Air.
The increase in airfreight rates came as capacity was squeezed by the grounding of thousands of passenger planes, which carry cargo in their bellies. At the end of July, about 35% of the world’s passenger aircraft were still parked in storage, aviation analytics company Cirium said.

Seen as ""stay-at-home"" winners in the coronavirus lockdowns, shares in Apple Inc (O:AAPL),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Amazon.com (O:AMZN) and Alphabet (O:GOOGL) have surged this year and now account for nearly a fifth of the S&P 500's (SPX) stock market value.

In a global markets research note sent to clients, Goldman analysts said the current rally could last until Labor Day in early September, but would be threatened by updates on vaccines. 

""Approval could ... prompt the kind of rotation that started and petered out in May and early June, supporting traditional cyclicals, steeper curves and banks, and challenging tech leadership,"" they argued.

The four are accused of fraud, false certification and criminal advertising, the prosecution office said in a statement.
Business daily Handelsblatt and Reuters had already reported on the move, citing people close to the proceedings.
The indictment, directed at three former board members and one head of department who is already retired, relates to a total 434,420 cars of the Audi, VW and Porsche brands which were mostly sold in the U.S. and Europe, it said.
The four are accused of having prompted the development of engines steered by an illegal software function which made engines produce lower emissions when operating in test conditions than when in regular driving operations.
The prosecution asserts that the accused former board members knew of the practice at various times between October 2013 and September 2015 and still carried on with sales, or did not prevent them from taking place.
In addition, one of the former board members is accused of having known but kept silent about his involvement in the practices ahead of his board membership from 2016, thus fraudulently earning board member pay.
Former chief executive Rupert Stadler and three other defendants were charged last year over their roles in the cheating scandal after parent group Volkswagen and Audi admitted in 2015 to having used illegal software.

The troubled bank in June approved a plan to offload around 8.1 billion euros ($9.6 billion) in bad and unlikely-to-pay loans to state-owned bad loan manager AMCO, in a move that could make it more attractive for a possible re-privatisation.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded mixed early Thursday, with strong industrial data supporting the German market while the Bank of England kept monetary policy unchanged, offering up a more pessimistic outlook.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% higher, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.8%. 
In Germany, factory orders soared in June, climbing 27.9% data showed earlier Thursday, far above the 10% gain expected. This provided hope that Europe’s manufacturing engine may be recovering more quickly than expected from the coronavirus-related downturn.
The Bank of England maintained its key interest rate at 0.10% earlier Thursday, and kept its powder dry in terms of additional stimulus. The central bank also signaled rates would stay low for some time, saying it would take until the end of next year for the U.K. economy to make up the ground lost during the coronavirus pandemic.
Elsewhere, the earnings season remains in full flow.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Air's (OL:NORR) July passenger volume fell by 90.4% from a year earlier as most of its fleet remained grounded due to the coronavirus pandemic, it said on Thursday.
The budget carrier flew just 356,093 passengers during the month compared to 3.71 million in July 2019.
""Although customer demand has increased compared to the almost non-existent levels in April, May and June, the market situation remains challenging,"" Norwegian said in a statement.
Competitor Virgin Atlantic Airways (VA.UL) on Tuesday became the latest carrier to seek bankruptcy protection from a U.S. court as the hard-hit industry seeks to restructure.
Norwegian used only 20 of its aircraft in July, up from eight in June, but more than 100 jetliners are still parked amid a sharp fall in global travel.
The company, which revolutionised transatlantic travel by offering cheap fares, won backing in May from owners and creditors for a conversion of debt to equity and aims to rebuild operations, albeit on a smaller scale.
""Norwegian will continue to evaluate demand, travel advice and infection control measures while adjusting its network accordingly,"" it said.
Initially limiting its operations during COVID-19 to domestic flights in Norway, the airline now flies more widely in Europe while its transatlantic business is on hold.
On June 29 the airline cancelled orders for 97 new Boeing (N:BA) aircraft and said it would claim compensation from the U.S. planemaker for the grounding of the 737 MAX and engine problems on its 787 Dreamliner jets.
Boeing said it was working with Norwegian on a path forward, as it was with other operators, but would not comment on commercial discussions.
Originally a small regional airline in Scandinavia, Norwegian made its breakthrough on the global stage with a multi-year order in 2012 for up to 372 aircraft, of which 222 were from Boeing and 150 from Airbus (PA:AIR).

Its shares have fallen 95% so far this year.

Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) Plc won’t pay its deferred dividend after net debt spiked because the commodities giant poured money into its trading business to cash in on volatile price swings.
The company put the payment on hold earlier this year as it moved to protect itself from potential shocks from the coronavirus pandemic. Glencore has bet heavily on oil by buying and storing the fuel when prices collapsed earlier this year, leading to record gains but also a spike in its debt. That, combined with uncertainty over the near-term outlook, prompted a decision to cancel the dividend.
Glencore’s trading business earned $2 billion in earnings before interest and tax, double the returns it made last year, the company reported Thursday. Glencore said last week that full-year trading profit would be at the top end of its range. However, net debt rose to $19.7 billion, well above a target of between $10 billion and $16 billion.

“The outlook remains highly uncertain in the short term, particularly from the risk of second wave infections in key economies,” Chief Executive Officer Ivan Glasenberg said in a statement. “Notwithstanding our cash-generative business and secure liquidity positions, the board has concluded that it would be inappropriate to make a distribution to shareholders in 2020.”
The company will focus instead on reducing borrowing, and expects to be back within its target range by the end of the year, Glasenberg said.
The dividend decision comes at a tumultuous time for the company. Glencore is facing ongoing corruption probes in the U.S., Brazil, and the U.K., which have spooked investors and shaken the Switzerland-based company in recent years. At the same time, the world’s biggest commodity trader is preparing for a change of power at the top. Glasenberg has said he’s in the process of looking for a successor and other top managers from the old guard are also being replaced.

The company didn’t give any more details on the timing of that succession plan in Thursday’s report. Glasenberg said he’s looking forward to working with the newly appointed senior executives.
The record first-half trading profit helped offset the effect of weaker prices for commodities that Glencore mines. Once again, the company has missed out on an iron rally that provided bumper earnings for its biggest rivals, such as Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Group and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Plc, because it doesn’t produce any. Instead, Glencore’s mining profits are driven by coal and copper.
While copper prices have been resilient through the pandemic, thermal coal has crashed, falling to the lowest levels since the commodity crisis five years ago. That contributed to a 13% fall in first-half core earnings.
The company reported a net loss of $2.6 billion, after it recorded impairments of $3.2 billion net of non-controlling interests and tax, including writedowns on its oil operations in Chad and Zambian copper operations. The collapse in thermal coal prices also prompted Glencore to take more writedowns on its Colombian mines. For the second time this year, the company lowered the value of its Prodeco and Cerrejon assets.
Last week the company announced it was cutting thermal coal output by 14% this year as it sought to protect prices. Glencore has a long tradition of cutting output to support prices, having held back production in commodities such as zinc, coal and cobalt in recent years after prices weakened.

In Germany, factory orders soared in June, climbing 27.9% data showed earlier Thursday, far above the 10% gain expected. This provided hope that Europe’s manufacturing engine may be recovering more quickly than expected from the coronavirus-related downturn.
The Bank of England maintained its key interest rate at 0.10% earlier Thursday, and kept its powder dry in terms of additional stimulus. Attention will now turn to comments from Governor Andrew Bailey over how fast he expects the economy to rebound from the financial damage wrought by the pandemic.
Elsewhere, top congressional Democrats and White House officials appeared to harden their stances on the new coronavirus relief plan on Wednesday.
""There are no top line numbers that have been agreed to. We continue to be trillions of dollars apart in terms of what Democrats and Republicans hopefully will ultimately compromise on,"" said White House chief of staff Mark Meadows late Wednesday.

The airline said on Thursday the collapse in demand for air travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic meant it carried 96% fewer passengers between April and June than a year earlier, leading to an 80% drop in second-quarter revenue to 1.9 billion euros.
Despite cost cuts, it posted an adjusted operating loss of 1.7 billion euros compared to 754 million euros a year earlier - the worst quarterly result in the company's 67-year history.
""We are experiencing a caesura in global air traffic. We do not expect demand to return to pre-crisis levels before 2024,"" Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said, adding the company would not be spared a ""far-reaching restructuring"" of its business.
Lufthansa said last month it would cut 20% of its leadership positions and 1,000 administrative jobs as it seeks to repay a 9 billion euro state bailout and navigate deepening losses in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.
The company, which had 129,400 employees as of the end of June, said forced redundancies can no longer be ruled out in Germany due to the development of the market and the course of negotiations with unions.
Lufthansa said it plans to increase short and medium-haul capacity to around 40% of the prior-year period in the third quarter and to around 20% of capacity on long-haul routes.
In the fourth quarter, it expects short- and medium-haul capacity to rise to 55% and to 50% on long-haul routes. Rival Air France-KLM, which also secured state-backed aid, aims to operate at two thirds of capacity before the end of the year.

The company said it expects to post an adjusted operating loss in the second half of 2020 and a further significant decline in adjusted operating profit for the full-year due to very limited operation of important long-haul routes.

Japan's top automaker reported a profit of 13.9 billion yen ($131.73 million) for the three months ended June, its worst since the June 2011 quarter. Still, it was better than an average estimate for a loss of 179 billion yen based on a Refinitiv poll of seven analysts.
The bleak results underline the challenges being faced by the global auto industry due to the health crisis that has shuttered factories this year and kept customers out of dealerships, hitting production and sales. 
Toyota reiterated its forecast for an annual operating profit of 500 billion yen, which would be its weakest in nine years, while raising its vehicle sales forecast. 
Toyota, which like its rivals saw sales and production crash over March-May, expects its global sales to fall 13% in the year ending March 2021, versus its prior outlook for a 15% drop. 
The maker of the RAV4 SUV crossover and the Prius gasoline hybrid expects to sell 9.1 million cars this fiscal year to March, down from 10.46 million last year, but better than a previous forecast for 8.9 million units. 
That would still mark its lowest sales in nine years, hit by a 14% drop in sales in North America - Toyota's biggest market that accounts for about a quarter of its global sales. 

In the first quarter, global sales fell 50% to 1.16 million units, led by a 62% tumble in North America.Toyota expects production to largely return to normal levels this month.

Representative Maxine Waters (NYSE:WAT), who chairs the committee, and the other lawmakers said they had ""serious concerns"" about the transactions and asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the circumstances surrounding the matter.
Kodak shares surged more than 1,000% last week after the loan was announced, generating a windfall for executives, some of whom had received options one day earlier. 
U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the government would investigate the circumstances surrounding the announcement of the loan, which will help the photographic equipment maker shift into making pharmaceuticals at its U.S. factories.
The SEC has declined to comment on a report saying that it would investigate, and Trump did not elaborate. Kodak has said it will cooperate with any potential inquiries.
Concerns center on the company's granting of options for 1.75 million shares to its executive chairman as the result of what a person familiar with the arrangement described as an ""understanding"" with its board that had previously neither been listed in his employment contract nor made public.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY) Holdings (SI:DBSM) reported a 22% fall in second-quarter net profit on Thursday after shoring up loan loss allowances in a pandemic-hit market, but its profit came just above market estimates and rose from the preceding quarter.
Piyush Gupta, CEO of Southeast Asia's biggest lender, said in a statement that the operating trends were in line with the bank's guidance and several fee income streams were improving from troughs in April as economies emerge from lockdowns.
Smaller rival United Overseas Bank (SI:UOBH) however missed analysts' estimates with a 40% fall in quarterly profit due to lower margins and higher credit costs.
Investors are keen to see if the June quarter marked the trough for banks' net interest margins, a key measure of profitability, and whether lenders can effectively tackle loan losses in recession-hit economies.
DBS said profit for the June quarter fell to S$1.25 billion ($913 million) from S$1.6 billion a year earlier, and versus an average estimate of S$1.19 billion from five analysts, according to Refinitiv data.
The profit was above the first-quarter's S$1.16 billion number. Loan loss allowances also declined quarter on quarter.
""DBS did better with help on treasury income and surprisingly was again able to contain costs like Q1,"" said Kevin Kwek, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
He said given the circumstances, DBS' ability to maintain a 10% return on equity would be seen positively especially in light of the recent stock price drop due to a cap on dividends.
Investor disenchantment with lenders grew after the city-state's central bank capped their dividends last week, sparking a sell-off in shares.

DBS' net interest margin fell to 1.62% in the second quarter from 1.91% a year earlier.

Singapore-based DBS saw net income fall 22% from a year earlier and UOB posted a 40% drop as a slump in lending income added to their woes, results for the three months ended June 30 showed Thursday. Still, chief executive officers of both banks signaled they can weather the economic storm, maintaining earlier guidance on credit costs.
Like their global peers, Singapore’s lenders are bracing for a wave of soured debts as the coronavirus crisis hammers companies and households. While a host of government relief measures have supported businesses, the central bank has indicated they won’t be extended and ordered the lenders to cap their 2020 dividend payouts to boost capital reserves.
At DBS, Southeast Asia’s largest bank, net income totaled S$1.25 billion ($913 million), beating the S$1.19 billion projected by analysts, as a drop in expenses softened the blow. UOB’s profit was S$703 million, missing the S$784 million estimated.
“Results were in line with expectations especially around provisions” which could be read as positive in light of recent declines in the stocks, said Kevin Kwek, a banking analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in Singapore. “There were some modest positives such as cost cuts for both, to offset expected margin drops.”
Kept Guidance
DBS maintained its guidance for total allowances of around S$3 billion to S$5 billion over two years, S$1.9 billion of which were taken during the first six months, CEO Piyush Gupta said in a presentation accompanying the results.
The bank’s allowance reserves, at S$3.8 billion, are 24% higher than the minimum requirement by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Gupta said. DBS has an ongoing review of its cost structure, he said.
UOB’s credit costs are likely to remain around second-quarter levels, “with more preemptive allowances to cushion anticipated asset quality weaknesses,” CEO Wee Ee Cheong said. Like its larger rival, UOB also cut operating expenses, which fell about 8% from a year earlier.
Falling interest rates are also taking a toll on the banks by shrinking loan profitability. Both banks saw their net interest margins narrow more than 20 basis points from three months earlier. UOB’s net interest income declined 12% from a year earlier, and DBS posted a 5% drop.
Singapore’s economy plunged into recession in the second quarter amid restrictions to control the spread of Covid-19. Gross domestic product tumbled an annualized 41.2% from the previous three months, the biggest quarterly contraction on record.
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., Southeast Asia’s second-largest bank, will report its earnings Friday.

145,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 07:15PM ET</span>",U.S. proposes fine of $1.25 million on Boeing for pressuring workers at airplane plant,"By David Shepardson and Eric M. Johnson
WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday said it was proposing to fine  Boeing Co  (N:BA) $1.25 million after the agency alleged Boeing managers at its South Carolina plant exerted undue pressure on workers who handle safety oversight work on behalf of the agency. 
The FAA said Boeing managers pressured workers to perform inspections on an aircraft that was not eligible for inspection because of various issues; harassed people to make them perform inspections more quickly; threatened to replace workers; and retaliated against a unit manger for filing an undue pressure report by declining to interview the ""highly qualified manager” for a promotional position.
The long-standing practice of delegating some FAA tasks to airplane manufacturers has come under criticism after two fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes raised questions about the program. The FAA in two civil penalty notices alleged Boeing failed to ensure administrators were in a position to effectively represent the FAA’s interests and that some Boeing managers ""exerted undue pressure or interfered"" with people performing FAA tasks.
Boeing said the proposed fines ""are a clear and strong reminder of our obligations"" under the Organization Designation Authorization program, or ODA. ""Undue pressure of any type is inconsistent with our values and will not be tolerated,"" the company said.
Boeing employees tasked with handling certification work on behalf of the FAA - so-called ODA unit members - at Boeing's South Carolina factory were subjected to undue pressure or interference from at least four Boeing managers between September 2018 and May 2019.
The FAA said the pressure came from executives including the factory’s vice president of 787 operations, a senior quality manager and the director of jet deliveries, according to a 5-page letter from the FAA’s enforcement division in Washington state to Boeing veteran Beth Pasztor, an executive in charge of Product and Services Safety.
The FAA also said Boeing, from roughly November 2017 through July 2019, implemented an organizational structure that did not conform to ODA procedures, with managers in unapproved roles.
The letter says the FAA will take no further action for 30 days to allow Boeing to pay the fines or furnish additional information. 
Boeing said in both instances ""allegations were appropriately reported, investigated, and disclosed to the FAA"" and added it took ""corrective action in response.""
A 2016 Boeing survey released by a congressional panel found nearly 40% of 523 employees handling safety-certification work perceived ""potential undue pressure"" from managers, such as bullying or coercion.

Evidence of “undue pressure” was also pinpointed by a group of international regulators reviewing the 737 Max certification.

146,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 06:55PM ET</span>",U.S. lawmakers seek probe of investment firms' dealings in Puerto Rico debt,"By Karen Pierog
(Reuters) - Five members of U.S. Congress from New York said on Wednesday that several investment firms involved in Puerto Rico's ongoing bankruptcy may have engaged in insider trading and urged the state attorney general to investigate. 
In a letter to New York Attorney General Letitia James, the lawmakers cited allegations arising from the island's bankruptcy litigation ""that some hedge fund groups may have been engaging in insider trading and using the PROMESA restructuring process to artificially manipulate bond markets.""
Using the 2016 PROMESA Act, Puerto Rico's federally created financial oversight board filed a form of municipal bankruptcy for the U.S. commonwealth in 2017 in an effort to restructure about $120 billion of debt and obligations.
""Not only is this another example of deep pocketed interests profiteering off Puerto Ricans’ suffering, but these hedge funds may have also violated securities law,"" U.S. Representative Nydia Velázquez, a New York Democrat, said in a statement.
The letter, which was also signed by Congress members Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Carolyn Maloney, José Serrano, and Adriano Espaillat, pointed out that the federal judge overseeing the bankruptcy ordered detailed disclosures from the Lawful Constitutional Debt Coalition (LCDC), whose members include Aristeia Capital LLC, Whitebox Advisors LLC, Taconic Capital Advisors LP, and GoldenTree Asset Management.
Those disclosures revealed that LCDC members ""significantly increased their holdings of bonds they argued in court were of no value while engaging in confidential mediation talks about their restructuring,"" according to the letter.
Meanwhile, the bonds increased in value ""and the restructuring plan revealed at the end of the mediation period increased their return."" The LCDC was part of a global settlement announced in February to restructure Puerto Rico's core government debt.
""An investigation is needed to reveal whether some hedge funds may have made these trades with non-public information obtained through the mediation discussions, and without disclosing their true economic interests,"" the letter said.
In a statement, the LCDC said its members ""adhered to and respected all elements of the mediation protocol and trading restrictions during the period in which they were negotiating with the oversight board."" 
""As creditors with long-term investments in Puerto Rico, our members have consistently engaged in a constructive, transparent manner with the oversight board to facilitate the commonwealth’s timely emergence from bankruptcy and economic recovery,” it added.
The individual firms listed in the letter did not immediately respond to requests for comment or deferred to the LCDC statement.
A spokesman for the New York Attorney General's office said: ""We’re reviewing the letter now, and will look further into this matter.” The oversight board declined to comment.

(Reuters) - U.S. insurer MetLife Inc (N:MET) on Wednesday posted a 43% drop in quarterly adjusted earnings, spurred by declining premium income and private equity investment losses.
Adjusted earnings fell to $758 million in the second quarter from $1.3 billion a year earlier, MetLife said. Excluding items, MetLife earned 83 cents per share compared with $1.46 per share a year ago.
Analysts estimated earnings of 91 cents per share for the second quarter ending June 30, according to Factset, the company said.
Premiums and fees dropped 13% to $10.4 billion, from $12 billion a year ago.
Adjusted premiums and fees in MetLife's U.S. retirement income unit dropped 58%, to $511 million from $1.2 billion a year earlier, mainly because of lower activity in its business that takes over corporate pension assets.
MetLife's net investment income was $4.1 billion, down 13% from $4.7 billion a year ago. The decline was driven by a loss in variable investment income, reflecting a reporting lag from the first quarter for private equity results.
""The decline in our private equity portfolio was squarely within our expectations,"" MetLife Chief Executive Officer Michel Khalaf said in a statement.
MetLife's businesses include group workplace life insurance programs. 
MetLife said it had higher COVID-related claims during the quarter, but did not provide specifics. The disease's effects in the third quarter would be largely offset by underwriting margins, the company said.
MetLife reported $710 million in net derivative losses, compared with $724 million in derivative gains a year ago.
Adjusted earnings at most of MetLife's businesses including the U.S., Asia and Latin America, dropped from the previous year because of declining variable investment income. 

MetLife's EMEA unit reported an adjusted profit of $116 million, up 51% from $77 million a year ago, driven by favorable underwriting and expense margins, the company said.

149,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 05:00PM ET</span>",Republican senators back extending $25 billion payroll aid for U.S. airlines; shares jump,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of Senate Republicans on Wednesday backed extending a $25 billion payroll assistance program for U.S. airlines after warnings that carriers may be forced to cut tens of thousands of jobs without government action, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Airline stocks moved sharply higher on the news, which was first reported by Reuters. Shares of American Airlines (O:AAL) closed up 9.5% while shares of United Airlines (O:UAL) rose 4.6% and Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) finished up 4.2%. 
The letter, spearheaded by Senator Cory Gardner and addressed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and copied to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, was the first public disclosure of significant support in the Republican-led Senate for additional emergency funding for U.S. airlines. A spokesman for McConnell declined to comment.
Senators Marco Rubio, Roger Wicker, James Inhofe, James Risch, John Cornyn, Todd Young, Susan Collins, Martha McSally, Shelley Moore Capito and others who signed the letter said they backed a new six-month extension of the $25 billion payroll support program ""to avoid furloughs and further support those workers.""
After Reuters reported the letter, Cornyn's office released a copy of it and declined to comment further.
Airline officials and unions have been urging U.S. lawmakers to extend new assistance in the face of the coronavirus epidemic's devastating impact on airline travel.
""With air travel anticipated to remain low in the near future, Congress should also consider provisions to support and provide flexibility for businesses across the aviation industry similarly impacted, such as airport concessionaires and aviation manufacturing,"" the letter said.
On July 27, a majority of the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives signed a letter also calling for a six-month extension for the payroll aid program that they argue is crucial to keeping hundreds of thousands of aviation workers employed through March 31. That letter was signed by 195 Democrats and 28 Republicans.
Congress awarded $25 billion in payroll assistance to U.S. passenger airlines in March, along with $4 billion for cargo carriers and $3 billion for airport contractors. Most of the bailout funds do not have to be paid back.
Congress also approved a separate $25 billion in low-cost loans for passenger airlines; many airlines have not yet tapped those loans.
Airline executives feel increasingly optimistic Congress will act, while chief executives and union leaders have been calling lawmakers to push for additional assistance.
Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents nearly 50,000 flight attendants at 19 airlines, said the letter on Wednesday demonstrated ""overwhelming bipartisan majority support"" for a another $25 billion six-month extension of the payroll program.
Airlines and unions have warned that mass layoffs could take place after the existing $25 billion in aid expires on Sept. 30, just over a month before the Nov. 3 U.S. elections.

Between American Airlines and United Airlines, more than 60,000 frontline workers have received warnings that their jobs are on the line.

The company's shares jumped nearly 10% in extended trade, after gaining about 64% this year through Wednesday's close.
Zynga said it would also acquire an 80% stake in Istanbul-based hyper-casual game maker Rollic for $168 million in cash, about two months after its $1.8 billion acquisition of Peak, the maker of games like ""Toon Blast"" and ""Toy Blast"".
""It is a great way to acquire users,"" Zynga Chief Executive Officer Frank Gibeau told Reuters, noting that hyper-casual is the fastest growing category on mobile right now.
Rollic, known for games like ""Go Knots 3D"" and ""Tangle Master 3D"", will also add to Zynga's ad sales. The mobile game maker said it would acquire the remaining 20% of Rollic at valuations based on specific profitability goals over the next three years.
The ""FarmVille""-maker has been strengthening its hold on the fast-growing mobile gaming market through a slew of acquisitions and licensing agreements with media outlets to publish themed games of popular franchises. 
Besides games like ""Empires & Puzzles"" and ""Merge Dragons!"", Zynga is also known for its portfolio of social casino games like ""Game of Thrones Slots Casino"".
User spending on mobile games surged in the past few months along with broader videogame sales, as people turned to games to keep themselves entertained and connect virtually with friends while under coronavirus-led lockdowns.
Zynga raised its full-year 2020 bookings to $2.2 billion from $1.8 billion, above analysts' estimate of $1.85 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

It reported bookings of $518.1 million for the second quarter ended June 30, beating estimates of $503.2 million.

151,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 04:38PM ET</span>","Roku Beats on Q2 Earnings, Revenue But Flags Uncertainty Ahead","By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com –  Roku  was roughly flat in after-market hours on Wednesday after the streaming device company's gloomy outlook overshadowed second-quarter results that topped consensus estimates.
Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) was up 0.2% in after-market trading.
Roku reported a second-quarter loss of $0.35 per share, better than the $0.54 loss expected. Revenue rose 42% to $356.1 million to top estimates of $313 million.
The company's beat on the top line was helped by platform revenue, which increased 46% year-on-year to $244.8 million.
""The company generated the largest net increase in active accounts in our history outside of a Q4 holiday period,"" Roku said. ""As economic pressures caused advertisers to further re-evaluate how much and where to invest media dollars, Roku delivered strong growth in our ad business, particularly relative to the overall TV ad market that was down.""
Average revenue per user (ARPU) was up 18% to $24.92, while streaming hours increased by 2.3 billion hours over last quarter to 14.6 billion.
Looking ahead, the company warned of uncertainty.
""The ad industry outlook remains uncertain for Q3 and Q4, and we believe that total TV ad spend will not recover to pre-COVID-19 levels until well into 2021. Advertisers in industries like Casual Dining, Travel and Tourism have significantly slowed their spending. However, we remain confident in our ability to grow our ad business, albeit not as much as we would have expected prior to the pandemic, as marketers re-allocate spend and follow consumers in the shift to streaming,"" Roku warned. ""As a result, despite the potential reasons for variability listed above, we believe that our overall revenue will grow substantially on a year-over-year basis in the second half and for the full-year 2020, albeit not as strongly as we had anticipated prior to the pandemic."" 
The company also reversed a decision to replace chief financial officer Steve Louden.
""Last December, we announced that Steve Louden would relocate and leave Roku after bringing on board his successor. Over recent months, Steve has proven that he is more than capable of performing the CFO role while residing in Seattle. Hence, we are delighted that Steve will be staying on as Roku’s CFO and we have ended the search for his successor,"" it added."
152,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 04:31PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: 3 Things to Watch for August 6,"By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Private payrolls expanded by far less than expected in July, and lawmakers still can't agree on a fourth round of economic stimulus, but that isn't doing anything to halt the tech-fueled market rally.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged for the fourth-straight day on Wednesday, Nasdaq notched yet another record and briefly topped 11,000, and investors pushed gold to all-time highs.
Investors even scrambled into the public trading debut of BigCommerce Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BIGC)e, the online marketplace that has to compete against the likes of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and  Shopify Inc  (NYSE:SHOP). Shares in that IPO tripled to $90 from their offering price of $24 during the day, and closed around $74.
Most everyone is waiting on the government's job report for July, which comes out on Friday, but there is still evidence that the economic revival after Covid-19 shutdowns was hitting a few snags.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Will another bailout boost the struggling airlines industry?
Airlines jumped late Wednesday after news that GOP Senators backed another $25 billion in support for the ailing industry. The ETF tracking the sector, U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSE:JETS), rose 3% and individual airlines also rose, including JetBlue Airways Corp (NASDAQ:JBLU) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL), up more than 4%, and  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) up nearly 9%.
Travel shriveled up in the spring as people hunkered down at home to prevent the spread of Covid-19. With some new restrictions imposed to stamp out fresh virus outbreaks across the country, expectations are low that tourists and business people will return to the air in significant numbers for the near term. Airlines already received a $32 billion bailout in March.
2. This week the data is focused on jobs
The weekly initial jobless claims number will be reported on Thursday as usual at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). The expectation is that 1.4 million Americans filed for unemployment for the first time last week, about even with the prior week and elevated from lower levels about a month ago.
But most people are focused on Friday's nonfarm payroll report, which is expected to show an addition of 1.6 million jobs in July, and private nonfarm payrolls rising 1.47 million. That would be a big contrast to a private payroll processor's assessment released Wednesday. The ADP report on private payrolls showed only 167,000 jobs were added last month.
Friday's report is also expected to reveal changes in the unemployment rate, which is still at highs not seen since after World War II.
3. Digital payment providers the big winner during pandemic era
After  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) topped expectations for profit and revenue earlier last week with its strongest earnings report ever,  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) also jumped ahead Wednesday. Both are benefiting from a boom in online and contactless payments despite widespread business closures during the spring.
Square, which is  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) founder Jack Dorsey's other business, is especially exposed to small businesses and restaurants. But, as Briefing.com points out, Square's Cash App helped propel it forward during the quarter.
Cash App is like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Pay or Venmo (a PayPal company). People download the app on their smart phones and use it to pay for things instead of using a card or cash, as well as to transfer money. Cash App users can even invest in stocks using the app.
Square's per-share profit was 18 cents versus expectations for 5 cents a share and revenue was nearly $2 billion.
PayPal shares rose 2.8% Thursday and are up 87% year to date. Square rose 7% on Thursday and is up 133% this year."

Investing.com – Wall Street ended higher on Wednesday on optimism that U.S. lawmakers will agree to a fresh round of coronavirus stimulus sooner than later.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.39%, or 372 points. The S&P 500 gained 0.64%, to move within 2% of its all time high. The Nasdaq Composite jumped 0.52% to close at another record high.
A sea of green washed over stocks as investors cheered signs of progress on the virus aid bill, which many believe is critical to support the economy's nascent recovery. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were said to have made some concessions to break the deadlock.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that he was ""prepared to support"" federal unemployment benefits being brought back at that $600/week level – a key sticking point that has been holding up progress.
The bill could also include further aid for airlines after 16 Republican Senators reportedly called for $25 billion in federal aid for the airline industry to be included in the virus relief package amid fears of looming job cuts as payroll assistance is set to end on Oct. 1.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) surged 10%, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) was up 4% and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) (NYSE:DAL) added 3%.
Crude inventories fell by 7.4 million barrels last week, a larger draw than the 3 million barrels expected, sending oil prices nearly 3% higher.
Financials were boosted by a 7% surge in Square (NYSE:SQ) after the payments company delivered better-than-expected quarterly results thanks to strong growth in its consumer payments app.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) jumped about 9% after revealing a surprise fiscal third quarter profit on cost cuts and strong growth in its streaming business. The company also said the remake of Mulan would be available to stream in September.
Elsewhere on the earnings front, Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) fell about 7% after reporting mixed results as earnings were in-line, but revenue fell short of estimates. The company also flagged higher than expected costs and weakness in its food service channel.
""(T)he quality of results was weaker than we expected with the exclusion of $7.4M of COVID costs and donations and U.S. Foodservice channel sales down 59% with a slow exit rate for sequential recovery,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in a note.
In tech, the ""Fab 5"" pared losses to end mostly higher. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was lower.
On the economic front, U.S. services activity in July topped estimates, but the labor market continues to show signs of weakness ahead of the nonfarm payrolls report later this week.
The U.S. private sector added 167,000 jobs in July, short of forecasts of 1.5 million jobs."

156,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 03:27PM ET</span>","Exxon Says 20% of Oil, Gas Reserves Threatened by Low Prices","(Bloomberg) --  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). warned that low energy prices may wipe as much as one-fifth of its oil and natural gas reserves off the books.
If depressed prices persist for the rest of the year, “certain quantities of crude oil, bitumen and natural gas will not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2020,” the company said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. A 20% hit would impact the equivalent of almost 4.5 billion barrels of crude, or enough to supply every refinery on the U.S. Gulf Coast for 18 months.
Exxon’s shares gave up some gains, trading 0.3% higher at 1:34 p.m., after earlier climbing as much as 1.9%, bolstered by a gain in international crude futures.
Rivals  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc, BP (NYSE:BP) Plc and Total SE have written off billions of dollars in reserves in recent weeks as the pandemic destroyed oil demand and prices, making some fields unprofitable to drill. Exxon has been the sole holdout, having not written down anything during the current crisis.
Exxon’s last significant reserves revision was in 2016, when it removed some of its oil-sands assets in Canada from its books, though it later added some of these back.
Exxon is currently undergoing its annual “very rigorous” process of reviewing the value of assets and should present the results to the board by November, Senior Vice President Neil Chapman said during a call with analysts July 31. While Exxon doesn’t publish commodity price forecasts, unlike European peers, Chapman said they’re “consistent with the range of third-party estimates.”

Investing.com - Airlines were given a boost on Wednesday as Reuters reported that 16 Republican Senators had backed plans for another $25 billion in aid package to support the battered airline industry.
The airline industry was given $32 billion in federal aid in March, in the hope =s that travel demand would return. But the spread of Covid-19 picked up pace, and led some states to rein in reopening measures, leaving travel demand on its knees.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) surged 11%, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) was up 5% and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) was up 4%."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks climbed on Wednesday in the wake of a surprise quarterly profit from  Disney  and as investors hailed signs that a deal was near for a U.S. coronavirus fiscal aid package. 
Walt Disney Co's (N:DIS) shares jumped 9.06%, among the biggest boosts to the S&P 500 and Dow, and was on track for its biggest daily percentage gain since March 24 as revenue declines for its parks and media networks were not as bad as feared.
""What is helping not just Disney but the markets in general is everyone is completely buying into the Disney move to streaming but then if you do look at the theme parks, the data for the U.S. at large has gotten much more positive lately where we are at least getting initial indications we are sort of over that hump,"" said Shawn Cruz, senior manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) in Jersey City, New Jersey. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 321.61 points, or 1.2%, to 27,150.08, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 21.96 points, or 0.66%, to 3,328.47 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 59.92 points, or 0.55%, to 11,001.09.
Payments processor  Square Inc  (N:SQ) surged 8.50% after reporting a 64% rise in second-quarter revenue, as consumers increased online buying and used its peer-to-peer Cash App platform during the pandemic.
As quarterly results have come in better-than-feared and heavyweight technology and technology-related companies have surged, a heavy dose of fiscal and monetary stimulus have helped fuel a rally in equities to bring the S&P 500 less than 2% from its closing record on Feb. 19. 
With 384 companies in the S&P having reported earnings through Wednesday morning, results are coming in 23.5% above expectations, in aggregate, according to Refinitiv data, the highest on record back to 1994. 
Economic data painted a mixed picture, as U.S. services industry activity gained momentum in July, according to an ISM survey, with new orders jumping to a record high. However, hiring declined, supporting views that a recovery in the labor market was faltering.
Earlier, the ADP National Employment Report, which can be an inconsistent precursor to the government payrolls report set for Friday, showed U.S. private employers hired far fewer workers than expected last month.
U.S. Congressional Democrats and White House officials were set to resume negotiations on coronavirus relief legislation on Wednesday, with administration officials aiming for an agreement by Friday.
Financials (SPSY), industrials (SPLRCI) and materials (SPLRCM), that track economic growth, outperformed among the major S&P sectors. 
Teladoc Health Inc (N:TDOC) fell 17.30% after agreeing to buy chronic care provider  Livongo Health Inc  (O:LVGO) in a deal valuing the company at $18.5 billion, betting on a boom in online care and consultations spurred by the coronavirus crisis. Livongo shares fell 10.23%.
Electric truckmaker  Nikola Corp  (O:NKLA) slumped 8.16% after it reported a bigger quarterly loss in its first results as a listed entity.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.93-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 48 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 202 new highs and 9 new lows.

The bank also aims for 40% of its employees with this title to be female, Goldman's chief executive officer, David Solomon, wrote in the statement, which was posted on the bank's website and emailed to staff. 
The diversity targets add to ones Goldman set for staff in lower-level positions last year, and they reflect a growing acknowledgement on Wall Street that most top jobs are held by white men. 
Goldman executives have frequently said that greater diversity also equals greater success in business. 
""Progress on diversity will enhance our ability to execute our strategy and deliver for our clients,"" Solomon said Wednesday. 
Employees with the title of vice president at investment banks like Goldman Sachs are in the higher ranks of the bank, considered to be just below the rank of managing directors, and above analysts and associates. 
In 2019, Goldman set a goal for 11% of all new analysts and entry-level associates hired in the U.S. and 9% hired in the U.K. to be Black professionals. The bank said it also aimed for 14% to be Latino professionals and half to be women. 

In Wednesday's statement, the bank committed to doubling its hiring from historically black colleges and universities for the position of analyst by 2025.

Investing.com – Wall Street jumped on Wednesday as signs of progress on Capitol Hill over the next coronavirus fiscal stimulus package lifted investor sentiment.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.24 %, or 331 points. The S&P 500 gained 0.66%, while the Nasdaq Composite jumped 0.52%.
With the clock ticking down on the congressional summer recess set for the end of this week, a sense of urgency to get the coronavirus relief package over the line has set in, with lawmakers on both sides said to have made modest concessions.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that he was ""prepared to support"" federal unemployment benefits being brought back at that $600/week level – a key sticking point that has been holding up progress.
Value stocks, which tend to perform well when the economy picks up, led the broader market higher, with materials, industrials, financials and energy up more than 1%.
Energy was rising on oil prices amid data showing weekly a fall weekly U.S. crude stockpiles.
Crude inventories fell by 7.4 million barrels last week, a larger draw than the 3 million barrels expected, sending oil prices nearly 3% higher.
Financials were boosted by an 8% surge in Square (NYSE:SQ) after the payments company delivered better-than-expected quarterly results thanks to strong growth in its consumer payments app.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS), meanwhile, jumped 9% after revealing a surprise fiscal third quarter profit on cost cuts and strong growth in its streaming business. The company also said the remake of Mulan would be available to stream in September.
Elsewhere on the earnings front, Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) fell more than 7% after reporting mixed results as earnings were in-line, but revenue fell short of estimates. The company also flagged higher than expected costs and weakness in its food service channel.
""(T)he quality of results was weaker than we expected with the exclusion of $7.4M of COVID costs and donations and U.S. Foodservice channel sales down 59% with a slow exit rate for sequential recovery,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in a note.
In tech, the ""Fab 5"" pared losses to end mostly higher.  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as lower.
On the economic front, U.S. services activity in July topped estimates, but the labor market continues to show signs of weakness ahead of the nonfarm payrolls report later this week.

The stock was trading at $16.59 at 1:16 p.m. ET (1716 GMT) on Wednesday, down from the $21 per share price Rackspace shares had sold for in its initial public offering on Tuesday. 
The lackluster IPO and trading debut bucked the recent trend of strong appetite from investors for cloud computing companies as the novel coronavirus pandemic drives more businesses to operate digitally and rely on cloud computing for more of their workflow. 
Rackspace sold 33.5 million shares in its IPO at the bottom end of its target range of $21 to $24 per share, valuing the company at $4.18 billion, excluding debt. 
""We've actually been very pleased with how the IPO process has gone. This is one of the largest tech IPOs of the year so we’re pretty excited to reach this milestone,"" Rackspace Chief Executive Kevin Jones said in an interview before the stock started trading. 
""We're not really focused on today's stock price. We're more focused on the long term and the future,"" Jones added. 
Cloud companies such as  Ncino  Inc (O:NCNO) and  Kingsoft Cloud Holdings Ltd  (O:KC) have seen their share prices more than double since going public earlier this year. 
Rackspace has historically leased server space and helps corporations store and access data in the cloud, and in recent years, has expanded its business to include multicloud services.
Rackspace had been exploring an IPO for the last two years, but its weak organic growth and large debt due to its $4.3 billion leveraged buyout by Apollo in 2016 and subsequent acquisitions had stopped it from pursuing an IPO earlier.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and J.P. Morgan were the lead underwriters for the IPO.

BigCommerce has a way to go to catch up with its rivals. Revenue in the second quarter is estimated at between $35.5 million and $35.8 million. That compares to Shopify’s $714.3 million in sales for the second quarter.
Last week, Shopify reported quarterly earnings that beat estimates, with earnings per share of $1.05 compared to the average analyst forecast of 1 cent. Amazon also blasted through expectations when it reported last week, with earnings per share of $10.30 compared to the average forecast of $1.48.

166,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 01:09PM ET</span>",Democrats Demand More After White House Concessions on Stimulus,"(Bloomberg) -- Democrats are demanding more concessions from the White House if the two sides are going to meet their goal of striking a deal on new pandemic relief by the end of the week, throwing the timeline in question.
“While we have started to generate some forward momentum, we need our partners in the White House to go much further on a number of issues,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday.
Republicans put the blame on Democrats, saying they have refused to budge from their positions. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday that they “continue to push their $3 trillion-dollar wish-list that even their own Democratic colleagues brushed off as absurd.”
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said after Tuesday’s meeting with Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that the administration’s concessions were “far more substantial” that those made by Democrats.
The White House has offered $400 per week in supplemental unemployment benefits through Dec. 14, which the Democrats have rejected since they are insisting on $600 per week, according to people familiar with the details. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Meadows also put $200 billion in state and local aid -- including $105 billion in education money -- on the table, still far less than the $1 trillion Democrats were seeking. The White House also agreed on extending a moratorium on evictions through mid-December.
In response, Democrats have said they can accept $10 billion in postal service aid in one year instead of the $25 billion over three that was in the legislation passed by the House in May, according to a person familiar with their offer. Pelosi and Schumer are scheduled to meet Wednesday with Postmaster General Louis Dejoy on U.S. Postal Service funding needs.
After more than a week of negotiations with Mnuchin Mnuchin and Meadows, Schumer and Pelosi said they still have significant differences to bridge, including aid for renters and the enhanced unemployment benefit that was in the last stimulus bill but now has expired, he said.
”We still have a distance apart in terms of state and local” Pelosi said Wednesday on MSNBC. “I am confident we will have an agreement. The timing of it, I can’t say.”
Schumer and Pelosi are scheduled to meet again Wednesday with the two Trump administration officials. Democrats are sensing some advantage in the negotiations with the unemployment aid and other earlier stimulus measures running dry, the November election 90 days away and Republicans bickering over additional aid spending on top of the almost $3 trillion Congress previously approved.
Some lawmakers are skeptical that legislation can be produced and voted on by next week given the differences that remain. But there may be added urgency to get something done with signs indicating the economy is being weighed down by the pandemic. ADP Research Institute data released Wednesday showed payroll gains at U.S. companies slowed sharply in July, suggesting the pickup in coronavirus cases is putting brakes on the job market.
Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican leader, said that if no deal is reached by the end of the week, senators likely will be sent home while negotiators continue their work. They would be called back if there is something to later vote upon.
“If anything breaks, we would give people plenty of advance notice so they could get back,” Thune said.
The House is on a break now, but members have been told they would be called back with 24 hours notice to vote on any virus relief legislation.

169,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 12:27PM ET</span>","Barclays, JPMorgan Fight U.K. Investor Lawsuit Over FX Rigging","(Bloomberg) -- Investors suing  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and three other banks were given more time to go through evidence in a London lawsuit over the manipulation of foreign-exchange rates.
Justice Richard Jacobs said on Wednesday that the investors from pension funds and investment management firms needed additional scope to go over documents that will be submitted in a similar U.S. lawsuit. The material may help the investors bolster their claims that the lawsuit should cover a 10-year period.
The banks face lawsuits in the U.S. and U.K. over traders’ manipulation of benchmark foreign-exchange rates. More than a dozen financial institutions have paid about $11.8 billion in fines and penalties globally in regulatory probes, with another $2.3 billion spent to compensate customers and investors.
Before Jacobs’ ruling, lawyers for the banks criticized the investors’ case, telling the judge that the claims were “vague.”
“We’ve got a whole range of fundamental problems with this” case, Daniel Beard, a lawyer for JPMorgan, told the judge. The essence of what the banks “want to do is understand what the claims are against them. These are very serious allegations. We say they are seriously flawed.”
Wednesday’s hearing follows a decision by U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield in Manhattan in May to allow most of the claims in a suit filed by a group of 1,300 investment firms and local governments to go forward.
The EU probes covered two cartels that traders ran on online chat rooms, swapping sensitive information and trading plans that allowed them to make informed decisions to buy or sell currencies. Many of them knew each other, calling one chat room on the Bloomberg terminal the “Essex Express n’ the Jimmy” because all of the traders but one met on a commuter train from Essex to London. Other names for rooms were the “Three Way Banana Split” and “Semi Grumpy Old Men.”
While the EU probes focused on the period spanning 2007 to 2013, the U.S. proceedings include an earlier period from 2003 to 2007.
The investors in the U.K. case sought access to the material from the earlier time frame, arguing that these are not separate periods, but a “pattern of collusive behavior” over 10 years, said their lawyer, Marie Demetriou.
The EU is still probing possible collusion in a third chatroom, called “Sterling Lads,” that  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) was part of, according to filings prepared for the U.K. hearing. This chat was created by former Barclays trader Christopher Ashton, the Federal Reserve said in 2016, when it fined him $1.2 million and permanently banned him from U.S. banking. Ashton was acquitted of U.S. criminal charges in 2018.

Boeing shares were up 4.3%.
Despite the pandemic decimating air travel, adding to the fallout from a 16-month-old crisis over the 737 MAX grounding after fatal crashes, Smith said the U.S. planemaker was still focused on future investments including new jet development.

The deal is Blackstone's first acquisition out of Blackstone Capital Partners VIII, the largest-ever private equity fund that raised $26 billion from investors last year. 
Ancestry.com has more than 3 million paying customers in about 30 countries, and earns more than $1 billion in annual revenue. Launched in 1996 as a family history website, it harnessed advances in DNA testing and mobile phone apps in the following two decades to expand its offerings. 
Blackstone is buying Ancestry.com from private equity firms Silver Lake, Spectrum Equity and Permira. Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC, another Ancestry.com investor, said it will continue to maintain a significant minority stake in the company.

The acquisition's price tag represents a significant jump to Ancestry.com's valuation from four years ago, when Silver Lake and GIC invested in the Lehi, Utah-based company at a $2.6 billion valuation.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd (KS:005930) unveiled its latest Galaxy Note smartphone and new version of its foldable phone, the Z Fold 2, on Wednesday, hoping to regain ground against rivals Huawei and Apple Inc (O:AAPL) as the smartphone market begins to recover from its COVID-19 slump.
Samsung launched its previous premium model, the S20, in February at the start of the pandemic but since then has ceded its top ranking in the smartphone market to China's Huawei, as people opt for cheaper models in tough times. 
The Z Fold 2 has a 6.2-inch (15.75-cm) screen when folded to provide a full smartphone experience even when it is closed, Samsung announced during a livestreamed event. Its unfolded display measures 7.6 inches (19.3 cm).
The new iteration is thinner than the first Fold, and the hinge is improved to be more resilent, Samsung said. 
Samsung did not disclose the phone's price, but said more details and preorders will be available on Sept. 1. 
The new Note 20 boasts a larger screen at 6.7 inches (17 cm), 5G connectivity, enhanced writing features with its S-Pen stylus, and access to more than 100 console and PC games via a tie-up with  Microsoft Corp 's (O:MSFT) Xbox cloud service. 
It will go on sale on Aug. 21 in about 70 countries, including the United States, where the basic version will retail for $999, compared with its predecessor's $949. 
""It is an uncertain time to launch a new premium device given the challenging competitive and economic environments,"" said Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight Tech, adding that the ""eye-watering price"" could deter some buyers. 
Apple fans are unlikely to jump ship to the new Samsung model as the 5G iPhone is likely to be launched later this year, analysts say. 
Samsung posted a 29% on-year drop in shipments in the June quarter, the biggest fall among top vendors, according to researcher IDC. Apple, which launched the budget-friendly SE during the period, remained resilient with 11% on-year shipment growth, while Huawei posted only a 5% fall. 
The global smartphone market shrank about 16% on-year in the April-June quarter due to COVID-19 lockdowns and consumer caution, a larger contraction than in the first quarter, and is expected to improve only slightly in the second half, IDC said.

""Before the Covid-19 existed, Samsung’s flagship launch usually had a big splash. ... Even if things are recovering, the splash is not going to be as big as it was before,"" said Nabila Popal, research director at data provider IDC.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) has spent $2.07 billion on Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) shares since mid-July, after winning regulatory permission to increase what was already its largest common stock holding other than Apple Inc (O:AAPL).
In a regulatory filing on Tuesday night, Berkshire said it paid $337 million for about 13.6 million Bank of America shares between July 31 and Aug. 4.
It has purchased about 85.1 million of the bank's shares since July 20, giving it a total of 1.03 billion shares, or 11.9%, worth $25.8 billion as of Tuesday's close.
Berkshire is the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender's largest shareholder. It also invests in several other banks, including  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM)
Buffett's assistant did not immediately respond on Wednesday to a request for comment. Bank of America did not immediately respond to similar requests.
In April, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond approved Berkshire's application to boost its Bank of America stake as high as 24.9%, more than twice the usual 10% limit for investors, according to a Richmond Fed spokesman.
Berkshire would have to file to become a bank holding company to increase its stake beyond 24.9%.
Buffett began investing in Bank of America in 2011, purchasing $5 billion of preferred stock plus warrants to buy 700 million common shares, at a time many investors worried about the bank's capital needs.
Berkshire exercised the warrants in 2017 and sold preferred stock to cover the cost.
Adding Bank of America shares helps Berkshire reduce its cash stake, which totaled $137.2 billion on March 31.
The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate is also spending $4 billion to acquire some gas assets from Dominion Energy Inc (N:D), and may have repurchased billions of dollars of its own stock.

Berkshire is expected to report second-quarter results on Saturday.

(Reuters) - The United States government will pay Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) over $1 billion for 100 million doses of its potential coronavirus vaccine, as it stocks up on vaccine and drugs in an attempt to tame the pandemic.
The latest contract is priced at roughly $10 per vaccine dose produced by J&J, or around $14.50 per dose, including a previous $456 million the U.S. government promised to J&J for vaccine development in March. That compares with the $19.50 per dose that the U.S. is paying for the vaccine being developed by  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) and German biotech BioNTech SE (F:22UAy). 
J&J is studying both one and two-dose regimens of its vaccine. Pfizer and BioNTech's candidate would require two doses per person treated. The drugmaker said on Wednesday it would deliver the vaccine to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) on a not-for-profit basis to be used after approval or emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The U.S. government may also purchase an additional 200 million doses under a subsequent agreement. J&J did not disclose that deal's value.
As the race for vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 intensifies, the U.S. government has been signing deals to buy them through its Operation Warp Speed program. Other drugmakers who have signed deals include Sanofi SA (PA:SASY) and Regeneron Inc. (N:REGN) 
This is J&J's first deal to supply its investigational vaccine to a country. Talks are underway with the European Union, but no deal has yet been reached.
J&J's investigational vaccine is currently being tested on healthy volunteers in the United States and Belgium in an early-stage study.
There are currently no approved vaccines for COVID-19. More than 20 are in clinical trials.
Shares of J&J were up around 1 percent in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said on Wednesday it will sell $112 billion next week in notes and bonds and that it plans to continue to shift more of its funding to longer-dated debt in coming quarters, as it finances measures to offset the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic.
The Treasury said it expects its debt needs to moderate but remain elevated, after borrowing a staggering $2.753 trillion in the second quarter.
""Treasury continues to face unprecedented borrowing needs as a result of the federal response to COVID-19,” Brian Smith, Treasury's deputy assistant secretary for federal finance, said on a conference call.
The Treasury will sell $48 billion in three-year notes, $38 billion in 10-year notes and $26 billion in 30-year bonds next week as part of its quarterly refunding.
It said on Monday that it plans to borrow $947 billion in the third quarter, about $270 billion more than it previously estimated for the July-September period.
The federal agency will use ""long-term issuance as a prudent means of managing its maturity profile and limiting potential future issuance volatility,"" Smith said in a release.
As Treasury increases auction sizes, it will have larger increases in 7-year, 10-year, 20-year and 30-year notes and bonds, he said. 
Treasury has been raising extra money to fund trillions of dollars in coronavirus-related economic aid allocated by Washington. As of Tuesday, White House negotiators were trying to reach a deal with congressional Democrats to extend relief measures including unemployment benefits, liability protections for businesses and a moratorium on evictions.
Borrowing has spiked far above the quarterly record set during the 2008 financial crisis.
A declining economic outlook has driven down U.S Treasury yields across the curve to record or near-record lows, helping raise equity prices and lower borrowing costs.

(Reuters) -  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) said on Wednesday smaller volume agreements for its experimental coronavirus vaccine have been priced in the range of $32 to $37 per dose, higher than the price set by the U.S. deal for  Pfizer  Inc's (N:PFE) vaccine candidate. 
As the race to develop COVID-19 vaccines reach a decisive stage, with several candidates being tested in pivotal late-stage studies, pricing has come under increasing scrutiny. 
""We will be responsible on price well below (its) value during the pandemic,"" Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel said on a conference call, adding that larger volume agreements for its vaccine will be priced lower.
Last month, the U.S. government struck a deal for an experiment vaccine being developed by Pfizer and partner BioNTech SE (F:22UAy) that secures enough vaccine to inoculate 50 million Americans for about $40 a person. Moderna's two-dose vaccine regimen would cost between $64 and $74 per person.
Moderna, which has no drugs on the market, has received nearly $1 billion from the U.S. government under a plan to speed up vaccine development. It has not struck a supply agreement with the United States. 
The company said on Wednesday it was in talks with several countries for supply agreements for its vaccine, adding that it had already received about $400 million in deposits for eventual supply. 
Moderna said enrolment for its late-stage vaccine study that aims to include 30,000 people is on track to be completed in September. 
The company's vaccine candidate is one of the few that have already advanced to the final stage of testing. Effective vaccines are seen as essential to halting a pandemic that has claimed more than 700,000 lives worldwide.
Moderna said last month it plans to price its coronavirus vaccine in a way that ensures broad access and that it did not intend to conduct late-stage trials of the vaccine outside the United States.

Moderna shares fell 5% in early trading on Wednesday.

(Reuters) - Wendy's Co (O:WEN) saw its sales recover in June and July as several U.S. states eased lockdown restrictions, after the fast-food chain's quarterly profit narrowly beat Wall Street expectations, driven by its new breakfast items.
The company said the new menu, which included social media favorite the ""Baconator sandwich"", had a strong second quarter, at a time when other chains such as McDonald's (N:MCD) and Starbucks (O:SBUX) have said they are facing pressure as people working from home are increasingly cooking their meals.
""Despite breakfast being the hardest hit daypart in QSR (quick service restaurants category) since the beginning of the pandemic, our businesses continue to grow each month,"" Wendy's Chief Executive Officer Todd Penegor said.
Decline in the U.S. same-store sales in the second quarter was limited to 4.4% by a recovery towards the end of the quarter. In July, sales rose 8.2%, after a 5.1% growth in June.
Truist Securities analyst Jake Bartlett said the current trends give confidence that Wendy's will ""continue to thrive despite the COVID-19 crisis and quickly re-accelerate.""
The company also said it would invest $13 million more in the breakfast category, launched in March in the hopes of gaining customers from McDonald's, in the back half of the year.
Excluding items, Wendy's earned 12 cents per share in the second quarter ended June 28, scraping past estimates of 11 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Shares of the chain, up 7% this year, were down 4% in early trading as limited restaurant operations due to the pandemic dented sales in the quarter. 
Revenue fell about 8% to $402.3 million, missing estimates of $409.7 million. 

Wendy's also said on Wednesday it intended to resume share repurchases in 2020 after suspending it in March to conserve cash amidst declining sales.

MILAN (Reuters) - Investors in  Atlantia  (MI:ATL), including Italy's wealthy Benetton family, lined up on Wednesday to back a surprise move by the infrastructure group to amend a deal with the government over its Autostrade per l'Italia unit.
The move is the latest twist in a two-year battle over the future of Autostrade and comes just after Monday's opening of a new motorway bridge in Genoa to replace the Autostrade-managed viaduct that collapsed in 2018 with the loss of 43 lives.
Late on Tuesday, Atlantia said it had run into difficulties reaching agreement with state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) over the value of Autostrade under a government-backed plan in which CDP would take control of the unit as a first step to an eventual listing.
It said it was considering alternative plans, either to sell the whole 88% stake through a competitive auction or to split it off into a separate vehicle prior to a bourse listing.
The Benetton family, which controls Atlantia through a 30% stake, indicated on Wednesday it supported the group's proposal to withdraw from Autostrade ""in a market-friendly way and respecting the rights of all shareholders and stakeholders"".
It would consider the Autostrade stake that it would receive under the spin-off as a non-strategic asset and would sell the shares at market conditions, it said.
The statement from the family holding company Edizione appeared designed to ease concerns over the family's future role in Autostrade, an issue that became a source of political tension with the government.
Separately Atlantia's minority shareholders TCI Fund Management and Spinecap told Reuters they were supportive of the group's new proposal, adding the previous plan agreed with the government would violate free market principles.
""We believe the transaction (proposed in July) is unlawful,"" French investment company Spinecap said in a letter sent to Atlantia on July 28 and seen by Reuters. 

In the letter, Spinecap asked Atlantia's board to redesign the deal and added that any deal at an implied pre-money equity value below 12 billion euros for Autostrade ""must be rebuffed"".

Demand for the virtual healthcare provided by both companies has skyrocketed as the pandemic kept patients from visiting their doctors, sending shares in both companies surging this year and encouraging expectations for future growth.

One recent study estimated 46% of Americans now use telehealth to replace cancelled visits, up from just 11% in 2019, and Trump's order will reinforce its use in under-served rural areas and elsewhere in the months to come.
Pre-COVID-19, the total annual revenues of U.S. telehealth players were an estimated $3 billion. The study by consultants McKinsey & Company estimate up to $250 billion of current U.S. healthcare spend could become virtualized. 
Shares in Livongo, up 477% this year, gained 14% in premarket trade to race past the purchase price. Teladoc, whose access to capital has been bolstered by a doubling of the value of its own shares since January, dipped 4%. 
Gorevic will continue to head the new company, which will be called Teladoc Health and headquartered in Purchase, New York. It will have 2020 pro forma revenue of about $1.3 billion.
Teladoc shareholders will own about 58% of the new company, with the deal expected to close by the end of 2020.

Hospitals also rescheduled elective surgeries to reduce the burden on the healthcare system as coronavirus cases surged, benefiting health insurers including CVS Health and  Humana Inc  (N:HUM), which also beat quarterly profit estimates on Wednesday, as claims fell. 
Shares of CVS, which also operates drugstores, rose nearly 4% in premarket trade. 
The medical benefit ratio - the percentage of premiums paid out for medical services - at CVS' health insurance unit fell to 70.3% from 84% a year earlier. Sales at the unit rose 6.1% to $18.47 billion. 
CVS like other health insurers including industry bellwether UnitedHealth (N:UNH) has warned that costs may go up in the remainder of the year as Americans catch up on their postponed surgeries. 
Best known for its chain of pharmacies, CVS acquired a health insurance business through its 2018 deal for Aetna (NYSE:AET), and also operates a pharmacy benefit management unit. 
""Our earnings in this environment demonstrate the strength of our strategy and the power of our diversified business model,"" said CVS Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo in a statement. 
The company raised its full-year profit forecast to between $7.14 per share and $7.27 per share from $7.04 per share to $7.17 per share
Net income attributable to the company rose nearly 54% to $2.98 billion in the second-quarter ended June 30, compared with a year earlier

Activity in the world’s largest technology company “sticks out” over the past week, a repeat of the pattern seen in previous years when Apple split its stock, Christopher Brankin, chief executive officer of brokerage TD Ameritrade Asia Pte in Singapore, said in an interview Tuesday.
“It’s something that we’re seeing across our options here because of that announcement,” he said, referring to the use of derivatives to bet on more gains in Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL).
The iPhone maker’s quarterly report last week crushed Wall Street expectations amid pandemic demand for its products, and the company announced a four-for-one split for later this month to make its stock more accessible. The stock has risen for five straight days, adding more than 17% to $438.66.
Signals from the options market are flashing enthusiasm for Apple shares, such as unusually high relative prices for upside bets, according to RBC Capital Markets strategist Amy Wu Silverman.
Apple options are pricing in more upside risk versus downside than at any time this year, despite the stock having almost doubled from its mid-March lows, Chris Murphy, derivatives strategist at Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP, wrote in a note Monday. Smaller traders have been a big portion of such bets in recent months, according to Sundial Capital Research Inc.
That’s part of a wider fervor for the stay-at-home trade favoring some technology stocks. More than 82,000 users of the U.S. investing app Robinhood.com added Apple to their accounts in some form over the past week, according to website Robintrack.net, which aggregates data from the brokerage but isn’t affiliated with it.

191,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 08:05AM ET</span>",BMW loses almost $800 million as sales slide during lockdowns,"By Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BMW (DE:BMWG) expects to make a profit this year if demand continues to recover, despite posting a record loss for its car division in the second quarter after sales slumped 25% because of coronavirus lockdowns, it said on Wednesday.
The German manufacturer of BMWs, Minis and Rolls-Royces said sales had started to recover during the latest three-month period, including a 17% jump in deliveries in China, but the rebound would not fully make up for sales lost to COVID-19.
As a result of the sales slide, and higher costs for developing low-emission cars, BMW posted a pretax loss of 498 million euros, its first in over 11 years, and an operating loss of 666 million euros ($790 million) for the quarter.
Shares in BMW fell 3% following the results, with some analysts saying they had not expected such a big loss in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).
""What matters now is how robust this upward trend is and when individual markets will follow suit,"" said Chief Executive Oliver Zipse, adding that its overall cars sales in July were higher than last year. 
BMW said, however, that its outlook did not factor in the potential impact of a second wave of COVID-19 infections, nor the prospect of a more sustained or deeper recession than expected in its key markets.
Zipse said on a call that developments in the United States, which has the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide, were ""extremely worrying"".
Sales in the United States made up 12.6% of deliveries in the first half of 2020, down from 15.2% in 2020. Overall, BMW said it expected global demand for luxury cars to fall by a fifth this year.
'CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM'
The COVID-19 pandemic has already hit carmakers such as  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), Ford (N:F) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) particularly hard at time when the auto industry is ramping up spending to clean up their combustion engines as well as developing low-emission technologies to conform with stringent European anti-pollution rules.
BMW's EBIT margin for cars slumped to minus 10.4%, an historic low, down from 6.5% in the second quarter last year, though it maintained the forecast it made in May for a margin of 0% to 3% for the year as a whole.
By contrast, electric-only car manufacturer Tesla (O:TSLA) saw its automotive gross margin widen to 25.4% in the second quarter, up from 18.9% a year earlier, despite a 5% drop in deliveries.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Philippe Houchois said BMW's margin forecast for the year suggested a healthy recovery in the second half of 2020, even though the second-quarter results were below the consensus.
""We are now looking ahead to the second six-month period with cautious optimism and continue to target an EBIT margin between 0% and 3% for the automotive segment in 2020,"" Zipse said in a statement.

BMW reiterated that it expected to make a pretax profit in 2020, albeit well below 2019 levels and for car deliveries to customers to fall significantly this year.

The company's vaccine candidate is one of the few to be in the final stages of testing as drugmakers race to develop a safe and effective vaccine against the pandemic that has claimed more than 700,000 lives worldwide.
Last week, Moderna announced the start of a late-stage trial on 30,000 people to demonstrate that its vaccine was safe and effective, the final hurdle prior to regulatory approval. It has said the vaccine could be ready for widespread use by the end of this year.
The company, which ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments, said it was on track to complete enrollment in the study in September.
Moderna said last month it plans to price its coronavirus vaccine in a way that ensures broad access and that it did not intend to conduct late-stage trials of the vaccine outside the United States.
""As we pivot to a commercial stage company, we recognize the need for responsible pricing in the face of the pandemic,"" Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel said in a statement. 

The company, which has no drug on the market, has received nearly $1 billion from the U.S. government under a plan to speed up vaccine development.

In a joint agreement with global workers' union IndustriALL, Inditex reiterated a commitment to ensuring health and safety standards were met and collective bargaining rights and workers' rights to unionise maintained throughout its supply chains.
It has also committed to stable payment terms in a way that allows suppliers to honour payments to workers, it said.
The agreement builds on a partnership first signed in 2007 and last renewed in 2019, Inditex and IndustriALL said in a joint statement.
The pandemic and associated lockdowns have ripped a hole through the garment manufacturing sector, with many retailers cancelling orders as they closed stores around the world, leading to the shuttering of thousands of factories and huge job losses. 
In May, as stores closed across Europe and the United States in response to the coronavirus, Inditex said it had paid for all orders with suppliers, whether finished or in production. 

Inditex and IndustriALL, which represents 50 million mining, energy and manufacturing workers, said they would strengthen their commitments in order to minimise the impacts of the pandemic.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open on Wall Street on Wednesday, with the Dow on track for a fourth straight days of gains as Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) shares soared premarket following better than expected earnings, but gains were held in check as U.S. stimulus talks dragged on.
At 7:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), S&P 500 futures were up 18 points, or 0.7% and Nasdaq 100 futures added 35 points, or 0.3%. The Dow futures contract rose 180 points, or 0.7%.
The gains came after Wall Street ended higher following a volatile session on Tuesday, buoyed up by gains in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and energy stocks.
Among Dow components, Walt Disney jumped 6.1% in premarket trade after it reported revenue declines for its parks and its media networks were not as bad as feared. The entertainment giant squeezed out a quarterly profit despite taking a $5-billion charge due to the pandemic.
Investors were looking ahead to the ADP nonfarm payrolls report, due out at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT) which is expected to show that the private sector added 1.50 million jobs in July, slowing after a strong rebound of 2.37 million in June.
The ADP data is a precursor to Thursday’s weekly report on initial jobless claims and Friday’s government nonfarm payrolls report for July.
Both reports are expected to indicate that the U.S. economic activity is stalling amid a surge in COVID-19 infections in parts of the country, underlining the urgent need for more fiscal aid.
White House negotiators on Tuesday vowed to work ""around the clock"" with congressional Democrats to try to reach a deal on coronavirus relief package by the end of this week.

202,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 07:06AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Mexico power plant violated environmental law, documents show","By David Alire Garcia
TULA, Mexico (Reuters) - For at least four years, one of Mexico's largest power plants violated an environmental safeguard that prevents emissions of deadly pollutants, according to documents seen by Reuters.
The Tula thermoelectric plant north of Mexico City breached the legal limit for the amount of sulfur in the fuel oil it burned between 2016 and 2019, according to internal documents from the national electricity company, Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE), which owns and operates the plant.     
The sulfur content during each of those four years - detailed in state-run CFE's annual operations reports - was at least 3.9%, nearly double the 2% cap set by Mexico's energy regulatory commission for six industrial corridors, including the Tula area.     
While some Mexican environmentalists have long believed that the plant was breaking the sulfur content rules, the CFE's reports on plant operations that were seen by Reuters detail the violations. The reports are not publicly available.
Reuters could not determine whether the power plant has continued to use fuel oil containing excess sulfur this year.
Besides the high sulfur levels, the CFE documents show another violation: emissions of sulfur dioxide, a harmful air pollutant, are not being registered by the plant even though that is required by law.        
""The CFE shouldn't burn this fuel at 4%. The rule establishes that it should be at 2%,"" said Xochitl Galvez, who grew up near the Tula plant and is now a senator for the opposition National Action Party. 
The CFE did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The energy regulatory commission, which is meant to enforce the sulfur limits, also did not respond to questions.
Mexican law sets fines of between $82,000-$820,000 for breaches of contaminant limits for fuels, including the maximum sulfur content allowed.  
When high-sulfur fuel oil is burned without contaminant-capturing filters, massive amounts of particles and gases are released into the air that some scientific studies show can lead to premature death and more people developing respiratory diseases like chronic bronchitis as well as some cancers.
Energy experts say the plant is likely operating with few or no filters. Reuters could not independently confirm this.
The CFE did not respond to questions about premature deaths or whether the plant uses filters.
""They must not have hardly any controls on their stacks,"" said Jonathan Dorn, an emissions expert at U.S.-based consultancy Abt Associates, who works closely with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's power plant monitoring.
He described the Tula plant's 2019 emissions levels as ""crazy.""
The Tula plant's five chimneys belch out a steady stream of purplish-gray smoke at all hours, easily visible from its perimeter fence. An acrid smell fills the air, causing mild throat irritation. Next door lies Mexican state oil company Pemex's second-largest refinery, where the fuel oil is produced.
High sulfur fuel oil is produced by Mexico's refineries for a number of uses besides power generation.
Pemex's press office did not respond to requests for comment. 
    
CAPITAL SMOG
Some environmentalists and academics have linked emissions from the Tula plant to chronic poor air quality in Mexico City 58 miles (94 km) away where a frequent haze has not abated during the coronavirus lockdown despite sharply reduced traffic.
The violations at the CFE's 1,500 megawatt power plant, one of the three biggest in Mexico, mostly predate President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. 
Opposition politician Galvez, along with environmental scientists who have studied the Tula plant, said the continued violations during 2019 reflected an ongoing dependence on fossil fuels in Lopez Obrador's first year in government.
About 13% of Mexico's power comes from renewable sources, mostly wind and solar, according to energy ministry data.
Lopez Obrador's office did not respond to a request for comment. 
In the past the president has said he cares about a clean environment, while being unapologetic about the need to prioritize domestic supplies as he seeks to wean the country off foreign fuel imports.
His national energy plan, unveiled in June, called for ""making the most of fuel oil for electrical generation"" while taking unspecified steps to lower sulfur levels. 
CFE chief Manuel Bartlett told Reuters in a May interview that the company is committed to using cleaner energy, especially natural gas, but that such a transition will take time. The CFE is also looking to expand hyodroelectricity generation.""We want to eliminate fuel oil, but you can't do that from one day to the next,"" Bartlett said.
High levels of sulfur in oil burned for power create three especially dangerous air pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns (PM2.5). 
The CFE documents show that the Tula plant emitted 9,487 tonnes of PM2.5 in 2019. That made it the highest emitter in North America, according to a Reuters comparison with publicly-available U.S. and Canadian government data. The coal-fired Shawnee power plant in Kentucky was the top U.S. emitter, the comparison showed. 
Tula's PM2.5 emissions exceeded Shawnee's by nearly 30%. 
The Tennessee Valley Authority, a U.S. state-owned enterprise that operates the Shawnee plant, did not respond to a request for comment. 
Tula emitted 14,090 tonnes of nitrogen oxides last year, the documents showed, putting it in third place for the largest emissions of those contaminants in North America.
Following years of public pressure in Mexico, the Tula plant was upgraded from 2009-2016 to also use cleaner-burning natural gas. 

However, a natural gas pipeline that would supply Tula has stalled since 2015. Nearly all of the plant's power in 2019 came from burning 8.6 million barrels of fuel oil, the CFE documents show.

203,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 06:50AM ET</span>",Japan's climate change efforts hindered by biased business lobby: study,"By Aaron Sheldrick
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's powerful business lobby Keidanren is dominated by energy-intensive sectors that represent less than 10% of the economy, resulting in national policies that favour coal and hindering attempts to combat climate change, a new study said.
The influence of the country's electricity, steel, cement, car and fossil fuel sectors undermines Japan's attempts to meet its Paris Agreement commitments, according to the report by London-based data analysis company InfluenceMap.
The Keidanren, which has close ties with the trade and industry ministry as well as other government bodies, sits on expert panels and other forums where government policies are debated. It has acted as a 'central negotiating point' on climate policy for two decades, the report said.
While it claims to represent all of Japanese business, the claim ""clearly should be questioned on climate/energy policy,"" InfluenceMap said. It added the most powerful industries within Keidanren only employ about 2.7 million, while those with little influence employ 10 times that number.
Lobbying and consultation by business groups will be critical next year when the government reviews its strategic energy plan.
The Keidanren's influence was seen last year when it argued that a target proposed by the government to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050 was ""extremely ambitious"" and pushed for any new target to be a ""vision"", InfluenceMap said.
Japan later adopted a goal of achieving carbon neutrality as soon as possible in the latter half of this century, rather than an explicit 2050 emissions target.
Keidanren said in a statement to Reuters it could not comment on the study as it had yet to formally receive a copy. But it added it had made policy commitments to a low carbon society and the government's climate goals were consistent with Paris agreement goals.
InfluenceMap noted that other groups in Japan which count blue-chip firms from the retail, finance, tech and construction sectors among their members - such as the Japan Climate Initiative and Japan Climate Leaders' Partnership - have sharply criticised the government's climate change efforts.
The study's findings are ""mostly consistent with my personal experience as a policymaker in Japan to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol and to develop national legislation,"" Hikaru Kobayashi, who was vice minister for the environment from July 2009 to January 2011, told Reuters.
""What surprises me is that this remains unchanged today.""
Japan's coal use has surged to record levels in the years following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster that led to the shutdown of most of the country's reactors.
Japan is also the only G7 country working on a major rollout of coal power, with companies planning to build around 20 new coal-fired plants with total capacity of about 12,000 megawatts, within a decade, a Reuters survey showed last year.
Coal now generates 32% of Japan's electricity, although the government wants that proportion to fall to 26% and renewables to climb to 22-24% from around 18% currently by 2030.
For a graphic on Japan's coal plans, please see https://tmsnrt.rs/3i4JCdZ
Using government statistics, InfluenceMap ranked business sectors by economic importance and then assessed the influence of industry associations both within the Keidanren and outside the Keidanren.
It chose 50 groups for the purposes of the study, ranking them using two metrics - how supportive a group is of climate policies that meet Paris goals and how intensely a group engages with the government on climate policy.

TIM on Tuesday postponed to the end of August a decision over the sale of a minority stake in its so-called secondary landline, after Rome requested it negotiates a wider deal to merge its network assets with those of Open Fiber.
A Milan-based trader said TIM's decision to extend the deadline showed a commitment to reaching a deal with Open Fiber.
""We have never been so close to reaching a deal on the single-network,"" Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) Securities analysts wrote.
Despite months of talks with Open Fiber, a joint venture owned by state utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI) and state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), issues regarding governance and regulation have so far stood in the way of a potential deal.
CDP also owns also a 10% stake in TIM, whose shares were up 3.4% at 0837 GMT, outperforming Milan's blue-chip index (FTMIB). TIM shares have lost nearly 31% this year.
UBS analysts, however, cautioned against excessive optimism.

209,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 05:15AM ET</span>",Virgin Atlantic Airways seeks U.S. Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection,"By David Shepardson and Kate Holton
WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd (VA.UL) is seeking protection from creditors in the United States under Chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which allows a foreign debtor to shield assets in this country, according to a court filing on Tuesday. 
Virgin Atlantic's filing in U.S. bankruptcy court in the southern district of New York said it has negotiated a deal with stakeholders ""for a consensual recapitalization"" that will get debt off its balance sheet and ""immediately position it for sustainable long-term growth.""
In July, Virgin Atlantic said it has agreed a rescue deal with shareholders and creditors worth 1.2 billion pounds ($1.57 billion) to secure its future beyond the coronavirus crisis.
The U.S. filing is an ancillary proceeding tied to a separate action filed in a British court, where Virgin Atlantic obtained approval Tuesday to convene meetings of affected creditors to vote on the plan on Aug. 25.
An airline spokeswoman said the restructuring plan was before a British court ""to secure approval from all relevant creditors before implementation."" She added the ""process is proceeding with the support of the majority of our creditors."" 
Bloomberg reported Virgin Atlantic told a London court it could run of money in September if a restructuring deal is not approved.
Non U.S.-companies use Chapter 15 to block creditors who want to file lawsuits or tie up assets in the United States.
In July, the airline said its private deal with stakeholders eliminates the need for support from the British government that billionaire founder Richard Branson had sought. The reorganization is expected to be completed towards the end of this summer and be spread across the next 18 months.
The airline, 51% owned by Branson’s Virgin Group and 49% by U.S. airline Delta, closed its Gatwick base and cut more than 3,500 jobs to contend with the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has grounded planes and hammered demand for air travel. 
""Delta said it supported the plan and was ""optimistic"" that it would help Virgin Atlantic ""maintain its position"" in the travel market.
Virgin Atlantic said it needed to recapitalize ""to not only survive the exigent threats posed by the COVID-19 global pandemic but to thrive once the immediate global health crisis passes.""
It added in a court filing reservations are down 89% from a year ago and current demand for the second half of 2020 is at approximately 25% of 2019 levels. Virgin Atlantic also owns Virgin Atlantic Holidays, a tour operator business and Virgin Atlantic Cargo. 

The high-profile Branson had attracted criticism after calling for government help for Virgin Atlantic to survive the downturn.

The company said it expected to deliver a headline pretax loss of between 70 million pounds ($91.60 million) and 75 million pounds for the year ending Aug. 31, compared with a headline pretax profit of 155 million pounds last year.

The central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 4.25% in July. With inflation seen rising towards the bank's 4% target from 3.2% in the coming months, deposit rates have become less lucrative and the cost of borrowing has come down.
Deputy Chairman of VTB's management board Anatoly Pechatnikov said the bank expects mortgage loans to grow by 12% this year, but stressed that the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic meant it was too early to give any exact forecasts.
In May, VTB board member Dmitry Pyanov said the bank ran two scenarios, with retail lending increasing by 1.8% in the base scenario and declining by 2.7% in the worst-case scenario.
Pechatnikov said the short-term savings market was shrinking, forecasting a decline of 2% for the year. He added that inflation and interest rate dynamics could encourage outflows from deposit accounts.
""We, of course, run the risk that our real return on deposits, taking inflation into account, will return to the situation of 1995-1996, when no one took deposits seriously as a source of savings and growth because inflation exceeded the deposit rate,"" he said.
""If this continues, people will look for an alternative to deposits as forms of saving.""

(Reuters) - European shares rose on Wednesday as positive earnings and the huge quantities of stimulus coursing through the financial system again overshadowed concerns about the surge in coronavirus cases in Europe and the United States.
Sectors considered most exposed to an economic downturn such as travel & leisure (SXTP), mining (SXPP), oil & gas (SXEP) and industrial companies led the morning surge in Europe. 
The broader pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 0.8%, while euro zone stocks (STOXXE) gained 1.0%.
Ahold Delhaize NV (AS:AD), a major operator of supermarket chains in the United States and Europe, hit a record high as it raised its 2020 sales outlook after coronavirus lockdowns drove more traffic through its stores and online delivery services.
German residential real estate company Vonovia (DE:VNAn) rose 3.2% as it announced an 8% rise in first-half core profits and confirmed its guidance for the year, boosting the sector (SX86P).
Bank of Ireland (I:BIRG) surged 10.5% after it said it was beginning to see some signs of recovery, while analysts pointed to an income outlook for 2020 that was better than indicated.
""Earnings season is helping support risk appetite as has economic data,"" said Edward Park, deputy chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald Asset Management. ""That seems enough at the moment to offset the uncertainty about the U.S. case growth and pickup in European cases.""
A survey of purchasing managers earlier this week showed European manufacturing activity returned to a modest expansionary territory in July, however the rebound in the bloc's service industry was not as sharp as expected.
""Manufacturing PMIs earlier this week is certainly helping the cyclical story, but there is temporary nature to the current outperformance,"" said Park.
The positive mood helped investors look past a worsening of diplomatic ties between the United States and China and rising COVID-19 cases in parts of Europe and the United States. 
Among the decliners, BMW (DE:BMWG) slid 2.5% as lockdowns pushed the carmaker to a second-quarter operating loss as deliveries of luxury cars fell by 25% during the period.
British life insurer  Legal & General  (L:LGEN) also fell 2.5% as it blamed the coronavirus pandemic for a 2% fall in first-half operating profit.

Companies listed on the STOXX 600 are expected to report a decline of 67.5% in second-quarter earnings, down from a drop of 58.3% forecast the week before, according to Refinitiv data.

The lay-off plan, which is subject to changes, would apply across all functions, the airport operator said.

CPH, the biggest airport in the Nordic region, said talks with union representatives would be held in the coming weeks to decide on the expected redundancies. 
Separately, CPH reported a 55.5% drop in revenue for the first six months as a result of the coronavirus crisis.

215,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 04:09AM ET</span>",BP Walks Away From the Oil Supermajor Model It Helped Create,"(Bloomberg) -- In the late 1990s, BP (NYSE:BP) Plc boss John Browne used an oil-price slump to usher in the age of the supermajor, buying U.S. rivals Amoco and Arco to create a transatlantic giant. He kicked off a round of mergers that saw his company and four others dominate the industry --  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). and  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) in the U.S., Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc and Total SA (NYSE:TOT) in Europe.
That era ended on Tuesday when Bernard Looney, the third chief executive officer since Browne’s swashbuckling reign ended in 2007, declared BP would be a supermajor no more and proposed a very different blueprint for the oil company of the future.
Just six months after taking the helm, Looney has put meat on the bones of his plans to make BP compliant with the Paris accord on climate change, saying he’ll cut dividends in half, shrink oil and gas output by 40% over the next decade and spend as much as $5 billion a year building one of the world’s largest renewable-power businesses.
Where Browne created a global model, Looney’s strategy shows the oil industry is splitting in two.
On one side of the Atlantic, BP, Shell and Total are trying to make themselves going concerns for a low-carbon age, diluting their fossil-fuel businesses with plans to build significant revenues from renewable energy. Exxon and Chevron -- insulated from the pressure applied by European investors and politicians -- are charting a different course: keep pumping as profitably as possible and hand the cash back to investors. Like Big Tobacco, they’re increasingly courting shareholders willing to put returns above the harm their product causes.
Pay Out or Diversify
“BP had two choices,” said Brian Scott-Quinn, emeritus professor at Henley Business School in southern England, who’s written on financial markets and climate change. “First, simply paying out the maximum dividend it can in the future by not investing in the future at all. Alternatively, it can diversify on a much larger scale.”
Looney described his seismic shift as making an integrated oil company into an integrated energy company.
“You have to knit together lots of different energy sources,” Looney said in a Bloomberg TV interview on Wednesday. “We are natural gas, we’re in solar, we’re in wind, we have one of the world’s largest trading organizations.”
It’s a complete change of direction for a company that raised the dividend as recently as January and has been hammered by the post-pandemic crash in oil prices. And there are plenty of risks ahead.
BP concedes that power projects still make lower returns than oil and gas investments -- one reason why the board agreed to a lower dividend. And management has acknowledged that hydrocarbon production will probably remain BP’s main source of earnings for “the next several years,” funding its shift toward cleaner energy.
It’s also unclear what competitive advantage an oil company brings to building wind farms and solar parks; traditional power utilities have had a long head-start.
But there are dangers for Exxon and Chevron too. As alarm over global warming increases, their universe of potential investors may keep shrinking, especially if Joe Biden takes the White House in November and resets U.S. energy policy. As this quarter’s record losses show, if the post-Covid slump in crude prices is sustained, generating meaningful returns from oil and gas won’t be easy. A decade ago, Exxon was the most valuable U.S. corporation. Today it ranks 41st.
See also: Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Overtakes Exxon’s Market Value in Symbolic Energy Shift
“There’s definitely a division between the Europeans, who are much more committed to meeting the climate agenda,” and the Americans, said Panmure Gordon & Co. analyst Colin Smith. Their success will depend on how attractive the pivot in investments is perceived to be, relative to continued spending on oil and gas, he said.
Unlike their European peers, Exxon and Chevron have managed to bat away investor pressure thus far. Both companies, backed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, have resisted requests for shareholders to vote on their emission strategies.
But they’ve been struggling with meager returns after investing heavily in megaprojects around the world for a decade, leaving them wholly unprepared for the era of cheap oil that began in 2014. Slow to realize the transformational effect of the shale revolution that happened on their doorstep, Exxon and Chevron are only now understanding that they must become more nimble to respond to market conditions, rather than dictate them.
Sticking With Oil
Under their current CEOs, neither U.S. major has the will to follow the Europeans down the green path. Both plan to stick with oil and gas long-term, tempered only by small clean-energy technology bets. For them, rushing to renewables -- where they have no competitive advantage and see smaller returns in a more regulated industry -- is not the answer.
Yet in Europe, BP’s newly fleshed out plans will no doubt add pressure on Shell, which also announced ambitions earlier this year to slash its carbon emissions by 2050 and increasingly turn to renewables. The Anglo-Dutch major has promised more detail on that shift, which will ultimately result in it only doing business with emission-free companies.
For the European majors, the success of their strategy depends in part on governments maintaining the scale of policy support needed to make the energy transition happen. With countries around the world pledging greener economies as they emerge from the devastation of the coronavirus, BP may have chosen its moment wisely.
“If ever there was a moment to reset, this was it,” said Luke Parker, vice president of corporate analysis at consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd. “Several factors have converged to make it possible: coronavirus and everything that comes with it; a strategic pivot to net-zero on the horizon” and a “new leadership with credit in the bank.”

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Gold scaled a new high on Wednesday as a weaker dollar and falling bond yields burnished its safe-haven appeal, while shares ticked higher as investors turned their focus to stepped-up monetary and fiscal support globally.
Spot gold  jumped to a record high of $2,030.72 per ounce on Wednesday as bond yields hit new lows. Prices have soared about 33% this year.
Risk assets such as equities have surged in recent months on massive policy stimulus from central banks and governments, but gold has also rallied in a sign of heightened uncertainty around the long-term effects of the global health crisis.
European futures (STXEc1) started in green with Germany's DAX futures (FDXc1) up 0.4% and those for France's CAC40 (FCEc1) up 0.2%. Futures for London's FTSE (FFIc1) rose 0.37% while E-minis for the S&P 500 (ESc1) reversed early losses to climb 0.2%.
Analysts said equities would struggle a bit until the U.S. Congress agrees on a stimulus package and ahead of corporate earnings from tech giants later in the week.
White House negotiators have vowed to work ""around the clock"" to reach a spending deal by the end of the week.
Markets also latched on to comments from the president of Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco that the U.S. economy will need more support than initially thought, sending long-term Treasury yields into a downward spiral. 
""Failure to agree to another round of stimulus would hit the U.S. economy hard at a time when high-frequency data suggests it is losing some momentum,"" said Tapas Strickland, analyst at Melbourne-based National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY). 
The United States has reported more than 4.7 million coronavirus cases and over 157,000 deaths, the highest globally.

Japan's Nikkei, off 0.3% and Australia's benchmark index (AXJO), down 0.6%, were notable underperformers in Asia while Chinese shares were mildly weaker though still near a recent five-year peak. (CSI300)
South Korea's Kospi <.KSII> bucked the trend to hit its highest level since October 2018.
On Wall Street, the Dow (DJI) had ended up 0.6% on Tuesday, the S&P 500 (SPX) rose 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 0.4%.
""Significantly increased odds"" of more monetary policy stimulus from the U.S. Federal Reserve is a key driver of equities although the rally has been reined in by stretched valuations, Mizuho analysts wrote in a note.
More central bank support is also dragging U.S. Treasury yields lower, led by the long-end of the curve, and helping ""fire-up gold's glitter"", they added.
GREENBACK UNDER PRESSURE
The dollar was under pressure  with the safe-haven Japanese yen  rising to 105.64 as the bond market's dim view of the U.S. recovery sent real yields further into negative territory and nominal yields near record lows. [US/]
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar  has risen more than 2% so far this year while the euro (EUR=) has climbed over 5% against the greenback.
The Aussie was last up 0.3% at $0.7184 while the common currency was inching toward a two-year high at $1.1811, buttressed by hardening perception that the U.S. rebound is lagging Europe.
Investors are now waiting for an Aug. 15 video conference where senior U.S. and Chinese officials are set to review a trade deal and likely air mutual grievances, according to sources.

220,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 02:31AM ET</span>",Britain's banks brace for $22 billion loan losses as outlook darkens,"By Iain Withers and Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's banks took a gloomier view than almost all their European peers in their second quarter earnings, as coronavirus fears, Brexit and low interest rates caused them to bake tougher ""worst-case"" scenarios into their risk models.   
Investors had expected a torrid set of half-year results, but  Barclays  (L:BARC),  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN), Lloyds (L:LLOY), NatWest Group (L:NWG) and HSBC (L:HSBA) fell short of these low expectations.
Provisions for potential loan losses across the five banks topped $22 billion, blowing past analyst forecasts and increasing selling pressure on shares already hammered by the pandemic this year.
By contrast, France's  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) beat analyst forecasts, benefiting from bumper trading volumes as well as relatively modest provisions.
HSBC and Lloyds were punished for poor results, with shares in both banks plumbing their lowest levels in 11 and 8 years respectively.
All five UK banks have under-performed, falling by between 42% and 55% this year compared to a 36% fall in the European banking index (SX7P). 
""The UK banks are facing a more significant economic drop than most Europeans as the UK has faced a bigger shock from the COVID-19 pandemic, and that has fed through into provision levels,"" said Patrick Hunt, partner at consultancy Oliver Wyman.
The British economy is forecast to shrink 11.5% this year, while the euro area contracts 9.1%, according to OECD forecasts in June.
Other factors weighing on UK banks include a relatively higher exposure to unsecured consumer lending, a larger drop in central bank rates and the potential for a ""no deal"" exit from Brexit transition arrangements at the end of 2020, analysts said.
The roll out of further lockdowns across the north of England in response to a rise in infections also threatens to derail the country's nascent economic recovery and damage bank balance sheets further.
TOUGH CHOICES
NatWest and Lloyds gave guidance that loan-loss provisions should be lower in the second half of the year, raising hopes the country's banks may have ""kitchen sinked"" provisioning and got ahead of European rivals.
But they also warned the outlook could deteriorate further and drastically downgraded their worst case forecasts for the economy, predicting GDP drops of as much as 17% in 2020.
The heftier provisioning among British banks relative to their European rivals was largely because the former incorporated gloomier worst-case forecasts into their economic models. 
Lloyds, for example, said Britain's GDP could tumble 17.2% in a worst scenario compared with a 7.8% fall previously modelled as the extreme downside case when the bank reported results in April. 
While European rivals did not disclose their models in as much detail,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) allowed for a more modest 2 percentage point swing to the downside in German GDP from the base case in its adverse scenario.
That disparity is reflected in the yields banks are paying on their debt. 
Deutsche Bank's bonds maturing in August 2023  were trading at a yield of 0.03% on Tuesday, 38 basis points lower than a comparable Barclays September 2023 note . In January, Barclays' yield was trading lower than that of its German counterpart.
""Asset quality in the UK appears to be deteriorating faster than in Europe and you are seeing that reflected in the bonds,"" said Filippo Alloatti, a credit analyst and portfolio manager at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI).
NatWest chief financial officer Katie Murray said the bank's worst case took account of both further lockdowns to control the spread of the virus and a disruptive Brexit.
HSBC said its business in Britain, where it took a $1.5 billion charge against expected credit losses, had been particularly hard-hit and it would look to accelerate cost-cutting plans including redundancies.
Tom Merry, head of financial strategy at Accenture (NYSE:ACN), said banks are prioritising cost-cutting and readying restructuring and debt collection operations - including improving credit risk modelling to pick up on red flags - in preparation for a tough second half.
Cost-cutting is likely to include further branch and office closures, Merry said, with any investment spend ploughed in to digital services. 
""If there's one good thing to come from this for banks it's that if they are able to accelerate digital transformation they will be stronger out the other side.""

LONDON (Reuters) - An investor group managing more than $16 trillion on Wednesday launched the world's first step-by-step plan to help pension funds and others align their portfolios with the Paris Agreement on climate change.
Many investors have pledged high-level support to the goals of the 2015 Paris deal, but the ""Net Zero Investment Framework"" is the first to lay out the steps they need to take to ensure the commitment is backed up by the necessary action.
Specific targets could include increasing the percentage of assets invested in low-carbon passive indexes and ensuring the leaders of investee companies link pay to climate-related targets. 
""Countries, cities and companies around the globe are committing to achieve the goal of net zero emissions and investors need to show similar leadership,"" said IIGCC Chief Executive Stephanie Pfeifer
""The willingness is there, but until now the investment sector has lacked a framework enabling it to deliver on this ambition.""
Since the Paris deal was struck in 2015, investors have launched a number of initiatives to help them better manage climate-related risks.
While many were useful, the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) said its framework was the first to give investors practical guidance on how to both decarbonise portfolios and boost investments in solutions to climate change.
Developed with input from 70 global investors, including bond giant PIMCO and Dutch pension investor APG, the plan sets concrete targets at the portfolio and asset class level and also addresses asset allocation, engagement and lobbying.

The first phase of the framework, which will now go out to consultation, covers listed equities, credit, sovereign debt, real estate and strategic asset allocation. A later phase will look at addressing private equity and infrastructure.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening slightly higher Wednesday, with investors wary of taking positions ahead of key economic releases, amid stalemate in Washington over the latest relief bill and as the earnings season continues.
At 2:10 AM ET (0610 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.1%, while CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1%.
The markets continue to look to the U.S. Congress for lawmakers to agree to another round of stimulus to help the American economy, the world’s largest and key driver.
U.S. Treasury Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday that the goal is to strike a deal on legislation by the end of the week, but it remains to be seen whether Republicans and Democrats can reach an agreement on the package’s price tag.
Wednesday sees an abundance of economic data releases on both sides of the Atlantic which should inform the global recovery debate.
In the euro area, final services PMI number should recover this important sector is back in expansion territory, while retail sales for June are expected to show another solid increase.
In the U.S., the non-farm ADP jobs report is expected to show a gain of 1.5 million workers, down from 2.369 million in June, and will be studied carefully ahead of Friday’s official monthly jobs report. 
Meanwhile, the global death toll from Covid-19 surpassed 700,000 on Wednesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, with the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico leading the rise in fatalities.
In corporate news, BMW (DE:BMWG) said it still expected an operating profit for the full year even as coronavirus lockdowns pushed the carmaker to a second-quarter operating loss as deliveries of luxury cars fell 25% during the period.
Also, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) posted a 21% decline in second-quarter profit, as risk provisions rose sharply to 469 million euros from 178 million euros, and the German bank said it expects to make a loss this year.
Oil prices were largely unchanged Wednesday, after previously climbing to the highest levels in nearly two weeks following an explosion at Lebanon’s capital Beirut and a hefty U.S. inventory draw.
The blast, which authorities say was caused by highly explosive materials at the port, raised fears of instability in the volatile region, while the American Petroleum Institute reported a 8.59 million-barrel decline in U.S. crude inventories last week, suggesting healthy demand in the country.
That said, the official U.S. government inventories tally will be released later Wednesday, while coronavirus cases continue rising in the United States, with dozens of states having had to pause or scale back plans to reopen their economies.
U.S. crude futures traded unchanged at $41.70 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.1% to $44.48.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Health Information Technology has raised nearly $1.3 billion in Hong Kong's largest follow-on share sale since 2015, and industry experts say this could prompt more firms to tap investors for cash in the Asian financial hub.
The Chinese company, an arm of internet retail giant Alibaba Group, said on Wednesday it would issue 499 million new shares priced at HK$20.05 ($2.59) apiece, an 8% discount to the stock's HK$21.80 closing price in Hong Kong on Tuesday. 
Alibaba Health shares were down 2.75% at HK$21.20 in the first session since the deal was finalised.
The size of the deal was increased by 25% during the institutional bookbuild overnight on high demand from investors. This is the largest ever healthcare follow-on in Hong Kong.
The transaction, according to experts, could trigger more capital raisings in Hong Kong as companies take advantage of positive sentiment towards healthcare stocks amid the coronavirus pandemic.
""Follow-on deals can be done very quickly, it comes down to sentiment and price,"" said a capital markets lawyer, who could not be named because he was not authorised to speak to media.
""Companies in healthcare and biotech are doing very well, I think we will see more deals like this happening in Hong Kong.""
The deal was the largest Hong Kong follow-on share sale since CSPC Pharmaceutical Group's $1.26 billion transaction in 2015, Refinitiv data showed.
Ahead of the Alibaba Health deal, Hong Kong's equity capital markets volumes for 2020 stood at $42.7 billion versus $22.3 billion at the same time last year, Dealogic data shows.

Alibaba Health said the cash would be used to develop its pharmaceutical e-commerce business, which has benefited from the growth of the online service sector amid the health crisis.

Inbound shipments rose to 823,000 tones from a month earlier in July as demand from the food services industry grew following the easing of lockdown rules, according to G.G. Patel, managing partner of GGN Research. That’s the highest since September and compares with 812,805 tons in July 2019.
A jump in purchases by India will likely trim stockpiles in top producers Indonesia and Malaysia, potentially further boosting palm oil prices that have advanced more than 20% so far this quarter. Reserves in Malaysia likely tumbled to a three-year low in July as production shrank and exports surged, according to a Bloomberg survey.
Palm oil consumption by restaurants and hotels suffered in India after the government imposed the world’s most stringent stay-at-home rules in March to curb the spread of the coronavirus among its 1.3 billion people. The restrictions are gradually being lifted.
Soybean oil imports in July are estimated to have increased to 484,000 tons from 331,264 tons a month earlier, Patel said. Sunflower oil buying fell to 199,000 tons from 268,128 tons. Edible oil imports probably totaled 1.51 million tons, compared with 1.16 million tons a month earlier, Patel said.

226,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 11:35PM ET</span>","Exclusive: U.S. pursues nearly $13 billion of claims in Purdue Pharma opioid probes, sources say","By Mike Spector
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors are pursuing possible penalties of nearly $13 billion to resolve investigations of OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma after uncovering evidence of criminal and civil misconduct stemming from the company's alleged role in fueling the nation's opioid crisis, people familiar with the matter said.
U.S. Justice Department officials outlined additional details of their ongoing investigations of the company, controlled by the wealthy Sackler family, in paperwork filed last week with a federal bankruptcy court in White Plains, N.Y., which has not yet become public, the people said.
As with other Purdue creditors, the Justice Department had to meet a July 30 deadline to assert financial claims against the company. The initial claims seek about $10 billion in criminal penalties, consisting of a fine exceeding $6 billion and a forfeiture of more than $3 billion, as well as a civil penalty of nearly $3 billion, one of the people said. 
The size of the claims represent the upper limit of penalties federal prosecutors might seek, and the ultimate sums paid to resolve the investigations are likely to be far lower, the people said. 
The Justice Department is among thousands of creditors vying to extract money from Purdue, which has a liquidation value of only a bit more than $2 billion. Purdue has offered to settle widespread opioid litigation in a deal it values at more than $10 billion. 
That includes $3 billion from the Sacklers and value derived from the Stamford, Connecticut-based firm transforming into a public benefit company run on behalf of plaintiffs that would donate addiction treatment drugs and opioid overdose-reversal medications under development.
Purdue filed for bankruptcy protection nearly a year ago and received court approval to halt more than 2,600 lawsuits brought by cities, counties, states, hospitals and other plaintiffs alleging the company and the Sacklers were major contributors to the U.S. opioid epidemic. The company and family have denied the allegations.
As part of the criminal probe, Justice Department officials are scrutinizing Purdue's alleged encouragement of illegal opioid prescriptions, some of the people said. U.S. prosecutors are focused on possible conspiracy charges and alleged violations of anti-kickback and drug safety laws, they said.
A separate civil investigation is focused in part on the company's alleged defrauding of government healthcare programs such as Medicare, one of the people said. 
Justice Department officials and lawyers for the company and family have held discussions about resolving the probes and details, including the size of any financial penalties prosecutors might seek, could change, the people said. 
Neither Purdue nor the Sacklers have currently been charged with criminal wrongdoing or civil violations in the Justice Department investigations, and federal prosecutors have not yet decided whether to bring cases, they said. 
Purdue said it is cooperating with the Justice Department probes and in discussions to resolve them, but declined to comment further. A lawyer for the Raymond Sackler family said the family acted ethically and responsibly at all times, but declined to comment on the Justice Department's filings. Representatives for another group of Sacklers had no immediate comment. 
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. 
Purdue has been in the Justice Department's crosshairs before, when the company and three executives pleaded guilty in 2007 to charges of misbranding OxyContin to resolve a case that also included more than $600 million in penalties.
The Justice Department's current claims could significantly affect ongoing settlement discussions among Purdue, the Sacklers, and thousands of U.S. communities that have sued the company and family. Plaintiffs are seeking billions of dollars in damages to address harm from opioids.
Resolving the Justice Department probes is a condition of Purdue's proposed settlement, and penalties U.S. officials seek could affect how much money plaintiffs receive to address a public health crisis that claimed the lives of nearly 450,000 people between 1999 and 2018, according to the latest U.S. data. 
The lawsuits against Purdue and, in some cases, the Sacklers allege they aggressively marketed prescription painkillers while misleading doctors and patients about their addiction and overdose risks. 
Purdue has said U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved labels for the company's opioids carried warnings about risk and abuse associated with treating pain. Purdue and the Sacklers have denied allegations in lawsuits that they contributed to the opioid crisis, and have pointed to heroin and fentanyl as more significant culprits than prescription painkillers.
Health experts have said many people turned to drugs like heroin only after first becoming addicted to prescription opioids.

More than 20 states led by Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut initially objected to the settlement proposal from Purdue and the Sacklers, wanting a larger contribution from the family and more details on their finances. Plaintiffs are currently involved in discussions overseen by court-appointed mediators about how to allocate settlement proceeds.

Square's Cash App saw a 167% spike in transactions in the second quarter ended June 30 as the coronavirus-triggered lockdown forced more Americans to shop online, while people also signed up to receive government aid. 
The Cash App, which directly competes with  PayPal Holdings Inc 's (O:PYPL) Venmo app, allows users to send money to each other for free. The app charges fees to businesses when users choose to instantly deposit money from the app into their bank accounts, rather than wait several days.
Square, founded and led by  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey, was initially expected to report second-quarter earnings on Aug. 5. 
The company said it released the figures due to ""early external access of the company's quarterly financials"". 
The payments processor posted a loss of $11.5 million, or 3 cents per share, compared with a loss of $6.7 million, or 2 cents per share last year.
Its subscription and services-based revenue, which includes earnings from Square's software offerings, rose 38% to $346 million.

228,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 09:35PM ET</span>",Trump's bid for a piece of Microsoft-TikTok deal could spur legal action,"By Alexandra Alper and Echo Wang
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's unprecedented demand that the United States get a cut of the proceeds from the forced sale of Chinese internet giant ByteDance's short-video app TikTok is based on an interpretation of U.S law that regulatory lawyers say may be open to challenges.
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a U.S. government panel that reviews deals for potential national security risks, has given ByteDance until Sept. 15 to negotiate a sale of TikTok to  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), amid concerns over the safety of personal data that the app handles under its Chinese parent. 
Microsoft has said it is seeking to buy the assets of TikTok in North America, Australia and New Zealand. It has not disclosed how much it is willing to pay, though sources previously told Reuters that ByteDance executives value all of TikTok at more than $50 billion. 
""A very substantial portion of that price is going to have to come into the Treasury of the United States because we're making it possible for this deal to happen,"" Trump told reporters on Monday.
CFIUS legislation gives the U.S. government broad authority to seek mitigation from companies that are jeopardizing national security, legal experts said. 
While CFIUS has never before sought a cut from the proceeds of a divestiture it has ordered, the White House could argue that imposing a fee on Bytedance would deprive it of resources that would otherwise support China's government on technology initiatives that could harm U.S. interests, some of the legal experts added. 
""It's certainly inconsistent with the intent of Congress ... and with CFIUS's long-standing concern to maintain a reputation for acting apolitically and solely on grounds of national security, but it's not clear that it's outside the president's statutory authority,"" said Paul Marquardt, a regulatory lawyer at Cleary Gottlieb.
The White House, the Treasury Department, Bytedance and Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
U.S. law states that presidential decisions blocking deals on national security grounds are not subject to judicial reviews. However, a legal challenge is possible under the fifth amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits the government from seizing property without just compensation, as well as other laws, legal experts said. 
While a previous fifth amendment challenge to a CFIUS order had limited success, this would be the first time a challenge could be mounted against the U.S. government imposing a deal fee, the experts added. 
“This is akin to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act but on U.S. soil, where the U.S. government would be able to require what is tantamount to a bribe in order to obtain a regulatory approval for a business transaction,” DLA Piper lawyer Nicholas Klein said. 

It is not clear if Trump will make good on his demand for a slice of the TikTok deal proceeds. ""I'm not sure it's a specific concept that will be followed through,"" White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Fox Business News on Tuesday.

The company's shares closed down 3.61% at $14.40 after the Wall Street Journal reported earlier that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would investigate the deal.
Trump told reporters the concept of the arrangement was good because it would help Kodak branch out into a new business area, but he was not personally involved in the deal.
""We'll do a little study on that. We'll find out. If there is any problem, we'll let you know about it very quickly,"" he told reporters during a briefing. ""We'll see what that's all about.""

The SEC declined to comment. A representative for Kodak said it intends to fully cooperate with any potential inquiries.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday wrote a letter to the SEC asking that it investigate potential insider trading before the loan was announced. 
There was heavy trading volume in Kodak shares the day before the announcement. The shares surged more than 1,000% last week, generating a windfall for executives, some of whom received options one day prior to the announcement. 
The company granted its executive chairman options for 1.75 million shares as the result of what a person familiar with the arrangement described as an ""understanding"" with its board that had previously neither been listed in his employment contract nor made public.

A Kodak representative said Executive Chairman Jim Continenza has regularly purchased Kodak shares since joining the company in 2013 and has invested more capital in the company than he has earned during his tenure.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) on Tuesday avoided the unmitigated disaster some investors feared as it eked out an adjusted profit amid the coronavirus pandemic that shut down parks, movie theaters and sporting events across the globe.
Disney's quarterly profit of 8 cents per share on an adjusted basis beat expectations for a loss of 64 cents, sending the stock up 5% in after-market trade.
The company took a nearly $5 billion charge due to the pandemic and shifting media habits. COVID-19 wiped out $3.5 billion in operating profit in the parks division.
""The majority of businesses worldwide have experienced unprecedented disruption as a result of the pandemic,"" Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek told analysts. ""Most of our businesses were shut down, and this had a huge impact.""
Investors overlooked total revenue that fell short of expectations by nearly $600 million and focused on divisions including parks and its media networks with revenue declines that were not as bad as expected.
The Disney+ streaming service, which had 60.5 million paying customers as of Monday, was a bright spot in the quarter, Chapek said. Disney had reported 54.5 million subscribers as of May 4. 
""What we plan to do is invest even more in our content in order to keep that machine cranked and going,"" he said.
Combined with Hulu and ESPN+, Disney has attracted more than 100 million streaming customers worldwide since launching its big streaming effort nine months ago. Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), which got a head start in the market when it began streaming 13 years ago, boasts 193 million.
The coronavirus outbreak forced Disney to delay the theatrical debut of movies including the live-action epic ""Mulan"" about a Chinese warrior.
In a surprise move, Disney said it will release ""Mulan"" on Disney+ on Sept. 4 for people to watch at home at a cost of $30, and in theaters in markets where Disney+ is not available. 
Chapek said the shift was a one-time event and did not represent a shift in strategy. 
The decision followed a deal in July between Comcast Corp's (O:CMCSA) Universal Pictures and cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (N:AMC) to allow the studio to release films directly to consumers after just three weeks in theaters, down from the average three months. 
Disney also said it would launch a new international streaming service under the Star brand. 
""Investors are looking beyond the tough quarter to continued reopening of parks, while Disney+ is expected to see further growth,"" said Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar.
Theme park closures from April to June led to an operating loss of $1.96 billion in the parks and consumer products business. Even as four of its six theme park resorts around the world have opened, social distancing rules have limited attendance.
Demand at profit center Walt Disney World was lower than expected because of the resurgence of coronavirus infections in Florida, Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said.
The media network segment, which includes ESPN and Disney channels, reported a 48% jump in operating income to $3.15 billion.
The direct-to-consumer and international unit, which houses the Disney+ streaming service, reported an operating loss of $706 million, below the $1.06 billion that analysts expected. 
Operating income at the movie studio fell 16% to $668 million as many movie theaters remained closed.
Overall revenue fell 42% to $11.78 billion. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $12.37 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 

Net loss from continuing operations was $4.72 billion, or $2.61 per share, in the third quarter ended June 27, compared with a net profit of $1.43 billion, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier.

TOKYO - Japan's Nintendo Co Ltd (T:7974) on Thursday is expected to post a 160% jump in first-quarter operating profit as its hit  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) console and titles like Animal Crossing: New Horizons look set to extend a decade-high earnings streak.
The escapist island life simulator became a major hit as its delayed release coincided with consumers staying home due to the coronavirus outbreak, boosting the gaming firm's earnings in a year with a thin pipeline for major Switch titles.
In what is normally a lean quarter, Nintendo is seen posting an April-June profit surge at 71 billion yen ($670 million), according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate, based on the estimates of 12 analysts. That would compare with 27.4 billion yen a year earlier.
Sales of Animal Crossing likely reached 8 million units in the quarter, said  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analyst Kota Ezawa, who sees total sales for the title reaching 20 million units.
Momentum for the Kyoto-based gaming firm, whose shares hit a 12 year high in July, is being tempered by worldwide shortages of the hybrid home/portable Switch and portable-only Switch Lite. 
The system also lacks forthcoming marquee titles following the surprise release of Paper Mario: The Origami King in July just two months after the title was announced.
""Even if they announce a big first-party game tomorrow, the release is going to be at least two months away,"" said Serkan Toto, founder of game industry consultancy Kantan Games.

Upcoming titles that Nintendo has flagged, including a sequel to Switch launch title Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, have no firm release dates.
With critical mass from its Switch install base of over 55 million units, Nintendo is attracting third-party gaming firms such as  Electronic Arts Inc  (O:EA) which is set to release FIFA 21 Legacy Edition on the system in October.
The Switch dominates Nintendo's earnings. A push into mobile gaming is stuttering with just a single title, Mario Kart Tour, released this year and underperforming expectations.
Switch sales in Japan topped 100,000 units last week, industry magazine Famitsu said, in an indicator of possible easing of the supply bottleneck.

233,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 07:00PM ET</span>","Beyond Meat racks up high COVID-19 operational costs, shares fall 7%","By Richa Naidu and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) -  Beyond Meat Inc 's (O:BYND) quarterly results showed on Tuesday that the plant-based burger maker spent more than expected on dealing with the fallout of weak demand from restaurants, sending shares down about 7% after the bell.
El Segundo, California-based Beyond Meat typically gets about half its global sales from restaurants, many of which closed stores and limited menus during the quarter due to COVID-19. But as fast-food orders slumped, demand from grocery shoppers on lockdown surged and Beyond Meat had to spend nearly $6 million to reroute products to retailers like Walmart (N:WMT) and Costco (O:COST).
""We had to figure out how to continue to grow in an environment where half our business, essentially, deteriorated,"" Chief Executive Ethan Brown said.
Sales fell nearly 61% at the company's U.S. food service business, which supplies plant-based patties, chicken and sausages to fast-food chains like KFC (N:YUM) and Dunkin Brands (O:DNKN). Revenue from international restaurants more than halved to $7.2 million.
Beyond Meat repurposed a ""meaningful"" amount of inventory that was previously intended for fast-food chains. The process involved retrieving finished products from third-party warehouses across the country, transporting them to manufacturing facilities, repacking them into retail-friendly boxes, and sending them to new warehouses.
The added costs widened Beyond Meat's quarterly net loss to $10.2 million from $9.4 million, even as sales surged 69% to $113.3 million and beat analysts' expectations by nearly $14 million.
Beyond Meat's exposure to small restaurants is slightly concerning because some may never reopen or may downsize menus because of the pandemic, CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram said.
U.S. retail sales nearly tripled to about $90 million in the quarter ended June 27, while revenue from international stores rose about 167% to $9.6 million.

Results were also helped by newly launched value packs and deep discounts the company gave some U.S. retailers this summer, hoping to take a bigger share of the burger market as beef prices rose due to COVID-19. The value packs were in stores only for the last two weeks of the quarter, but accounted for 16 percentage points of U.S. retail sales volume growth, Beyond Meat said.

(Reuters) - Major advertisers including Procter & Gamble (N:PG),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), and  Unilever  (L:ULVR), and trade associations have formed a partnership to develop industry standards for targeted ads, the group said on Tuesday.
Addressable advertising, a strategy using data to target consumers based on their interests and demographics, has grown with technology from ad giants such as Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), but concerns about privacy and the use of consumer data are widespread.
The Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media said any new standards will support ""critical"" technical functions for targeting ads, while protecting consumer privacy and their experience with media content.
Other partners include major ad agencies such as Publicis (PA:PUBP), Comcast Corp's (O:CMCSA) NBCUniversal media company and ad tech companies including The Trade Desk (O:TTD).

The group said its principles include consumer privacy as a ""foundational pillar"" of any new industry standards, and any new solutions being operable across any device, web browser or platform where ads are displayed.

Tinder added about 200,000 users in the second quarter, taking its average subscribers to 6.2 million, as restrictions to stop the spread of the pandemic limited face-to-face meetings and encouraged more people to use dating apps as an alternative. 
The numbers also allayed investor concerns over slowing growth at the company's flagship product, sending shares 3.2% higher after the bell. 
""Despite the pandemic, our user trends like engagement and willingness to pay for our products is up,"" Chief Executive Officer Shar Dubey said.
Match had revamped its video calling feature to boost usage during lockdowns and also offered free access to the ""Passport"" feature on Tinder, which allows users to virtually change their location and match with people across the world. 
The company expects third-quarter revenue of at least $600 million, above analysts' estimate of about $575 million, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Match-owned apps, including Hinge and OkCupid, dominated nearly 61% of the dating app market in the quarter, by measure of monthly active users, according to data from analytics firm Apptopia. 
""As the pandemic took hold, we saw an increase in product usage, particularly among younger users and females,"" the company said in its shareholder letter.
Total revenue rose 12% to $555.5 million in the second quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of about $533.7 million.

(Reuters) - U.S. equities will not revisit the lows hit in March 2020, but the next big correction in stock markets could be triggered by corporate defaults, Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz SE (DE:ALVG), said on Tuesday.
""I do not expect U.S. equities to revisit the March lows,"" El-Erian told the Reuters Global Markets Forum chat room.
""I suspect the next big correction will likely be one triggered by corporate defaults and other capital impairment events that central banks cannot shield against,"" he said.
The S&P 500 (SPX) index bottomed at an intraday trough of 2,191.86 on March 23 after tumbling from February's all-time high as the spread of coronavirus shut down economies around the world. It has rallied back to within 3% of the record.
El-Erian said he expected the lowest tiers of the capital structure to be most at risk, including ""CCC-rated high yield corporate bonds and the like, as well as their equities, also some emerging markets.""
Asked about his positioning ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3, El-Erian said he had become defensive ahead of the rally from the March lows.
""I have gotten more defensive in my positioning and, as it turns out, prematurely,"" he said.

U.S. corporate junk bonds (N:JNK) have broadly provided holders with negative returns this year, despite a wave of central bank liquidity, which has supported corporate investment grade bond (P:LQD) prices, lifting them from their March lows. 
El-Erian said it was unlikely the Federal Reserve would take policy rates into negative territory. ""Having said that, I did not expect them to be buying high yield bonds.""

""The sequence is likely to be stronger forward guidance and more QE (quantitative easing), with the related adoption of a more symmetrical inflation target,"" El-Erian said, adding the Fed will stay near zero for ""a long time!""

Investing.com - Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) reported a surprise third-quarter profit as cost cuts helped offset a coronavirus-led $2.9 billion hit to its businesses.
Walt Disney shares lost 3.36% in after-hours trade following the report, but turned positive soon after.
Walt Disney announced earnings per share of 8 cents on revenue of $11.78 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated LPS of 61 cents on revenue of $12.44 billion.
""Results in the quarter were adversely impacted by the novel coronavirus (Covid-19). The most significant impact was at the Parks, Experiences and Products segment as most of our theme parks and resorts were closed for the entire quarter and our cruise ship sailings were suspended,"" the company said. ""We estimate the net adverse impact of Covid-19 on our current quarter segment operating income across all of our businesses was approximately $2.9 billion.""
Parks, experiences and products revenues for the quarter decreased 85% to $1 billion.
Studio entertainment revenues for the quarter decreased 55% to $1.7 billion, while direct-to-consumer & international revenues for the quarter increased 2% to $4 billion.
The company's streaming service Disney+ racked up 57.5 million users in the quarter.
""It’s obvious from this report that financial hemorrhage is continuing as Disney’s parks and other entertainment assets are unable to operate when the pandemic is spreading. In this, otherwise, quite gloomy earnings outlook, Disney’s explosive growth in its streaming business is the only silver lining which is grabbing investors’ attention. The company is taking full advantage of the stay-at-home environment and adding subscribers at a robust pace,"" Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said.

(Reuters) - Wall Street ended higher after a choppy session on Tuesday, lifted by Apple and energy stocks but limited by declines in AIG and Microsoft while investors awaited more U.S. government stimulus to fight economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Apple (O:AAPL) climbed 0.7%, up for a fifth straight session as investors cheered the iPhone maker's blowout quarterly report last week. The Silicon Valley heavyweight is around $120 billion away from becoming the first U.S. publicly listed company with a stock market value of $2 trillion.
The S&P 500 energy index (SPNY) jumped 2.45% and was the strongest performer among 11 sectors, while healthcare declined (SPXHC). 
Ralph Lauren Corp (N:RL) dropped 4.4% to its lowest since May after quarterly revenue plunged due to coronavirus-related store closures and a slowdown in global demand for luxury goods.
American International Group Inc (N:AIG) tumbled 7.5% after its quarterly adjusted profit slumped.
Notwithstanding those two reports, about 83% of the 352 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported quarterly results so far have beaten estimates for earnings, according to IBES Refinitiv data.
""Investors are still comfortable that the trajectory of earnings is on the right path and the 2021 outlook has remained intact. All that helps support the market at these levels,"" said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest.
""But there is an underlying level of uncertainty leading to a bit of caution,"" Bell added.
Investors are awaiting a major new coronavirus-aid bill, with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer saying talks with the White House were moving in the ""right direction.""
A rally in tech-related stocks and trillions of dollars in monetary and fiscal stimulus have lifted the S&P 500 to within about 3% of February's record high.
""I do not expect U.S. equities to revisit the March lows,"" Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz (DE:ALVG) SE, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum chat room.
""I suspect the next big correction will likely be one triggered by corporate defaults and other capital impairment events that central banks cannot shield against,"" he said.
 Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), which is looking to buy short-video app TikTok's U.S. operations, fell 1.5%. 
White House officials could not say how the U.S. government would receive a portion of the proceeds from any sale of TikTok's U.S. operations, one day after President Donald Trump called for a cut of the money.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 0.62% to end at 26,828.47 points, while the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.36% to 3,306.51. 
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) climbed 0.35% to 10,941.17.
Evergy Inc (N:EVRG) slumped nearly 12% after two sources said the board of the Midwest utility planed to remain independent as bids solicited from prospective merger partners did not offer sufficient value.
 Take-Two Interactive  Software Inc (O:TTWO) rose nearly 6% after it raised its annual adjusted sales forecast on demand for its videogame franchises ""Grand Theft Auto"" and ""NBA 2K"".
Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) fell 2% in extended trade following its quarterly report.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.98-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.55-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 26 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 129 new highs and 10 new lows.

Beyond Meat reported a loss per share of 2 cents on sales of $113 million for the quarter, compared to the average analyst estimate of a loss per share of 2 cents on revenue of $98.6 million.  
The better-than-expected performance on the top line was driven by performance in retail in North America, but margin growth was held back by packing costs.

Gross margin fell to 29.7% form 33.8% for the quarter year-on-year.
""Growth in volume sold was driven mainly by increased retail channel sales, resulting from distribution gains both domestically and abroad, higher sales velocities at existing retail customers, and contribution from new product introductions. During the quarter, increased retail channel sales were partially offset by a reduction in foodservice channel sales as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,"" the company added.

245,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 04:10PM ET</span>","Diageo full-year sales plunge as demand in bars, restaurants dries up","By Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) -  Diageo  Plc (L:DGE), the world's largest spirits maker, took a 1.3 billion pound writedown as it reported a bigger than expected decline in underlying net sales on Tuesday as demand for its whisky, vodka and gin fell in nearly all markets.
The Johnnie Walker whisky maker took the 1.3 billion pound non-cash writedown related to its businesses in India, Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Windsor whisky brand in South Korea, blaming challenging trading conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
On Tuesday, the company reported an 8.4% drop in organic sales for the year ended June 30, larger than the 7.3% fall analysts had expected, company supplied estimates showed.
This marks the company's worst annual sales performance in more than a decade, according to Bernstein analysts.
Diageo shares were down 6.2% in early trading and was the biggest loser on the FTSE (FTSE). The stock is down nearly 10% this year, better than the FTSE's 20% decline over the same period. 
By region, organic sales in Asia fell the most, dropping 16% due to the impact of coronavirus-related closures of alcohol outlets and bars in India and Thailand, while in China demand was hit by the absence of the Chinese New Year.
The company's Latin America, Africa and Europe and Turkey markets also posted double-digit falls in sales, mainly due to disruptions to supply chains and fewer social occasions due to the pandemic.
North America was the only bright spot, with sales rising 2%, reflecting strong demand for tequilas and ready-to-drink beverages at supermarkets and alcohol stores, the company said.
Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells said the strong results in North America, its biggest market by revenue, was because 80% of Diageo's sales came from retail stores, in contrast to other markets, where bars and restaurants make up most of the sales.
The company, which also makes Tanqueray Gin, Smirnoff Vodka and a wide range of scotch whiskey, said it was still unable to provide specific outlook for the year, after abandoning a full-year forecast in April. Its 4.5 billion pound capital returns programme remains suspended.
""The hit to earnings should be short lived provided the global economy doesn't take too long to recover,"" William Ryder, equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) said. ""We think the group will continue to do well long term, but management will have to focus more on debt reduction than they probably would have liked.""
The company also said it would keep paying a dividend, which Liberum analyst Nico Von Stackelberg called a ""positive sign"".
After a tough second half of the year ""we should see sequential improvements (in the business) from here,"" he said in a note.
Diageo's business outlook was in contrast to French spirits makers  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) and  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) , which last month said the pandemic would not hit their full-year forecasts as strongly as initially feared. 
Diageo's impairment charge follows those of other alcoholic beverage makers, AB InBev (BR:ABI) and  Heineken  (AS:HEIN). While AB Inbev took a $2.5 billion writedown related to its African operations last week, Heineken announced a nearly 550 million euro writedown on Monday.

247,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 04:06PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: 3 Things to Watch for August 5,"By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com  -- Stocks closed slightly higher Tuesday after going a lot of nowhere. Signs of progress among U.S. lawmakers on the next round of coronavirus stimulus came and left with no clear outcome.
Lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle did hint that some progress had been made on talks concerning the next round of coronavirus aid, but their differences on the size of unemployment support, which was set at $600 a week in March, remained a key sticking point to get a deal over the line.
Some sectors tied to the progress of the economy like energy and real estate rallied to keep the broader market in the green.
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1. Economic indicators
American companies likely slowed hiring in July, thanks to Covid-19 keeping workers at home. The non-farm ADP jobs report is expected to show a gain of 1.5 million workers, down from 2.369 million in June. 
The July ISM Non-Manufacturing survey may move to 55 from 57 in June. A reading above 50 percent indicates the non-manufacturing sector of the economy is generally expanding.
The Energy Information Administration reports crude oil inventories on Wednesday, with an expected draw of 3.3 million barrels, compared to last week’s draw of 10.6 million barrels.
2. Earnings run
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) is forecast to report a loss per share of 37 cents on sales of almost $28 million. Shares are down 18% after hitting a high last month. The company is in phase 3 of a trial for a vaccine candidate for Covid-19, and is getting close to $1 billion for development of the prophylactic from the U.S. government.   
Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) is forecast to publish earnings per share of 39 cents on revenue of $327 million. The stock hit a record earlier Tuesday. 
Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) reports on the heels of Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO)'s strong print. The video game developer is expected to report earnings per share of 8 cents on sales of $504 million. That will compare to earnings per share of 5 cents on revenue of $365 million for the second quarter of 2019. 
CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) should report earnings per share of $1.89 on revenue of $64 billion. Shares are up 24% since March.
 Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ)is expected to publish a loss per share of 5 cents on sales of $533 million for the quarter. The stock has 11 buy ratings, 14 holds and two sells.
3. Samsung (KS:005930) reveals new phone
Samsung will introduce five new devices at its online Unpacked event tomorrow, Engadget said. Three new phones, wireless headphones and a smartwatch are expected to be unveiled. While unlikely to elicit quite the same fanboy adulation as a similar Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) event, consider this: Samsung shipped more phones than any other handset maker last year, followed by Huawei, according to Counterpoint Research.

250,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 03:45PM ET</span>",Italy's Atlantia says hits 'concrete difficulties' in talks on Autostrade split,"By Francesca Landini
MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's  Atlantia  (MI:ATL) said on Tuesday it had encountered ""concrete difficulties"" in talks with state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) over CDP's planned investment in its Autostrade per l'Italia and was studying alternative options.
The infrastructure group is now considering the sale of its entire 88% stake in Autostrade through a competitive auction or to spin-off the motorway unit into a separate vehicle to be listed on the stock exchange, it said in a statement.
Since the collapse of a motorway bridge run by Autostrade in 2018, which claimed 43 lives, Atlantia and the government have been wrangling over Autostrade's operating concession.
Last month, under heavy political pressure, the group agreed to pay 3.4 billion euros ($4 billion) in compensation and said it would withdraw from Autostrade to make space for CDP and allied investors, which planned to take a majority stake in the unit.
The arrangement would hand the motorway unit to the Italian government and reduce the sway of the powerful Benetton family, which controls Atlantia through its 30% stake.
Atlantia, however, said on Tuesday that differences over valuation and other issues had emerged in talks with CDP and it was looking at other possibilities.
""There are concrete difficulties in the negotiations,"" it said in a statement on its first-half results.
It said it wanted to proceed with two alternative plans to split Autostrade from the group to protect shareholder interests and added that CDP could buy a stake in Autostrade by taking part in the competitive auction for the unit.
An extraordinary board meeting on Sept. 3 will vote on splitting Autostrade from the group, it added.
Activist hedge fund TCI, an investor in Atlantia, welcomed the group's move and said either a straight sale of the Autostrade stake or a spin-off would be acceptable if the move achieved a fair market price through a transparent process.
""We fully support Atlantia's resolutions,"" TCI Advisory Services Partner Jonathan Amouyal told Reuters.
TCI believes that the Italian government and CDP are forcing Atlantia to accept a ""non-transparent and non market friendly transaction,"" Amouyal said.
The fund lodged a complaint against the Italian government with the European Commission over the Atlantia last month. [nL5N2EV332]
Atlantia also said its first-half core profit fell 63% year-on-year to 1.3 billion euros after it booked a 700-million euro provision linked to the deal with the government.

MILAN (Reuters) - U.S. investment firm KKR (N:KKR) has agreed to extend its binding offer for a minority stake in  Telecom Italia 's (MI:TLIT) secondary grid until end-August at the request of the Italian government, two sources close to the matter said on Tuesday.
One of the sources said that KKR agreed its deal for a stake in the so-called last-mile network should be part of a broader plan for a tie-up of TIM's network assets with those of smaller state-controlled rival Open Fiber with the aim of building a national ultra-fast broadband champion.
TIM and Open Fiber, a wholesale-only broadband unit jointly controlled by government-controlled utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI) and state lender CDP, have been talking since June 2019 on ways of combining their assets, but negotiations have been fruitless so far.
In a bid to break the stalemate, Italian Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri last month asked parties involved to agree on a memorandum of understanding (MOU) by the end of July but sources told Reuters more time was needed to strike a deal.
On Tuesday the prime minister's office said Rome had no objection to KKR, adding it was in favour of including other institutional and market players in the broader deal.
Sources told Reuters last month that CDP, which also own a 10% stake in TIM, could invest in TIM's last-mile network to allay Rome's concerns over the planned sale of part of the grid to KKR.
Reuters wrote on July 27 that Rome drafted a plan under which any combined merger of TIM's assets with Open Fiber could initially be majority owned by Telecom Italia but would grant equal access to all market players.

KKR declined to comment. TIM was not immediately available to comment.

(Reuters) - A bipartisan group of state attorneys general on Tuesday urged the U.S. government to allow other companies to make Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD)' COVID-19 treatment, remdesivir, to increase its availability and lower the price of the antiviral drug.
The coalition of more than 30 state attorneys general called on the government to act or allow states to do so, saying in a letter to U.S. health agencies that Gilead ""has not established a reasonable price"" for remdesivir.
""Gilead should not profit from the pandemic and it should be pushed to do more to help more people,"" the letter said.
The drugmaker is charging most U.S. patients $3,120 per course, or $520 per vial of remdesivir.
The medicine is one of only two that have demonstrated an ability to help hospitalized COVID-19 patients in formal clinical trials. It received emergency use authorization (EUA) in the United States and approval in other countries after it shortened hospital stays in a large U.S. trial.
In the letter, the coalition, led by Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, urged RemdesivirFINALLetter202008041.pdf the federal government to exercise its rights under the Bayh-Dole Act and license remdesivir to third-party manufacturers to scale up production.
The letter went to the heads of the U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) department, the National Institutes of Health, and the Food and Drug Administration. 
Gilead and the health agencies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The U.S. government, which provided some financial backing for the drug's development, signed a deal with Gilead in June for more than 500,000 courses of the treatment, making up most of the company's output through September. 
Gilead agreed to send nearly all of its remdesivir supply to the United States between July and September, according to HHS. The agency and states are managing allocation of the drug to U.S. hospitals over that period.
The government said it would receive around 94,000 treatment courses in July, 175,000 in August, and another 233,000 in September.
Still, the drug has been in scarce supply since the U.S. EUA in May, and hospital staffers and politicians have complained about difficulties getting access to the drug.
""Shipments are coordinated by the federal (government) and we have a bad disconnect between what they think we need and what we really need,"" U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida tweeted last month, before announcing further allocation to his hard-hit state.
Over the past four weeks, just under half of the U.S. remdesivir supply has gone to COVID-19 hotspots Florida, Texas, California and Arizona.

Gilead teamed up with generic drugmakers based in India and Pakistan, including Cipla Ltd and Hetero Labs Ltd, to make and supply remdesivir in 127 developing countries.

254,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 02:10PM ET</span>",Continental to resume some U.S. shale output but sees sector lackluster unless oil prices rise,"By Liz Hampton
(Reuters) - U.S. shale oil producer Continental Resources (N:CLR) on Tuesday said it plans to resume most curtailed production, adding prices need to rise further for a significant rebound in overall industry activity.
Supply and demand are rebalancing, but current prices near $40 a barrel are not enough for long-term growth in U.S. output, founder and Chairman Harold Hamm said.
The company, which shut 70% of its oil production in the spring when prices and fuel demand collapsed, said U.S. production growth will stay moderate unless oil reaches $50 to $60 a barrel. 
Continental said its cost are running about $1,500 per well to resume production, and reopened wells showed double their earlier flow rates. 
The company, a major producer in the Bakken shale of North Dakota, said it was confident that a court decision to shut and drain the 570,000 barrel per day Dakota Access Pipeline would be stayed. It would see minimal impact on its production if the oil pipeline were closed, executives said.
Continental directly ships about 35,000 to 50,000 barrels of oil per day on the line, a major transportation artery out of the North Dakota oil fields. 
Continental also said 97% of its workforce had returned to their offices and work sites. It was among the first to bring employees back following COVID-19 related office closings. 
In a video town hall to employees in late April, CEO William Berry and Chairman Hamm laid out plans for returning staff to work, including free testing for employees and family members. 
Shares were down 2.7% on Tuesday afternoon at $17.17.

The suspension, which relates to transactions that took place more than five years ago, will last at least three months and takes effect Tuesday, Agence France Tresor -- the nation’s debt management office -- said in a statement.
Primary dealers must take part in government debt auctions, can sell the securities on to others and provide liquidity in the secondary market. Morgan Stanley’s suspension was over trades on June 16, 2015, that “seriously affected” liquidity and failed disclosure requirements, the AFT said.
The suspension will be lifted once the bank has complied with “remedial measures,” the AFT said. Morgan Stanley in a statement said it was working to implement the measures and would also appeal against the decision.
Temporarily rescinding the bank’s membership blocks Morgan Stanley from participating in government bond auctions. The bank was the 10th most active dealer in primary markets in 2019, according to the AFT website.
While fees from acting as a primary dealer are generally negligible, the prestige of working closely with the French government can foster further business for banks.
“‘It is not end of the world, but it does impinge on their ability to market-make governments, and perhaps more significantly this would spill over into bringing new corporate issuance to the market,” said Marc Ostwald, global strategist at ADM Investor Services. “It’s not exactly helpful for revenues and earnings, particularly as French corporate issuance is one of if not the largest proportion of euro zone issuance.”
For example, being part of this elite bond club makes banks more likely to be hired to manage lucrative syndicated bond sales for both governments and corporates. This year alone, financial institutions that were mandated to syndicate 15 billion euros ($17.6 billion) in French sovereign bonds made a combined 30 million euros in fees, the most lucrative year yet for such deals, according to Bloomberg calculations.
While Morgan Stanley hasn’t been a joint-lead manager on any publicly syndicated French transaction since 2017, it handled $10.8 billion worth of similar sales by European governments this year, and is ranked 15th among its peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) SA and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. top the list after managing $35 billion and $30 billion worth of deals, respectively.
Morgan Stanley was fined 20 million euros in December over accusations its London desk used “pump and dump” tactics to rig bond prices after a bet on the French sovereign turned sour amid Greece’s debt crisis.

256,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>",New Ford CEO Farley eyes expansion into tech fields,"By Paul Lienert, Nick Carey and David Shepardson
(Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's incoming Chief Executive Jim Farley said on Tuesday he wants to expand the automaker's operations into related technology fields, including software, fleet management and electric vehicle charging.
""These are new growth initiatives that could create a lot of value for the company,"" Farley told Reuters, after Ford announced that he will succeed Jim Hackett as the automaker's fourth CEO since 2014.
In addition to Ford's work on self-driving vehicles, ""these are concrete areas that will change Ford,"" Farley said. ""They're going to impact the company's future look and feel.""
In the meantime, Farley, 58, must wrestle with a painful restructuring of Ford's global operations amid the ravages of the coronavirus crisis that has saddled the No. 2 U.S. automaker with large amounts of debt.
Executive Chairman Bill Ford said the company had not considered outside candidates because “our board felt that we were on the right path” with Farley. 
“I wouldn’t expect any big surprises,” Ford said in terms of additional management changes. 
Farley, who joined the company in 2007, was named chief operating officer in March soon after his main internal rival for the top role at the automaker, Joe Hinrichs, announced his retirement. 
Farley has a reputation within Ford for being a skilled political operator with sharp elbows, which has garnered him some loyal fans but made him unpopular with others. 
Hackett and Farley will work together during a two-month transition period, and Hackett, 65, will continue as a company advisor through March 2021.
Ford shares were up 1.1% in afternoon trading, after initially rising 3% on news of Farley's succession as CEO.
The stock has lost nearly 40% of its value since Hackett took the reins as chief executive in May 2017 and has been at lows not seen since the Great Recession in 2009. 
In the year to date, Ford shares have sunk 26% and its market capitalization of $27 billion is one-tenth that of rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s.
HANDPICKED
Hackett was handpicked for the top job at Ford by chairman Bill Ford, great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford. Hackett had no automotive experience, and his tenure at the automaker was rocky and accompanied by persistent rumors that he was about to be ousted, but Bill Ford stuck loyally by his chosen CEO for more than three years.
Hackett’s relationship with Wall Street has, at times, been strained. Analysts have expressed frustration at his preference for often-impenetrable corporate language, instead of clear updates on where Ford was heading, and a perceived lack of urgency in restructuring the automaker.
Last week, Ford reported a quarterly profit thanks to an investment by Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) in its self-driving Argo AI unit, more than offsetting an operating loss caused by a coronavirus-induced production shutdown.
Ford said it expects a full-year loss, but added it should have ample cash on hand through the rest of 2020, even if global demand falls further or the coronavirus pandemic forces further shutdowns of vehicle assembly plants.
Executives insisted that although the company had dramatically scaled back the amount it will spend on a global restructuring of its business, that overhaul had not stalled.
'STEADY HANDS'
The No.2 U.S. automaker also faces slumping demand in China, its second-largest market.
Ford lost $771 million in China last year, about half its 2018 loss, and its market share there has shrunk. The company has struggled to revive sales in China since its business began slumping in late 2017.
In an SEC filing, Ford said Farley's annualized base salary increased to $1,700,000 from $1,400,000, while Hackett's remained unchanged at $1.8 million. Farley will receive stock options valued at $4,000,000.
Hackett’s total compensation, including stock options, fell to $17.4 million in 2019 from $17.8 million in 2018. He will cease to have access to private aircraft for personal travel effective Oct. 1.
Farley previously led Lincoln, South America, Ford of Europe and all of Ford’s global markets in successive roles.

In the last two months, Ford has unveiled a redesigned version of its highly profitable F-150 pickup truck and a family of off-road Bronco SUVs as part of efforts to revitalize its lineup and pay down money borrowed to ride out the economic shock of the pandemic.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's Labour Court on Tuesday ordered state defence firm Denel to pay workers outstanding salaries for May, June and July by Friday, Aug. 7, a copy of the court judgment showed.
The case against Denel was brought by two trade unions, Solidarity and UASA, on behalf of their members after the weapons manufacturer did not pay salaries in full.
Denel, which makes equipment ranging from armoured vehicles to missiles, has struggled to pay staff salaries amid a liquidity crisis aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
It is one of a number of struggling state enterprises the government has been keeping afloat with bailouts.
Denel said in a statement it was committed to meeting all its employment-related obligations.
As well as paying outstanding salaries, Denel will have to meet statutory obligations such as making payments to its employee pension fund, which it has also struggled to do recently.
It was not immediately clear how Denel would pay, given severe cashflow constraints.

""Denel and the state as shareholder have dealt recklessly with their employees,"" said Helgard Cronje, Solidarity's defence sector coordinator. ""This problem has not arisen as a result of COVID-19 but is the result of years of incompetent management and corruption.""

258,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 01:36PM ET</span>",Real-Time Covid Trends Are Helping to Keep Stock Investors Bullish,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors in search of good news in Covid-19 trends to justify a bullish bent in markets are finding it right now, particularly in secondary data such as traffic congestion and restaurant bookings.
To be sure, what looks good to traders often diverges from what looks good to the rest of the world, and far from all of the data is positive. But certain trends in some of the worst-hit states, particularly in the Sunbelt, a major area of concern for many, are flattening. All this as the S&P 500 inches toward its February high, a milestone just 3% away.
“You cannot dismiss the virus and it’s always in conjunction with the effect on the economy,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU).
The following is a compilation of some of the data investors are focusing on:
Major Indicators
Almost all indicators tracking the pandemic outbreak, from infection cases to hospitalization rates and deaths, are pointing to an improving trend. On a seven-day moving average basis, those measures are trending lower, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Difficulty in testing is flattering some of those results though testing prevalence doesn’t affect hospitalization and death numbers, wrote Paul Hickey, one of the firm’s founders.
However, one risk going forward is that Sunbelt states that are beating back their outbreaks could declare victory too early, with a return to normal behavior potentially causing new flare-ups, Hickey said.
Epicenter States
States at the epicenter of recent outbreaks -- Florida, California, Arizona and Texas -- are doing better, according to Fundstrat Global Advisors’s Tom Lee. For that group, which Lee refers to as “F-CAT,” daily cases are roughly 40% off their peaks, a trajectory that closely resembles that of the tri-state area, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. If the F-CAT states track the tristate area, U.S. cases could be down 75% in the next two weeks and down 90% by early September, he said.
“The evidence is pretty conclusive that this June-July surge is now turning into a full-blown retreat,” Lee wrote in a note. “If cases are falling and we see overall fear abate, as the disease slows, we expect consumer confidence to strengthen. Hence, this is an important juncture,” one that could bolster arguments for a cyclical rotation.
That rings true to Keith Gangl, portfolio manager for Gradient Investments, who says the spread in those states has been a worry. “A lot of GDP comes out of those states and those were rising pretty rapidly,” he said by phone. “The last couple of days, some states are actually going down.”
Tracking Traffic
Restaurant bookings and traffic congestion increased last week and flight activity -- international and domestic -- also improved. Online traffic to unemployment portals has fallen, a trend consistent with renewed declines in jobless claims, according to Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) LLC. Though other inputs, including public transportation ridership, have trended lower-- and a lapse in unemployment benefits posing a risk for early August -- an economic activity index compiled by the firm rose to the highest level since March.
“We look for momentum to improve significantly as soon at the second stimulus check hits bank accounts, presumably by late August/early September,” Markowska wrote in a note.

259,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 01:35PM ET</span>",Spirit pushes cash flow target to 2022 after bigger-than-expected loss,"By Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - Spirit AeroSystems (N:SPR) on Tuesday reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss and pushed its target of becoming cash flow positive by another year, as top customers Boeing and Airbus slashed production due to a collapse in global travel. 
Spirit said it now expects to generate positive cash flow in 2022, instead of 2021, and its current-quarter results will be further hit due to fresh production cuts announced in July by  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus SE (PA:AIR).
Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and Airbus' A350 are among the most profitable for the planemakers, but demand for the long-haul jets has sharply fallen due to the COVID-19 pandemic as cash-starved airlines defer deliveries to save money and stay in business.
Boeing, which accounts for nearly 80% of Spirit's revenue, said last month it would cut 787 output to six units a month in 2021, the fourth such cut since last year when output touched a record 14 units a month.
Airbus SE (PA:AIR) also cut production of A350 to five jets a month last week, after dropping it to six from 9.5 in April.
Spirit booked $194.1 million in charges mainly related to the 787 and A350 cuts in the second quarter, and said will take another charge of about $46.5 million in the current quarter. The company's total deliveries of shipsets, or complete sets of parts, sank about 65%, resulting in a 68% plunge in revenue for the quarter ended July 2, as the Boeing 737 MAX grounding also hurt. 
Shares of Spirit fell as much as 8.9% to over two-month low of $17.76.
The company posted an adjusted loss of $2.28 per share in the quarter, compared with loss estimates of $1.33 per share.

Quarterly revenue came in at $644.6 million, below estimates of $863.2 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

(Reuters) - Evergy Inc (N:EVRG) plans to remain independent after the board of the U.S. Midwest utility decided that bids solicited from prospective merger partners did not offer sufficient value, two sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
The news dropped Evergy's stock more than 10% to its lowest price since mid-May.
The company had been reviewing strategic options under a March agreement with activist investor Elliott Management Corp, which earlier this year demanded Evergy find a merger partner or implement changes to bolster the utility's stock price.
A number of bidders submitted offers for Evergy by last week's deadline, and they were reviewed by the company's board in consultation with its advisers in recent days.
These offers were not considered acceptable, and the company will unveil a new strategic plan to operate as an independent company on Wednesday, as part of its scheduled earnings announcement, the two sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the information is not public.
A spokeswoman for Evergy declined to comment. Bloomberg News reported earlier on Tuesday that Evergy had decided to forgo a sale.
Evergy's stock closed Monday at $62.68, valuing the company at $14.2 billion, below the $73 it traded at in early March, when Evergy struck the Elliott agreement.
This fall-off, caused by the pandemic, meant selling now was not the prudent move, one of the sources said. 
Disclosing a stake which made it the firm's fourth-largest shareholder, Elliott said in January some $5 billion of value could be added if Evergy cut costs. Alternatively, Evergy should merge with another utility to generate better performance.
The March accord, under which Elliott pledged to support Evergy's board and management until Nov. 2, 2020, has drawn scrutiny, with the Kansas regulator saying in June it would probe whether proposed actions would be bad for customers.
Formed out of the merger of Great Plains Energy and  Westar Energy  in 2018, Evergy serves 1.6 million customers in Kansas and Missouri.

268,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 12:00PM ET</span>",VIX Flashes Most Enticing Short Since 2012 in the Month of Fear,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s volatility speculators are staring down one of the most confounding trading landscapes in years, even as bullish conviction pushes U.S. stocks back toward records.
On the one hand, equities are in their historically most volatile month, U.S. election risk remains elevated and the pandemic fallout continues. All of which suggest gains for investors betting on rockier markets, and risks for those shorting.
On the other, a manic season for corporate earnings is fading, historical swings on the S&P 500 are easing and technicals haven’t looked this inviting since 2012. With the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, sitting at its post-pandemic low, money managers may be tempted to bet on further tranquility. Yet there are few signs of strong conviction out there.
“This environment is, and has been, attractive for shorting equity volatility,” said Colton Loder, managing principal of Cohalo, an alternative investment firm. But, “there doesn’t appear to be a massive rush yet from what we can see,” added the Washington-based manager.
One indicator is that speculative short positions in VIX futures remain subdued, and have increased lately only in tandem with commercial longs. The metric doesn’t take into account those either selling options or betting in the over-the-counter market. But the lack of activity here could suggest traders are lacking strong conviction on shorting volatility even with one of the most promising market set-ups in years.
On the latter, take a look at one corner of the VIX landscape. Thanks in large part to heightened jitters around the U.S. presidential election, volatility futures several months out on the curve are trading at an outsize premium to near-term contracts, a condition known as contango.
The generic second-month VIX contract was 2.6 points higher than the front-month contract Monday -- near the largest gap in eight years. Since futures will converge to spot VIX at expiry, selling the contracts has typically delivered gains in a trade known as the rolldown. That’s especially when the curve has looked this upward sloping.
In a note Tuesday citing the shape of the curve, BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) SA strategists wrote “there looks to be plenty of opportunity to trade rolldown.”
But what looks like an inviting shape to short-sellers may ultimately prove deceptive, suggests Vance Harwood of Six Figure Investing.“Normally this level of steepness in front months would indicate an ‘all is well’ market but this market is anticipating volatility associated with the election,” Harwood wrote on Twitter.
In other words, the VIX could remain elevated or even rise as the election draws nearer, confounding short bets.
Still, over at trading firm Susquehanna, Chris Murphy notes that realized swings for the S&P 500 Index have been relatively tranquil of late, which can have a dulling effect on the VIX, a forecast of future moves. He reckons a pandemic-lashed earnings season will soon be in the rearview mirror, a potential slam-dunk for shorts.
But there are plenty of reasons for caution. Beside the heightened risk around the election, there’s the potential for more bad news on the virus, steep valuations for tech leaders and haggling over U.S. stimulus.
“Volatility traders are likely short to capture the roll yield,” said Mike Shell (LON:RDSa), founder of Shell Capital Management LLC. But “I would not be short volatility right now.”

270,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 11:36AM ET</span>",Robinhood Crowd Helps Hedge Fund Manager Gain 30% This Year,"(Bloomberg) -- One hedge fund manager is getting some inspiration from an unlikely source: the Robinhood crowd.
Adam Sender’s volatility hedge fund has climbed 30% this year -- in part by betting on and against stocks that have been popular on the retail trading app. He notched gains by wagering around stocks including carmakers Hertz Global Holdings (NYSE:HTZ) Inc., NIO Inc. and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
By watching Robinhood traders, Sender is embracing the speculative fervor brought on by retail investors who have far less experience and insight into the companies. Robinhood has become a go-to trading platform for individual investors during the Covid-19 pandemic, who are largely stuck at home without much entertainment.
The day trading crowd has “created the late ‘90s type of environment I thrive on,” Sender said in an interview, referring to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. A significant portion of the gains were also made by betting on S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures, as well as large-cap technology names.
Founded in 2016, Sender Company & Partners is among a handful of volatility funds taking advantage of the return of market turbulence sparked by the coronavirus pandemic. And the fund has outperformed its peers. The HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index, an early indicator of industry performance, is roughly flat this year through July.
In a bet on tech, some of Sender’s top holdings include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)., Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp.,  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). All were up in the first seven months, with PayPal rising the most at about 81%.
Sender previously worked for Steve Cohen’s SAC Capital Advisors before starting Exis Capital Management in 1998. He grew Exis to more than $1 billion in assets before shuttering it in 2014 after a tough year of performance and amid a lawsuit with Canadian insurer Fairfax Financial Holdings (OTC:FRFHF) Ltd.
He’s now finding smaller is better at his $100 million fund, though he’s looking to double the assets amid a bout of success. His paycheck is also tied to that success -- the fund charges 40% for performance, but has a 0% management fee.
“Unfortunately, the hedge fund industry has become an asset-gathering strategy,” Sender said of wanting to stay small. “Back when I started in the industry, hedge funds were geared for absolute performance -- they weren’t geared for safety.”

(Reuters) - Insurer American International Group Inc (N:AIG) racked up $730 million in COVID-19-related losses during the first half of the year, its chief executive officer said on Tuesday.
The pandemic is a ""formidable and ongoing catastrophe,"" AIG CEO Brian Duperreault said during a call with analysts to discuss the company's second-quarter results. 
But the impact will affect earnings and not capital, Duperreault said.
AIG, one of the largest U.S. insurers, on Monday posted a 56% fall in quarterly adjusted earnings, partly a result of $458 million in losses related to COVID-19 for its general insurance business.
Analysts and investors have been awaiting insurers' second-quarter results, the first full quarter of the pandemic, for a clearer picture of the impact of COVID-19 on insurers' payouts. 
The pandemic has left many insurers struggling to estimate future losses and fallout for their massive investment portfolios.
Pandemic-related losses affected a larger number of insurance lines than during the first quarter, AIG's president and chief operating officer, Peter Zaffino, said during the call.
Those coverage lines include travel, property, trade credit, marine, casualty, workers' compensation, accident and health, financial lines, contingency, and AIG's reinsurance business, Validus Re, Zaffino said.
But AIG expects to recover some losses through reinsurance, Zaffino said.
A travel decline because of the pandemic hurt AIG's travel insurance business, partly contributing to a $1 billion drop in AIG's net premiums written for the quarter from a year ago, the company said.
Before the pandemic, travel insurance generated $1 billion in premiums in North America, fairly evenly spread across quarters, Zaffino said.
""(T)he second quarter, you had not only no new sales. You had cancellations,"" Zaffino said.

There have been ""some modest sales in the third quarter,"" Zaffino said, noting that the situation is ""hard to predict.""

Mountain Valley is one of several U.S. oil and gas pipelines delayed by regulatory and legal fights with environmental and local groups that found problems with federal permits issued by the Trump administration.
Other projects similarly held up include TC Energy (NYSE:TRP) Corp's (TO:TRP) $8 billion Keystone XL crude pipeline and  Energy Transfer  LP's (N:ET) Dakota Access crude pipeline, which are still involved in court battles.
Equitrans said in its second-quarter earnings statement that the project's costs could rise by 5% to around $5.7 billion if it needs ""to adapt the construction plan for potential complex judicial decisions and regulatory changes.""
When Equitrans started construction in February 2018, it estimated Mountain Valley would cost about $3.5 billion and be completed by the end of 2018. But successful legal challenges to federal permits resulted in lengthy delays and higher costs for Mountain Valley.
Equitrans said it expects to receive new approvals soon from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that will enable it to finish building the last 8% of the project.
The 303-mile (488-km) pipeline is designed to deliver 2 billion cubic feet per day from the Marcellus and Utica shale in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to consumers in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast.
Mountain Valley is owned by units of Equitrans,  NextEra Energy Inc  (N:NEE), Consolidated Edison Inc (N:ED),  AltaGas Ltd  (TO:ALA) and  RGC Resources Inc  (O:RGCO).

Alafco was suing the U.S. planemaker for $336 million over accusations it wrongly refused to return advance payments on a cancelled order for 40 of the troubled 737 MAX planes.
The Kuwaiti lessor will now buy 20 aircraft from Boeing, instead of the 40 on its order book, with new delivery dates, it said in a bourse filing. 
Additional details of the agreement could not be disclosed due to confidentiality clauses, it said.
Alafco, which followed other lessors in cutting 737 MAX orders, said it was ""looking forward to a long-lasting and mutually beneficial relationship with Boeing.""
Alafco did not respond to emailed requests for comment. Boeing declined to comment.
Boeing suspended deliveries of its narrow-body 737 MAX jet in March last year, when the Federal Aviation Administration grounded the aircraft after the deaths of 346 people in crashes of two 737 MAX planes operated by Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines.
The crisis over the grounding of the once top-selling 737 MAX has cost the U.S. planemaker more than $19 billion, slashed production and hobbled its supply chain, with criminal and congressional investigations still ongoing.

Alafco's owners include Kuwait Finance House, Gulf Investment Corporation and state airline Kuwait Airways, according to its website.

278,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 09:00AM ET</span>",‘Too Big to Fail’ Is the New Mantra for Bulls in Stock Market,"(Bloomberg) -- All the teeth-gnashing in Congress over tech’s endless ascent has done nothing to keep the big from getting bigger in the stock market, going by the Nasdaq 100’s last two sessions. New research says that as far as the economy is concerned, that’s fortunate.
While popular support may exist for pruning the power of megacap mammoths like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc., support is also running high right now for stocks themselves -- as barometers of hope and wealth. Tampering with one without blowing up the other could be thorny, or so says a new report.
In a note titled “Stocks Are Too Big to Fail,” Michael Kantrowitz, a strategist with New York-based research firm Cornerstone Macro, argued that psychology in the economy has rarely been fastened as tightly to equity gains as it is now. One example: consumer confidence is correlated to the S&P 500 more than any time in the past three decades.
“One could argue that falling stock prices have never had the potential to be such a drag as they are now,” Kantrowitz wrote in a note to clients. “Stocks are too big to fail here because a big drop in the stock market could leave the U.S. government an enormous bill.”
None of those points seemed to weigh heavily on lawmakers who last week put chief executives of the biggest U.S. tech companies through five hours of interrogation over allegations their size and influence are out of control. (Those companies aren’t the whole market, but they’re close: the big five make up a record 23% of the S&P 500.)
Maybe they should have, says Kantrowitz. Everyone from legislators to regulators to the central bankers has reason to be careful when doing anything that might cause the market to fall with a pandemic and recession raging, he wrote. Indeed, stocks have played such a big role in boosting income and confidence that policy makers are likely to be forced to come to their rescue at signs of trouble. The Fed will press its easy monetary policy while government spending keeps rising, the strategist said in an interview.
“I’m not saying that stocks will not fall in the future,” he said. “Just that the ‘cost’ of lower equity prices has never been greater. It seems cheaper and easier for most to just keep the music playing and supporting the stock market, and by extension the economy.”
Share values currently stand at a record high relative to the size of U.S. economy. Other data show equity values and dividend income dwarfing household compensation at an unprecedented rate. Those facts are routinely trotted out to prove investor exuberance is out of control. But to Kantrowitz, it means the market has gotten too large for policy makers to risk ruining.
The S&P 500 now stands about 3% from erasing its bear-market loss. The market extended gains Monday after President Donald Trump, who has always considered the Dow Jones Industrial Average a report card, said he may take executive action to impose a moratorium on evictions with talks on a new virus relief plan stalled in Congress.

As for tech megacaps, while regulatory scrutiny will certainly increase, targeting an industry that’s now helping lift the economy on all fronts, from job creation to investment spending, is sure to look like a bad policy, especially if it’s blamed for any market collapse, according to Kantrowitz.
“It’s a potential risk, but hard to see the government press if stocks get hit,” he said.

279,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>","India app ShareChat in talks with Sequoia, others to raise up to $200 million: sources","By Aditya Kalra, Aditi Shah and Anirban Sen
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian content-sharing platform ShareChat is in early-stage talks with U.S.-based Sequoia Capital and some other investors to raise up to $200 million, which could value the company at over $1 billion, three sources aware of the matter told Reuters.
ShareChat has appointed JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) to advise on the new fund raising which it expects to complete before the end of the year, said the sources, who declined to be named as the talks were private.
The discussions come as Indian apps such as ShareChat are seeing a popularity surge after New Delhi in June banned 59 Chinese origin apps including ByteDance's TikTok following a border clash between the two countries.
ShareChat, in which Twitter (N:TWTR) last year invested an undisclosed amount, declined to comment. It has 140 million monthly active users in India.
JPMorgan declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for Sequoia in India did not respond to Reuters questions.
ShareChat allows users to post content in 15 Indian languages and after TikTok was banned, it launched a similar short-video sharing app named Moj which has clocked up more than 50 million downloads so far.
The money raised by ShareChat will be used to grow its video app further, bring more content creators to its platform and raise its marketing spend, said the first source.
""Investor interest in the company (ShareChat) is strong and 2020 may end up being their best year,"" the source added.
ShareChat is in the process of completing a separate, smaller fund raise of $50-$70 million, mainly from existing investors such as Lightspeed Venture Partners, the second source said.
Lightspeed did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other home-grown TikTok alternatives such as Chingari and Mitron are also finding favour with users in India. Facebook's (O:FB) Instagram also last month introduced a new video sharing feature called ""Reels"" on its platform in India.

280,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 08:45AM ET</span>",Microsoft's rescue attempt of TikTok endears old company to new generation,"By Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has emerged as a savior to young users of TikTok, who praised the tech industry giant for trying to buy parts of the social media company's operations, in hopes of avoiding a U.S. shutdown. 
Bearing hashtags like #SaveTikTok and #Microsoft, which have attracted nearly 1 billion views combined, TikTok'ers - an overwhelmingly young group that uses the app to create short dance, lip-sync, comedy and talent videos - embraced a company founded by people their grandparent's age and whose former chief executive's pre-internet-era onstage outbursts and profuse sweating are now a YouTube meme.
A look at Microsoft’s track record on recent acquisitions, including building game Minecraft in 2014 and business networking site LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) in 2016, could validate TikTok users’ optimism, analysts said.
In recent years, Microsoft has taken a hands-off approach to integrating new acquisitions, said Mike Vorhaus, chief executive of Vorhaus Advisors, a digital media consulting firm. For example, Microsoft left Minecraft’s team operating in Europe, he said.
“You don’t want to lose (TikTok’s) secret sauce, but you want them to gain from Microsoft,” he said.
Microsoft has largely abandoned its historic practice of tying all of its products back to its Windows operating system or other properties. Minecraft apps have no obvious connection to Microsoft. Its sales have quadrupled over the six years since it was acquired and it now reaches 126 million monthly users.
Under Satya Nadella, who took over as Microsoft CEO in 2014, the company purchased two large online communities that it has allowed to operate essentially autonomously. After acquiring business-oriented network LinkedIn for $26.2 billion, LinkedIn kept its brand identity, CEO and its own offices, while GitHub, the code-repository service acquired in 2018, has continued to build tools that help developers use Microsoft's rivals. 
JT Casey, a TikTok user with 2.8 million followers, said he was initially worried about the idea of Microsoft's ownership, but concluded there is a potential change that could benefit video creators.
""I realized Microsoft will figure out a way to monetize better, which will lead to creators making more money, as well as Microsoft,"" he said. 
TIME RUNNING OUT
While TikTok’s fans are lauding Microsoft for coming to the rescue after President Donald Trump threatened a ban over concerns with how the Chinese-owned company handled user data, they are considering other options.
Dmitri Robinson, a 20-year-old TikTok user with more than 270,000 followers, said short-form video apps Triller and Byte are seen as the top two contenders for the next hottest app among conversations with friends and videos he has seen on TikTok.
On Friday, when Trump told reporters he planned to ban TikTok as soon as that weekend, downloads for four TikTok rivals - Triller, Byte, Dubsmash and Likee - all spiked on Sunday, according to data from Apptopia. Daily downloads in the United States for Triller on Sunday almost doubled to nearly 62,000.

 Facebook Inc 's (O:FB) Instagram is also readying the global launch of its TikTok rival, called Reels, which first debuted in Brazil in November.

Shares of the New York-based fashion house fell 5% in premarket trading.
The company's quarterly revenue slumped 77% in North America, with analysts saying demand for high-end handbags, apparel and accessories is not expected to rebound quickly as the global economy enters a deep recession.
The company reported a net loss of $127.7 million, or $1.75 per share, in the first quarter ended June 27, compared with a profit of $117.1 million, or $1.47 per share, a year earlier. 
Excluding certain items, Ralph Lauren reported a loss of $1.82 per share, while analysts were expecting a loss of $1.72 per share. 

Net revenue fell to $487.5 million, missing analysts' average estimate of $615 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

282,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 08:35AM ET</span>",Europe air safety regulator gives no firm date for 737 MAX to fly again,"PARIS (Reuters) - Europe's air safety watchdog has no firm date for Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s grounded 737 MAX to resume flights, it said on Tuesday, adding that the U.S. planemaker had some more work to do before a 17-month-old safety ban could be lifted in Europe.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Monday issued a proposed directive requiring four design or operating changes in the wake of two fatal 737 MAX crashes, in a move which could lead to the agency lifting a grounding order on the jet later this year. 
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) declined to comment directly on the FAA documents, but said it was still waiting to conduct its own test flights before the commercial ban could be lifted in Europe.
""...we are still working to conduct our test flights, scheduling of which has been hampered by the travel restrictions due to COVID-19,"" a spokeswoman said by email.
""The test flights are a prerequisite for EASA to approve the return to service of the 737 MAX in Europe.""
EASA reiterated it would only return the aircraft to service once it felt it was safe.
""In general, good progress has been made but there is still some work which Boeing needs to complete,"" the spokeswoman said.
""In the light of this position, and in common with the FAA, we cannot yet predict a firm schedule for the return to service and the ungrounding of the aircraft in Europe.""
EASA scrutiny is one of a number of hurdles to a widespread return to service, including getting Canadian approval and a public comment period of 45 days on the FAA's proposed changes, as well as finalising a new set of pilot-training procedures. 

Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told analysts last week he expected MAX deliveries to resume in the fourth quarter, comments that were interpreted as a suggesting that the U.S. return to service could slip into next year.

(Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) said on Tuesday that its second-quarter distributable earnings were flat year-on-year, beating many analysts' expectations amid a rise in management and performance fees.
KKR said after-tax distributable earnings (DE) of $326 million was in line with the $327 million posted a year earlier. This translated to after-tax DE per share of 39 cents, which was greater than the 36 cents that Wall Street analysts estimated on average, according to Refinitiv.
Following similar announcements by its peers, KKR said the value of its funds rebounded alongside the recovery of financial markets from a slump caused by the spread of the coronavirus, allowing investment income to rise 37% to $1.58 billion.
KKR's private equity funds rose 11% in the second quarter, while global infrastructure and real estate funds rose 7% and 2% respectively. Its leverage credit funds rose 11%.
Last month, Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) said its private equity portfolio rose 12.8% in the second quarter, while  Carlyle Group  Inc (O:CG) and Apollo Global Management Inc (N:APO) reported that their private equity funds grew 13% and 11.7% respectively.
Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), KKR said its net income rose 36% year-on-year to $698.6 million in the second quarter owing to the appreciation of its funds. 
The New York-based firm said its performance fee income rose 52% to $355.4 million, as it completed asset sales including the 2.8 billion euros ($3.03 billion) divestment of German fiber-optic network company Deutsche Glasfaser to private equity firm EQT (NYSE:EQT) and Canadian pension fund OMERS.
KKR said its total asset management was $222 billion, up from $207.1 billion as of the end of March, driven by strong fundraising in its flagship funds. The firm declared its regular quarterly dividend of 0.135 cents per share.

COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, causes widespread inflammation which could impair or damage the left ventricle of the heart and lead to heart failure or excess fluids in the lungs.
Impella, part of a family of invasive heart pump devices manufactured by Abiomed, provides circulatory support to patients who develop left side ventricular failure and is authorized to be used by healthcare providers in the hospital setting.
It was approved for use in the United States in 2015.
This is the second EUA that the FDA has granted for Impella during the COVID-19 pandemic. In May, the FDA issued an EUA to expand the use of Impella RP to include patients suffering from COVID-19-related right ventricular complications.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures pointed to a slightly lower open Tuesday as investors took a breather after the Nasdaq closed at record highs on Monday boosted by pickup in merger activity, including Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) pursuit of TikTok's U.S. operations.
At 7:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), S&P 500 futures were 10 points, or 0.3% lower and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 40 points, or 0.3%. The Dow futures contract edged down 47 points, or 0.1%.
The move lower came after the Dow ended 0.9% higher on Monday, the S&P 500 hit its highest level since Feb. 21 and the Nasdaq closed at a record high.
Market sentiment was hit as tensions between the U.S. and China flared up amid President Donald Trump's moves to force China-owned TikTok into a sale of its U.S. operations.
Trump said on Monday the U.S. government should get a ""substantial portion"" of any deal price. On Tuesday, state-backed newspaper China Daily said the country will not accept the ""theft"" of the technology company.
Microsoft and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had both jumped on Monday, powering gains in the tech sector.
Apple jumped for a second straight session following stunning quarterly results and announcing a four-for-one stock split. The tech giant is about $140 billion short of hitting $2 trillion in market capitalization.
In Washington, White House officials and Democratic leaders in the U.S. Congress are to hold further talks on a fifth major coronavirus-aid bill Tuesday to help bolster the economy and possibly dispatch new aid to tens of millions of unemployed Americans.
""We're making some progress on certain issues,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters after Monday's talks. ""There are a lot of issues that are still outstanding.""
In commodity markets, U.S. crude futures traded 1.6% lower at $40.34 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent fell 1.7% to $43.41 amid concerns over a patchy rebound in demand just as output is ramping up.
Elsewhere, gold futures were hovering near record highs at $1,980.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1770, little changed on the day.

BEIJING (Reuters) - ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming told employees on Tuesday there were misunderstandings on Chinese social media about TikTok's situation in the United States and that the company could face more difficulties as anti-Chinese sentiment rose abroad. 
His comments in a letter to ByteDance's Chinese employees came after the company and Zhang were heavily criticised on Chinese social media for entering into talks with  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) to sell TikTok's U.S. operations.
Chinese media first reported the contents of the internal letter. A source confirmed the content of the memo to Reuters.
ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
""I actually understand (the criticism),"" Zhang said in the letter. ""People have high expectations of a company founded by a Chinese person which is going global but have little information about it. With lots of grievances towards the U.S. government, they tend to lash out at us with harsh criticism.""
Since Monday, some users of China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) have said they would uninstall ByteDance's Chinese short video app Douyin and news aggregator Jinri Toutiao because they believed ByteDance had given in too quickly to Washington.
Others urged ByteDance to learn from U.S. giant Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which opted to pull its search engine out of the Chinese market in 2010 after China asked it to censor its search results, rather than selling off its Chinese operations. 
Zhang said some people had misunderstood the U.S. situation. He said Washington's goal was not to force a sale of TikTok's U.S. operations through the Committee of Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) but to ban the app, and there was a legal process ByteDance had no choice but to follow.
Zhang told staff on Monday in another internal letter that the company had started talks with a tech company so it could continue to offer the TikTok app in the United States.
U.S. President Donald Trump initially dismissed the idea of selling TikTok's U.S. operations to Microsoft but changed his mind following pressure from some advisers and many in the Republican party, because banning TikTok could alienate many young voters, Reuters has reported.

Zhang also told employees that over the last two years, anti-Chinese sentiment had risen in many countries and the company must brace for more difficulties in the current atmosphere.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Grocery shelves won't be fully stocked with Clorox (NYSE:CLX)'s disinfecting wipes until next year, CEO Benno Dorer told Reuters on Monday, as the world's biggest cleaning products maker struggles with overwhelming pandemic-led demand for its top product.
Since the start of global lockdowns, makers of hygiene goods have seen a sustained boom in sales. While California-based Clorox typically holds aside excess supply for flu seasons, it says it has been unable to keep up with a six-fold increase in demand for many of its disinfectants.
The company is currently understocked across much of its portfolio, which includes Glad trash bags and Burt's Bees lip balm. Supply for most products, like liquid bleach, will improve dramatically over the next four to six months - but not wipes, Dorer said.
Clorox products are used in Uber (NYSE:UBER) vehicles and United Airlines planes, and are sold by major retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Kroger (NYSE:KR).
""Disinfecting wipes, which are the hottest commodity in the business right now, will probably take longer because it's a very complex supply chain to make them,"" Dorer said. Many wipes are made from polyester spunlace, a material currently in short supply as it is also used to make personal protective equipment like masks, medical gowns and medical wipes.
""That entire supply chain is stressed. ... We feel like it's probably going to take until 2021 before we're able to meet all the demand that we have,"" Dorer said. 
Dorer had said in May that Clorox expected to see shelves stocked with wipes by this summer. 
Since then, Clorox has made ""major"" capital investments so it can ramp up output each quarter, including simplifying its disinfectant product line-up at factories that run 24/7 every day of the year. Clorox began outsourcing some manufacturing this year to 10 third-party supplies, and plans to keep looking for more.

On Monday, Clorox reported fourth-quarter sales and earnings that widely topped analysts' expectations, driven by a 33% increase in revenue from its health and wellness business, which makes cleaning products and accounts for more than 40% of total sales.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp's domestic wireless unit raised its free cash flow 50% in its first quarter, part of a broader effort to stabilise the group and help it weather the coronavirus outbreak. 
SoftBank Corp said on Tuesday it generated adjusted free cash flow of 236 billion yen ($2.23 billion) in the April-June quarter, compared with 159 billion yen a year earlier, in part through securitisation of receivables. 
CEO Ken Miyauchi said the wireless carrier aims to cut costs and reduce debt. After a wave of consolidation among Japanese internet companies there would be no large deals for a while, he said, adding share buybacks would be considered. 
SoftBank Group has cut its stake in the telco to 62.1% from 67.1% as Chief Executive Masayoshi Son sells assets to buttress the parent's finances and fund a record 2.5 trillion yen share repurchase plan. 
The group buyback has fuelled a divergence in market valuation, with SoftBank Corp's share price languishing below its 1,500 yen initial public offering price from December 2018, even as its parent's shares rocket to two-decade highs.

SoftBank Group reports its earnings on Aug. 11.
The telco reported a 4% rise in first-quarter operating profit, beating analyst estimates, as falling profit at its consumer business was offset by growth in enterprise as it benefits from growing demand for teleworking services amid the coronavirus outbreak.
SoftBank is making a major push into online retailing through companies it controls. 
Z Holdings Corp last week said operating profit from e-commerce topped its media business for the first time. Online fashion retailer Zozo Inc also reported a big profit jump as shoppers moved online.
Japan's third-largest wireless carrier maintained its forecast of flat operating profit of 920 billion yen for the current financial year through March 2021. 

Separately on Tuesday, the telco said it had under-reported 3 billion yen of income during the financial year to end-March 2019, entailing additional taxes.

The company, which operates 449 restaurants in the UK and is currently owned by Chinese private equity firm Hony Capital, said it had started a sale process to find a new owner.
PizzaExpress said it will soon launch a company voluntary arrangement in the UK as part of an agreement with some of its secured creditors and its majority shareholder. 
The deal includes reducing the company's external debt from 735 million pounds ($959.84 million) to 319 million pounds, a provision of up to 144 million pounds and the divestment of its mainland China business.
The restaurant group said its bondholders would acquire the company if a third party does not outbid them. 
PizzaExpress, which had to shut its outlets during coronavirus lockdowns, said 166 of its restaurants are now open and further reopenings are well underway.

""Customer demand has been encouraging at 60 restaurants that reopened in early July,"" it said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German drugs and pesticides group Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) slumped to a 9.5 billion euro ($11.2 billion) net loss in the second quarter, mainly reflecting charges to settle disputes inherited with its $63 billion takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON).
The charges stemmed mainly from a $10.9 billion settlement of U.S. lawsuits claiming weedkiller Roundup caused cancer, compounding a net loss that is the worst for Bayer in at least 10 years, according to a spokesman.
Settlements on dicamba, another weedkiller, and on waste water contaminated with PCB, were also included in figures released on Tuesday, as were reserves for a deal on injury claims from birth control device Essure which Bayer said could be imminent.
Talks over a potential Essure settlements ""intensified and have made good progress in recent weeks,"" Bayer said, adding that it stood by the device's safety and efficacy.
Funds set aside for Essure accounted for most of the litigations charges of 1.25 billion euros at the pharmaceuticals unit for the quarter. As of July 24, 32,000 U.S. users of Essure had brought lawsuits against Bayer, slightly less than in February, Bayer said.
Overall special items would reach about 14 billion euros for the full year, it warned.
Shares in the company were down 2.9% at 56.75 euros by 0935 GMT.
In a bid to turn investor attention to its operating business, Bayer said core earnings or EBITDA, adjusted for special items, would reach 12.1 billion euros this year, down from a target of between 12.3 billion and 12.6 billion issued in February.
It said its pharmaceuticals and consumer health businesses would normalize overall, hoping the COVID-19 pandemic would no longer deter patients from seeing doctors, but it expects slower growth in seeds and crop protection as the viral outbreak weighs on demand for biofuels in North America. 

A second-quarter gain in adjusted EBITDA of 5.6% to 2.88 billion euros was slightly above analyst expectations.

(Reuters) - European shares slipped on Tuesday as disappointing earnings reports from  Diageo  and Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) took the shine off a jump in growth-linked cyclical stocks, while investors awaited signs of progress on more U.S. fiscal stimulus.
The world's largest spirits maker, Diageo Plc (L:DGE), slid 6.3% as it reported a bigger-than-expected decline in underlying net sales across all markets except North America, bucking a trend which has seen alcohol producers propped up by supermarket sales during lockdowns.
German drugs and pesticides group Bayer (DE:BAYGn) also fell 3.6% as moves to settle lawsuits over its Roundup weedkiller helped drive a 9.5 billion euro ($11.2 billion) loss.
Energy major  BP  (L:BP) by contrast jumped 7% as it used results to bring forward plans to speed its reinvention as a lower carbon company, funded in part by $25 billion in asset sales by 2025. [nL8N2F61A0]
Oil & gas led gains among industrial sectors (SXEP) with a 2.4% rise, while automakers (SXAP) and banks (SX7P) rose between 1.5% and 2%.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) slipped 0.2% overall, with UK (FTSE) and German (GDAXI) stocks both down.
After a stunning recovery since March lows that has seen the STOXX 600 climb nearly 36%, European stocks have wobbled in recent weeks on concerns about a resurgence in coronavirus cases.
""We're already trading at high levels in equity markets, from here on it's going to be more challenging,"" said Elwin de Groot, head of macro strategy at Rabobank.
""The economy has been recovering in the last couple of months, but it remains to be seen whether activity can make headway, given the geopolitical situation and in some areas new lockdowns, although targeted, are being implemented."" 
Doubts over the progress of a U.S. coronavirus aid package and a diplomatic tussle over Chinese tech companies' operations in the United States also kept investors on edge. 
Banking-heavy Italian (FTMIB) and Spanish (IBEX) indexes were both higher, as data showed Italy standing out as the main beneficiary of the European Central Bank's efforts to support a virus-stricken euro zone economy.
Of the 57% of companies listed on the STOXX 600 that have reported so far, nearly 62% have topped analysts' much-reduced expectations for results, according to Refinitiv data. 
Chipmaker Infineon (DE:IFXGn) jumped 4.7% after its CEO Reinhard Ploss signalled ""concrete signs of recovery within the automotive sector"".

 Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) gained 2.8% as it said it had returned to strong growth in China in June and saw online sales jump 74% in the second quarter.

U.S.-China tensions worsened as President Donald Trump said that he will ban Chinese app TikTok in the U.S. unless a tech company such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) buys it.
The move provoked an outcry on Chinese social media and criticism from a prominent Chinese investor in TikTok's owner, ByteDance.
""This kind of rhetoric lines up with our view that U.S.-China frictions may increase into the U.S. elections, injecting volatility into related assets like China tech ADRs (American Depository Receipts) while also supporting insurance assets like gold,"" wrote UBS Global Wealth Management's chief investment officer, Mark Haefele.
The rebound in the dollar faltered, with investors still waiting for Washington to make progress in talks over the next round of fiscal stimulus. 
A $600-per-week enhanced unemployment benefit, which provided a lifeline for the tens of millions of Americans who lost their jobs due to the pandemic, expired on Friday.
Lawmakers said they had made progress in the talks, and U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will meet again with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows on Tuesday, raising hopes for a breakthrough.

Ten-year German bond yields edged down to -0.5249, still above the two-month lows reached at the end of last week (DE10YT=RR).
Spot gold held close to all-time highs, at $1,974.77 per ounce, amid mounting COVID-19 cases and a warning from the World Health Organization that the road to normality would be long.
Oil prices slipped on fears that a new wave of COVID-19 infections could curtail a pick-up in fuel demand, just as major producers ramp up output.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) eased 21 cents, or 0.5% to $40.79 a barrel at 0800 GMT. Brent crude (LCOc1) futures fell 25 cents, or 0.6% to $43.90 a barrel.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - India's top private-sector lender  HDFC Bank Ltd  (NS:HDBK) has received the approval to name insider Sashidhar Jagdishan its chief executive officer, the bank said on Tuesday, as it steers itself through the coronavirus downturn.
Jagdishan, who will replace Aditya Puri - HDFC Bank's CEO of 26 years, takes over at a time when the country's lenders are facing a flood of potential loan defaults as the pandemic brings small businesses to the brink.
Currently the head of finance and ""strategic change agent"" at the Mumbai-based bank, Jagdishan will start his new role from Oct. 27, the lender said, after the Reserve Bank of India cleared the appointment.
Investors cheered the move, sending HDFC Bank's shares up as much as 6% after local media first reported the news citing sources and pushing the broader Mumbai market (NSEI) higher.
Puri, who has been at the helm since HDFC Bank's inception in 1994, is the country's highest paid banker and has been credited with turning the bank into a financial powerhouse over the years.
Puri has run the bank with an iron hand, preventing it from accruing a high level of bad loans at a time when most of its peers are struggling, analysts have said.
It is one of three domestic lenders that the Reserve Bank of India has designated as ""too big to fail"". The bank has been able to maintain strong profit growth and stable asset quality amid the pandemic.
""In an uncertain environment like this, we believe an internal candidate who is in sync with the outgoing CEO Mr Puri is the right choice,"" Macquarie Research said in a note.

The bank said in a regulatory filing https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/9cb34b1b-0791-453e-8df1-fdd87039bf2d.pdf its board will meet in due course to approve Jagdishan's appointment. The RBI has approved a three-year term for Jagdishan.

The AFT said the suspension arose after the execution on June 16, 2015, of transactions that seriously affected the liquidity of the French sovereign bond market and a failure by Morgan Stanley to disclose an investigation by the French AMF watchdog into those transactions.
Morgan Stanley said it had taken note of the AFT's decision, adding that it was working on remedial measures and hoped to regain its primary dealership status with the French state treasury as soon as possible.
Last December Morgan Stanley was fined 20 million euros ($23.53 million) by the AMF for manipulation of sovereign bonds, which the bank is appealing against.

The move was largely expected after European peer Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc slashed its own dividend in April. While Big Oil’s generous payouts have long been its main attraction to investors, the unprecedented market turmoil wrought by the virus has forced companies to take decisions unthinkable before this year.
BP also announced a new strategy to deliver its “net-zero” ambition, targeting a 10-fold increase in low-carbon investment by 2030 and a 30%-35% decline in emissions from its operations by that year.
The company reported an adjusted net loss of $6.68 billion for the second quarter, following a $2.81 billion profit a year earlier. Analysts had estimated a loss of $8.45 billion. It cut its dividend to 5.25 cents a share.
BP had raised its payout in the fourth quarter to 10.5 cents a share, in the final set of results for outgoing Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley. But as the coronavirus spread across the world, destroying demand and hammering oil prices, the $8 billion annual payout had looked increasingly shaky.
Virtually every part of BP’s business, from its forecourts to its oil and gas production, was hit by the pandemic’s devastating impact on fuel consumption. But there was one bright spot: oil trading delivered an “exceptionally strong result,” BP said.
The oil major’s sprawling trading unit capitalized on the period’s volatility and in particular made money from so-called contango plays. That trade involves putting cheap oil into storage and simultaneously selling it at higher prices on the forward market. Total SE, Shell and Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) all reaped the benefits of contango, with trading gains saving them from a quarterly loss.
American counterparts  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). and  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX), which have a more timid approach to trading, posted their worst set of quarterly results of the modern era.

308,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 02:25AM ET</span>",Valuation of Asian shares rises to decade high on stimulus support,"(Reuters) - The valuation of Asian shares surged to a more than 10-1/2-year high in July, Refinitiv data showed, as record-low interest rates and abundant government stimulus helped offset worries over the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares rose 4.29% last month, recording its fourth straight monthly gain. The index's 12-month forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was at 16.15, the highest since December 2009, the data showed.
Meanwhile, MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe climbed 5.14% in July, lifting its P/E ratio to 19.65, the highest since at least June 2003.
Lower interest rates, stimulus support from regional governments and retail investors' increased participation in stock markets have bolstered the valuation of regional indexes this year, analysts said.
Hopes that vaccines against the COVID-19 disease might be ready by the end of the year also supported the risk-on trade in regional markets.
China's benchmark stock index surged 10.9% in July, recording its best monthly rise since February 2019, and topped regional gains.
Simona Gambarini, markets economist at Capital Economics, said the higher P/E ratios of mainland China equities, which have been driven higher by a government-sanctioned wave of retail speculation, do not yet suggest signs of trouble.
""One reason why we wouldn't put too much emphasis on high P/E ratios in general is that earnings are distorted by the impact of the pandemic, which has been very large but will probably also prove short lived,"" Gambarini said.

309,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 02:22AM ET</span>",Stocks - Europe Seen Higher; BP Weighs After Dividend Cut,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening largely higher Tuesday, helped by signs of progress in Washington over another U.S. stimulus bill as Covid cases rise globally, but with weak results from oil giant  BP  (NYSE:BP) weighing on the U.K. market.
At 2:20 AM ET (0620 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.4%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%,
The markets are looking to the U.S. Congress for lawmakers to overcome the current stalemate and agree to another round of stimulus to help boost the American economy, the world’s largest.
""We're making some progress on certain issues, moving closer together,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters after Monday's talks. ""There are a lot of issues that are still outstanding. But I think there is a desire to get something done as soon as we can.""
A key sticking point remains what to do about the $600-per-week enhanced unemployment benefit, which expired on Friday.
This comes as the World Health Organization warned on Monday that the road to normality from the Covid-19 virus would be long, and there might never be a ""silver bullet” in the form of a perfect vaccine.
More than 18.28 million people around the world are reported to have been infected with the disease and over 693,000​ have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, with some nations that thought they were over the worst experiencing a resurgence.
Turning back to Europe, the economic data slate is largely empty of substance Tuesday but the earnings season continues.
In the spotlight, will be BP (LON:BP), with the oil major cutting its dividend in half after reporting a $16.8 billion loss for the second quarter, after taking a charge of $10.9 billion, mostly for writing down the value of various projects after the steep fall in oil prices.
Elsewhere, German drugs and pesticides group Bayer (DE:BAYGN) reported a 9.5 billion euro ($11.2 billion) net loss for the second quarter, following a $10.9 billion settlement of U.S. lawsuits claiming that its weedkiller Roundup caused cancer.
Oil prices weakened Tuesday, with concerns about fuel demand growth as Covid-19 cases increase across the globe as the major crude producers move to increase supply weighing. This has overshadowed Monday’s strong manufacturing data from the U.S., the world’s largest consumer.
OPEC+, a grouping of OPEC and allies including Russia, is set to step up output in August, adding about 1.5 million barrels per day to global supply.
Investors are now looking towards the American Petroleum Institute crude oil data to be released later Tuesday for further direction.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% lower at $40.73 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.7% to $43.83. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,980.10/oz, reaching a record high for a second consecutive day, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1772, up 0.1%.

310,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 02:09AM ET</span>","China Won’t Allow a TikTok ‘Smash and Grab’ by U.S., State Media Warns","(Bloomberg) -- China’s government won’t accept an acquisition of TikTok’s U.S. operations by  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and may take action against Washington if a sale is forced, the Beijing-backed China Daily said in its Tuesday editorial.
It’s Beijing’s strongest defense so far of ByteDance Ltd. and its viral video phenom, which President Donald Trump threatened to ban unless a deal is struck by Sept. 15 to sell TikTok’s U.S. business to Microsoft or another U.S. entity. That process is tantamount to officially sanctioned theft, the Communist Party mouthpiece wrote, echoing prominent Beijing-backed media like the Global Times.
“China will by no means accept the ‘theft’ of a Chinese technology company, and it has plenty of ways to respond if the administration carries out its planned smash and grab,” it said, without specifying options. “With competitiveness now dependent on the ability to collect and use data, it offers an either-or choice of submission or mortal combat in the tech realm.”
ByteDance became the world’s largest startup thanks to the success abroad of TikTok, which American lawmakers accuse of posing a threat to national security by vacuuming up data. Trump now has the power to potentially cripple ByteDance’s prized asset by adding TikTok to the U.S. entity list, which would compel American companies such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google to drop the service from their app stores.

The U.S. crackdown has split many in the industry: Some decry the betrayal of values like free speech and capitalism, while others advocate doing whatever it takes to subdue a geopolitical rival and its pivotal tech industry.
Trump repeatedly insisted on Monday that any sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations would have to include a substantial payment to the U.S. That was “open robbery,” tweeted Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a tabloid run by the Party’s flagship People’s Daily.
It’s unclear what regulatory measures China could take. The Global Times wrote China has a “limited ability” to protect its companies since the U.S. still enjoys technological superiority. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has previously criticized Washington for employing double standards in trying to ban TikTok. But asked about the latest developments at a regular press briefing Monday, a spokesperson said: “We also don’t comment on the specific business activity of the relevant companies.”

The trend marks a reversal in the risk-seeking behaviour seen during March-June and has caused the country's blue-chip index to pull back from its highest in more than five years.
(GRAPHIC - China's major indexes had witnessed big swings since mid-July, prompting investors to seek shelter in money market funds: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/azgpokzmlpd/China's%20major%20indexes%20had%20witnessed%20big%20swings%20since%20mid-July.jpg) 
MMFs are traditionally considered low-risk and liquid as they normally invest in high-quality assets, including government bonds, and yield is closely related to general cash conditions in the financial system.
Hwabao Tianyi ETF (SS:511990), the largest money market ETF listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, saw its total units increase 35.6% to 968 million on Aug. 3, from 714 million on July 13 when the CSI300 blue-chip started to retreat from its five-year high. 
Huatai-PB CSI 300 ETF (SS:510300), the largest ETF tracking the blue-chip CSI300 index (CSI300), saw its total units decrease 17.9% to 7.8 billion on Aug. 3, from 9.5 billion on July 13. 
""Some investors, in particular those heavily leveraged, want to exit the stock market for the moment given the big uncertainties around the Sino-U.S. tensions, and park their money in the money market funds,"" said Zhang Chengyu, vice general manager of Beijing-based Shiji Hongfan Asset Management Co.

China's major indexes saw two sessions of big plunges on July 16 and July 24, as worries mounted over policy tightening, following better-than-expected GDP data in the second quarter, and over escalating Sino-U.S. tensions. 

In July, the CSI300 and SSEC had both shed as much as 8% in their recent corrections, but they are up and 16.6% and 10.5% for the year, respectively.

Gold has rallied to a record this year as the coronavirus pandemic savaged growth, with gains supported by massive inflows into bullion-backed ETFs. Bulls are fearful that the waves of stimulus to fight the slowdown may debase paper currencies and ignite inflation. They also point to simmering geopolitical tensions, rising government debt burdens, and lofty equity valuations.
Worldwide holdings in gold-backed ETFs rose to 3,365.6 tons on Monday, up 30.5% this year, according to preliminary data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s a couple of tons ahead of Germany’s stash. U.S. reserves exceed 8,000 tons.
Even after futures topped $2,000 an ounce, there are plenty of forecasts for further, substantial gains. Among them, Goldman Sachs says gold may climb to $2,300 as investors are “in search of a new reserve currency,” while RBC Capital Markets puts the odds of a rally to $3,000 at 40%.
On Tuesday, futures traded at $1,993.20 an ounce, just below the latest record of $2,009.50, which was set on Monday. ETFs enable investors to trade in gold without needing to take physical delivery of the precious metal.

313,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 01:16AM ET</span>",Lobbying for Russian pipeline spikes in Washington,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As U.S. lawmakers plot to stop one of Moscow's most important projects in Europe, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, lobbyists supporting it are busier than ever but disclosing few details of their work, according to government filings and current and former U.S. officials.
The pipeline linking Russian gas fields to Western Europe has become a lightning rod of contention in U.S.-Russia relations, with the Trump administration concerned it would dangerously expand the region’s energy dependence on Moscow but backers, including in Europe, saying the gas is needed.
U.S. President Donald Trump has already signed a sanctions bill that delayed construction on the $11 billion project, wholly-owned by Russia's state-run Gazprom (MM:GAZP) and headed by Alexei Miller, a longtime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. But lawmakers fearful the measures are not enough to prevent the pipeline’s completion are contemplating further action.
Nord Stream 2 AG has paid lobbyists at BGR Group, Roberti Global LLC, and Sweeney & Associates a combined $1.69 million during the first half of this year, according to Senate records. That is more than double the amount during the same period a year ago, and more than all of 2018, the first full year the project lobbied in Washington. 
But exactly who the lobbyists meet with is a mystery because they have not registered with the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, a law passed in 1938 to limit the influence of Nazi Germany and Communist Russia in U.S. politics. Under FARA, lobbyists must disclose every meeting with U.S. officials, along with the materials they distribute. 
Instead, the Nord Stream 2 lobbyists have registered under the 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act, a law that amended FARA by allowing lobbyists for foreign companies or individuals to report much less information as long as their work is not intended to benefit a foreign government. 
Representatives for Nord Stream 2 and the lobbying companies did not respond to requests for comment. But Nord Stream 2 has characterized itself as a commercial, not political, project.
A senior Trump administration official took issue with that, saying the lobbyists are seeking to further Moscow's national interests. 
""The fact that you’ve got people working for Gazprom, which is essentially the Russian state, you know to manipulate our processes … it’s crazy,"" the official said, asking not to be named discussing the issue.
Danielle Nichols, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice, which handles FARA registrations, said the department had no comment at this time. 
Lobbyists for Nord Stream 2’s foreign opponents, by contrast, have registered under FARA. Yorktown Solutions LLC, for example, which lobbies for Ukraine's state-owned Naftogaz and its partner companies against the pipeline, is among them, according to FARA records. 
Andriy Kobolyev, Naftogaz's chief executive told Reuters in an email that company representatives travel to Washington about once a month to provide updates on the status of Nord Stream 2 and discuss how to stop the pipeline. 
Nord Stream 2 will double the capacity of an existing line to Germany under the Baltic Sea to 110 billion cubic meters of gas per year, enough to supply 26 million households. It would circumvent U.S. ally Ukraine, depriving it of potentially billions of dollars in transit fees, and compete with U.S. efforts to sell liquefied natural gas into Europe.
U.S. senators Ted Cruz, a Republican, and Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, are among the pipeline’s biggest opponents in Congress and are pushing new sanctions measures that would target insurers of Gazprom vessels that would lay the last 100 miles (160 km) of pipe in Danish waters, where unexploded bombs from World War II lie in the pipeline’s path. 
Neither senator responded to a request for comment. 
Nord Stream 2 backers say Germany and other European countries need Russian gas, and Germany has threatened retaliatory action if U.S. sanctions stop the project.

Austria's OMV (VI:OMVV), German firms Uniper (DE:UN01) and Wintershall (DE:BASFn), Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and France's Engie (PA:ENGIE) provide half the project’s the long-term financing.

South Korea's Supreme Court in 2018 ordered Nippon Steel to pay 100 million won ($83,800) each to four South Koreans as compensation for forced labor during World War II, angering Japan which says the issue of compensation was settled under a 1965 treaty and that the ruling violated international law.
A subsequent ruling by a South Korean lower court allowed for the seizure of Nippon Steel assets. Starting midnight Tuesday, the Pohang branch of the Daegu District Court has gained the right to start procedures to auction off some of Nippon Steel's stake in a joint venture with  POSCO  (NYSE:PKX), South Korean media have reported.
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga reiterated on Tuesday that the South Korean ruling was a ""clear violation of international law"", adding that any asset seizure must be prevented to keep the situation from becoming more serious.
Following the ruling, Japan last year said it would stop preferential treatment for shipments to South Korea of three materials whose production it dominates and which are used by firms such as Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd (KS:005930).
Seoul has filed a complaint to the World Trade Organization over the export curbs which remain in place for two of the three materials. The WTO last month set up a panel to rule on the complaint.

Nippon Steel holds 81,075 shares in PNR, a Korea-based joint venture with steelmaker POSCO, which are worth about 400 million won at face value, according to Yonhap news agency.

318,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 10:10PM ET</span>",U.S. judge denies claims Uber won price-fixing suit because arbitrator was scared,"By Tina Bellon
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday denied a request by an Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc customer to overturn an arbitration win for the company in a price-fixing case over claims the arbitrator only ruled in Uber's favor because he was scared.
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan said the claim was without merit, with the arbitrator, Les Weinstein, simply joking when he said he dismissed the lawsuit in February and said he acted out of fear.
""After carefully reviewing the full record, the court finds that the arbitrator's concluding remarks, rather than a sincere confession of fear, were simply an attempt at humor - one of many made by the arbitrator throughout the hearing,"" Rakoff wrote on Monday. 
Spencer Meyer initiated the high-profile 2015 antitrust lawsuit alleging Uber engaged in an illegal conspiracy with its drivers to coordinate high ""surge pricing"" fares during periods of heavy demand by agreeing to charge prices set by an algorithm in the Uber ride-hailing app.
The lawsuit sought a nationwide ban against surge pricing. A ruling against the company would have threatened Uber's business, which takes a cut from drivers' earnings.
The company argues its drivers are independent contractors and that its app is merely a technology platform connecting drivers with passengers. 
After going through several courts, the lawsuit was sent into arbitration in 2019 in accordance with Uber's terms of service. Weinstein, the arbitrator, dismissed Spencer's lawsuit on Feb. 22. 
According to court transcripts, he concluded his ruling by saying: ""I must say I act out of fear. My fear is if I ruled Uber illegal, I would need security. I wouldn't be able to walk the streets at night. People would be after me.""

Spencer in May asked Rakoff to overturn the ruling, arguing Weinstein had displayed ""evident partiality.""

319,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 10:00PM ET</span>",U.S. FAA lays plan for Boeing 737 MAX's return; hurdles remain,"By David Shepardson and Eric M. Johnson
WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Monday it is proposing requiring four key  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 MAX design and operating changes to address safety issues seen in two fatal crashes that led to the plane's grounding in March 2019.
The agency is issuing a proposed airworthiness directive to require updated flight-control software, revised display-processing software to generate alerts, a revision of certain flight-crew operating procedures and changes in the routing of some wiring bundles.
While the measures align with those expected by Boeing and aerospace analysts for months, the announcement comes after a series of delays and sets in motion the final sequence of events that could lead to the FAA lifting a grounding order on the plane later this year.  
There are still a number of hurdles, including collecting public comments on the changes for 45 days, and finalizing a new set of pilot-training procedures. Transport Canada and Europe's EASA have their own concerns.
Given the work left, it remains unclear whether U.S. flights will resume before year-end.
Boeing shares closed 2.7% higher on Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up nearly 1%. 
In response to the FAA's proposal, Chicago-based Boeing said it was ""continuing to make steady progress towards the safe return to service, working closely with the FAA and other global regulators.""
The FAA said in a separate 96-page report on Monday it ""has preliminarily determined that Boeing's proposed changes to the 737 MAX design, flightcrew procedures and maintenance procedures effectively mitigate the airplane-related safety issues."" The airworthiness directive seeks to require Boeing changes.
The crisis over the grounding of the once top-selling 737 MAX has cost the U.S. planemaker more than $19 billion, slashed production and hobbled its supply chain, with criminal and congressional investigations still ongoing.
The FAA's review has taken more than 18 months and included more than 40 full-time engineers, inspectors, pilots, and technical support staff. To date, the FAA has conducted more than 60,000 hours of review, certification testing, and document evaluation.
The agency is also proposing that 737 MAX operators conduct an Angle of Attack (AOA) sensor system test and perform an operational readiness flight before returning airplanes to service. 
The changes are designed to prevent the erroneous activation of a key system known as MCAS tied to both crashes, to alert pilots if two AOA sensors are receiving conflicting data and to ensure flightcrew can respond to erroneous stabilizer movement.
The FAA said the changes minimize ""dependence on pilot action and the effect of any potential single failure"".

The wiring change will ensure the MAX complies with FAA's wire separation safety standards.

320,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 09:00PM ET</span>","Melbourne Retail, Manufacturing Shut to Contain Virus","(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s Victoria state will shut down large parts of its retail and manufacturing sectors for six weeks across the city of Melbourne after a lockdown failed to contain a spike in coronavirus cases.
Premier Daniel Andrews on Monday also announced that construction firms must radically reduce the number of workers on site across the city, while production at meatworks statewide will be cut by a third. Essential services such as banks, supermarkets, pharmacies and petrol stations will remain open, he said.
“This will have a very significant impact” on the economy, Andrews said. “But until we fix the health problem, until we get these case numbers down to a much, much lower level, we simply cannot open the economy up again. So there is significant damage that needs to be done.”
The outbreak in Australia’s second-most populous state shows no signs of abating, three weeks after Melbourne’s 5 million residents were ordered to stay home except for work, medical care, provisions or exercise. On Sunday, the government said the lockdown would be widened to cover the whole state, while Melbourne was placed under a six-week curfew between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m.
Andrews told reporters Monday the state recorded 429 new cases and 13 more deaths in the past 24 hours.
The tighter restrictions threaten to exacerbate Australia’s first recession in almost 30 years. Victoria contributes about one-quarter of gross domestic product, but is now isolated from the rest of the country as other states shutter their borders against the worrying spike in community transmission.
Deadly Australia Flareup Shows Limits of Locking Down Again
Australia’s Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said earlier Monday the economy faces another significant hit from the extended lockdown and restrictions on workplaces.
“This is a massive kick in the guts to Victorian businesses,” Frydenberg told Sky News. Treasury had previously estimated a six-week Melbourne lockdown would cost the economy A$3.3 billion ($2.4 billion) in the September quarter.
Consumer discretionary stocks extended losses following the announcement.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the restrictions were a “devastating blow” to Victorians and announced a new disaster payment of A$1,500 for people who have run out of sick leave and have to self-isolate for 14 days.
Addressing the media in Melbourne, Andrews said grocery and liquor stores, news agencies and post offices would also remain open and urged against panic buying. Retailers that have an on-line, click and collect facility could continue to operate, he said.
People working in administration in the city must also stay home under the restrictions. Warehousing and distribution centers in Melbourne will be limited to no more than two-thirds of the normal workforce.
Large scale public construction projects have already halved their workforce and commercial sites for buildings above three storeys must cap the number of employees at 25%. Only 5 people will be allowed at any one time on residential construction sites. The new measures mean an additional 250,000 workers will be forced to stay home.
Andrews said further announcements would be made in the next few days as consultation with industry groups continues.
Schools across the state will move to remote learning from Wednesday, while childcare centers in Melbourne will close to all but essential workers from Thursday.
Separately, New South Wales -- the nation’s most populous state -- recorded another 13 cases Monday. Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she was “strongly encouraging” residents to wear masks in certain situations, such as supermarkets and places of worship.
Winter Virus Surge Down Under Shows U.S., Europe What May Come
“I want to stress it’s not compulsory, but it is a strong recommendation,” Berejiklian told reporters. “I can’t stress enough how critical the next few weeks are,” adding she was taking extra measures due to the state’s geographical proximity to Victoria.
Australia’s first lockdown that lasted roughly from March to May was one of the most successful in the world, bringing down cases to just a handful a day nationwide. But security failures at quarantine hotels for returning travelers and poor communication of critical information to migrant communities allowed the virus to roar back in Victoria.
With those unable to work from home not willing to sacrifice wages, and people losing patience with physical isolation, many no longer seem willing to fully follow the rules as the economic and social costs mount.

321,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 07:45PM ET</span>",Singapore Startup Seeks to Give Solar Power a Competitive Edge,"(Bloomberg) -- A Singapore startup is seeking to connect potential buyers and sellers of solar power directly.
Electrify Pte’s platform lets owners of homes and businesses bid and offer rates for specific amounts of electricity. By selling directly to users rather than the grid, solar owners can get more money for their power, while consumers avoid paying a premium for renewable energy.
The platform underscores how cheap solar, with its ability to be installed just about anywhere with a roof, is challenging the decades-old model of power grids that deliver electricity one way from plants to homes. It’s also allowing smaller players to join massive utilities in profiting from differences in electricity prices.
“Power grids are old and designed for centralized generation, but that’s changing,” Martin Lim, the chief executive officer of Electrify, said in an interview.
Electrify’s marketplace can benefit both those with solar roofs as well as people and businesses who want to support green energy, Lim said. The company is testing the platform with a one-year pilot program in Singapore involving 100 people and businesses.
Homes and businesses in Singapore that have rooftop solar sets that produce excess power can currently sell it back into the grid at near wholesale prices, which is usually well below the retail price most customers pay for their electricity.
Electrify allows them to offer it at a higher rate, Lim said. He currently advises users to price deals around the retail price.
When a consumer and producer agree on a rate, they sign a six-month deal, and Electrify uses meters installed at both sites to determine total sales over the length of the contract.
For buyers, it allows them to say they’re paying for solar power, which is important to some climate-conscious people and a growing number of businesses trying to prove their green credentials.
The arrangement should allow solar owners to increase revenue, which could lead to increased rooftop builds, said Jenny Chase, head of solar analysis for BloombergNEF. However it likely won’t drive a huge expansion, as solar owners prefer long-term contracts to mitigate their investment risks.
Electrify, which attracted a small investment from Tokyo Electric Power Co. in 2018, is partnering with Senoko Energy for its Singapore pilot. The company is also in talks with governments and utilities in places like Australia and Thailand.
The company is currently charging a 5% transaction fee for energy exchanged on its platform during the pilot. It wants to capture a 20% market share of solar energy transacted in Southeast Asia by 2025, and envisions generating around $20 million in annual revenue by that year, Lim said.

(Reuters) - Insurer American International Group Inc (N:AIG) on Monday posted a 56% fall in quarterly adjusted earnings, spurred partly by higher catastrophe losses and lower private-equity returns.
Adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders fell to $571 million in the second quarter ended June 30, from $1.3 billion a year earlier. 
Excluding items, AIG earned a profit of 66 cents per share compared with $1.43 per share a year earlier, exceeding Factset expectations of 50 cents per share, the company said.
Shares of AIG, one of the largest U.S. insurers, rose 3.7% in after-hours trading.
AIG posted an underwriting loss of $343 million in its general insurance business, compared with a $147 million profit a year earlier. 
The loss included $674 million of catastrophes, net of reinsurance, partly reflecting $458 million related to COVID-19 and $126 million for civil unrest claims.
A decline in travel during the pandemic affected AIG's travel insurance business.
Net adjusted investment income dropped $537 million from a year ago to $3.2 billion. Performance was hurt by $276 million in private-equity losses compared with $238 million in private-equity income a year ago which included a large gain from one of the holdings.
AIG's general insurance accident year combined ratio excluding changes from losses incurred in past years, was 94.9 for the quarter, compared with 96.1 a year ago.
AIG has been using the metric to gauge the success of a turnaround plan launched by Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault upon taking the insurer's helm in 2017.
A ratio below 100 means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims.
Gross premiums written fell 2% to $8.47 billion in the general insurance business.
AIG's life and retirement unit posted $881 million in adjusted pretax income compared with $1.0 billion a year ago, driven partly by private-equity losses and deaths from COVID-19.

AIG completed selling a 76.6% stake in its run-off company, Fortitude Group Holdings LLC, to  Carlyle Group  Inc (O:CG) and T&D United Capital Co Ltd on June 2. The deal reduces risk on AIG's balance sheet, the company said.

324,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 04:54PM ET</span>",Microsoft’s Long History in China Complicates Potential TikTok Deal,"(Bloomberg) --  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT).’s attempt to buy TikTok’s U.S. operations represents the latest step in a careful dance the software maker has performed to meet the demands of the Chinese and U.S. governments while doing business in both places, a balancing act that has grown increasingly fraught in the political conflict between the countries.
China hawks in the Trump administration oppose any purchase of the social-media service by Microsoft, which wants the popular app to expand its consumer internet business in the U.S. But the company also wants to maintain its robust business in China, the world’s most-populous country.
Microsoft entered China in 1992, helping to engineer the government's computer systems and installing special versions of Windows operating systems that would comply with the country's censorship controls. Early on, the company launched a massive research operation in China, churning out a feeder system of tech executives who would go on to start or work at many of China's biggest tech companies. The large presence endeared the Redmond, Washington-based company to Chinese officials, who allowed Microsoft to maintain the only major Western-run search engine and social media companies in Bing and LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD), albeit censored versions.
The company also operates cloud services under a joint venture with a Chinese company and its Xbox console was the first of that type of video-game device approved for sale in China, again through a joint venture. In September, Microsoft president Brad Smith criticized U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration for what he called unfair treatment of Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technolgies Co., raising the ire of some Republican senators. 
That longstanding relationship has prompted White House adviser Peter Navarro, one of the top administration opponents to the TikTok deal, to argue that Microsoft may not be the best suitor for the unit of China-based ByteDance Ltd., or that Microsoft should perhaps be made to divest its Chinese holdings should it acquire TikTok in the U.S. 
""Whose software does the People’s Liberation Army and China run on? Microsoft,” Navarro told CNN on Monday. “The Chinese Communist Party, whose software do they use to do all the things they do? It's Microsoft. So this is not a white hat company. It's an American company, it's clearly a multinational company, that's made billions in China, that enables Chinese censorship through things like Bing and Skype.
""Microsoft is one of one of four or five American technology companies, Yahoo, Google, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and others, who helped China originally build the Great Firewall of China, which is used to surveil, track, monitor, censor and imprison the Chinese people,” Navarro said. “But more importantly, one of the few surviving search engines from America in China is Bing and Microsoft owns Bing so we know that there's some some fishy stuff going on there.”
The Great Firewall of China is the term used to describe the combination of regulation, technology and human monitoring used to control and restrict the internet in the country. Internet products such as Google’s search engine and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).’s main social network aren’t available in China due in part to the reluctance of the U.S. companies to censor information for the Chinese government.
A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment.
Microsoft has emerged as a top contender to buy TikTok partly because Facebook, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google and other tech giants are being scrutinized by U.S. regulators and lawmakers over antitrust issues. Microsoft, which settled antitrust cases almost two decades ago, now occupies an enviable position of relative trust among big tech companies. Rival Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) Inc. has made a complaint against Microsoft in Europe and may do the same in the U.S., so that could change. 
While it has sued the Trump administration several times on issues surrounding cloud data privacy and immigration, Microsoft also has maintained friendly relations, particularly through large contracts with the government. It was recently awarded a massive Defense Department cloud contact over rival Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., which Amazon is alleging in a lawsuit stemmed from Trump’s bias against the e-commerce giant, and unlike Google, Microsoft hasn’t avoiding bidding for military technology deals. 
Over the weekend, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella held talks with Trump, which for the time being salvaged Microsoft's efforts on TikTok after Trump told reporters Friday night that he planned to ban the app from the U.S. 
Microsoft has faced challenges with the Beijing government, too, and has struggled to contain software piracy in the country. Its offices were raided in 2014 as part of an anti-monopoly investigation that ran for several years. The Windows operating system had been banned at times from Chinese government computers, leading Microsoft to offer an altered version that allows the government to use its own encryption and removes some apps and features. And while China accounts for about 18% of the world’s population, it’s less than 2% of Microsoft’s sales, partially because the Chinese market isn’t fully open to U.S. companies, Smith said at a conference in January. 
Read More: The Great Firewall of China
Still, Microsoft's approach differs from rival Google, which pulled its search engine from China in 2010 over concerns about censorship and has since scrapped some search and cloud initiatives it was working on for that market. Last year, the company ended a secretive project, called Dragonfly, to build a new search app in China. In May, Google shut down a plan to offer a new cloud service in China and other politically sensitive countries due, in part, to concerns over geopolitical tensions, sources told Bloomberg News last month. Microsoft and Amazon both offer this kind of cloud service, which lets countries keep data stored locally. Still, at a congressional antitrust hearing last week, multiple lawmakers hammered Google for its recent efforts in China, including setting up an AI lab in Beijing.
For a company to successfully acquire TikTok in the U.S., it will have to pass national security and antitrust muster with Beijing and Washington. Microsoft’s careful work with both governments may make it one of the few that can thread the needle. At the same time, it’s bound to arouse suspicion from both sides that it’s too close to the other.

(Reuters) -  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) named its president, former technology executive Dean Banks, as its new chief executive on Monday as the meatpacker faces unprecedented disruptions from the COVID-19 outbreak.
Tyson said Banks will replace 37-year company veteran Noel White in October as it reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales. The company predicted the pandemic will increase operating costs and hinder sales volumes into next year. 
Uncertainty over the economic reopening confronts Banks, who formerly worked for Google-parent Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) experimental research division. He joined Tyson's board in 2017 and became president in December 2019. 
Chairman John Tyson said Banks will help the company integrate more technology into operations and focus on employee health. 
The novel coronavirus has infected thousands of U.S. meatpacking workers and led to temporary meat shortages as processors closed slaughterhouses in April and May. Plants have reopened, but absences among workers who are afraid of getting sick continue to limit output.
Tyson said it spent $340 million on COVID-19 testing, personal protective equipment and other direct costs related to the disease. The company has tested about 40,000 employees, one-third of its workforce, and less than 1% are currently infected, White said.
Grocery-store sales have spiked during the pandemic, but Tyson said it is grappling with a larger drop in demand from food-service outlets. The company predicted lower sales volumes in its chicken and prepared foods segments in the last fiscal quarter.
In the third quarter ended June 27, Tyson's chicken unit swung to an adjusted operating loss of $120 million from income of $237 million a year earlier. 
""Our level of future growth is dependent on away-from-home eating occasions, which will be impacted by communities opening up and potentially reclosing,"" White told analysts.
JP Morgan said it had expected Banks to replace White, although the change may spook investors. Shares rose 1.6%.
Banks should bring Tyson ""new vision"" on innovation and automation, said Arun Sundaram, equity analyst at CFRA Research. 
Tyson's quarterly sales fell 7.9% to $10.02 billion. Analysts expected $10.56 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Excluding items, Tyson earned $1.40 per share. Analysts had expected 94 cents.

Investing.com - Virgin Galactic fell sharply in after-hours trade on Monday after the space tourism company detailed plans to tap shareholders for $460 million and reported earnings that fell short of analysts' estimates as the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic weighed on performance.
The proceeds of the stock offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, general and administrative matters, and capital expenditures. The company, founded by the British billionaire Sir Richard Branson, has big plans for space travel in the coming year.
Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) fell more than 9% in after-hours trading before recovering some of that ground.
The company reported a GAAP EPS of -$0.30, missing estimates of -$0.26, but revenue of $360 million topped estimates of $825,000.
""During the period, our operations were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, despite our efforts to minimize disruption,"" the company said.
Looking ahead, the company said it expected to ""advance to the next phase of its test flight program with its first powered spaceflight from Spaceport America this fall ... Assuming both flights demonstrate the expected results, Virgin Galactic anticipates Sir Richard Branson’s flight to occur in the first quarter of 2021.""

Investing.com -- Big tech pushed Nasdaq to yet another record and lifted the Dow on Monday as investors looked past concerns about the economic fallout from Washington's stalemate over new stimulus.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are all sharply higher for the year and rose again on Monday. Microsoft said it was pursuing a deal to buy the U.S. operations of the TikTok social media app popular with Gen Z. NASDAQ Composite closed at 10,902, just a breath away from 11,000, as it continues its relentless rise. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly 1%, to 26,675.
Stocks also got a boost from strong earnings reports in recent days and data showing manufacturing is rebounding better than expected.
Anticipation is building over Friday's monthly jobs report for July as lawmakers on Capitol Hill continue to argue over whether to reinstate a $600 weekly federal pandemic assistance payment to those who are unemployed.
Here are some things that could affect the markets tomorrow:
1. Banks are tightening the credit spigot
Banks are tightening their lending standards and terms for everything from commercial loans to household loans like mortgages and credit cards, according to the Federal Reserve's loan officer survey. That could mean higher borrowing costs or less credit available for already Covid-challenged businesses and consumers.
Regulators have already told banks to hold off on stock buybacks so they can preserve capital out of fear that a looming credit crisis could leave them holding big losses. But at the same time, the Fed and other agencies have been encouraging banks to make more credit available to aid in the economic recovery process.
Still, financials are the second-worst performing sector of the S&P 500 so far this year, down more than 20%. Only energy was worse, down 40%. Shares of Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) are down 29% since the beginning of the year, while JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) is down 30% through July.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) is down 36%.  Wells Fargo  & Company (NYSE:WFC) is down 54%.
2. Investors eye Nikola's earnings report on Tuesday
Nikola Corp (NASDAQ:NKLA) shares jumped 21% on Monday as the company prepared to release second quarter earnings on Tuesday. The shares gave back some of that gain in after-hours trading, falling 4.3%.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said in a note on Monday that the electric truck maker could provide business updates that would drive the shares higher in the short term. Among the things investors are hoping to learn more about are the customer pipeline for Nikola's electric semi, its plans to build a hydrogen refueling network, and a manufacturing partner for its Badger pickup truck, according to Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner, according to The Motley Fool.
Analysts have recently been raising their estimates for the quarter, which is typically a bullish sign.
3. TikTok makes news, and not because of a viral video
U.S. presidents typically don't weigh in publicly on corporate M&A activity, but that's not stopping Donald Trump from commenting on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s potential deal for the popular video-making app TikTok.
The president talked with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella over the weekend and then the Seattle company confirmed that it was looking to buy TikTok's operations in the U.S., Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Trump has criticized TikTok and even threatened to ban it in the U.S. because of security concerns over its Chinese parent.
On Monday he told reporters at the White House that TikTok would be shut down on Sept. 15 unless Microsoft or another company buys it. TikTok has about 100 million users in the U.S., many of them teenagers and young adults.
Shares of another popular social media app, Snapchat by  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP), fell 5.6% on Monday after the news of the Microsoft talks with TikTok. Facebook, which owns Instagram, fell less than 1%.

Microsoft (O:MSFT) jumped after it said it would push ahead with talks to buy the U.S. operations of Chinese-owned TikTok. President Donald Trump reversed course earlier on a planned ban of the short-video app.
ADT (N:ADT) soared on news that Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) Google was buying a nearly 7% stake in the home security firm for $450 million in a deal that will allow it to provide service to customers of its Nest home security devices.
 Varian Medical  Systems Inc (N:VAR) jumped after a $16 billion buyout by Germany's Siemens Healthineers (DE:SHLG), while Kansas City Southern (N:KSU) gained after a report a group of buyout investors were considering a takeover bid in a deal of about $20 billion.
""The market is revolving around M&A activity possibly picking up,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""It means CEOs are more confident about the future. Otherwise, why would they lay out billions of dollars?""
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) jumped for a second straight session following stunning quarterly results and announcing a four-for-one stock split. The tech giant is about $140 billion short of hitting $2 trillion in market capitalization.
Tech (SPLRCT) far outpaced gains among the six of 11 major S&P sectors trading higher.
Congressional Democrats and Trump administration officials resumed talks aimed at hammering out a coronavirus relief bill after missing a vital deadline to extend relief benefits to tens of millions of jobless Americans.
A rally in tech-related stocks and trillions of dollars in monetary and fiscal stimulus have lifted the S&P 500 to within about 3% of February's record high.
The Labor Department's monthly employment report is due on Friday, on the heels of last week's weekly jobless claims data that showed a recovery in the job market appeared to have stalled in late July.

Investing.com – The Nasdaq surged to record highs Monday as big tech continued to drive the broader market higher following bullish earnings last week, while healthcare names rallied on positive coronavirus treatment news.
The Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.47% to close at a record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.90%, or 236 points and the S&P 500 gained 0.69%. 
The tech-heavy Nasdaq was powered to all-time highs, led by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), with the latter up 5.6% after confirming that it was in talks to buy social media company TikTok from ByteDance.
The potential acquisition has been cheered by analysts on Wall Street, who believe that the addition of TikTok could boost Microsoft's consumer offering.
""(Satya) Nadella has essentially had the golden touch since becoming CEO… although the missing piece in the puzzle has been a consumer trojan horse strategy which TikTok can fill along with a re-rating/sum-of-the-parts valuation,"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note.
Beyond tech, healthcare also supported investor sentiment on stocks thanks to signs of progress in the race for a coronavirus treatment.
Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) said it would get a phase 3 trial of its experimental coronavirus treatment, LY-CoV555, underway, sending its shares 1.7% higher.
A lack of progress between U.S. lawmakers over the next coronavirus stimulus package, however, kept broader market gains in check.  
Unemployment assistance, set at $600 a week in March, has lapsed, and renewing it has remained a key sticking for lawmakers.
On the earnings front, Clorox (NYSE:CLX) slipped about 1.9% despite delivering quarterly results that beat on the top and bottom lines.
In economic news, signs of a turnaround in manufacturing continued.
ISM manufacturing data  for July showed an uptick to 54.2, beating expectations of 53.6. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy.
""We remain confident that manufacturing will be more resilient to Covid-related developments than the service side of the economy, and activity should continue to expand in coming quarters as the recovery takes hold,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.

In the filing, with U.S. District Judge Paul Borman, GM says the scheme, which it alleges occurred between FCA executives and former United Auto Workers (UAW) leaders, ""is much broader and deeper than previously suspected or revealed as it involved FCA Group apparently using various accounts in foreign countries ... to control corrupt individuals by compensating and corrupting those centrally involved in the scheme to harm GM.""
Last month, Borman threw out the racketeering lawsuit, saying the No. 1 U.S. automaker's alleged injuries were not caused by FCA's alleged violations.
GM alleged that its rival bribed UAW officials over many years to corrupt the bargaining process and gain advantages, costing GM billions of dollars. GM was seeking ""substantial damages"" that one analyst said could have totaled at least $6 billion. FCA called the case meritless and asked Borman to dismiss it.
""These new facts warrant amending the court's prior judgment, so we are respectfully asking the court to reinstate the case,"" GM said in a statement. 
FCA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

In affidavits accompanying GM's filing, attorneys for the automaker said that ""reliable information concerning the existence of foreign bank accounts"" used in the alleged scheme had only come to light within the last 10 days.

Investing.com – Wall Street climbed Monday, as big tech continued to rack up gains following bullish earnings last week, while healthcare names rallied on positive coronavirus treatment news.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.04%, or 275 points. The S&P 500 gained 0.92%, while the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.64%.
Tech continued its melt-up, led by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), with the latter up more than 5% after confirming that it was in talks to buy social media company TikTok from ByteDance.
The potential acquisition has been cheered by analysts on Wall Street, who believe that the addition of TikTok could boost Microsoft's consumer offering.
""(Satya) Nadella has essentially had the golden touch since becoming CEO… although the missing piece in the puzzle has been a consumer trojan horse strategy which TikTok can fill along with a re-rating/sum-of-the-parts valuation,"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note.
Beyond tech, healthcare also supported investor sentiment on stocks thanks to signs of progress in the race for a coronavirus treatment.
Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) said it would get a phase 3 trial of its experimental coronavirus treatment, LY-CoV555, sending its shares more than 1% higher.
A lack of progress between U.S. lawmakers over the next coronavirus stimulus package, however, kept gains in the broader market in check.  
Unemployment assistance, set at $600 a week in March, has since lapsed, and renewing it has remained a key sticking for lawmakers.
On the earnings front, Clorox (NYSE:CLX) slipped about 3% despite delivering quarterly results that beat on the top and bottom lines.
In economic news, signs of a turnaround in manufacturing continued.
ISM manufacturing data  for July showed an uptick to 54.2, beating expectations of 53.6. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy.
""We remain confident that manufacturing will be more resilient to Covid-related developments than the service side of the economy, and activity should continue to expand in coming quarters as the recovery takes hold,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Still, the path ahead for the economy is one paved with uncertainty.  
""I think the slowdown in July would be consistent with the idea that we shouldn’t expect a completely smooth transition as you go forward because this is a crisis and there’s going to be ups and downs,"" St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said on Monday."

336,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 02:15PM ET</span>",Microsoft talks to buy TikTok's U.S. operations spark ire in China,"By Yingzhi Yang and Kane Wu
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - A potential shotgun wedding to  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) for TikTok's U.S. operations provoked an outcry on Monday on Chinese social media as well as criticism from a prominent Chinese investor in TikTok owner ByteDance.
The U.S. tech giant formally declared its interest on Sunday after President Donald Trump, who has cited national security risks posed by the Chinese-owned short video app, reversed course on a planned ban and gave the two firms 45 days to come to a deal.
The proposed acquisition of parts of TikTok, which boasts 100 million U.S. users, would offer Microsoft a rare opportunity to become a major competitor to social media giants such as  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP).
Shares in Microsoft, which owns the business social media network LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) and is also seeking to buy TikTok's Canadian, Australian and New Zealand interests, rose nearly 3% in early trades on Monday. 
ByteDance has not publicly confirmed the sale talks. But in an internal letter to staff on Monday seen by Reuters, the company's founder and CEO Zhang Yiming said the firm had started talks with a tech company it did not identify to clear the way ""for us to continue offering the TikTok app in the U.S.""
Clinching a deal that will satisfy all parties and potentially act as a lightning rod for U.S.-China relations will be a tall order.
People close to the situation have told Reuters that all of TikTok could be worth $50 billion, but the forced sale of the U.S. division and some other units alone will likely yield much less than that.
""A forced deal under Washington's shotgun could open up for endless litigations if it should result (in) an unfavorable outcome to existing private shareholders,"" said Fred Hu, chairman of Primavera Capital Group, an investor in ByteDance and one of China's best known private equity groups.
Hu said Microsoft was a credible buyer but questioned how selling large parts of TikTok's operations at such an early stage of its growth could ever be a good deal for ByteDance. 
""It absolutely makes no sense. Bytedance is an innocent victim of the mad politics and mad geopolitics. It is a sad outcome for Bytedance, for entrepreneurial capitalism, and for the future of global commerce,"" he said. 
Tech bankers in Asia said investment banks working on the deal would have to be careful not to antagonize Trump. 
""This is not a standard M&A situation...this is hard to predict,"" said one senior banker with a U.S bank in Hong Kong, saying that it would be a question of how to structure a deal in a way that would keep Washington happy.
Zhang's letter to staff also said ByteDance did not agree with the stance taken by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes deals for national security risks, that it must fully divest TikTok's U.S. operations. 
""We disagree with this CFIUS conclusion,"" the letter said but added: ""...we understand the decision in the current macro environment.""
ByteDance did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
The Chinese government declined to comment specifically on the Washington's move to force a sale of TikTok's U.S. operations.
The United States has been ""stretching the concept of national security"", presuming that companies are guilty without evidence, China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a briefing after being asked about U.S. actions against Chinese software companies.
The topic ""ByteDance has agreed to divest TikTok's U.S. operations"" was one of the most discussed subjects on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) platform on Monday, with over 920 million views. 
Some commentators criticized ByteDance, saying it has not shown as much backbone as Huawei Technologies, also in the crosshairs of U.S.-China tensions and now on a U.S. trade blacklist.
""(ByteDance) kneeled down so fast that it didn’t even wait for the Chinese government to retaliate,"" said one comment that was 'liked' over 5,000 times.

While TikTok is ByteDance's most well known app globally, the company makes the bulk of its revenue from advertising on Chinese apps including Douyin - a Chinese version of TikTok - and news aggregator app Jinri Toutiao.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Monday he was formally removing two members from the board of the Tennessee Valley Authority, and criticized its chief executive as overpaid.
In remarks during a White House event, Trump threatened to remove the agency's chief executive, Jeff Lyash, and called on the utility's board to do so. Trump has previously been critical of the agency and threatened firm disciplinary action against it.
The TVA had previously come under criticism by U.S. Tech workers, a nonprofit formed to fight the growth of H1-B1 visas to foreign workers. The group appealed to Trump, who has the authority to appoint the TVA board, to fire Lyash for laying off U.S. workers and replacing them with contractors hiring foreign workers, airing an ad on cable television. 
The Chattanooga Free Press reported in June that TVA had laid off 62 IT workers in Chattanooga and Knoxville as it moved to outsource more data and programming work.
Later on at the same event, Trump said he had been informed that Lyash had contacted the White House and indicated a strong willingness to reverse course. The TVA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trump has also sparred with the TVA in the past over its efforts to close coal-fired power plants. He has also previously proposed selling parts of the government-owned entity to the private sector. 
The U.S. Tech workers' group aired an ad on cable television that said Lyash received an $8.1 million compensation package, making him the ""highest-paid federal employee in America.""

Trump said the position was overpaid, and the CEO should not make more than $500,000 annually.

Varian shares rose 22% in early trading on Monday, while Healthineers' shares were down 6.7% at 41.00 euros each on concerns that Healthineers was paying a steep price.

Shares in parent company Siemens, however, rose 3.7% on Monday to 112.28 euros.
Healthineers said it plans to raise roughly 7.5 billion euros in equity to finance the deal, with the remainder coming from debt that parent Siemens will provide. 
To avoid raising the money through a rights issue, Healthineers plans to place up to 10% of shares on the market using its authorised capital later this year. The company will seek shareholder approval for a similar transaction next year, the sources said.
Siemens' stake in Healthineers will be diluted to about 72% from 85% following the share sale.
The debt part of the transaction will be provided by parent Siemens, given that it is expected to get better terms than newcomer Healthineers, spun out of Siemens in 2018.

By buying Varian, Healthineers is acquiring the leader in radiation therapy with a market share of over 50%. In case the deal falls through, Siemens will have to pay a $450 million break fee.

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. new vehicle sales in July continued to show signs of recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, as Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) on Monday posted its lowest sales decline since the COVID-19 outbreak slammed the sector in mid-March.
The Japanese automaker said that its sales in July fell 19% versus the same month in 2019, to 169,484 units. That was Toyota's best month since before the pandemic shuttered North American production for two months and led to closed showrooms across numerous U.S. states.
The rebound in U.S. auto sales since hitting a bottom in April has seen major automakers scramble to ramp up production and boost weak inventories at dealerships, especially in states where they remained open throughout the shutdowns. 
The rebound in sales, though, could be threatened by spiking cases in southern and southwestern U.S. states, which have increased uncertainty over the U.S. economic recovery. 
 Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) reported a modest year-on-year 0.6% gain in U.S. sales for July, selling 57,677 units. 
""Achieving an overall sales increase despite the ongoing pandemic is a tremendous accomplishment and speaks to the depth and quality of our product lineup and resiliency of our dealers,"" Hyundai's North American sales chief, Randy Parker, said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission will take public comment for 45 days on a petition filed by the Trump administration seeking new transparency rules in how social media companies moderate content, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said on Monday.
Pai rejected calls from Democrats that he summarily dismiss the petition without public comment. The decision came after President Donald Trump directed the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to file the petition after  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) in May warned readers to fact-check his posts about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting.
Pai has said previously he does not see a role for the FCC to regulate websites like Twitter,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) or Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, but said on Monday the FCC ""should welcome vigorous debate - not foreclose it. The American people deserve to have a say, and we will give them that chance.""
FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter that Congress, not the FCC, should act. ""Perhaps when comments are in we can package up the whole docket and send it over to Congress-where this debate belongs,"" Starks wrote.
The July 27 NTIA petition asks the FCC to limit protections for social media companies under Section 230, a provision of the 1996 Communications Decency Act that shields social media companies from liability for content posted by their users and allows them to remove lawful but objectionable posts.
The NTIA wants the FCC to require social media companies to ""publicly disclose accurate information regarding its content-management mechanisms"" to ""enable users to make more informed choices about competitive alternatives.""
Trump, a Republican who is running for re-election on Nov. 3, has repeatedly expressed anger at social media companies.

The FCC could take a year or longer to finalize any rules.

354,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 10:36AM ET</span>","Extension of Jobless Benefits to Buoy Growth, Fed’s Kaplan Says","(Bloomberg) -- A continuation of some form of extra unemployment benefits would bolster economic growth, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan said.
The extra $600 per week of jobless aid passed by Congress in March amid the start of the coronavirus pandemic ran out at the end of July. Lawmakers debating the next round of stimulus are at a stalemate over whether, and in what form, to extend the benefits.
“I think you’re still going to need to see an extension of unemployment. It may be restructured to some extent from the $600 but I think it’s important that we see an extension of it,” Kaplan said in an interview with Michael McKee on Bloomberg Television Monday. “The increased incomes, while it may have made it harder for certain individual businesses to hire, it’s helped create jobs because it’s helped bolster consumer spending, so the net effect still has probably been positive for the economy and for employment.”
If unemployment insurance isn’t boosted further, it could weaken growth, Kaplan said. He sees the economy contracting 4.5% to 5% this year, but rebounding strongly in the third and fourth quarters. U.S. gross domestic product shrank 32.9% on an annualized basis in the second quarter, a report showed last week.
Kaplan said he doesn’t think the U.S. needs another nationwide lockdown to tame the recent virus resurgence, as one of his colleagues called for on Sunday.
Live with Virus
“We’re going to have to learn to live with this virus,” Kaplan said, adding that mask wearing, along with a good contact tracing and testing regime, is essential.
Although low take-up in some of the Fed’s emergency lending programs, such as the corporate credit and the municipal facilities, isn’t a barometer of their success, the programs directly aimed at businesses should be utilized, Kaplan said.
“The Main Street Program, and if there’s another round of the PPP, those programs are critical to helping those small- to mid-sized companies get credit, so I do think usage is important to look at there,” Kaplan said.
The Fed has revised its Main Street Lending Program several times, decreasing the minimum loan size to make it accessible to more businesses, and most recently proposing an expansion to nonprofit entities. Despite these tweaks, the program has only bought $82 million of loans so far.
Forward-Guidance Stance
Kaplan said he doesn’t favor changing forward guidance to specifically tie future rate increases to inflation running above 2%, something some economists have argued the Fed may be able to do without seeing inordinate price increases.
Kaplan said he prefers to keep tying forward guidance to both inflation and unemployment, as the Fed currently does. But he added that the central bank has learned that it can let the economy run a bit hotter than previously thought without sparking unwanted price pressures, and that by doing so, it pulls marginalized workers back into the labor force.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency surged to $12,112 in trading just after midnight New York time Sunday, its first foray above $12,000 since August 2019, according to pricing compiled by Bloomberg. But it plunged shortly thereafter -- 30 minutes after the high, it had dropped to $10,638. It was up 1.2% to $11,224 as of 8:41 a.m. Monday.
“There are two factors that make this market particularly volatile. One is the low level of liquidity, which is one of Bitcoin’s hallmark traits due to digital scarcity. The second is an increasing amount of crypto exchanges who offer extreme leverage,” said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) Economics. “When traders get a bit over excited, they tend to pile on the margin, giving way to extra large liquidations and frequent shakeouts.”
Bitcoin has rallied strongly in recent days after rising above $10,000. It had fallen as low as $4,904 in mid-March around the height of coronavirus-fueled market uncertainty, but by mid-May was back around $9,000.
“Clearing resistance at $10,000-$10,500, which coincided with the downtrend line from the late 2017 highs and first-quarter 2020 highs, established a higher high for Bitcoin confirming a new tactical uptrend,” according to Rob Sluymer, technical strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors LLC.
“In the short-term Bitcoin’s daily momentum indicators are overbought (as they are for gold), but beyond some very near-term choppy trading, Bitcoin is likely to continue to trend to its next resistance level at $13,800.”
While cryptocurrencies’ volatility continues to attract skeptics, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. in June noted that Bitcoin’s rally back from the March depths suggests it has staying power.
The cryptocurrency’s notable moves both last weekend and this one recall a similar phenomenon in 2019, when outsized gains took place numerous times during Saturday and Sunday trading as the price rose from a few thousand dollars into five-digit range.
Other cryptocurrencies rallied as well. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index gained about 8% to 542. Ether rose 4.4% to $389, capping a torrid rally that has seen it advance in 13 of the last 14 sessions in data compiled by Bloomberg.

MILAN (Reuters) - Luxury carmaker  Ferrari  (MI:RACE) trimmed its full-year earnings forecast on Monday after second-quarter income plunged due to supply chain and production disruptions during the coronavirus pandemic.
However the guidance review from the company known for its ""prancing horse"" symbol proved marginal and results left analysts upbeat on its performance, which also confirmed it expected to generate positive free cash flow this year.
Analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said given the circumstances second-quarter results were strong from the company, maker of high performance models such as the F8 Spider, the 1,000 horse power SF 90 Stradale hybrid and top-selling Portofino grand tourer.
""The full year 2020 guidance, while lowered marginally at the midpoint and below consensus, is extremely high quality and sets up 2021 for a significant year on year (improvement),"" they said.
Milan-listed shares in Ferrari rose as much as 3.3% after briefly falling after the results. They were up 2.9% at 1250 GMT.
The company said sales had been hit by production suspensions and significantly lower sponsorship and commercial and brand revenues due to the pandemic.
That resulted in a 60% drop in adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to 124 million euros ($145 million) in the second quarter, in line with a Reuters an average forecast of 120 million euros from analysts polled by Reuters.
The company said it now expected full-year adjusted EBITDA of between 1.075 billion euros and 1.125 billion, versus the already-cut guidance it provided in May for adjusted EBITDA of between 1.05 billion and 1.20 billion.
""This guidance reflects an updated assessment of the projected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's supply chain and the resulting delay in the full production ramp-up of the SF90 Stradale,"" Ferrari said in a statement, referring to its hybrid electric model. 
Ferrari said it was also hit by the temporary suspension of the Formula 1 season which resulted in a reduced number of races as well as reduced in-store traffic and museum visitors.

The carmaker now expects revenue to top 3.4 billion euros this year, versus previous guidance of between 3.4 billion and 3.6 billion.

Morgan's credit trading desk already handling more than three-quarters of the volume of trades this year executed in the whole of 2019, a client report showed.
Last year's volumes had already more than doubled from 2018 levels, according to the report, seen by Reuters.
Portfolio trading, which involves bundling several bonds into a single package to trade, was once a time-consuming process that is gaining traction thanks to tech innovation.
It also proved popular among traders during the recent coronavirus-linked market mayhem, anecdotal evidence suggests.
""Halfway through 2020, the desk has already printed 77% of last year's volume,"" the note seen by Reuters said.
""Couple these figures with the fact that three of the past five months have yielded a rise in monthly inquiry and traded volumes, it becomes clear to JP Morgan that portfolio trading is gathering momentum.""
The turmoil unleashed by the coronavirus pandemic has forced liquidity to dry up even in the deepest parts of the global bond markets, with a surge in corporate debt issuance making the task of trading bonds extremely difficult.
Portfolio trading is a relatively new entrant in the bond market, with the strategy taking root in the United States and spreading to Europe last year as trading platforms move to electronic execution of the trading and settlement process.
The interest in portfolio trades comes as a surge in corporate bond issuance adds pressure on traders and banks such as JP Morgan - a top dealer in European bond markets, according to a Greenwich survey - to find faster and more cost efficient ways to trade.

(Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly & Co (N:LLY) is beginning a late-stage trial to study whether one of its experimental COVID-19 antibody treatments can prevent the spread of the virus in residents and staff at U.S. nursing homes, it said on Monday.
The phase 3 trial will test LY-CoV555, a treatment developed in partnership with Canadian biotech company AbCellera, is expected to enroll up to 2,400 participants who live or work at a facility that has had a recently diagnosed case of COVID-19.
""COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on nursing home residents,"" Eli Lilly's chief scientific officer, Daniel Skovronsky, said in a statement. ""We’re working as fast as we can to create medicines that might stop the spread of the virus to these vulnerable individuals."" 
Shares in the company rose 2.5% in premarket trading.
The drug is already being tested in hospitals to study whether it can work as a treatment in patients who have the disease. This trial will test whether it works prophylactically.
The phase 3 nursing homes trial is being conducted in partnership with several long-term care networks across the country as well as the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).
To speed the study, Eli Lilly has created mobile research units including retrofitted recreational vehicles that can be deployed in response to coronavirus outbreaks at nursing homes across the U.S. 
LY-CoV555 belongs to a class of treatments known as monoclonal antibodies, which are among the most widely used biotechnology medicines. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:REGN) and other drugmakers are testing similar treatments against COVID-19.

Last week Lilly told investors that LY-CoV555 had moved into mid-stage trials as a treatment and that late-stage trials would begin in the coming weeks. It expects efficacy data from the mid-stage trial in the fourth quarter.

Dollar bears also took some profits on crowded short positions, but further gains were likely to be capped by the slowing U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19 and real rates breaking below -1% for the first time.
The real rate hit a record low amid a marked flattening of the yield curve as investors wager on more accommodation from the Federal Reserve.
""Amid improvements in business sentiment, signals are emerging that the initial boost from pent-up demand is fading and consumer confidence is slipping lower,"" economists at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) wrote in a note.
""Together with concerns about labour market and virus developments, this clouds the outlook and could be exacerbated if U.S. fiscal support is not renewed in time.""
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields  were higher at 0.54% after touching the lowest level since March last week. German government bond yields rose slightly to -0.527%.
Factory activity data from China showed the fastest pace of expansion in nearly a decade. That helped China's blue chips (CSI300) rally 1.6%, offsetting worries about U.S.-China relations.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) meanwhile added 2.2%, courtesy of a pullback in the yen. The dollar steadied on the yen at 105.95  after hitting a 4-1/2-month low last week at 104.17.
The recent decline in the dollar combined with super-low real bond yields has been a boon for gold, which hit $1,984 an ounce  early on Monday and seemed on track to take out $2,000 soon.
Oil prices eased on concerns about oversupply as OPEC and its allies are due to pull back from production cuts in August while an increase in COVID-19 cases raised fears of slower pick-up in fuel demand.

362,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 08:18AM ET</span>",Big Tech Faithful Shouldn’t Ignore Antitrust Risk,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Monopoly power is a good gig if you can get it. The trouble is keeping lawmakers from knocking on your door. 
Tech titans Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. managed to do just that until last week, when a House subcommittee summoned the chief executive officers of the four companies. Lawmakers took a dim view of the tech giants’ grip on their respective industries. “These companies as they exist today have monopoly power,” said Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, who leads the House investigation into the companies. His prescription: “Some need to be broken up, all need to be heavily regulated.” The sentiment appeared to be shared widely.
As a matter of public policy, the issue is relatively straightforward. Monopolies are trouble, which is why antitrust laws are designed to stop them. They have the power to raise prices and thereby stifle demand. They often turn into big, lazy, unwieldy bureaucracies that have little incentive to innovate or look after customers, workers and suppliers. And perhaps most problematic, they can use their money and influence to seize political power, making it more difficult to dislodge them.   
There’s little disagreement that Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google pose such a threat. Apple controls nearly half the U.S. smartphone market and dominates the distribution of apps; Amazon all but controls e-commerce; Facebook rules social media; and Google  has a firm grip on internet search and online advertising. It’s difficult to overstate their power. The four companies make up just 0.8% of the S&P 500 Index by number, and yet they account for 6.1% of its total revenue, 8.9% of its earnings and 16.8% of its market value. 
For investors, the issue is a bit more complicated. Monopolies are impregnable money-minting machines, so everyone wants a piece of them. It’s no accident that Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook  are four of the seven biggest companies in the world by market value. Nor is it surprising that their profits have trickled down to shareholders. An equal investment in the four tech giants since Facebook — the youngest of the bunch — went public in 2012 has produced a return of 31% a year, including dividends, more than double the return from the S&P 500 over the same period.  
It turns out they’re not alone. Stocks of highly profitable companies tend to beat the market. Shares of the most profitable 30% of U.S. companies, sorted on return on equity and weighted by market value, outpaced the S&P 500 by 1.6 percentage points a year from July 1963 through June, according to the longest data series compiled by Dartmouth professor Ken French. And they did so with roughly the same amount of volatility as the broad market, as measured by standard deviation, a common proxy for risk.
Astonishingly, the odds of capturing this profitability premium favored investors regardless of the holding period. Shares of the most profitable companies outpaced the market 65% of the time over rolling one-year periods, 76% of the time over three years, 83% over five years and a whopping 93% over 10 years, counted monthly.
But markets aren’t supposed to work this way. You shouldn’t be able to reliably beat the market using widely available information without taking more risk. One explanation for the profitability premium is that investors are rubes: They don’t pay attention to profitability when picking stocks, or worse, they errantly favor less-profitable companies, allowing more cunning investors to exploit their mistakes. That seems unlikely. Profitability has long been a key feature of security analysis. More recently, there has been a proliferation of indexes, and funds tracking them, that pick or weight stocks based in part on profitability. And as the market value of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook show, their shares are hugely popular.  
A more plausible explanation is that the profitability premium is compensation for the risk that today’s profits will evaporate tomorrow. Highly profitable companies rarely maintain the same level of profitability. More often, competition squeezes it away or, as in the case of Apple and its cohorts, the competition is crushed or acquired, resulting in greater market share and profitability but also inviting lawmakers and regulators to step in.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Inc.’s antitrust entanglement with the government in the late 1990s is instructive. Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded the company in 1975, and by the early 1990s, most personal computers ran Microsoft’s operating system, first MS-DOS and then Microsoft Windows. In August 1997, the company became the second largest in the U.S. by market value, behind only  General Electric  (NYSE:GE). 
A year later, in May 1998, the U.S. Department of Justice and 20 U.S. states sued Microsoft, accusing it of attempting to illegally protect and extend its monopoly by undermining competitors. By the time the case was argued in early 2001, much of the evidence against Microsoft had spilled into public view. Although profits continued to grow, the legal and regulatory scrutiny around the company clouded its future, and shareholders paid the price. The stock returned a negative 4% from May 1998 to December 2000, even as the Nasdaq Composite Index and the S&P 500 returned 33% and 23%, respectively, over the same time. Several months later, a federal court found that Microsoft had violated federal antitrust laws.  
As it turned out, of course, Microsoft has maintained its status as a tech powerhouse. Today, its market value is second only to Apple among U.S. stocks, and shareholders who stuck with the company through its antitrust battles have been richly rewarded. Microsoft has returned 27% a year since it went public in 1986, compared with 11% and 10% a year for the Nasdaq and S&P 500, respectively. But that was far from a foregone conclusion when Microsoft was in the government’s crosshairs. And if lawmakers, regulators or prosecutors muster the will to go after Apple, Amazon, Facebook or Alphabet, their shareholders should prepare for more paltry returns and perhaps worse. 
For now, investors don’t seem worried that the tech titans are in danger. All four of their stocks were higher after the hearing than before. And all four companies reported financial results that beat analysts’ expectations a day after the hearing, no doubt emboldening their shareholders. 
Still, Big Tech’s faithful should bear in mind that monopolies are only as durable as a government that tolerates them. The profitability they enjoy, and the skyrocketing stock prices that accompany it, are no free lunch. They’re payment for the risk that lawmakers are more serious about breaking up or regulating the tech titans than investors seem to believe.

364,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 07:35AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Chipotle, fast food brands set for new wave of hiring","By Hilary Russ
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG) wants to hire another 10,000 employees in coming months as its sales rebound, an official said, one of several big restaurant chains looking to add staff in an economy otherwise dimmed by the coronavirus pandemic.
The fast-casual brand, known for its Mexican-inspired bowls and burritos, has already added about 8,000 of the 10,000 employees it targeted when it launched its last major hiring spree in May.
""As we go back into this next hiring season, we'd love to hire another 10,000 because of the growth that's occurring in the company,"" Chief Diversity, Inclusion and People Officer Marissa Andrada told Reuters on Thursday. Chipotle, which employs more than 85,000 people globally, has not announced the hiring expansion.
The company, whose shares are up more than 30% from the start of the year, will also launch a revamped career website by Wednesday, which it planned before the pandemic hit, she said.
Chipotle is not alone. As the economy shows signs of stalling and jobless rolls are growing, McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD),  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Taco Bell parent Yum Brands Inc are seeing sales recover, and that could leave them needing to hire more cooks and cashiers.
Dunkin Brands Group Inc wants to hire 25,000 new restaurant employees, from front counter staff to managers - even as it plans to close underperforming units, the company said on an earnings call on Thursday.
The moves would follow the expiration of enhanced U.S. unemployment benefits on Friday in the absence of action by Congress.
A March federal aid plan laid out the extra $600-per-week in payments as millions of Americans lost their jobs because of the crisis.
Since then, the country has begun to reopen, but economic progress may have stalled as the outbreak spreads in new areas and many companies slow rehiring. Jobless rolls grew by 867,000, to 17,018,000, during the week ended July 18, the first increase since late May.
Roughly half the of the 12.3 million restaurant and bar workers employed in February lost their jobs in March and April, making the industry among the hardest hit by the pandemic. 
Average weekly earnings for restaurant and bar workers was around $400 in May versus about $1,000 for all private sector U.S. workers.
Flynn Restaurant Group, which owns more than 1,250 Applebee's, Taco Bell, Panera and Arby's restaurants, struggled to recruit new employees during the pandemic.
But by mid-July, applicants for manager-level positions surged back, a change that founder Greg Flynn attributed in part to the looming end of enhanced unemployment benefits.
""You are never not looking for people"" to hire in fast food, said Barry Friends, a partner at food industry consultant Pentallect. ""In the short term, the labor pool is going to be better.""
Papa Johns said last week that it wanted to add another 10,000 workers – after already bringing on 20,000 earlier in the crisis as demand for pizza soared. 
Papa Johns needs delivery drivers in particular, said Chief People and Diversity Officer Marvin Boakye in an interview. The company and its franchisees are also hiring truck drivers, as well as workers at restaurants and at quality control centers where the brand's pizza dough is produced.

The pizza chain has even improved retention versus 2019, though Boakye would not disclose numbers. He said that was because of increased health and safety measures, free online doctors visits during the pandemic and expanded subsidized online college courses – especially as students are not sure whether they will be able to return to campuses in the fall.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The survival of J.C. Penney Co Inc hangs on whether the department store chain can reach a complex deal within days to sell itself to an alliance of retail mavens and distressed-debt investors. 
The 118-year-old retailer blew through a Friday deadline from lenders to sort through bids that would take the company out of bankruptcy proceedings that were commenced in May after the pandemic forced it to temporarily close all its 846 stores.
The Plano, Texas-based company, already facing concerns from U.S. Bankruptcy Judge David Jones that its restructuring is not moving fast enough, is racing to reach agreement on a sale that would carve the retailer into three pieces.
The company is hoping to file court papers as soon as this week disclosing details of a deal, though the timing could slip, said a person familiar with the matter. The retailer declined to comment.
J.C. Penney has lost money for years, grappling with consumers shifting to online shopping and competition from discount retailers. It is among a cascade of retailers undone by the pandemic, including Brooks Brothers and Lucky Brand Dungarees, now attempting to withstand unprecedented economic turmoil and stay in business through bankruptcy sales.
Some J.C. Penney vendors are demanding cash-on-delivery before shipping merchandise, the person familiar with the matter said, an onerous term for a retailer with strained finances accustomed to paying for goods later.
“For this to work, we are going to need to move with complete and deliberate speed,” Joshua Sussberg, a Kirkland & Ellis LLP lawyer representing J.C. Penney, said during a Wednesday court hearing.
He said progress on negotiating a sale rendered Friday’s deadline a “red herring.” A liquidation, which would close J.C. Penney’s doors for good and lay off all its more than 80,000 employees, is “not in the cards,” Sussberg said.
The company is sitting on $1 billion of cash, $400 million more than expected, after reopening stores, he said. Still, challenges loom with current coronavirus outbreaks and potentially more this fall, he added.
On July 22, J.C. Penney received three separate bids for its operating business from private-equity firm Sycamore Partners, Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson’s Bay Co and a duo of mall owners comprising Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE:SPG) and Brookfield Asset Management Inc, people familiar with the matter said.
Sycamore’s $1.75 billion bid was the highest, though J.C. Penney expects revised offers from suitors soon, one of the people said. Some bidders could team up or offers could change in other ways, the person said. The bidders declined to comment or did not respond to requests.
On July 20, hedge funds and private-equity firms financing J.C. Penney’s bankruptcy proposed forgiving debt owed to them in exchange for owning the retailer, Sussberg said in court. These lenders are led by H/2 Capital Partners and other distressed-debt investors that also hold portions of J.C. Penney’s $5 billion of total debt.
J.C. Penney is negotiating with the other bidders to “slot into” that deal by purchasing the retailer’s operating business while the lenders take over two property companies that would hold stores and distribution centers, respectively, he said.
A deal hinges on whether the lenders accept one of those offers, people familiar with the matter said. They otherwise face the choice of owning J.C. Penney’s operations themselves or attempting to recover money in a liquidation, the people said. A lawyer for the lenders did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
During less fraught times, other retailers such as Barneys New York Inc and Toys 'R' Us Inc have failed to reorganize under bankruptcy protection and liquidated.

Sussberg said during Wednesday’s hearing that the company has “not had one discussion” with lenders about a liquidation.

366,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 07:18AM ET</span>",Some German Banks to Be Allowed to Pay Dividends Despite ECB Ban,"(Bloomberg) -- Germany’s top financial watchdog is set to allow some smaller German banks to pay dividends this year, even after the European Central Bank urged lenders to refrain from payouts amid the Covid-19 crisis.
Bafin is likely to approve investor payouts by some smaller banks that don’t fall under direct ECB supervision if they can demonstrate a healthy level of profitability and sufficient capital cushions, a person familiar with the matter said. The German regulator continues to take an unfavorable view of dividend payments, but sees them as a manageable issue at small profitable banks, the person said.
The ECB in late July extended a de facto ban on banks returning capital to shareholders and urged them to show restraint on bonuses in light of the coronavirus outbreak, dealing a blow to lenders who had lobbied for a return to business as usual. The order applies at least until January and the ECB said it will review its stance again in the fourth quarter.​ National regulators “are expected to apply” the ban to banks in their jurisdiction “as deemed appropriate,” the ECB said when it outlined its decision.
The ECB initially told lenders to conserve capital during the height of the pandemic panic in March, indicating it was a trade-off for unprecedented regulatory relief intended to help them to weather the crisis. Several European banks, including the association for Germany’s cooperative banks, have called on the ECB to exclude well-capitalized and profitable lenders from the ban.
“As before, Bafin supports very restrictive dividend payments, even beyond October,” a spokeswoman for the regulator said by email. “Dividends should only be paid if a bank forecasts a sustainable trajectory of positive revenue and its capital situation would have sufficient buffer even in a prolonged period of stress.”
An ECB spokesman declined to comment.
The dividend restriction has been one reason behind the poor share price performance this year across the European financial industry. The ECB has acknowledged that its policy affects valuations and the head of its banking supervision arm, Andrea Enria, has said he’s “keen” to lift the ban.
The ECB directly supervises 21 banks in Germany, out of a total of 1,717 in the country, as it generally oversees lenders whose assets exceed 30 billion euros ($35 billion). National supervisors oversee smaller institutions though they do so “in close cooperation with the ECB,” according to the central bank’s website.

Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed to a moderately higher open on Wall Street on Monday, despite a lack of clarity over progress on a new pandemic relief package after a busy week of earnings.
At 7:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 15 points, or 0.5% higher and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 94 points, or 0.9%. The Dow futures contract added 87 points, or 0.3%.
On Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats are still trying to iron out differences over a coronavirus relief bill and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Sunday he was not optimistic about a deal in the very near term.
On Friday, Fitch Ratings cut the outlook on the United States' triple-A rating to negative from stable, citing eroding credit strength and a ballooning deficit.
It said the direction of U.S. fiscal policy depends in part on the November presidential election and the resulting makeup of Congress, cautioning that policy gridlock could continue.
But the U.S. technology sector is powering ahead after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) all posted far-better-than-expected earnings results last week. Apple, which easily surpassed iPhone sales in the second quarter saw its shares climb 10% on Friday.
A surge in Big Tech stocks, which make up nearly a fifth of the S&P 500's value saw the index post its fourth straight monthly gain in July.
This week will bring another packed slate of earnings, with 130 members of the S&P 500 set to report. Some of the names reporting Monday include  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) and Clorox (NYSE:CLX) before the opening bell, and Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) after the close.
Investors are looking ahead to the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index, due at 10 AM ET (14:00 GMT) for July, which is expected to show a small rebound.
Market watchers are also eagerly awaiting Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report for July, which will give more insight on the strength of the recovery in the labor market.
Concerns over the strength of the economy hit oil prices, with U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% lower at $40.02 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent fell 0.5% to $43.30.
Elsewhere, gold futures were hovering near record highs at $1,976.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1732, down 0.3%.

368,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",Rival drugmakers launch joint trial of medicines for COVID-19,"By Deena Beasley
(Reuters) - Rival drugmakers  AbbVie Inc  (N:ABBV),  Amgen Inc  (O:AMGN) and Takeda Pharmaceuticals Inc (T:4502) on Monday said they have begun treating patients in a trial to quickly show whether a drug from each company can be repurposed and used against COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The COVID-19 pandemic is an ""all hands on deck moment,"" David Reese, Amgen's research and development chief told Reuters. ""We wanted a trial to be able to quickly sift through multiple agents and prioritize.""
The study is a collaboration among pharmaceutical industry members of the recently-formed COVID Research & Development Alliance, Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) Leap Healthcare Collaborative, a partnership of medical researchers and investors, and the Food and Drug Administration.
The first segment will test whether Amgen's psoriasis drug Otezla, Takeda's anti-inflammatory Firazyr and AbbVie's cenicriviroc, which has been tried in patients with HIV, will help with the overactive, and potentially damaging, immune response that sometimes happens in patients with severe COVID-19.
The study's ""adaptive platform"" means several treatment candidates can be tested at the same time, with the most promising moving forward and the least promising dropping out, Quantum Leap co-founder Dr. Laura Esserman told Reuters.
""We could have some results in as early as six weeks,"" she said, adding that additional drugs will soon be added to the roster.
Company officials said Otezla may be able to suppress inflammation from an overactive immune response; Firazyr may help limit fluid in the lungs; and cenicriviroc, which blocks activity of certain immune system cells, could reduce the severity of acute respiratory distress caused by the virus.
The drugs are being dosed in combination with  Gilead Sciences Inc 's (O:GILD) antiviral drug remdesivir and generic steroid dexamethasone, both of which have been shown in rigorous trials to help COVID-19 patients and are now considered to be standard care, Dr. Esserman said. A comparison group of patients will be given remdesivir and dexamethasone alone.
Hospitals have tried other anti-inflammatory drugs in COVID-19 patients, including Regeneron's (O:REGN) Kevzara and Roche Holding's (S:ROG) Actemra, but trials of both arthritis drugs failed to show effectiveness. Roche is continuing to test Actemra in combination with remdesivir.
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' ongoing adaptive COVID-19 trial is studying remdesivir in combination with Olumiant, an arthritis drug sold by Eli Lilly & Co (N:LLY). Those results are expected next month.
Since the outbreak began seven months ago, so far killing more than 675,000 people worldwide, hundreds of clinical trials have been launched around the world to test whether existing drugs or experimental compounds could be effective treatments.

""There are a huge number of trials that for all the best intentions have been stood up around the world, but many are smaller - what we would call underpowered - and will not provide definitive answers,"" Amgen's Reese said.

371,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>","Disney to reveal pandemic hit to parks and ESPN, boost to streaming services, on Tuesday","By Helen Coster and Lisa Richwine
(Reuters) - For Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS), the ability to sell ""Frozen""-themed water bottles at the Magic Kingdom theme park while selling ads during the NBA playoffs has historically been its greatest strength.
But since the coronavirus pandemic forced theme parks and cinemas to shutter and live sporting events to be canceled, that exposure has made Disney one of the most vulnerable of its peers.
When Disney announces its third-quarter results on Tuesday, investors will gauge how significantly the pandemic has hurt the company’s theme parks, TV networks and studios, while boosting streaming services like Disney+.
PARKS, EXPERIENCES AND PRODUCTS
Disney's theme parks are expected to take the biggest hit from the pandemic. The unit is forecast to report a $2 billion quarterly loss, compared with a $1.7 billion profit a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data. 
Walt Disney World in Florida reopened in July to limited attendance. But with record-breaking coronavirus infection rates in Florida, can Disney avoid the fate of its Hong Kong park, which reopened only to be closed again as cases spiked? 
MEDIA NETWORKS
Analysts are expecting the division to be dragged down by sharp declines at ESPN. They are forecasting a $1.97 billion quarterly profit, compared with a $2.1 billion profit during the same period last year. 
ABC missed out on the NBA Finals during the quarter; the league restarted its season on July 30. Major League Baseball’s restart on July 23 - which set TV ratings records on ESPN - has been clouded by a COVID-19 outbreak among Miami Marlins players, causing the league to postpone games. A financial rebound from the return of live sports is uncertain. 
STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT
Theaters are starting to reopen, but Disney has postponed the theatrical release of ""Mulan"" and other potential blockbusters. A few smaller movies that had been scheduled to debut in theaters were moved to Disney+. 
Analysts expect the studio to post operating income of $356 million, a 55% decline from a year earlier. How and when will Disney fully resume movie production, and what are its plans for films that are already completed? 
DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER AND INTERNATIONAL
Disney+ is expected to be a bright spot in the third quarter, as viewers remained at home. As Disney invests in building the service, analysts expect a $1.1 billion loss in the division, about double the loss from the same period last year. 

Beyonce’s film “Black is King” debuted on Disney+ on Friday. The company used Disney+ as the platform for its filmed version of “Hamilton,” accelerating its Oct. 15, 2021, theatrical release to July 3 on the streaming service. Will Disney continue to divert hot properties onto Disney+ to maintain its growth streak as the pandemic drags on?

372,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 06:09AM ET</span>","Fed Is Headed for a Clash With Hedge Funds, Other Shadow Banks","(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve and other central banks are heading for a collision with shadow lenders -- the firms with a sinister nickname that are increasingly dominating global finance.
Even as policy makers struggle to reopen their economies in the midst of the coronavirous pandemic, they’ve launched a review of what went wrong with markets in March, when a worldwide dash for cash by investors nearly crashed the financial system and forced unprecedented rescue actions by central banks. Their focus is on loosely regulated money market and hedge funds, mortgage originators and other entities. Already, some watchdogs have pointed to highly leveraged trades involving U.S. Treasuries as one source of the turmoil.“In many cases they have reached systemic importance,” Bank for International Settlements General Manager Agustin Carstens said of the non-banks. He added that it’s time to move toward more regulation.There’s a lot at stake should the scrutiny lead to tougher oversight. The alternative financiers are major providers of credit to households and companies, making their smooth functioning critical to the health of financial markets and the economy.
Non-banks are marshaling their lobbyists in Washington to argue that casting blame on the industry is misplaced. A point in their favor is that unlike Wall Street banks a decade ago, shadow lenders didn’t cause the recent meltdown. Instead, the financial-market stress was triggered by a health crisis.
No Smoking Gun
“Often you need an obvious smoking gun to make significant reforms, and it’s not at that threshold for the non-banks,” said Capital Alpha Partners analyst Ian Katz.
Read More: Shadow Banking Is Booming Outside Regulators’ GripMuch will depend on the results of the November U.S. election. A clean sweep by Democrats would increase the chances of far-reaching reforms, including the passage of legislation in the mode of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which imposed new guardrails on banks but largely left shadow lenders unscathed.“We need a new Dodd-Frank,” said former Fed Chair Janet Yellen, who cited leveraged hedge funds, high yield and other investment vehicles that buy less liquid assets, and money market funds as areas of concern.
The Brookings Institution fellow called for strengthening the Financial Stability Oversight Council -- an umbrella group of U.S. regulators led by the Treasury Secretary -- so that it can ride herd on the non-banks. Private equity firms also could be in the crosshairs if the Democrats win big in November. Led by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, progressives argue that such firms damage workers and the economy.
‘Key Driver’
Global regulators contend that it’s shadow banks where the stresses showed up in March, with hedge funds dumping U.S. Treasury securities and bank loan funds and some money market funds hemorrhaging deposits. That led to wild swings in asset prices, forcing central banks to pump liquidity into markets.
In its annual economic report, the Bank for International Settlements said a rapid unwinding of so-called basis trades by hedge funds was “a key driver” of the turmoil -- something the funds dispute. The transactions involved buying Treasury securities using leverage via repurchase pacts while simultaneously selling futures contracts.
The tumult highlighted the vulnerabilities of non-banks, Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles wrote in a July 14 letter to central bank chiefs and finance ministers of leading nations. As head of the Financial Stability Board, he’s promised to deliver a report on the mayhem to leaders of the Group of 20 nations by November.
Read More: Shadow Bank Weaknesses Forced Fed’s Market Rescue, Quarles Says
Quarles’ aim is ambitious. He wants to develop an overall framework for regulation of non-traditional lenders, rather than focusing on piecemeal reforms. And he recognizes that template can’t simply be a replica of that already applied to banks.
Sufficient Liquidity
Whereas the thrust of the reform effort coming out of the 2008 financial crisis was on building bank capital, the emphasis this time may be on liquidity, to ensure that shadow banks have sufficient cash to ride out market squalls, rather than intensify them.
Whether the scrutiny of non-banks leads to new U.S. legislation -- as Yellen advises -- remains an open question. Regulators typically need lawmakers’ backing to stretch their oversight into new areas, but bills have been exceedingly difficult to get through a gridlocked Congress.
Michael Pedroni, an executive vice president at the Managed Funds Association, which represents hedge funds, said that the unwinding of basis trades was “dwarfed” by foreign central bank selling of Treasuries. He added that evidence indicates hedge funds continued providing liquidity, even as banks pulled back.
A July 16 study by analysts at the Treasury’s Office of Financial Research cast doubt on the argument that Treasury market illiquidity was amplified by the closing of basis trades, though it also said the high leverage involved in such deals remained “a cause for concern.”
‘Not Helpful’
The shakeout has also thrown a spotlight on prime money market funds, especially those catering to institutional investors, which suffered big outflows in March. In the wake of turmoil, Fidelity Investments announced plans to drop its two prime institutional money funds.In a May 27 presentation to a Securities and Exchange Commission’s advisory committee, Investment Company Institute Chief Economist Sean Collins emphasized that many market participants were hit hard by coronavirus.“The focus on a narrow aspect of the financial markets is not really helpful,” Collins, whose group represents mutual fund companies, said in an interview.

The retailer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, according to a court filing. 
Apparel retailers have been among the worst hit from the coronavirus crisis as their businesses were considered non-essential and their stores had to be closed. They were forced to limit operations to online, which led to furloughing of staff and unpaid leases and rents.
Tailored Brands said in a statement that it has entered into a restructuring agreement with more than 75% of its senior lenders, and that could reduce the company's debt by at least $630 million. 
The company said it has received commitments for $500 million in debtor-in-possession financing from its existing lenders.
In the court filing, the company listed both its assets and liabilities in the range of $1 billion to $10 billion.
The Houston, Texas-based retailer, which was already struggling with competition from fast-fashion brands and a shift to online shopping before the pandemic, said it will continue to build on its previously announced plans to reduce its corporate workforce by 20% and shut as many as 500 stores. 
The company added that Men's Wearhouse, Jos. A. Bank, Moores Clothing for Men and K&G Fashion Superstore will continue to serve its customers.
Last week, the retailer raised doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern within a year due to reduction in liquidity and failure to make an interest payment.

Lord & Taylor, a storied department store chain founded in 1826, billed as the oldest in the United States, also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday.

374,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 05:21AM ET</span>",Microsoft nears big bet on TikTok after risky LinkedIn deal shows promise,"By Paresh Dave
OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s potential acquisition of short-video app TikTok carries myriad risks, thrusting it into the politically fraught social media business and Sino-U.S. conflict amid increased scrutiny of big-tech companies.
But the deal could help Microsoft build on its $27 billion purchase of LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) to become a bigger player in internet advertising now dominated by  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google.
Microsoft on Sunday said it aims to complete a deal by Sept. 15 for TikTok's U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand operations. It is likely to have an edge in pricing negotiations as the U.S. is effectively forcing TikTok's Chinese parent, ByteDance, to sell by threatening to ban the app as a security risk. 
TikTok has taken teenagers around the world by storm and emerged as a significant competitor to Facebook and Google's YouTube. But like rivals, TikTok faces substantial new costs for content moderation as the spread of misinformation and allegations of political bias roil social media.
Increased oversight costs accounted for much of the 10-percentage-point drop in gross profit margins for Facebook and Alphabet over the last 3-1/2 years, Refinitiv data showed.
""Does Microsoft really want to own an app that breeds conspiracy theories in tweens?"" said Hank Green, YouTube star and chief executive of educational media company Complexly. He said TikTok removes content to maintain ""a certain feel"", and could face public challenges over such decisions more often under a bigger name such as Microsoft.
At $1.55 trillion, Microsoft is the world's second-largest company by market capitalization after Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) but has in recent years faced less criticism than peers over antitrust, data protection and China projects.
NADELLA'S DEALS
Microsoft has done several big deals since Satya Nadella became chief executive in 2014, with acquisitions including world-building game Minecraft and job-search social network LinkedIn. They have fared better than those under predecessor Steve Ballmer, whose failed deals included Nokia Oyj (HE:NOKIA)'s phone business. 
The LinkedIn acquisition in 2016, for 50% above its share price, was Nadella's biggest and riskiest. Microsoft shares fell 3% when it was announced with analysts expressing concern about slowing revenue growth and an expected cap on usage. 
Some concerns may have been overblown. Microsoft has avoided antitrust and privacy scrutiny with a cautious approach to connecting LinkedIn to other products, such as Outlook, and analysts have largely viewed the deal as a success in terms of synergies.
Though the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed sales, LinkedIn ad revenue was among Microsoft's fastest-growing over 2017-2019 as the global economy roared.
Overall, LinkedIn has generated $14.3 billion in revenue for Microsoft through ads and subscriptions, though analysts estimate it remains unprofitable.
TikTok is a bigger gamble because it caters to a less-affluent audience than LinkedIn, where advertisers typically pay more to attract wealthier consumers. TikTok's ad sales team and technology also are far less mature than LinkedIn's were, and TikTok faces greater competition.
About 11% of U.S. adults use TikTok at least once per week, versus 49% for YouTube and 62% for Facebook, showed a survey last month by tech consultancy Vorhaus Advisors.
LinkedIn came to Microsoft at 13 years old with 11,000 employees and 105 million monthly users globally. Six-year-old TikTok, by contrast, has about 1,000 U.S. employees and has been downloaded 226 million times in the four countries targeted by Microsoft's deal, showed data from app tracker Sensor Tower.
LinkedIn ""was bought on domination of a sector, good revenue, and good margins,"" said Mike Vorhaus, head of Vorhaus Advisors. ""TikTok is going to be valued based on its incredible user growth and mobile advertising revenue opportunities.""
TikTok would make Microsoft relevant among both young engineers looking for a hip place to work and advertisers clamoring for alternatives to Facebook and Google.
Green, the YouTube star, said he doubted Microsoft ownership would hurt TikTok, noting he amassed 600,000 TikTok followers since he began posting a month ago.

""I don't see anything at all standing in the way,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's favourite holding period -- forever -- has few fans these days, with the average length of time shares spend in a portfolio hitting record lows this year as investors surf wild market swings for quick gains.
The length of time that investors hold shares has been shrinking for decades but the trend accelerated this year in volatile markets that have made people nervous about sitting on investments for too long.
There are different ways of slicing it, but Reuters calculations based on New York stock exchange data show the average holding period for U.S. shares was 5-1/2 months in June, versus 8-1/2 months at end-2019. 
The previous record low of six months was hit just after the 2008 crisis. In 1999, for example, 14 months was the average.
Europe displays a similar trend, with holding periods shrinking to less than 5 months, from 7 months last December.
(GRAPHIC - Shrinking holding period of U.S. stocks: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/rlgpdnajbpo/Pasted%20image%201596444244862.png)
Rob Almeida, a portfolio manager at asset manager MFS, said for years mom-and-pop punters, commission-free investing and more machine-trading have contributed to the trend. 
But 0% interest rates, trillions of dollars of central bank and government stimulus and high levels of uncertainty caused by the pandemic have added to the momentum.
""Capital doesn't have a price thanks to all this stimulus,"" Almeida said, ""The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the trend of short-termism in investing."" 
Meanwhile there's little clarity on companies' future earnings, the economic outlook and the pandemic outcome.
""So what's happening is this ability to act or trade or churn, whatever you want to call it, based on information that may not be material,"" Almeida said.
Turnover ratios, the percentage of portfolio holdings that are replaced in a 12-month period, increased to 92% at end-June, from 85% a year ago for a group of global multi-asset funds tracked by Lipper.
The trend has ensured rich returns for nimble traders but also poses questions about market stability once stimulus fades.
(GRAPHIC - Bond returns: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgvokagqvd/MicrosoftTeams-image%20(4).png)
'BACK TO FRONT'
Market short-termism was highlighted as far back as 2010 by Bank of England chief economist Andrew Haldane who described it as ""subconscious myopia."" 
But buy-and-hold investors have had a rough year so far. Stocks fell 40% and bounced by the same margin in the space of three months. Around the 2008 crisis, moves of such magnitude occurred over three years. 
Kevin Russell, CIO of UBS' O'Connor hedge fund, with $6.1 billion in assets under management, said his lowest turnover strategies, unable to quickly adjust hedges and exposures, are now his worst performing. 
Low-turnover strategies struggle in this environment as they are not as durable against the swift rotations happening across sectors and style factors, he said, referring to different investment styles.
And when short-term returns are so attractive, it makes little sense to hold assets for longer. Returns on 10-year Treasuries in the first 2020 quarter almost matched what would mathematically accrue after a decade, BCA Research strategist Dhaval Joshi noted.
""The same principle also applies to mainstream stock markets which are priced for feeble long-term returns – yet can rally by 20-30% in the space of a few weeks,"" Joshi said.
""The incentive structure is back to front.""
On bonds too, whether high-grade government securities or ""junk"" debt, average daily turnover is running 10-20% above historical averages, trading platform Marketaxess said.
Asset manager BlueBay generally churns bond positions twice a year. But that horizon shrank in March-April to 2-3 months as volatility constantly threw up buying opportunities, said portfolio manager Kaspar Hense.
The issue has implications for spending on investment research, which is often used to set out strategies for longer-term investing, as well as for long-term pension and insurance investors. And BCA's Joshi said short-term players buying and selling at the same time can extinguish market liquidity, increasing volatility.
In terms of real-world impact, it is a poor incentive for long-term corporate planning, Fabio Di Giansante, Amundi's head of large cap equities, said. 
""Because what ultimately drives share price performance is earnings and you need to hold on to good investments for a while to see (companies) execute their business decisions,"" he said.

The company made the statement following a conversation between is CEO Satya Nadella and U.S. President Donald Trump. It said it would ensure that all private data of TikTok's American users is transferred to and remains in the United States.
""Microsoft fully appreciates the importance of addressing the President's concerns. It is committed to acquiring TikTok subject to a complete security review and providing proper economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury,"" Microsoft said in a statement.

377,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 05:09AM ET</span>",Wall Street Is Torn on Whether a Biden Win Brings Joy or Misery,"(Bloomberg) -- As President Donald Trump’s poll numbers continue to sink, Wall Street is starting to envision Washington under Joe Biden -- a scenario that many executives say they welcome. But to some pessimists, the upbeat view underestimates the rising influence of progressive Democrats who are demanding a clampdown on banks, hedge funds and private-equity firms.
Those with the rosier outlook point to Biden’s mostly pro-business inner circle, his significant campaign contributions from the financial industry and his longtime support of credit card companies located in his home state of Delaware. Plus, a Biden victory would likely be driven by U.S. voters seeking change because they believe the country is a mess. Wall Street thinks it has a strong argument to make that reining in lenders would be a fatal mistake when unemployment is sky-high and the economy remains ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic.
The enthusiasm, however, is tempered by fears over how much sway Biden will give progressives and their firebrand leaders, including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. That’s especially true when it comes to picking appointees to run the powerful agencies that police banks and securities firms, jobs that the activists are mobilizing to fill with industry critics. At a minimum, progressives want to ensure that the days are long over when Democrats appointed officials like Robert Rubin, Timothy Geithner and Lawrence Summers, who is a key Biden adviser.
The stakes for Wall Street couldn’t be higher. Centrist regulators would be less likely to overturn rule rollbacks approved under Trump that have saved financial firms tens of billions of dollars. Progressive (NYSE:PGR) agency heads, on the other hand, could pursue what the C-suite calls the “shame and investigation agenda.” Policies like taxes on trading, curbs on executive pay and even breaking up behemoth banks would be back on the table.
Serious Threat
That’s a threat that the industry should take seriously, especially if wealth inequality and Covid-fueled job losses “force a new Democratic tone,” said Karen Shaw Petrou, a managing partner at Washington research firm Federal Financial Analytics. “While Biden as president would surely be less ornery than Warren, it’s more than premature to say he won’t be considerably more progressive than many on the Street expect.”
The looming battle over key positions at agencies such as the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and Securities and Exchange Commission was described in interviews with more than a dozen people including progressives, financial executives, banking lobbyists and ex-regulators. Most requested anonymity so they could discuss specific names and strategies without endangering access to the Biden campaign.
“All these jobs matter,” said Jeff Hauser, who runs the Revolving Door Project, a Washington-based group that has led campaigns to keep corporate executives out of government.
The debate threatens to put Biden in a bind as he seeks to balance the competing interests of Wall Street donors and the activists he’s counting on to help generate enthusiasm among Democratic voters. Thus far, the former vice president has mainly stayed mum on potential nominees.
Read More: Biden Woos Left Flank Along With Wall Street to Avoid 2016 Rerun
The Biden campaign, according to people who have been in touch with it, has also been vague in private. Some attribute that to disorganization, while others say his aides want to avoid a divisive topic, especially at a time when the focus is on beating Trump in November.
The Biden campaign declined to comment.
Bankers’ Candidates
In compiling its wish list of potential nominees, Wall Street is pushing for what some executives call “adults” who understand markets and have been regulators in the past, such as Fed Governor Lael Brainard, ex-Deputy Treasury Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin, and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and TIAA Chief Executive Officer Roger Ferguson, both of whom are African American.
Other favorites include several women with closer Wall Street ties: Sallie Krawcheck, the former chief financial officer of  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). who now runs a digital investment platform for women; Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. CFO Ruth Porat, who held the same job at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS); and Mellody Hobson, co-CEO of Ariel Investments and a board member of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.
A Biden fundraiser last month put together by alumni of Barack Obama’s Treasury Department also showcased a number of people thought to be vying for regulatory jobs. The top donors, who each paid $25,000, included ex-Treasury counselor Antonio Weiss, Mary Miller, who recently ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Baltimore, and Seth Carpenter, the chief economist at UBS Securities.
Overall, Biden has raised more than $42.4 million from the securities and investment industry, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Progressives’ Strategy
Progressives say they are working on a two-pronged plan, offering names to the Biden campaign but also developing opposition research against potential Wall Street nominees. Among their biggest targets, people familiar with their effort said, is blocking anyone from BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). Activists argue the world’s biggest money manager is dangerously inter-connected and holds too much sway in Washington.
The progressive effort is being led by several groups such as the Revolving Door Project, Demand Progress, Americans for Financial Reform and Data for Progress. They are counting on massive email lists, social media and alliances with other liberal organizations, including the environmental movement, to help them press their case.
Their candidates include Obama Commodity Futures Trading Commission chief Gary Gensler, ex-SEC Commissioner Kara Stein, Amanda Fischer, who recently served as Representative Katie Porter’s chief of staff, ex-Warren aide Bharat Ramamurti and Graham (NYSE:GHM) Steele, a former San Francisco Fed staff member. They also would support Democratic SEC Commissioner Allison Lee becoming chairwoman.
Pro-Business Aides
A point Wall Street says it has in its favor is that Biden’s closest advisers are mainly centrists and seasoned Washington hands who would resist progressives’ most extreme ideas. They include Steve Ricchetti, a former corporate lobbyist, attorney Ron Klain, general counsel at venture capital firm Revolution, and longtime Democratic strategists Bruce Reed and Mike Donilon. Another Biden supporter is Donilon’s brother, Tom, a BlackRock executive who was Obama’s national security advisor.
Read More: Biden’s Wall Street Pals Think They Have His Ear Despite Snubs
But the liberal activists believe they also have allies in several staff who are working on domestic policy issues, as well as in Ted Kaufman, who is leading Biden’s transition team. After being appointed as a placeholder for Biden’s Senate seat in 2009, Kaufman called for capping the size of banks and ripped the Justice Department for failing to send Wall Street executives to prison after the 2008 financial crisis.
As both sides game out their strategy, there are plenty of unknowns. Perhaps the biggest factor will be which party ends up controlling the Senate, where most senior appointees must be approved. If Republicans continue to hold a majority, it could be tough for those with long track records of bashing banks to win confirmation.
Trump’s Squatters
Also adding to the uncertainty is that Biden wouldn’t immediately be able to replace all of Trump’s regulators because several don’t have to leave their jobs with a change in administration.
They include Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles, who has more than a year left in his term and has given no indication that he will step down. He’s led the charge in quietly relaxing post-crisis constraints, such as a June revamp of derivative rules that could free up an estimated $40 billion that Wall Street banks had been forced to set aside for protecting swaps trades.
Read More: Banks Get Easier Volcker Rule and $40 Billion Break on Swaps
Warren’s status, too, is up in the air. Biden has said she is under consideration for the vice president slot, and she has also been talked about for a cabinet position. But if she remains in the Senate, Warren could lead the drive for progressive regulators.
Thwarting Nominees
While progressives say they don’t expect to win all their battles under a moderate Biden administration, they do have some experience defeating nominees during the Obama years. That includes helping thwart the likely nomination of Summers, who serves as a paid contributor to Bloomberg Television, to run the Fed. That campaign led to the confirmation of Janet Yellen, the first woman to head the central bank.

“The basic issue vis-a-vis Wall Street is that we want to make clear that Biden World should ask itself a question,” said Hauser, of the Revolving Door Project. “Is this person worth the hassle?”

Poland sees Nord Stream 2, which would double Russia's gas export capacity via the Baltic Sea, as a threat to Europe's energy security, saying it will strengthen Gazprom's market dominance.
Nord Stream 2 is led by Gazprom, with half of the funding provided by Germany's Uniper (DE:UN01) and BASF's (DE:BASFn) Wintershall unit, Anglo-Dutch company Shell (L:RDSa), Austria's OMV (VI:OMVV) and Engie (PA:ENGIE).
UOKiK has been examining the project for years and in 2019 it fined Engie 40 million euros for failing to provide documents and information relating to the case.
""At the beginning of the year, we requested Gazprom provide us with contracts concluded by its subsidiary with other companies financing the construction of Nord Stream 2...The company failed to provide such information,"" the head of UOKiK said in a statement. 
""To my mind, it is an intentional act, the aim of which was to obstruct the ongoing proceedings."" 
Gazprom declined to comment. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Gazprom have said they plan to complete Nord Stream 2. More than 90% of the construction has been completed.
The Russian energy giant supplies most of the gas consumed in Poland. Polish state-run gas company PGNiG (WA:PGN) has often complained it pays more than its European peers for Russian gas.

In July, Gazprom paid PGNiG the $1.6 billion the Polish company won in a pricing dispute and PGNiG chief executive said that Poland's relations with Gazprom were ""becoming normal.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese utilities expect a slow recovery in electric power demand toward March after a 5% drop in the April-June quarter though some are less confident that the worst is over.
Uncertainty over demand has deepened recently due to a resurgence in coronavirus cases in Japan, forcing most utilities to skip providing annual profit guidelines.
Slack power demand may cause a surplus of fuels such as liquefied natural gas (LNG).
That threatens losses for Japanese utilities committed to large volumes of LNG under term contracts linked to oil prices as they resell it at spot prices which are much lower.
(GRAPHIC - Japan electric power demand: https://graphics.reuters.com/JAPAN-UTILITIES/POWER-DEMAND/xklpydbzwvg/chart.png)
In the April-June quarter, May was the weakest month with power demand falling 9%, according to the Organization for Cross-regional Coordination of Transmission Operators, Japan (OCCTO). 
For industry leader Tokyo Electric Power Company, household power demand in its region rose 5% thanks to lockdown demand, but industrial and commercial demand have plunged, with April-May figures plunging by 20%-50%, Managing Executive Officer Rikuo Otsuki said.
""Power demand will slowly pick up, but it won't return to the levels before the pandemic during this financial year,"" he told an earnings news conference last week.
Chubu Electric Power also predicted a gradual recovery later in the year, but annual demand in its region will likely fall 6% year on year, said Yoshinobu Mishima, manager at its Tokyo office.
Others were even more cautious.
""As the coronavirus cases are rising again, we can't say demand has hit the bottom. ..it's difficult to make any predictions now,"" said Yuji Sasaki, general manager at Tohoku Electric Power's Tokyo office said.
Nine of the top 10 regional utilities reported a drop in their quarterly sales.
Only Chubu and Chugoku Electric Power gave full-year forecasts this time, both predicting falls in net profit.
Okinawa Electric Power forecast a gain in annual profit in April, without factoring in the impact of the pandemic.

Chubu has warned its JERA fuel joint venture will book a loss estimated at 50 billion yen ($471 million) on the resale of LNG cargoes this year.

380,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 04:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Trump gives Microsoft 45 days to clinch TikTok deal,"By Greg Roumeliotis, Echo Wang and Matt Spetalnick
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump only agreed to allow  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) to negotiate the acquisition of popular short-video app TikTok if it could secure a deal in 45 days, three people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
The move represents an about-face for Trump and prompted the U.S. tech giant to declare its interest in the blockbuster social media deal that could further inflame U.S.-China relations. Trump said on Friday he was planning to ban TikTok amid concerns that its Chinese ownership represents a national security risk because of the personal data it handles.
The proposed acquisition of TikTok, which boasts 100 millions U.S. users, would offer Microsoft a rare opportunity to become a major competitor to social media giants such as  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP). Microsoft also owns professional social media network LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD).
Trump had dismissed the idea of a sale to Microsoft on Friday. But following a discussion between Trump and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, the Redwood (NYSE:RWT), Washington-based company said in a statement on Sunday that it would continue negotiations to acquire TikTok from ByteDance, and that it aimed to reach a deal by Sept. 15.
This is a deadline that was put to ByteDance and Microsoft by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes deals for potential national security risks, according to the sources. 
Trump changed his mind following pressure from some of his advisers and many in his Republican party, one of the sources said. Banning TikTok would alienate many of its young users ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November, and would likely trigger a wave of legal challenges. Several prominent Republican lawmakers put out statements in the last two days urging Trump to back a sale of TikTok to Microsoft. 
""A win-win in the making,"" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) tweeted in response to Trump's new stance on Sunday.
The negotiations between ByteDance and Microsoft will be overseen by CFIUS, a U.S. government panel that has the right to block any agreement, according to the sources, who requested anonymity ahead of a White House announcement. Microsoft cautioned in its statement that there is no certainty a deal will be reached.
""Microsoft fully appreciates the importance of addressing the President's concerns. It is committed to acquiring TikTok subject to a complete security review and providing proper economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury,"" Microsoft said in a statement.
ByteDance and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Microsoft talks. In a statement issued late on Sunday that did not mention TikTok, ByteDance said it faced ""complex and unimaginable difficulties"" in going global.
As relations between the United States and China deteriorate over trade, Hong Kong's autonomy, cyber security and the spread of the novel coronavirus, TikTok has emerged as a flashpoint in the dispute between the world's two largest economies.
State-backed newspaper China Daily on Monday called ByteDance the victim of a ""witch hunt"" from the United States, and said Washington had not provided evidence to support its allegation that TikTok posed a threat to U.S. national security. 
Under the proposed deal, Microsoft said it would take over TikTok's operations in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It said it would ensure that all private data of TikTok's American users is transferred to and remains in the United States.
Microsoft may invite other American investors to acquire minority stakes in TikTok, the company added. About 70% of the outside capital ByteDance has raised has come from the United States.
It is not clear how much Microsoft could pay for TikTok. Reuters reported last week that ByteDance's valuation expectations for the app exceeded $50 billion, although U.S. pressure to divest it could lower that price tag.
A key issue in the negotiations will be separating TikTok's technology from ByteDance's infrastructure and access, to alleviate U.S. concerns about the integrity of personal data. ByteDance owns a Chinese short video app called Douyin that was based on the same code used for TikTok.
One idea under consideration is to give Microsoft and ByteDance a transition period to develop technology for TikTok that will be completely separate from ByteDance, one of the sources said.
Microsoft said it did not intend to provide further updates until there was a definitive outcome in the negotiations.
APP SCRUTINY
The United States has been increasingly scrutinizing app developers over the personal data they handle, especially if some of it involves U.S. military or intelligence personnel. Ordering the divestment of TikTok would not be the first time the White House has taken action over such concerns.
Earlier this year, Chinese gaming company  Beijing Kunlun Tech  Co Ltd (SZ:300418) sold Grindr LLC, a popular gay dating app it bought in 2016, for $620 million after being ordered by CFIUS to divest.
In 2018, CFIUS forced China's Ant Financial to scrap plans to buy MoneyGram International Inc (O:MGI) over concerns about the safety of data that could identify U.S. citizens.

ByteDance was valued at as much as $140 billion earlier this year when one of its shareholders, Cheetah Mobile (N:CMCM), sold a small stake in a private deal, Reuters has reported. The start-up's investors include Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984).

LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) PLC warned its bad debt charges could blow past a previous estimate to $13 billion this year and said its profits more than halved, as the coronavirus pandemic hammered the bank's retail and corporate customers worldwide.
The lender warned its capital reserves could deteriorate, its revenues would come under pressure and it faced heightened geopolitical risk as Europe's biggest bank set out a gloomier than expected outlook for the second half of the year.
HSBC increased its estimate of the total bad debt charges it could take this year to between $8 billion and $13 billion from $7 billion-$11 billion, reflecting worse-than-expected actual losses in the second quarter and expectations of a steeper decline in the economy.
""What we have seen this quarter is quite a sharp shift in economic outlook for the global economy, the famous 'V' has got a lot sharper and as a result we have materially increased our provisions,"" Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson told Reuters.
HSBC's shares fell 4.6% to a nerly twelve-year low as investors digested the scale of the challenge facing HSBC, as it grapples with a global pandemic, political unrest in its core Hong Kong market, and low interest rates on its lending worldwide. 
The bank reported a pre-tax profit of $4.32 billion for the first six months this year, lower than the $5.67 billion average of analysts' forecasts. 
HSBC's business in Britain has been hit particularly hard, Stevenson said, as it took a $1.5 billion charge against expected credit losses.
HSBC's results reinforced the trend of lenders across the world increasing their buffers to absorb souring loans at a time when companies - from aviation to retail and hospitality sectors - are reeling from the impact of COVID-19.
TROUBLE AHEAD
The bank's credit impairment provisions in the first-half soared to $6.9 billion, compared to $1 billion in the same period a year earlier. 
Impairment charges included a $1.2 billion writedown on the value of software it owns, mainly in Europe, it said.
While HSBC's core capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, rose to 15% at the end of June, the bank warned the metric would likely decline later this year as falling credit ratings hit its risk-weighted asset ratio.
Its revenues fell 9% in the six-month period, as global interest rate cuts and declining market values on assets in investment banking and insurance outweighed higher trading income.
HSBC is continuing to review its long-term dividend policy, CEO Noel Quinn said in a statement. 
The bank earlier this year halted payouts in response to a regulatory request in Britain, infuriating many of its retail investors who rely on it for income, particularly in Hong Kong. 
Quinn told Reuters the bank's staff headcount has fallen by some 4,000 this year after it restarted a redundancy programme that was put on ice after the coronavirus outbreak.
The bank is aiming to cut costs by 3% this year from that restructuring as well as lower employee spending on travel and other items during the pandemic, he said.

Only a fifth of the around 9,000 staff in its headquarters in London's Canary Wharf district would be able to return to work in the near term for safety reasons, Quinn told Reuters.

The two new groups would comprise the coal and non-coal operations of the three companies, Jasek Sasin was quoted as saying by DGP on Monday.
Poland generates most of its electricity from burning coal and has been the only European Union member which refused to pledge carbon neutrality by 2050.
The ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party took power in 2015 partly on promises to sustain coal, but it has closed a number of mines since then and has encouraged investment in solar energy.
""We are all surprised with the pace of climate policy changes ... Today we need to reevaluate some comments due to what is happening around us,"" Sasin said.
He added that Polish power stations will likely stop burning coal in 2050 or 2060.
""Our plan is creating from the three energy groups - Tauron, PGE and Enea - two entities. One would be coal (based) and the other non-coal. We are consulting this with the European Commission,"" Sasin said.
Poland had planned to announce deep cuts in its biggest coal producer PGG last week, by closing two mines and reducing PGG's output.
The government unexpectedly backed away from the plan and said in the next two months it would work with trade unions on a new restructuring project for PGG.
""Finding a real alternative for the solution that was on the table will be very difficult,"" Sasin said, adding that Poland's coal stockpiles at mines and power stations stood at 15 million tonnes.
Sasin also said the mines that PGG planned to close as part of the restructuring account for 95% of the group's losses.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening cautiously higher Monday, helped by signs of economic growth in China but with rising Covid cases continuing to create doubts about the global recovery.
At 2:15 AM ET (0615 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% higher, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.1%, while CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.4%.
China reported a strong Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index reading of 52.8 earlier in the day, indicating that the Chinese manufacturing sector continued to expand in July. The reading also corroborated the official manufacturing PMI of 51.1 released on Friday.
The focus will now turn to manufacturing PMI data for the European region later Monday, to see whether this also points to a recovery for the sector during July. This comes after eurozone GDP data, released last week, showed a decline of 12.1% in the second quarter of 2020, the largest quarterly decline on record. 
Meanwhile, the number of Covid-19 cases continues to rise. The total number of cases globally topped 18 million as of August 3, according to Johns Hopkins University data, with deaths rapidly approaching 700,000.
The United States is in a new phase of the novel coronavirus outbreak with infections ""extraordinarily widespread"" in rural areas as well as cities, White House coronavirus experts said on Sunday.
Worries are high that continuing waves of coronavirus infections may halt what had been a budding recovery in the world’s biggest economy, particularly as Congress failed to reach an agreement over the latest stimulus measures before some earlier measures expired on Friday.
Earnings season continues this week, with HSBC (LON:HSBA), the U.K.’s biggest bank, in the spotlight after posting pretax profits of $4.3 billion, down 65% from the same period last year, adding that it has set aside between $8 billion and $13 billion this year for bad loans.
Oil prices headed lower Monday, with traders fretting about the recovery in demand just as the major crude producers move to increase supply into the market. 
Oil output by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries rose by over 1 million barrels a day in July as Saudi Arabia and other Gulf members ended their voluntary extra supply curbs on top of an OPEC-led deal.
OPEC+, a grouping of OPEC and allies including Russia, is set to step up output in August, adding about 1.5 million bpd to global supply.
This comes as a second wave of coronavirus cases has caused countries around the globe to scale back some of their reopening plans, hitting demand for oil.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% lower at $39.97 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.5% to $43.40. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,982.60/oz, reaching a record high and continuing its march towards the $2,000 mark, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1759, down 0.1%.

Cerberus made the comments in a letter to the bank's supervisory board dated Aug. 2 ahead of a Monday meeting of the board to discuss the role.
""We have serious doubts that Hans-Joerg Vetter is the right person for this job or has the right experience for it,"" 
A spokeswoman for Commerzbank declined to comment.
A decision on Monday by the board to back Vetter, a former chief executive of Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg, would go some way toward filling a leadership vacuum at the top of Germany’s No. 2 bank.
The lender was thrust into turmoil last month when Chief Executive Martin Zielke and supervisory board Chairman Stefan Schmittmann said they would step down to give the bank a fresh start.
That followed a public campaign for change by a top investor - the U.S. private equity firm Cerberus, which holds a 5% stake in the bank.
""Cerberus has identified at least two candidates who have the required qualifications to fill the role of chairman and secure the confidence of all key stakeholders,"" Cerberus said without naming them.

""We would be happy to introduce them,"" the investor said.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly up on Monday morning, starting August with gains which were capped by increasing investor worries over a slowing economic recovery from the COVID-19 virus.
China reported a strong Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) reading of 52.8 earlier in the day, indicating that the Chinese manufacturing sector continued to expand in July. The reading also corroborated the official manufacturing PMI of 51.1 released on Friday.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.97% by 11:23 PM ET (4:23 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component gained 1.77%.
“There is going to be a recovery – we shouldn’t lose track of that as we go through this period,” Anne Anderson, head of fixed income at UBS Asset Management Australia, told Bloomberg.
“But returning to where we were before we started is going to be a real challenge and is going to require ongoing monetary and fiscal support. It’s a long way out of here, unfortunately,” she warned.
The U.S. Congress failed to reach an agreement over the latest stimulus measures before some earlier measures expired on Friday. Although White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told CBS on Sunday, “I’m not optimistic that there will be a solution in the very near term,” negotiations for the bill are expected to continue in the forthcoming week.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.95% (2:45 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.14%. South Korea’s manufacturing activity shrunk at a slower pace than the previous month, with the Nikkei purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rising to 46.9 in July from 43.4 in June. Although the highest reading since January, the figure was still below the 50-threshold separating expansion from contraction.
Down Under, the ASX 200 was up 0.15%, reversing earlier losses. Victoria state declared a state of disaster on Sunday and tightened its existent lockdown measures after reporting 671 COVID-19 cases. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia will hand down its interest rate decision on Tuesday.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slipped 1.06, with Chief Executive Carrie Lam announcing on Friday that the city would postpone its Legislative Council elections, originally scheduled for September 6, for a year.
Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise. The total number of cases globally topped 18 million as of August 3, according to Johns Hopkins University data."

A large stock-market tumble is unlikely given pent-up demand and an assumption that further fiscal relief will eventually pass Congress, keeping the economy “well above trend,” strategists including John Normand wrote in a note Friday. However, there are moderate risks from payrolls and retail sales data undershooting expectations in the early part of the month, they warned.
“Some misgivings are justified given a macro backdrop that is becoming muddied, but not muddied enough to justify bearish targets or a defensive investment strategy,” the strategists wrote. “The intersection of a U.S. growth downshift with expiring income supports preserves the risk of a market correction in August, but drawdown should be limited due to investor positioning.”
The S&P 500 has risen 46% from its March low on the back of unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus to combat the impact of Covid-19. As the benchmark climbed, numerous market watchers have warned that a pullback is likely, and corporate insiders have started to sell stocks.
Normand -- who not long after the March trough said that the worst was likely over -- maintains that conditions aren’t in place for much of a drawdown right now.
“A large correction (about 10%) would be tough to generate when positioning measures in equities are below average for most hedge funds” as well as for balanced bond/equity mutual funds,” the JPMorgan strategists said.

A Rio spokesperson confirmed the suit after Monadelphous said in a statement that it would contest a writ received from Rio. Monadelphous said it was separately informed by Rio that the claim is for A$493 million ($351 million), largely consisting of losses due to inability to process iron ore during the period of repair work at the facility. 
""As the matter is now before the court, Rio Tinto is unable to provide any additional comment,"" Rio's spokesperson said. 
Perth-based Monadelphous said its unit Monadelphous Engineering Associates (MEA) had been performing maintenance shutdown services prior to the fire commencing. Monadelphous said Rio has claimed that MEA breached terms of a contract with Rio and caused the fire.
""The contract between Rio Tinto and MEA ... contains exclusions and limitations of liability which will be relied upon by MEA in defence of the claim,"" Monadelphous said in a statement. 

Shares of Monadelphous dropped as much as 8% to A$8.20, its lowest since March 30, while Rio's shares traded about 1.3% higher.

Bain raised its offer price for Nichiigakkan to 1,670 yen from 1,500 yen after the market close on Friday as activist fund Effissimo Capital Management, which owns about 12% of Nichiigakkan, agreed to tender its shares to Bain.
Shares in Tokyo-based Nichiigakkan equalled the new offer price of 1,670 yen in early trade on Monday after rising 8.4%.
Hong Kong-based investment fund Lim Advisors, which owns a stake of an undisclosed size in Nichiigakkan, said on Monday the revised offer price remains substantially below fair value, which it estimates at about 2,400 yen a share.
Lim Advisors previously said Bain appeared to take advantage of coronavirus-related weakness in the share price it first launched a public offer in May. Bain Capital susbequently extended deadlines for the bid as the stock continued to trade higher than its offer price.

Marathon, under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management, said last year it would launch sweeping restructuring, including spinning off Speedway, which it said was worth as much as $18 billion, including debt.
After-tax proceeds from the sale, which has been approved by the boards of both companies, are estimated at $16.5 billion, Marathon said, adding it will use the proceeds to pay existing debt.
For Seven & i, owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, the deal helps it shift its focus beyond a saturated Japan market, multiplying its portfolio of U.S. gas stations and corner stores acquired through a $3.3 billion deal with Sunoco (N:SUN) in 2017. 
7-Eleven said the latest deal will bring its store count in the United States and Canada to about 14,000.
The deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021, includes a 15-year fuel supply agreement for about 7.7 billion gallons per year associated with the Speedway business, said Marathon, the largest U.S. refiner by volume. 
The Japanese company abandoned the deal in March, according to sources at the time, due to worries about the price tag - reportedly around $22 billion - especially due to growing concerns about global economic slowdown amid the virus outbreak.
Many analysts and investors had said the initially reported deal price was too high. But some also said it still made sense for Seven & i to expand further in North America.
In Japan, the convenience store chain faces a slow economy as well as tough competition from rivals such as FamilyMart (T:8028) and Lawson (T:2651), as well as discount drugstores and online retail giants like Amazon.com (O:AMZN).
7-Eleven also said it expects to achieve $475 million to $575 million of synergies through the third year after the deal's closing.
The deal will also produce compound annual growth over 15% in 7–Eleven's operating income through the first three years after closing, the company said. It added the purchase price reflected $3 billion in tax benefits.

Seven & i, Canadian convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard (TO:ATDb) and private equity firm TDR Capital had prepared rival bids late last month for Speedway, Reuters reported in July.

393,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2020 08:05PM ET</span>",Samsung crafts India comeback as anti-China wave surges,"By Sankalp Phartiyal and Heekyong Yang
NEW DELHI/SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd (KS:005930) is forging a comeback in India's smartphone market with a new range of budget devices and a ramped-up online presence, aiming to recoup ground ceded to Chinese rivals such as  Xiaomi  (OTC:XIACF) Corp (HK:1810). 
Samsung, the only major non-Chinese player in the country, has already begun to gain ground, and a surge in anti-China sentiment in India following a border clash in June is expected to provide a fresh boost.
Samsung jumped to the No. 2 spot with 26% market share in the second quarter behind Xiaomi's 29%, according to tech researcher Counterpoint, as the South Korean company's diverse and inhouse supply chain helped it avoid product delays suffered by rivals during coronavirus lockdowns.
It was in third position with a 16% share in the previous quarter. 
Once the unrivalled leader in the world's second-biggest smartphone market, Samsung has over the past three years lost Indian customers to Chinese brands, whose devices are perceived as better value. 
But India still accounts for some $7.5 billion in annual retail smartphone revenues for Samsung, according to Counterpoint, making it the company's biggest market outside the United States. 
It has built what it has described as the world's largest mobile phone manufacturing plant on the outskirts of New Delhi, where it tests new devices and often assembles them for export.
That manufacturing power, and Samsung's ability to source many components internally, is helping it gain ground amid the pandemic. Chinese smartphone brands Xiaomi and Oppo suffered local production hiccups and product delays due to COVID-19, but Samsung was able to keep delivering phones smoothly. 
Now it is building on the momentum. Samsung has launched seven new smartphones since June, three of them under 10,000 rupees ($133.63) including its cheapest Android offering at $75.
""The COVID crisis has pushed people to use smartphones for everything from online education to digital payments to even connecting with friends on video calls. That's why these budget phones are focused on the mass market,"" said a source familiar with Samsung's strategy in India.
In May, Samsung partnered with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to train some 200,000 brick and mortar stores selling its phones to use social media for sales and marketing. It has also launched instalment-payment plans for customers and new incentive schemes, including one that gives student discounts on select devices.
A spokesman for Samsung said the company was seeing high demand for its devices in India and expected its revenues to increase from last year. The company does not provide a breakdown of revenues from individual countries.
TOUGH COMPETITION
Competition from rivals such as Xiaomi, which is banking on a 'Made in India' image to beat the anti-China sentiment, remains stiff. A deal between India's  Reliance Industries  Ltd (NS:RELI) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to make a cheap Android phone could also pose a threat to Samsung's sales of lower-end devices.
Anti-China sentiment is nothing new in India, where the Chinese have a reputation for cheaper products. Samsung, despite a better brand reputation, has struggled to woo price-sensitive Indian customers.
But better low-end offerings and the new anti-China tide -New Delhi has banned 59 Chinese apps since the border skirmish and traders have called for a boycott of imported Chinese products - could help shift the market dynamics.
""Samsung is India's No.2 smartphone brand after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) by image,"" brand strategist Harish Bijoor said. ""So a phone priced between 6,000 rupees to 15,000 rupees from Samsung is very well placed today to capture market share from Chinese rivals.""
The cheapest iPhone in India costs around 31,500 rupees, while the cheapest Xiaomi phone costs around 7,500 rupees.
Ganesh Salvi, a private sector employee from Satara town in western Maharashtra state said he had bought a Chinese branded phone for his 16 year-old son's online classes last month, even though he dislikes buying Chinese products.

""I believe Samsung mobiles are more durable than Chinese phones and I'd certainly prefer them if they had more smartphones below 10,000 rupees,"" Salvi said.

394,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 02, 2020 07:18PM ET</span>",Oil Crisis Presents BP’s New CEO With a Chance to Change,"(Bloomberg) -- As Bernard Looney took to the stage in London in February to announce his plan to transform BP (NYSE:BP) Plc for a low-carbon future, the U.K. capital confirmed its first case of Covid-19.
The oil giant’s chief executive officer couldn’t have known how the virus would shake the foundations of his industry: since the start of the pandemic, BP has said it will write off as much as $17.5 billion of fossil-fuel assets, slash 10,000 jobs and exit the petrochemicals business. And on Tuesday, it may announce the first dividend cut since the Macondo oil-spill disaster a decade ago.
But despite the pain for shareholders and employees, the crisis is giving Looney the opportunity to accelerate the big changes needed to fulfill his vision.
The global spread of coronavirus “only reaffirms the need to reinvent our company,” Looney now says. The pandemic has created a world that pumps less oil, gets more of its energy from renewable sources and emits less carbon dioxide -- exactly what he says BP should do.
“This backdrop of battered demand presents a lot of challenges, but it also presents opportunity,” said Luke Parker, vice president of corporate research for Wood Mackenzie Ltd.
The measures BP has taken so far aren’t unique, either in the current slump or in the periodic downturns that have afflicted the industry over the decades. But there’s a symbolism that wasn’t there before.
Quitting a core business like chemicals is a good way to show that the future looks different. Taking an ax to billions of dollars of oil and gas asset values demonstrates that “you’re a company that believes this transition is going to happen and that the world will be on a 2-degree path,” Parker said.
Also see: BP’s New CEO Needs to Steer Company Through World Wary of Oil
Most importantly, the company is widely expected to follow Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc in the coming week by cutting its dividend, potentially freeing up cash to invest in clean energy.
Difficult decisions like this have been made easier by the coronavirus crisis, according to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.’s head of EMEA oil and gas, Christyan Malek.
“What you’re seeing BP do is getting its house in order” before announcing a detailed transformation plan in September, Malek said. “BP have been putting the building blocks in place -- the impairments, the divestments. And we believe the dividend cut is the next building block.”
Reducing BP’s $8 billion annual shareholder payout would address the biggest unanswered question about Looney’s transition plan: Where is the money going to come from?
Even before the coronavirus lockdowns crashed energy prices, BP was saddled with more debt than any of its peers. Its gearing -- the ratio of debt to equity -- is poised to rise as high as 48%, according to RBC Capital Markets. That would be by far the highest in the industry, and could lead to questions about its credit rating.
While the measures Looney has taken so far may help him achieve BP’s long-term goals, in the short-term shareholders appear unimpressed. The company’s stock is down 41% this year, a steeper drop than the 36% decline in the Stoxx Europe 600 Oil & Gas index.
Low-Carbon Spending
Without a detailed plan of how BP is going to become a clean-energy giant, the cost of the transformation remains largely theoretical. What’s clear, is that at the very least the oil major will have to boost spending on low-carbon fuels significantly from the current $500 million a year to billions.
The other route would be acquisitions, following on from its 130 million-pound ($170 million) purchase of U.K. car-charging company Chargemaster in 2018. Such assets typically have positive cash flow and can be integrated easily into oil majors’ portfolios, said Bruce Duguid, head of stewardship, EOS at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI).
As Looney, 49, reshapes BP, doubts linger about the strategy. Sitting in the audience of the great unveiling in February was former CEO John Browne, who tried to steer the company into renewables in the early 2000s with the ill-fated “Beyond Petroleum” campaign.
“We moved too soon,” Looney said in a recent Instagram post. “We lost money on much of what we had built up.”
Bob Dudley, Looney’s immediate predecessor, has repeatedly cautioned against moving too fast into low-carbon fuels, saying the potential failure of new technologies could lead to financial ruin.
The key to success will be keeping investors on board. There’s strong support for BP’s overall change in direction, with shareholders voting overwhelmingly in favor of climate resolutions in 2019, according to Hermes’ Duguid. But it could be a painful journey, and there’s a risk shareholders have a change of heart if Looney does cut the dividend.
“You can use the macroeconomic backdrop as a way to justify the means, but you still need the end result to work,” said JPMorgan’s Malek.

Shell did not disclose a value for the deal, but said it will help in contributing towards the company's ambition of being a ""net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 or sooner.""
Last year, Shell made its first foray into Australia's highly competitive power sector with a A$617 million ($441 million) takeover offer for ERM Power.
The Anglo-Dutch company has made a number of large investments in renewables and electric vehicle technologies, and plans to boost spending on its power division to $2 to $3 billion per year by 2025 as the world rapidly shifts towards cleaner energy.
Select Carbon specializes in developing carbon farming and manages a portfolio of over 70 projects encompassing over 9 million hectares across Australia, according to the company's website.

Shell expects the deal to be completed before the end of the year, it said in a statement.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) issued Australia's first green bond linked to the performance of an index tracking companies tipped to benefit from the country's transition into a low-carbon economy, aiming to bridge a gap in sustainable investment products.
On Friday, BNP sold A$140 million ($101.12 million) of 8-year bonds that pay a fixed coupon plus a potential return tied to the performance of a ""forward-looking"" climate transition index, the first of its kind, investors said.
As large asset managers reshape their investment strategies away from dirty investments, the 'A+'-rated bond adds to the $350 billion in green bonds expected to be issued globally this year.
Developed by the French bank in collaboration with Monash University, ClimateWorks Australia and the ESG arm of corporate governance consultant Institutional Shareholder Services, the index uses scenario weighting and company data to chose those likely to do well from the transition to a decarbonised world.
Australia's First State Super, a A$125 billion pension fund, QBE Insurance, and the government-funded Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) invested in the bond, which builds on a similar European equity-linked green bond issued by BNP in 2014 that was not forward looking.
Investors will receive an undisclosed fixed coupon linked to BNP Paribas' green bond program, plus a potential ""green premium"" stemming from the performance of the new Australian index. BNP will use the proceeds to invest in certified green projects and hedge the exposure to the index. 
While there are plenty of climate-related investment indices that rely on emissions and financial data that is backward looking, the new Australian Climate Transition Index focuses on future climate transition risks and opportunities for Australian companies.
""With the companies on the ASX 300 responsible for an estimated 40% of national emissions, there is clear potential for them to make a substantial contribution to improving Australia's emissions profile,"" CEFC CEO Ian Learmonth said.

Geneva-based Relief Therapeutics Holdings AG has a patent for RLF-100, or aviptadil, a synthetic form of a natural peptide that protects the lung. U.S.-Israeli NeuroRx Inc partnered with Relief to develop the drug in the United States.
In June the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted fast-track designation to RLF-100 for treatment of respiratory distress in COVID-19.
While a Phase 2/3 clinical trial with 70 patients is ongoing, RLF-100 is being administered on an emergency basis to some patients who are too ill to be admitted to the trial.
The first report of rapid recovery under emergency use was posted by doctors from Houston Methodist Hospital, the companies said in a joint statement.
It said a 54-year-old man who developed COVID-19 while being treated for rejection of a double lung transplant came off a ventilator within four days of treatment with RLF-100.
Similar results were subsequently seen in more than 15
patients treated under emergency use, the companies said.
The two companies also said independent researchers in a biocontainment laboratory in Brazil reported that aviptadil blocked replication of the SARS coronavirus in human lung cells and immune cells.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several Republican senators on Sunday backed a plan by China's ByteDance to divest the U.S. operations of TikTok after President Donald Trump said on Friday he had decided to ban the popular short-video app.
Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said on Twitter that a divestment ""and purchase by U.S. company is win-win."" 
Senator Roger Wicker, a Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, echoed Cornyn but added that ""tight security measures need to be part of any deal in order to protect consumer data and ensure no foreign access.""
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told ABC on Sunday that the Committee on Foreign Investment on the United States ""agrees that TikTok cannot stay in the current format because it risks sending back information on 100 million Americans.""
Mnuchin said he and U.S. congressional leaders ""all agree there has to be a change."" He added that Trump could ""either force a sale or the president can block the app using (International Emergency Economic Powers Ac).""
U.S. officials have said TikTok under its Chinese parent poses a national risk because of the personal data it handles.
Reuters reported on Saturday that ByteDance, in a bid to save a deal with the White House, agreed to divest the U.S. operations of TikTok completely.
ByteDance was previously seeking to keep a minority stake in the U.S. business of TikTok, which the White House had rejected. Under the new proposed deal, ByteDance would exit completely and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) would take over TikTok in the United States, according to sources.
Republican Senator Marco Rubio on Sunday said on Twitter ""if the company & data can be purchased & secured by a trusted U.S. company that would be a positive & acceptable outcome.""
On Saturday, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) said the ""right answer"" to address security concerns about TikTok would be to ""have an American company like Microsoft take over TikTok. Win-win. Keeps competition alive and data out of the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.""

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News on Sunday that Trump ""will take action in the coming days with respect to a broad array of national security risks that are presented by software connected to the Chinese Communist Party.""

(Reuters) - U.S. online prescription drug price marketplace GoodRx Inc has submitted paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a potential initial public offering, according to people familiar with the matter. 
GoodRx, which was valued at $2.8 billion in 2018 when private equity firm Silver Lake invested in the company, is in the process of hiring advisers for the IPO, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the preparations are confidential. 
The listing could come later this year or early in 2021, one of the sources added, noting that the plans were subject to market conditions.
GoodRx did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Founded by Doug Hirsch and Trevor Bezdek in 2011, GoodRx gathers information for more than 70,000 U.S. pharmacies to track drug prices and offer coupons to consumers for discounts. It makes money by charging fees to partnering pharmacy benefits managers.
The Santa Monica, California-based company's website is used by more than 10 million Americans every month, according to GoodRx. Last year, it expanded into telemedicine by acquiring HeyDoctor LLC. 
In June, GoodRx appointed Karsten Voermann as chief financial officer and Bansi Nagji as president for healthcare. 
Besides Silver Lake, other investors in GoodRx include buyout firms Francisco Partners and Spectrum Equity. Its competitors include prescription drug savings app SingleCare and online coupon provider RetailMeNot Inc's RxSaver.

402,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>",U.S. companies leap over low profit hurdle in coronavirus-hit quarter,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A record high percentage of U.S. companies are beating analysts' forecasts this earnings season, giving investors a glimmer of hope in what is still expected to be the slowest profit period since the financial crisis.
More than halfway through second-quarter earnings, 82.1% of companies reporting have surpassed profit expectations, which would be the highest in the history of Refinitiv IBES data going back to 1994.
What's more, the size of the beats is well above what is typical. S&P 500 companies have beaten earnings expectations by a whopping 21.7%, also set to be the highest on record since 1994, based on Refinitiv's data as of Friday.
The latest big boost to numbers came late last week, when results from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and trillion-dollar market value companies Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) surpassed forecasts.
In many cases, estimates had been lowered so much ahead of earnings season that they were easier to beat, strategists said. Still, the results bolster the case for investors betting that the impact of coronavirus-led lockdowns and layoffs on companies' bottom lines may not be quite as dire as previously believed.
""What it's saying is there are pockets of absolute strength in corporate America,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.
Tech results in particular suggest ""there is spending going on globally,"" she said.
The S&P 500 is up nearly 4% since results began in mid-July, putting it 3.4% from its February record closing high.
To be sure, the pace of the market's rebound off the March lows has slowed in recent weeks, with earnings coming in as the United States sees a resurgence in virus cases in many areas and economic numbers remain bleak. 
Second-quarter S&P 500 earnings - expected to have dropped 33.8% from a year ago - are still set to be the low point for earnings this year and the biggest quarterly decline since the financial crisis.
Data on Thursday showed jobless claims rose last week, while the economy took its biggest hit on record in the second quarter. 
Strategists at BofA Global Research wrote in a recent note that while margins are ""tracking a hair above expectations,"" they are still expected to collapse and comments from companies suggest more job cuts ahead.
Still, some companies have managed better-than-expected results for the second quarter. 
Investors have been particularly keen to hear from technology companies, the most heavily weighted sector in S&P 500 earnings. 
With results in so far from 36 of the 71 tech companies in the S&P 500, second-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 tech sector now are seen growing 1.4% from a year ago versus an 8% decline estimated on July 1, Refinitiv's data shows.
The S&P's healthcare index has also seen big improvements since July 1, thanks to strong results from UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), drugmakers like  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and others. Analysts now expect healthcare earnings to have increased 1.1% compared with a 15.1% decline forecast at the start of July, according to Refinitiv.
""The second quarter of 2020 was a quarter with more uncertainty in it than I have ever seen in my life. Managements for the most part suspended guidance, so had the world kind of flying blind as to what the second quarter would bring,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.

And, ""it's brought results that are generally better than the worst imaginable. ... Things are a little bit more positive than many people thought.""

MUNICH/BERLIN (Reuters) - German health group  Siemens  Healthineers (DE:SHLG) said on Sunday it was buying  Varian Medical  Systems Inc (N:VAR) of the United States for $16.4 billion in a deal that seeks to create the global leader in cancer care solutions.
The deal is the first major growth move by Healthineers since it was spun off and floated in 2018 by Siemens (DE:SIEGn), which is undertaking a broader shakeup of its conglomerate structure to create room for its business units to do their own deals.
Siemens, which will retain control over Healthineers, will provide bridge financing for the deal that will be partly refinanced by a rights issue by the medical technology unit later this year.
Under the agreed transaction, Healthineers will acquire all shares in Varian for $177.50 each in cash, representing a 24% premium to the U.S. company's closing price on Friday and 42% above its 30-day weighted average.
""With this takeover, we are significantly strengthening our position - in addition to cardiology and neurology - in the field of oncology,"" Chief Financial Officer Jochen Schmitz told Reuters in an interview.
CEO Bernd Montag rejected suggestions that Healthineers had overpaid for Varian. ""This is an icon in our industry,"" he told reporters on a conference call. ""If you put it into perspective we achieved a sensible price.""
Through the deal to buy Varian, Healthineers acquires the leader in radiation therapy with a market share of over 50%.
Healthineers highlighted a long-term rise in the incidence of cancer - from 14 million cases worldwide in 2010 to a forecast 25 million in 2030. 
That translates into an addressable market of $20 billion that is forecast to grow at an annual rate of between 6% and 10%, the company said in a presentation on the deal.
The transaction, first reported by Bloomberg, is subject to approval by Varian shareholders and regulators. It is expected to close in the first half of 2021 and be accretive to Siemens Healthineers' adjusted basic earnings per share within 12 months of that.
""With Siemens Healthineers, we will transform care for a greater number of patients worldwide, as well as broaden opportunities for our employees as part of a larger and more global organization,"" Varian President and Chief Executive Officer Dow Wilson said. 
BALANCE SHEET SUPPORT
Conglomerate Siemens is effectively putting its balance sheet to work to fund the deal, providing a bridging loan of 15.2 billion euros ($17.9 billion) to Healthineers.
The medical technology unit aims to replace 50% of that through a rights issue this year, subject to market conditions.
Siemens said in a statement that it expressly welcomed the deal and would raise the money for the bridging loan by issuing bonds. It will not participate in the rights issue, meaning its stake in Healthineers will be diluted to about 72% from 85%.
Siemens aims to maintain its A+ debt ratings, which put it firmly in investment grade.
Healthineers also pre-released fiscal third quarter results instead of on Monday due to the acquisition announcement. They showed its revenue declined 6.9% year-on-year on a comparable basis to 3.3 billion euros due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Its adjusted operating margin was 13.9%, down 1.2 percentage points from the same period a year earlier, while adjusted basic earnings per share fell 21% to 30 euro cents.

The company said it expects revenue to be flat in fiscal 2020 while adjusted basic earnings per share are seen at between 1.54 and 1.62 euros, compared to 1.70 euros last year, assuming the business environment does not deteriorate further.

On Saturday, the company said some of its representatives were being investigated by market regulator Consob, without naming them. 
Tax police had searched its headquarters and taken documents, it said, denying the allegation - which touches on its planned tie-up with larger rival Generali (MI:GASI) - and adding that it was ready to fully cooperate with authorities..
Chairman Paolo Bedoni, Managing Director Carlo Ferraresi and Board Secretary Alessandro Lai were the three representatives in question, the source said on Sunday.
None of the three were immediately available for comment.
Cattolica said on Saturday that the three shareholder meetings under investigation included one held on Friday, at which investors approved Cattolica's conversion into a joint-stock company, paving the way for the Generali tie-up.
Resolutions approved at that meeting were ""valid for all intents and purposes"" and the operation with Generali ""will continue as planned"", it added. 
The other two meetings were held in June this year and April last year.
Ferraresi last year was granted CEO powers, when former Chief Executive Alberto Minali was forced to stand down.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - As Hong Kong's stock market prepares for billions of dollars in sales of new shares, global fund managers have a big challenge - competing with the city's army of mom-and-pop investors for a slice of the pie.
Record participation by retail investors in a recent Hong Kong initial public offering and sky-high demand in some other IPOs has forced big investors to hold onto newly listed shares.
Under IPO rules in Hong Kong - which competes fiercely with New York and London to attract global listings - a deluge of orders from retail investors reduces the portion that fund managers can buy.
This recent competition from individual investors has forced a growing number of funds to become ""cornerstone"" investors: they get priority before a deal launches but most hold the shares for at least six months.
Chinese biotech company  Ocumension Therapeutics  (HK:1477) set a record this month for an IPO over HK$500 million ($65 million) when the retail portion was nearly 1,900 times oversubscribed, according to stock exchange data.
Retail investors were initially to be allotted 10% of the $184 million offering, but Hong Kong's ""clawback"" rule, which kicks in when the retail portion of an IPO is heavily oversubscribed, bumped that up to 50%.
""Strong retail demand is the key reason we see more and more institutional investors willing to consider becoming a cornerstone investor,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) managing director Cathy Zhang, who worked on the Ocumension deal.
Ocumension shares popped to $HK37 in early trading from an initial $HK14.66. It closed on Friday at $HK29.45.
Hong Kong has among the highest retail trading levels in the world, and an OECD study last year estimated that individual investors owned 30% of the market - far above 11% in the United States and 16% in Britain.
Bankers say while Asian IPOs have seen strong retail interest, the levels do not eclipse Hong Kong - in Seoul, SK Biopharmaceuticals' $791 million share sale in June saw 323 times retail oversubscription rate, according to local media.
In Europe, bankers saw an uptick in individual interest in IPOs recently, but most of the retail activity has been in secondary trading and through exchange-traded funds and index trackers.
Hong Kong's high retail demand risks over-valuing companies, such as biotech startups, when they come to market, bankers say.
""It is a consensus among institutional investors that valuation for the majority of the biotech companies listing in Hong Kong are stretched,"" according to Aequitas Research co-founder Ke Yan, who publishes on the SmartKarma platform.
Strong recent listing performances by biotech firms is also helping to lure Hong Kong retail shareholders.
Ocumension rose 154% on its first day and Peijia Medical, which was 1,184 times oversubscribed, gained 68% on its market debut, Refinitiv data show.
Hong Kong Institute of Investors chairman Ricky Tam said the city's retail investors are being enticed by jumps in stock prices on the first day of trading.
""A lot of investors don't know the details of the companies, they only want to know if an IPO is going to perform well or not,"" he said.
Massive retail demand for Hong Kong IPOs has been driven by ""very, very low"" interest rates and should continue, said brokerage UOB Kay Hian executive director Steven Leung.

""Whenever there is a hot deal with a good story, lots of investors, retails, institutions, hedge funds rush to participate,"" Leung said.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China's ByteDance has agreed to divest the U.S. operations of TikTok completely in a bid to save a deal with the White House, after President Donald Trump said on Friday he had decided to ban the popular short-video app, two people familiar with the matter said on Saturday. 
U.S. officials have said TikTok under its Chinese parent poses a national risk because of the personal data it handles. ByteDance's concession will test whether Trump's threat to ban TikTok is a negotiating tactic, or whether he is intent on cracking down on a social media app that boasts it has 100 million users in the United States. 
Trump told reporters onboard Air Force One late on Friday that he would issue an order for TikTok to be banned in the United States as early as Saturday. ""Not the deal that you have been hearing about, that they are going to buy and sell... We are not an M&A (mergers and acquisitions) country,"" Trump said.
Late on Saturday, Peter Navarro, director of the White House's office of trade and manufacturing policy, told Fox News that Trump would be taking action on TikTok on Sunday or Monday. 
ByteDance was previously seeking to keep a minority stake in the U.S. business of TikTok, which the White House had rejected. Under the new proposed deal, ByteDance would exit completely and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) would take over TikTok in the United States, the sources said. 
Some ByteDance investors that are based in the United States may be given the opportunity to take minority stakes in the business, the sources added. About 70% of ByteDance's outside investors come from the United States.
""The administration has very serious national security concerns over TikTok. We continue to evaluate future policy,"" the White House said in a statement, declining to comment on whether Trump would accept ByteDance's concession. ByteDance in Beijing did not respond to a request for comment.
""We are here for the long run. Continue to share your voice here and let's stand for TikTok,"" TikTok U.S. general manager Vanessa Pappas said in a video published on the app on Saturday.
Under ByteDance's new proposal, Microsoft, which also owns professional social media network LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD), will be in charge of protecting all of TikTok's U.S. user data, the sources said. The plan allows for a U.S. company other than Microsoft to take over TikTok in the United States, the sources added.
""What's the right answer? Have an American company like Microsoft take over TikTok. Win-win. Keeps competition alive and data out of the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,"" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) wrote on Twitter on Saturday.
Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment.
As relations between the United States and China deteriorate over trade, Hong Kong's autonomy, cyber security and the spread of the novel coronavirus, TikTok has emerged as a flashpoint in the dispute between the world's two largest economies.
ByteDance has been considering a range of options for TikTok amid U.S. pressure to relinquish control of the app, which allows users to create short videos with special effects and has become wildly popular with U.S. teenagers.
ByteDance had received a proposal from some of its investors, including Sequoia and General Atlantic, to transfer majority ownership of TikTok to them, Reuters reported on Wednesday. The proposal valued TikTok at about $50 billion, but some ByteDance executives believe the app is worth more than that.
ByteDance acquired Shanghai-based video app Musical.ly in a $1 billion deal in 2017 and relaunched it as TikTok the following year. ByteDance did not seek approval for the acquisition from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews deals for potential national security risks. Reuters reported last year that CFIUS had opened an investigation into TikTok.
APP SCRUTINY
The United States has been increasingly scrutinizing app developers over the personal data they handle, especially if some of it involves U.S. military or intelligence personnel. Ordering the divestment of TikTok would not be the first time the White House has taken action over such concerns.
Earlier this year, Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd sold Grindr LLC, a popular gay dating app it bought in 2016, for $620 million after being ordered by CFIUS to divest.
In 2018, CFIUS forced China's Ant Financial to scrap plans to buy MoneyGram International Inc over concerns about the safety of data that could identify U.S. citizens.
ByteDance was valued at as much as $140 billion earlier this year when one of its shareholders, Cheetah Mobile (NYSE:CMCM), sold a small stake in a private deal, Reuters has reported. The startup's investors include Japan's SoftBank Group Corp.

The bulk of ByteDance's revenue comes from advertising on apps under its Chinese operations including Douyin - a Chinese version of TikTok - and news aggregator app Jinri Toutiao, as well as video-streaming app Xigua and Pipixia, an app for jokes and humorous videos.

411,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2020 05:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Eastman Kodak top executive got Trump deal windfall on an 'understanding',"By Jessica DiNapoli and Tom Bergin
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Eastman Kodak Co (N:KODK) on Monday granted its executive chairman options for 1.75 million shares as the result of what a person familiar with the arrangement described as an ""understanding"" with its board that had previously neither been listed in his employment contract nor made public.
One day later, the administration of President Donald Trump announced a $765 million financing deal with Eastman Kodak, and in the days that followed the stock soared, making those additional options now held by executive chairman Jim Continenza worth tens of millions.
The decision to grant Continenza options was never formalized or made into a binding agreement, which is why it was not disclosed previously, according to the person familiar with the arrangement. The options were granted to shield Continenza's overall stake in the company from being diluted by a $100 million convertible bond deal clinched in May 2019 to help Eastman Kodak stay afloat, according to the person's account.
While Kodak's approach is permissible, it is unusual because executives are paid to grow a company's long-term value and are not usually given extra compensation personally to cover events that may hurt share prices, several experts said.
Kodak disclosed the stock options award to Continenza in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which was previously reported. But the person familiar with the arrangement told Reuters that the transaction occurred because of the understanding with the board. 
That arrangement reported by Reuters for the first time sheds new light on Eastman Kodak's handling of the unexpected windfall for its top executives. 
An Eastman Kodak spokeswoman said that Continenza had no comment. The spokeswoman said the gains reflected by the rise in the share price are only on paper: Continenza, she said, ""is a strong believer in the future of the company, and has never sold a single share of stock."" 
Prior to this week's financing deal, the company warned investors it was at risk of not continuing as a going concern, but it was boosted by the agreement with the Trump administration on Tuesday to supply drug ingredients.
As a result, Continenza's gains at the end of this week amounted to about $83 million following a roughly 10-fold increase in Eastman Kodak's stock, compared to the approximately $53 million in gains he would have seen were it not for the additional options, according to a Reuters analysis of company filings. 
Roughly 29% of the options Continenza received on Monday vested immediately, giving him the right to cash them out as soon as possible.

While most corporate boards and their committees have wide latitude in awarding options, three corporate governance experts interviewed by Reuters said the move to mitigate the impact of dilution on Continenza's stake in the company without a prior contractual obligation was unusual.
""The compensation committee's job is not to protect the CEO from every adverse effect on the stock price,"" said Sanjai Bhagat, a finance professor at the University of Colorado. ""It's to get the CEO to think about long-term value.""
A fourth expert, Robin Ferracone, chief executive of compensation consultant Farient Advisors, said the company may have offered the prospect of additional options to executives as they worked toward the convertible bond offering -- to avoid them being ""disincentivized"" to seal a deal that would help the firm but potentially water down their holdings.
The additional options awarded to Continenza, a former telecommunications executive, were approved by the board's compensation committee on Monday, the spokeswoman said. Shareholders had voted in May of this year to increase the shares available for executive compensation.
""The issue is the board wanted to make sure the CEO had the same economic alignment as was contemplated when he took the job,"" said a person close to the company. 
The company's market capitalization jumped from a little over $100 million at the start of the week to almost $1 billion by Friday following the deal.
Eastman Kodak also granted options on Monday to three other executives, worth $712,000 each, according to regulatory filings. Kodak declined to comment on the reason for these awards. 
The company has struggled to reinvent itself from a flagging camera company after emerging from bankruptcy in 2013. Its selection by the U.S. government for the production of key pharmaceutical ingredients surprised many industry analysts who expected such a deal to go to a major generic drug maker. 
The government's U.S. International Development Finance Corporation released a July 28 statement quoting Continenza as saying: ""Kodak will play a critical role in the return of a reliable American pharmaceutical supply chain.""

President Trump, too, hailed the development. ""I want to congratulate the people in Kodak,"" he said at a press briefing. ""They’ve been working very hard.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - LATAM Airlines (SN:LTM) will fire ""at least"" 2,700 workers in Brazil, including pilots, its Brazilian arm said on Saturday, as the bankrupt carrier struggles to cut costs and cope with an industry collapse due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In a statement, LATAM Brasil said it opened a voluntary redundancy process on Friday which will run through Aug. 4, after which a further minimum 2,700 jobs will be cut.
The announcement followed the breakdown in talks with the SNA union over workers' pay, the statement said. O Globo and O Estado de S. Paulo newspapers had reported the redundancies earlier on Saturday. LATAM said it pays its pilots and crew more than its rivals in Brazil, and the pandemic has forced it to ""match industry practices.""

The layoffs are the latest in efforts to downsize Latin America's largest airline. Before the novel coronavirus outbreak, the airline had 43,000 workers worldwide, with most of them in Brazil and Chile. LATAM is seeking to restructure $18 billion in debt. When it filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection in May, it was the world's largest airline to date to seek an emergency reorganization due to the pandemic.

416,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>","Wall Street Week Ahead: After monster rally, investors cautious as U.S. recovery wobbles","By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are preparing their portfolios for a potentially rocky patch in U.S. stocks, worried that a dramatic rebound in equities may stall amid dimming economic data and rising political uncertainty. 
Most money managers are wary of cutting equity exposure too drastically in a market that has rallied more than 40% since late March and stands near all-time highs despite widespread economic devastation and a global coronavirus pandemic. 
Still, the continued divergence between stocks and the real economy has worried some investors. U.S. growth took its worst hit on record in the second quarter, while more recent data points to fading consumer confidence and jobless claims back on the rise. The S&P 500 (SPX), meanwhile, stands some 4% below all-time highs, though its weekly advances have grown progressively smaller in July. 
That disconnect is pushing some investors to beef up cash positions or tilt their portfolios toward Europe, where economic prospects appear to be brighter than in the United States.
The performance of options strategies designed to profit in sideways markets - such as the ""iron condor,"" which involves long and short positions on both calls and puts - has also improved. The iron condor strategy has drawn controversy and prompted investigation by some legal firms following its poor performance during sharp sell-offs, such as in December 2018.
""The longer (economic weakness) persists, the more permanent the structural damage becomes,"" said Michael Hans, chief investment officer at Clarfield Citizens Private Wealth in Tarrytown, New York. ""For the moment, a range-bound scenario makes sense.""
Concerns over the U.S. presidential election are also mounting. On Thursday, President Donald Trump suggested on Twitter that the Nov. 3 vote be delayed, though he has no direct authority to do so.
Net outflows from equity funds were $1.8 billion in the fourth week of July, while bond funds took in $17.2 billion and money market funds received $5.5 billion, according to EPFR.
Market participants hope the Labor Department's July payrolls report, due next Friday, will shed more light on the state of the recovery. 
Some investors who have racked up big gains during the equity rally of the last few months are now turning cautious. 
Eric Marshall, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital in Dallas, has sold some of the stocks he purchased earlier in the year and added to cash positions, convinced that rewards have diminished for buying even the most beaten-down shares. 
""We've taken profits, and we've been very slow to redeploy that money back,"" he said.
Uncertainty over the near-term outlook for equities and Treasury yields near record lows have prompted Charles Day, a private wealth manager at UBS in New York, to raise cash holdings to between 5% to 10% in the portfolios he manages. 
""Normally the safe-haven money would be on the fixed-income side, but having some cash for a while seems to be prudent to me,"" he said.
Others see greater opportunities in European stocks than in U.S. equities, in part because of the region's lighter COVID-19 caseload.
Ben Kirby (NYSE:KEX), co-head of investments at Thornburg Investment Management, recently added Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn) to his portfolio, betting the company will benefit from a sustained shift to remote work.
""As the S&P has been rallying, we've been reducing our exposure to domestic stocks,"" Kirby said. ""Europe is looking increasingly resilient.""
Range-bound U.S. stocks could still be lucrative for some investors, however.
Choppy trading in U.S. stocks has helped keep the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) above its long-term average even though shares overall have moved minimally, strategists say. 
That is a favorable environment for short-volatility strategies, said Stacey Gilbert, portfolio manager for derivatives at Glenmede Investment Management in Philadelphia. Option sellers expect to collect income when expectations for market gyrations remain high but actual moves are more muted.
Likewise, an index that tracks the S&P 500 ""iron condor"" options strategy (CNDR) - which profits in range-bound markets and had been badly hit this year - is set to post its first monthly gain since last October.
""Many people think that the recovery has mostly done what it's going to do"" for now, said Mike Zigmont, head of trading and research at Harvest Volatility Management, which specializes in iron-condor strategies. ""There's not much upside, but there's not much downside left, either.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) Taiwan contract manufacturers Foxconn (TW:2317),  Wistron Corp  (TW:3231) and  Pegatron  Corp (TW:4938) have applied for funds from India's $6.65 billion scheme to boost smartphone manufacturing, the technology minister said on Saturday.
The production-linked incentive (PLI) plan offers companies cash incentives on additional sales of devices made locally over five years, with 2019-2020 as the base year. India wants to become a global smartphone export hub like China.
Apple assembles some smartphones, including the iPhone 11, at Foxconn and Wistron's plants in two southern Indian states.
Pegatron, one of Apple's top suppliers, has yet to open a plant in India, but is in talks with various states to set up operations, according to sources. Pegatron officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
South Korea's Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd (KS:005930) has also applied for incentives under the plan, technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told a news conference.
Samsung has a plant on the outskirts of New Delhi that it describes as the world's biggest mobile phone manufacturing plant. It also exports devices from the factory.
Lava, which once assembled models for China's Lenovo (HK:0992), was among the Indian companies which have sought funds, Prasad added.
A total of 22 firms have applied to the scheme, which the government expects will generate smartphone production worth $154 billion and create 300,000 direct jobs over five years.
Smartphone production has emerged as a bright spot in India's economy, thanks to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's emphasis on local manufacturing in a bid to create jobs.
With more than 1 billion wireless subscribers, of which about a third rely on basic handsets, India provides huge growth prospects for smartphone makers, as well as offering cheap labour.

Foxconn plans to invest up to $1 billion to expand a factory in Tamil Nadu state where it assembles iPhones, sources told Reuters last month.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya Airways (NR:KQNA) resumed international flights on Saturday, heading to about 30 destinations for the first time since the routes were suspended in March due to the coronavirus.
The carrier, in which Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) holds a small stake, resumed domestic flights in mid-July after the government cleared local air travel.
""We announced we are starting with 27 destinations, we increased it to 30 just following demand,"" Allan Kilavuka, the airline's chief executive officer, said during a ceremony ahead of seeing off a flight to London.
He said for the rest of the year the airline expected demand to remain below 50% of capacity, but it would increase flight frequencies depending on demand.
""In fact 2020, we call it a lost year. Because at some point we even see demand of 25% in some months, in some months we see 38%,"" he later told Reuters.
The COVID-19 pandemic has depressed the global aviation industry, with African carriers alone expected to lose $6 billion this year in revenue.
In July, Kenya Airways said it would lay off an unspecified number of number of workers, reduce its network and offload some assets due to the coronavirus crisis.
Kilavuka said so far the company had laid off some 650 people, mostly trainee pilots, trainee cabin crew, technician trainees and newly hired staff on probation.
""What I have to emphasise though is it's not because we want to. Those employees have done nothing wrong. They are very good employees. It's just that we cannot afford to keep them,"" he said.
The airline was struggling long before the coronavirus outbreak, posting 2019 losses of almost 13 billion shillings ($120 million).
Last month the Nairobi Securities Exchange suspended trading of Kenya Airways shares for three months, citing the government's plan to restructure the carrier, after it submitted to parliament a draft law on nationalising the airline.

The takedowns come amid a crackdown on unlicensed games by Chinese authorities.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this year Apple gave game publishers an end-of-June deadline to submit a government-issued licence number enabling users to make in-app purchases.
China's Android app stores have long complied with those regulations. It is not clear why Apple is enforcing them strictly this year.
The smartphone maker removed more than 2,500 titles from its app store over the first week of July. Games affected by the sweep included titles from Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) and Supercell, research firm SensorTower reported at the time.
The Chinese government has long sought to enforce stricter regulations on its gaming industry to remove sensitive content.
The approval process for games looking to enable in-app purchases is long and complicated, hurting all but the largest game developers, industry insiders say.
""This affects small- and mid-sized developers' incomes the most, but due to the difficulties of acquiring a business licence, it's devastating to the whole iOS game industry in China,"" said Todd Kuhns, marketing manager for AppInChina, a firm that helps overseas companies distribute their apps.

421,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 01, 2020 06:58AM ET</span>",Point/Counterpoint: The Case for Spotify,"By Geoffrey Smith and Peter Nurse
Investing.com --  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) faces a reckoning.
The music streaming service, which debuted on NYSE in 2018, has been adding users at a torrid pace, forecasting growth in average monthly users for the fourth quarter at roughly 25% above the last three months of 2019. With nearly 300 million users already, it is still poised for growth as it enters new global markets such as Eastern Europe and expands its offerings beyond music to podcasts.
But Spotify also faces competitive challenges from Big Tech: Amazon, Apple and Google are all getting in the music streaming business. Profit has been elusive, and as a pure-play company, Spotify has less flexibility to compete against behemoth companies that can offer audio streaming on slim to no margins. 
Investing.com's Geoffrey Smith argues the case in favor of investing in Spotify, while Peter Nurse explains why investors should be cautious. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Bull Case
Forget the lack of profits. Or at least, reconsider the importance you attach to them in the near term. Spotify is still a company with a compelling growth story.
Monthly average users are still growing at around 30% year-on-year. Last week, the company predicted sequential quarterly user growth of 5% and 7% for the rest of the year. The midpoint of the company’s forecast for Q4 is still 25% above the final quarter of 2019.
At a time when the pandemic is forcing investors to differentiate much more sharply between those companies with a future and those without, Spotify is clearly in the former bracket. Multiple expansion, to borrow Donald Trump’s reference to the Covid-19 virus, “is what it is.”  
In any case, much of the widening of its loss in the second quarter was an accounting issue arising from the sharp rise in its share price in the quarter, rather than any lasting operational issue. Gross margins improved during the quarter.
The underlying business is clearly going to be in demand for a long time yet, even at a higher price point. Its 299 million users are already a lot, but they are still only a fraction of the global addressable market (Spotify is only now, for example, launching in eastern Europe, gaining access to 250 million more potential customers).  
The company’s churn rate is also improving as it mines a rich seam with its Family and Duo plans. For every additional user on the plan, the disincentive so switch suppliers grows and the cost of gaining each new subscriber – a key metric for the company – falls.
Moreover, of that 299 million, only one in five has ever listened to a podcast, according to the company’s latest estimates. In other words, Spotify still has scope to substitute many of the services offered by radio for the last 100 years, be it news, documentaries, or – as with the hotly anticipated Joe Rogan podcast debut in September – comedy.  Its ability to serve ads against all that content may be crimped in the short term by the fall in ad budgets worldwide, but it has an obvious opportunity for advertisers who have vowed to stay off Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for the next few months.
And looking at the longer term, it’s easy to see the increasing concern at Big Tech’s stranglehold on the economy as a win-win for the company. If Congress breaks up rivals such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), then the playing field is leveled in Spotify’s favor. If it chooses to wave through the creation of digital monopolies, then the attractiveness of such a formidable content aggregator as a potential bid target for one of the major platforms will only increase.
The Bear Case
Spotify has been one of the Wall Street darlings since its flotation on the New York Stock Exchange in early 2018.
The music streaming company has managed to pull in nearly 300 million monthly active users, including 138 million paying subscribers, prompting share price gains of over 70% year-to-date.
However, the music surrounding this company going forward may well be less sweet.
As Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris put it as he downgraded its investment stance on the company to sell earlier this week, ""the market is now pricing shares for blue-sky growth, which has made the risk-reward unattractive.""
The main problem is Spotify is not making money. It’s tough for streaming music companies to make a profit because of high royalty rates owed to music publishers.
Rivals like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple can operate their streaming music services at near break-even levels or even as loss leaders. As more of a ""pure play"" in the space, Spotify doesn't have that ability to the same extent.
After flirting with the black in the third quarter of 2019, the company has posted operating losses ever since, including a loss of 167 million euros in the second quarter of this year, released earlier this week. 
The outlook isn’t much better. The company’s own figures predict an operating loss of between 70 million and 150 million euros in the third quarter, and a loss of between 45 million and 145 million euros in the year’s final quarter.
It’s true Spotify has been very good at attracting new subscribers to its platform--adding 8 million paid subscribers in the second quarter alone. But the amount those new customers are paying, on average, has fallen considerably over the last few years. Premium subscribers paid just 4.41 euros per month on average in the second quarter. Three years ago, Spotify was reaping in 5.53 euros  during the same period.
Spotify has tried to counter the “pure play” issue by investing in original podcasts, including signing big names such as American comedian Joe Rogan. The hope being that it becomes more like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), a subscription service with high-value exclusive content. 
However, Morris expects competition for podcast content and distribution to intensify over the next 12 months, particularly from Amazon and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which could negatively impact sentiment from the current highly-positive levels implied in the share price.
Spotify has performed well since its listing, but facing competitors like Apple, Google, Amazon and Netflix will be difficult going forward and it is currently priced for perfection."

""Basically, like in the automotive industry, we want to be 2-3% more efficient every year,"" he told Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft.
With costs of around 17 billion Swiss francs ($18.63 billion), this meant around 400 million francs in annual savings, he said after Credit Suisse announced an overhaul of its investment bank and beat profit forecasts in its results on Thursday.
""We look at where there are duplicates and inefficiencies that can be remedied without compromising,"" said Gottstein, citing the example of merging the risk and compliance functions.
The rest of the savings would come from other group-wide functions, as well as its business in wealth management, Asia, and reducing the branch network in Switzerland.
""With higher digitisation and automated processes, we can basically get even more out of it. However, we will reinvest all of these savings in the business,"" said Gottstein, who took over as CEO from Tidjane Thiam in February.
Looking ahead, Gottstein said the bank's M&A business was only seeing a slow pick-up in activity, but he expected high market volatility to continue which was good for the bank's trading business.
""I am also convinced that the capital market will continue to be active. Companies have to refinance themselves, many through capital increases,"" he told the newspaper.
""And as far as private banking is concerned, we were able to increase sales in the first half of the year by 4% and even currency-adjusted by 7%, which is very solid in this environment. So I'm a little more optimistic here.""

The airline said in an email to Reuters on Saturday it is looking at different ways to reduce costs in the medium term, given reduced passenger demand with no immediate signs of improvement. The retirement plan was first reported in local media.
Cathay has already taken short-term measures including executive pay cuts and two rounds of voluntary special leave scheme.
Pilots aged 50 or 55 and above, depending on the retirement age outlined in their contract as 55 or 65 respectively, are eligible to apply for the early retirement scheme, the carrier said. Pilots aged 58 and above at its regional arm Cathay Dragon are also eligible.
""The decision comes after careful consideration and is an effective way for the Group to manage costs. Addressing a specific group of employees for this dedicated scheme helps us adjust to the new operating environment,"" the carrier said.
The scheme will pay pilots who retire early three months basic salary for each year remaining before their normal retirement age, plus a further one month allowance payment up to a maximum of 12 months' basic salary.
Cathay said management is doing a comprehensive review of all aspects of the group's operations, and it will make recommendations to the board on the future size and shape of the airline by the fourth quarter.
The group was looking to cut costs, streamline marketing, consolidate pilot contracts and move veteran pilots to cheaper contracts, sources have told Reuters.
Cathay last month warned it expected to report a HK$9.9 billion ($1.28 billion) loss for the six months ending June 30, including impairment charges on 16 planes. The estimated loss would be Cathay's biggest half-yearly loss in at least a decade

Britain's death toll from COVID-19 is over 55,000 when deaths from suspected cases are included, and it has the highest ""excess death"" rate in Europe.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday postponed a planned easing of the coronavirus lockdown in England after a rise in infections amplified fears of a second deadly surge in COVID-19 cases.
Britain reported 846 new cases on Thursday, the highest daily number in over a month.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) could re-energize its advertising business with a huge supply of video if it follows through on acquiring TikTok's U.S. operations from ByteDance.
Reuters reported on Friday, citing a source familiar with the matter, that Microsoft is in exploratory deal talks as the U.S. government prepares to force China-based ByteDance to divest its video app TikTok over data security concerns.
Microsoft generates the bulk of its $143 billion in annual revenue by licensing software such as Windows and Office as well as cloud storage and computing tools through its Azure service.
The company, with advertising supported businesses including its Bing search engine, MSN news service and LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) business social network, disclosed this month that its search ads sales grew 1% to $7.7 billion over the last year. But that growth was flat when excluding fees it pays to partner websites and apps.
The ad market research company eMarketer has estimated LinkedIn's ad revenue at about $2 billion annually in the United States alone. But Microsoft also said this month LinkedIn ads sales have fallen this year as the novel coronavirus pandemic prompted advertisers to pare spending.
Social media services, including  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) YouTube, have seen their sales growth continue during the pandemic as users spend more time entertaining themselves online - particularly with video - and advertisers follow them there.
Without an entertainment service aimed at a broad audience, Microsoft has struggled to capture the increasingly lucrative videos flowing to YouTube, Facebook and more recently TikTok, which widely opened its ad tools this month.
Increased U.S. regulatory scrutiny of potentially anticompetitive behavior by Facebook and YouTube have likely diminished their ability to purchase a major competitor soon, according to antitrust experts. Microsoft, though, faces fewer constraints.

""Its consumer strategy remains in flux and an aggressive acquisition (or strategic investment) of TikTok would be Microsoft throwing its hat in the ring and trying to compete with other tech giants in a new avenue of growth,"" Wedbush financial analyst Dan Ives said in a statement on Friday.

435,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 04:18PM ET</span>",Exxon Tears Up Growth Plan in Attempt to Defend Its Dividend,"(Bloomberg) --  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). is ripping up its debt-fueled, $30 billion-a-year plan to rebuild an aging worldwide portfolio after cash flow evaporated and threatened the company’s vaunted dividend.
The shift by the Western world’s premier oil explorer represents an about-face after more than two years of doing pretty much the opposite of the its biggest rivals, who have been been shrinking and looking to a future beyond fossil fuels. As recently as March, the Texas giant had pinned its future to huge capital spending on oil and natural gas at a time when rivals were shrinking and looking to a future beyond fossil fuels.
Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods’ plan was to lean on the company’s impeccable balance sheet to drill for gushers and still cover almost $15 billion in annual dividends. If cash flow fell short, Exxon’s stellar credit rating would allow it to borrow its way through lean times, or so the thinking went.
But the black swan event of a global pandemic that smashed energy demand amid a stubborn glut of crude overwhelmed Woods’ ambitions. Cash flow from operations fell to zero in the second quarter, Exxon disclosed Friday, and one of the CEO’s top lieutenants announced all bets were off.
The company is pursuing “significant potential” budget reductions and some managers may find themselves out of a job as a result, Senior Vice President Neil Chapman said during a conference call with analysts.
Those cuts would be in addition to ongoing efforts to trim its U.S. workforce by as much as 10% and a $10 billion scale-back in capital outlays announced in April.
Five Projects
More striking was Chapman’s announcement that work on Exxon’s five marquee developments -- deepwater oil in Guyana and Brazil, Permian Basin shale, gas exports from Mozambique and Papua New Guinea -- will all be curtailed or delayed.
Further Reading: Exxon’s Humbling Fall From Oil Juggernaut to Mediocre Company
Still, he rejected any suggestion that Exxon was undertaking a strategic shift. Rather, Exxon is prioritizing dividend coverage and protecting its balance sheet, said Chapman, one of three top executives who serve with Woods on the management committee that oversees day-to-day operations.
“I don’t think it’s a fundamental change,” Chapman said. “I think it’s a response to the short-term environment.”
Exxon is keenly sensitive to the fate of its dividend because 70% of the company’s shareholders are retail investors, he noted. Keeping that payout to shareholders is “something we take really, really seriously.”
Spending Plans
The commitment comes at a significant cost. Exxon already reduced its capital spending plan by about a third to around $23 billion three months ago as the pandemic panicked the world’s major economies. Next year’s outlays probably will shrink to $19 billion, Chapman indicated.
Though a major reversal for management, the scaled-down outlook may appease investors. The counter-cyclical growth strategy was never embraced by the market, with the stock plunging to a 15-year low even before the virus hit. Exxon had dropped out of the top 10 biggest companies in the S&P 500 Index for the first time in 2019 and lost its premium valuation over peers a year earlier.
Still, without so much money being spent on new projects, questions remain over how Exxon can mitigate its long-term production declines and how resilient its assets will be in an energy transition toward low-carbon fuels.
Rivals  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc and BP (NYSE:BP) Plc wrote down billions of dollars of assets in the past quarter because of the depressed price outlook. Exxon, famously resilient to writedowns, took no such charges.
November Meeting
The company is currently undergoing its annual, “very rigorous” process of reviewing the value of its assets and should present the results to the board by November, Chapman said. While Exxon doesn’t publish price forecasts, unlike European peers, Chapman said they’re “consistent with the range of third-party estimates.”
Exxon dropped 0.9% to $41.47 at 1:19 p.m. in New York, giving it a market value of $175 billion. That’s nearly $100 billion less than electric car manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.

436,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 03:16PM ET</span>",U.S. airlines making push for new round of payroll assistance,"By Tracy Rucinski and David Shepardson
CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major U.S. airlines are pressing U.S. lawmakers for a six-month extension of the $32 billion U.S. payroll support program for airlines, airports and contractors set to expire in September, warning that some flights may disappear otherwise and more jobs are at risk.
Southwest Airlines (N:LUV)Chief Executive Gary Kelly said in a video message to employees the company backs the effort.
""We’re in lockstep with our industry organization – Airlines For America – ... in support of the labor unions' efforts,"" Kelly said in the video, which was viewed by Reuters. ""I am personally involved in delivering that message to our federal leaders.""
Kelly also wants lawmakers to extend a ticket tax holiday and pass other tax breaks that give Americans incentives to travel ""because without customers and places and events for them to fly to -- we'll never punch our way out of this crisis.""
Airline industry executives have privately told lawmakers they may need to halt some flights because of depressed travel. The payroll funding required them to maintain minimum service levels through Sept. 30.
On Friday, American Airlines (O:UAL) subsidiary PSA warned that based on American's October schedule, it may need to furlough another 230 pilots and flight attendants on top of the 1,000 potential furloughs announced this month.
This week, 223 U.S. House lawmakers called for a six-month extension of the payroll aid program they called crucial to keeping hundreds of thousands of aviation workers employed through March 31.
Congress awarded $25 billion in payroll assistance to U.S. passenger airlines in March, along with $4 billion for cargo carriers and $3 billion for airport contractors. Most of the bailout funds do not have to be paid back.

When the first package was approved, large U.S. airlines hoped for demand to recover by October. But with a resurgent pandemic, airline executives warn demand is stalling again. Between American Airlines and United Airlines (O:UAL), more than 60,000 frontline workers have received warnings that their jobs are on the line.

The Irish carrier, Europe's largest budget airline, said it had begun the action to challenge what it described as the Irish government's ""ineffective"" green list of countries, for which a 14-day quarantine requirement does not apply.
Ireland has taken a more cautious approach to reopening its economy and skies than many European countries. The green list, announced on July 22, contained some popular destinations Ryanair flies to, such as Italy and Greece, but not others including Britain, France and Spain. 
This list is due to be reviewed next week and is unlikely to be enlarged.
Asked about reports of a potential challenge by Ryanair on Sunday, Deputy Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said the government would wait to see what case the airline made but that the advice from the authorities on travel was clear.
The Irish Independent newspaper reported that Ryanair would seek a judicial review and argue the list was not provided for in legislation and parliament was denied the opportunity to scrutinise it when it was put in place by way of public announcement.
IAG (L:ICAG), which owns Irish airline Aer Lingus, has joined as a notice party to the proceedings, meaning it could be heard in court argument, chief executive Willie Walsh told Irish national broadcaster RTE.
Irishman Walsh said he understand the need for the measures, but was challenging its blanket application.

Ryanair, IAG and easyJet (L:EZJ) launched a similar challenge against the British government last month, but said they would end the action after London scrapped its 14-day quarantine rule for travellers coming from some of the most popular tourist destinations.

439,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 02:25PM ET</span>","Canada says requirements for Huawei CFO's extradition to U.S. met, documents show","By Moira Warburton
(Reuters) - Canada's attorney general says the requirements for extraditing Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou to the United States on charges of bank fraud have been met, documents submitted in a British Columbia court show.
Meng, 48, was arrested in December, 2018, on a warrant from the United States, which alleges that she misled the bank HSBC (L:HSBA) about Huawei's business dealings in Iran.
Meng has been on house arrest in Vancouver since then, fighting extradition, and has said she is innocent. Her case has caused a diplomatic row between Canada and China, which has demanded that Meng be released. China detained two Canadians after Meng's arrest.
The documents, which were filed last week and released to media on Friday, are a precursor to the formal hearing on committal, or whether Meng should be extradited to the United States. Those hearings will take place in April 2021.
The documents outline the evidence in support of Meng's custody and conclude that the test for committal has been met.
The extradition hearings are not a full trial on the charges laid by the United States, the documents state, only whether there is the potential for those charges to be found valid.
""The evidence demonstrates that Ms. Meng deliberately made dishonest representations to HSBC in an attempt to preserve Huawei's relationship with the bank,"" lawyers for the Canadian Minister of Justice and Attorney General David Lametti wrote.
""Since Ms. Meng concedes that she is the person sought for prosecution for the conduct set out in the extradition request, all of the formal requirements for committal are established.""
Huawei declined to comment and pointed instead to its past legal submissions on its arguments.
In May, a judge in British Columbia's Superior Court found that the legal standard of double criminality - meaning that Meng's actions could be considered a crime in both Canada and the United States - had been met, dealing a blow to hopes for a quick end to the trial.
The next hearings, scheduled for Aug. 17-21 in Vancouver, will discuss whether the attorney general's assertion of privilege in declining to release some documents requested by Huawei relating to Meng's initial arrest is valid.

Hearings for the trial are scheduled to wrap up in April 2021, although the potential for appeals of the decision from either side means the case could drag out over several years.

The benchmark index is now about 4% shy of its February all-time high, but faltering macroeconomic data and rising COVID-19 cases in the U.S. are making investors cautious again.

The employee count Musk predicted in an interview with trade publication Automotive News would represent a 35% surge from the just over 48,000 employees that Tesla reported having at the end of 2019.
“We are hiring a lot of people,” Musk said.
Tesla managed to report its fourth straight quarterly profit earlier this month despite relatively stagnant revenue the last couple of years. Musk, 49, is trying to change that by expanding the company’s product portfolio and production footprint. A new plant near Shanghai helped buoy output while its California car factory was idled for an almost two-month period ending in mid-May.
Tesla has scores of job openings listed on its career page, including for a store leader in Singapore and a construction-safety manager in Austin, Texas, where the company has purchased land for a plant that will build the Cybertruck pickup.

(Reuters) - Shares of the so-called blank-check company merging with electric carmaker Fisker fell 20% on Friday after it disclosed it would not close a deal by the end of July to use Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) electric-vehicle platform for its vehicles.
 Spartan Energy Acquisition  Corp (N:SPAQ_u), backed by alternative investment manager Apollo Global Management Inc (N:APO), announced a deal this month to take Fisker public through a merger that valued the EV startup at $2.9 billion. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
A blank-check company, or SPAC, is a shell company that raises money through an initial public offering to buy an operating company, typically within two years.
Shares of Spartan were trading on Friday afternoon at $12.58, well below the highs of $23.86 when the deal was announced earlier this month. The stock is still above Spartan's IPO price of $10.
Fisker said at the time of the deal it was in talks with VW to use the German automaker's MEB EV platform to speed vehicle development and cut costs, but it disclosed the delay in documents filed on Friday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
""We have not achieved our goal of signing a cornerstone agreement with VW by the end of July 2020 as we previously anticipated,"" Fisker said in the filing. ""We look forward to continuing discussions with VW again in September after the traditional European summer holidays.""
""We remain in conversation with several other potential (automakers) and suppliers that would be able to fit within our unique business model and we believe will enable us to enter into definitive manufacturing and supply agreements before year-end,"" the company added.
The Spartan deal will provide Fisker with $1 billion in gross proceeds. Fisker said in the SEC filing that it will use those funds to launch its Ocean SUV by late 2022, followed by a super-sports sedan, a sports crossover and a pickup truck by 2025.
Fisker previously said it was in talks with other companies, including  Magna International Inc  (TO:MG), about building the SUV.

444,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>","Demand for Tesla vehicles remained strong during pandemic, Musk says","By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk said in a podcast released on Friday that demand for the company's electric vehicles remained strong throughout the coronavirus pandemic, with consumers preferring to shop online.
Musk, talking to Automotive News' Daily Drive podcast, said having a traditional dealer network - something he considered in the past - appears increasingly unnecessary.
""We saw strong orders through the whole pandemic, we still had a good order volume,"" Musk said. ""I guess people are less inclined to want to go to a dealership, do the test drive and hang out in the lobby and that kind of thing.""
Asked about a 2020 meteoric stock rally that has pushed Tesla shares up more than 240% from the start of the year and made the company the world's most highly-valued carmaker, Musk said the market would eventually sort itself out. He added that as long as Tesla made great cars, investors would be happy. 
In a May 1 tweet, Musk said Tesla's share price was ""too high,"" at a time when shares where trading at around $700 - roughly half of where they are now. Shares on Friday were down 2.2% at $1,454.
In the podcast interview, Musk also praised the Chinese work ethic and criticized U.S. attitudes.
""China rocks in my opinion,"" Musk said. ""There are a lot of smart, hard-working people and ... they're not entitled, they're not complacent, whereas I see in the United States increasingly much more complacency and entitlement.""

Tesla has built a factory in Shanghai and seen a sharp increase in Chinese demand for its Model 3 sedans. The company recently has also launched a hiring spree in Shanghai as it ramps up production and prepares to manufacture its new Model Y sport utility vehicle at the plant.

446,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 12:55PM ET</span>",Dominion takes $2.8 bln charge to exit Atlantic Coast natgas pipe,"By Scott DiSavino and Taru Jain
(Reuters) - U.S. energy company Dominion Energy Inc said on Friday it took a $2.8 billion charge in the second quarter related to the cancellation of the Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina.
Atlantic Coast was the most expensive U.S. gas pipeline under construction when Dominion and partner  Duke Energy  Corp (NYSE:DUK) exited the $8 billion project earlier this month due to regulatory uncertainty following years of delays and billions of dollars of cost overruns.
It is just one of several U.S. oil and gas pipelines mired in legal and regulatory battles with local and environmental groups that have found numerous problems with U.S. permits issued by Trump administration agencies.
When Dominion started work on the 600-mile (966-km) pipe in 2018, the company estimated it would cost $6.0 billion to $6.5 billion and be completed in late 2019.
In the weeks before canceling the project, however, Dominion said it could finish the project in early 2022 only if it received new federal permits soon that would survive court challenges.
In addition to regulatory delays, Atlantic Coast was also hurt by a short-term hit to gas demand from the coronavirus and a longer-term hit from growing consumer interest in clean energy projects.
Still, there was a need for the pipeline and that will now be left unmet, Chief Financial Officer James R. Chapman said on a post-earnings call.
Virginia is one of several states seeking to achieve 100% carbon-free power over the next two decades.
Even though gas is the cleanest fossil fuel and considered by many analysts to provide a bridge from dirty coal to clean renewables, it still produces carbon.
Dominion has plans to invest up to $55 billion over the next 15 years on zero-carbon generation, energy storage, gas distribution replacement and renewable natural gas.

Apple rose as much as 7.1% on Friday, touching a record market capitalization of $1.765 trillion. It’s the first time the company’s valuation has surpassed that of Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, which made its market debut in Riyadh in December. Before that, Apple had vied with  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). for the title of the U.S.’s largest public company.
The horse race with Aramco comes after a tumultuous period for the Saudi company. Its initial public offering fell short of Crown Price Mohammed bin Salman’s expectations. The kingdom’s de facto ruler initially wanted a valuation of $2 trillion and to raise $100 billion. But after foreign investors balked at the pricing, the government settled on a smaller domestic offering and raised about $30 billion, still the largest IPO ever.
Then came this year’s plunge in crude prices as energy demand crashed with the spread of the virus. Aramco’s second-quarter revenue probably dropped to about $37 billion from $75 billion a year earlier, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That’s less than the $59.7 billion in sales that Apple reported for the most recent period.
Aramco’s stock is down 6.4% since the end of December, though that’s far less than the fall of other oil majors.  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). has declined 38% and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc has dropped 47%.
Apple, meanwhile, has benefited as the pandemic has strengthened the market positions of the world’s biggest technology companies, which boast strong balance sheets and fast-growing businesses thanks to an acceleration in the shift to digital services. The iPhone maker has added more than $1 trillion in market value so far this year.

450,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 11:18AM ET</span>",One-Third of U.S. Restaurants Face Permanent Closure This Year,"(Bloomberg) -- A new forecast projects that one in three U.S. restaurants may close permanently this year, showing how the Covid-19 pandemic is decimating an industry that employs millions of Americans.
As many as 231,000 of the nation’s roughly 660,000 eateries will likely shut down this year, according to an estimate from restaurant consultancy Aaron Allen & Associates provided to Bloomberg News. This will bring the industry’s steady growth to a halt and mark the first time in two decades that U.S. restaurant counts don’t climb. Restaurants have already shed millions of jobs this year, economic data show.
In addition, Aaron Allen & Associates calculates that more than 8,000 restaurants in the U.S. have already been directly affected by an employee with coronavirus.
The forecast portends a fundamental change for an industry that for generations has been a bedrock of local economies. Restaurants -- long a key source of employment and income for Americans from all backgrounds -- are facing new hurdles as data show that infection rates have spiked in the states that were first to reopen sit-in dining, such as Georgia, Texas and Florida.
“We’re talking a slow journey back for restaurants to be where they were before the pandemic, and that will take several years to work out,” said University of Michigan economist Richard Curtin, who has studied consumer behavior for decades.
Covid-19 cases rose in tandem with customers entering restaurants, according to data provided to Bloomberg by Zenreach, which uses wireless signals from cell phones to monitor traffic. But after reports of rising cases emerged, walk-in traffic turned down, the data show. That doesn’t necessarily mean going to restaurants is sparking more coronavirus spread, but it does show how comfortable customers in those markets feel about leaving the house in general.
These patterns -- rising virus cases, retrenching customers, restaurants closing -- may spark an enduring change in consumer behavior. Additionally, capacity restrictions can make it difficult or impossible for restaurants to turn a profit.
Zenreach Chief Executive Officer John Kelly said restaurant walk-in traffic in Georgia, Florida and Texas is currently at half of what it was a year ago. But this includes an upturn of more than 20% since May 1, he said.
Miami’s mayor in July forbade indoor dining after a Covid-19 surge. The governor of Texas, meanwhile, ordered restaurants to cut back to 50% capacity. In Atlanta and Houston, dozens of established eateries have shut down permanently despite their states being among the first to offer sit-down dining.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. in June found the level of in-person spending in restaurants was the strongest predictor of where new cases would emerge. In a follow-up July report, the bank said the correlation still held but was weakening as consumers embraced more precautions such as wearing masks.
Controlling the Shock
For Emory University economist Tom Smith, the rush to reopen was unrealistic from the beginning.
“In every economic shock, you cannot move forward until you have controlled the shock,” he said, comparing Covid-19 to a devastating storm. “You want to get back to normal in the middle of a hurricane -- it’s not going to happen.”
The economic impact of restaurant closures will reverberate beyond the industry itself, which accounts for nearly 4% of U.S. gross domestic product and employed about 8% of America’s labor force before the pandemic.
On a personal level, Smith said he hasn’t been inside a restaurant since early March.
“People are changing their behavior radically,” he said.

(Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said on Friday it had won approval to defer some quarterly payments due on its U.S. Energy Department retooling loan, but added it will repay the loan on time by June 2022.
In September 2009, Ford was awarded a $5.9 billion low-cost government loan, an important source of liquidity in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
The second-largest U.S. automaker said its loan was modified in June to reduce quarterly principal payments from $148 million to $37 million. Ford said it has $1.26 billion of remaining principal left on the loan.
An Energy Department spokeswoman said ""the flexibility the Loan Programs Office was able to provide through this loan modification is a good example of what (Energy) Secretary Brouillette meant when he asked for all of the Department’s resources to be supportive of the energy industry during the Covid-19 pandemic.""
Ford said ""with COVID-19 related economic uncertainty remaining, we believe that is worthwhile to further strengthen our balance sheet and increase liquidity to optimize our financial flexibility.""
The company noted that if it opts to pay a dividend, repurchase shares above a certain threshold, or provide security to other lenders it will have to revert to the original payment schedule.
The company said Friday that ""deferring a portion of the principal until the maturity date will also result in incremental interest cost to Ford, in addition to the cost to modify the loan. All costs associated with the modification were covered by Ford through a higher interest rate.""
But it added, ""the financing remains very cost-effective."" 

Ford shares were down slightly, 0.3% to $6.72.

More people turned to Pinterest's platform for content to keep themselves entertained during coronavirus lockdowns, leading to a 39% jump in monthly active users to 416 million in the quarter, beating estimates of 372.7 million.
In a post-earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Todd Morgenfeld said the ad boycott on Facebook's (O:FB) platform gave Pinterest ""an opportunity to win some budgets and educate advertisers about how and why Pinterest is different.""
Ad spend recovered from a slump since mid-March as economic activity resumed following the easing of lockdowns, Morgenfeld said.
Both Google (O:GOOGL) and Facebook (O:FB), which rely heavily on digital advertisement, reported strong ad sales on Thursday.
Pinterest also benefited from its updated shopping feature, with a 50% growth in users who visited shopping-only feeds in the first half of the year.

Pinterest, which had withdrawn its full-year outlook in April, now expects current-quarter revenue to increase in the mid-30% range year-over-year, with revenue growth of about 50% for this month through July 29.
The company slashed total expenses by about 74%, helping it narrow net loss to $100.7 million in the quarter ended June 30 from a loss of $1.16 billion last year.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. travel management firm CWT paid $4.5 million this week to hackers who stole reams of sensitive corporate files and said they had knocked 30,000 computers offline, according to a record of the ransom negotiations seen by Reuters.
The attackers used a strain of ransomware called Ragnar Locker, which encrypts computer files and renders them unusable until the victim pays for access to be restored.
The ensuing negotiations between the hackers and a CWT representative remained publicly accessible in an online chat group, providing a rare insight into the fraught relationship between cyber criminals and their corporate victims.
CWT, which posted revenues of $1.5 billion last year and says it represents more than a third of companies on the S&P 500 U.S. stock index, confirmed the attack but declined to comment on the details of what it said was an ongoing investigation. 
""We can confirm that after temporarily shutting down our systems as a precautionary measure, our systems are back online and the incident has now ceased,"" it said in a statement.
""While the investigation is at an early stage, we have no indication that personally identifiable information/customer and traveller information has been compromised.""
CWT said it had immediately informed U.S. law enforcement and European data protection authorities. 
A person familiar with the investigation said the company believed the number of infected computers was considerably less than the 30,000 the hackers told CWT they had infected.
DIGITAL RANSOM NOTE
The hackers initially demanded a payment of $10 million to restore CWT's files and delete all the stolen data, according to the messages reviewed by Reuters. ""It's probably much cheaper than lawsuits expenses (sic), reputation loss caused by leakage,"" the attackers wrote on July 27.
The CWT representative in the negotiations, who said they were acting on behalf of the firm's chief financial officer, said the company had been badly hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and agreed to pay $4.5 million in the digital currency bitcoin.
""Okay let's get this moving forward. What are the next steps?"" the representative said after agreeing to the ransom.
A public ledger of digital currency payments, known as the blockchain, shows that an online wallet controlled by the hackers received the requested payment of 414 bitcoin on July 28.
Messages sent to email addresses used by the hackers went unanswered.
In a ransom note left on infected CWT computers and screenshots posted online, the hackers claimed to have stolen two terabytes of files, including financial reports, security documents and employees' personal data such as email addresses and salary information. 
It was not clear whether data belong to any of CWT's customers, including  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), was compromised.
Western security officials say ransomware attacks are a consistent and serious threat to businesses and private companies, despite the increased attention usually given to the headline-grabbing antics of state-backed hackers.
Such attacks are thought to cost billions of dollars each year, either in extorted payments or recovery costs. 

Cybersecurity experts say the best defence is to keep secure data back-ups, and that paying ransoms encourages further criminal attacks without any guarantee that the encrypted files will be restored.

455,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 11:05AM ET</span>",Outlook for U.S. value stocks uncertain with cloudy economic picture,"By Chuck Mikolajczak and Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - After a rally led by growth companies that has left the S&P 500 index (SPX) roughly 4% from setting a new record high, the window of opportunity for value stocks to take leadership on Wall Street, as has often happened in the past, may be closing. 
The benchmark index plunged more than 33% from its Feb. 19 high to its low on March 23 as coronavirus-related shutdowns began spreading across world economies. As restrictions eased, and the Federal Reserve pumped trillions into stabilizing markets, many stocks have stormed back, lifting the S&P 500 more than 45% as economic activity slowly returned. 
Over the past decade, a focus on growth and momentum has steadily outperformed stock picking based on how undervalued a stock looks. More recently, the Russell 1000 growth (RLG) index has risen 53% from the market low on March 23 versus the 37% gain in the Russell 1000 value (RLV) index.

The value investment style tends to do better as an economy recovers from a recession, and while some analysts are still looking for a sharp economic recovery, expectations are mixed as to how quickly the economy can bounce back from the lockdowns put in place across the country to stall the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
Recent data on the economy and the latest policy statement from the Federal Reserve offered a dim view on the prospect of a quick recovery. 
""It is virtually impossible for value to start to get sponsorship unless and until we have a better answer on economic growth,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.
""So you are never going to see a value sector, value company, value investor shine unless the projection for economic growth significantly improves and we don’t really have that necessarily this year."" 
The Commerce Department said on Thursday that gross domestic product collapsed at a 32.9% annualized rate, the steepest decline in output since the government began to keep records in 1947, while weekly initial jobless claims increased to 1.434 million. On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the recent surge in coronavirus cases is starting to drag on economic activity.
""You can't dial up a worse situation for value stocks than the biggest collapse ever in a quarter in the post-war history of the United States. That's got to be the worst possible environment for value stocks,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.
But in a note to clients on Wednesday, Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC)'s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, pointed out that the relative valuation between growth and value has become increasingly stretched, and the firm prefers value stocks for at least the next few months. 
Graphic: Forward PE of Russell 1000 growth and value - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyprkmgjve/Pasted%20image%201596125217667.png
Subramanian does caution, however, that value traps remain in areas such as brick-and-mortar retail names and energy. 
Some cyclical stocks, many of which fall into the value bucket, have already outperformed since the March low. The S&P materials sector (SPLRCM) is up 57%, energy (SPNY) is up 52% and industrials (SPLRCI) are up nearly 48% to outpace the broad S&P 500's 45% run off the low. 
Andrew Slimmon, portfolio manager at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management in Chicago, also thinks the time may be right to start looking at value if the economy is poised to rebound next year. 
Comparing the performance of the equal-weighted S&P 500 index <.SPXEW>, which gives a fixed relevance to each component and, as such, does not discount beaten-down stocks in value, to the market-cap weighted benchmark S&P 500, Slimmon notes the equal-weighted index historically outperforms as the economy exits a recession.

""We haven’t seen that yet and I think we will, in fits and starts,"" Slimmon said. 
""There is this short-term rotational set up, which is we could have a value rally because they are oversold, growth stocks are overbought."" 
But ultimately, any hope for a strong economic rebound, and in turn, a rally in value stocks is likely to be predicated on an end to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

""It coalesces around economic growth but it doesn’t take much of an imagination to think what would drive that and what would change that, and a lot of that has to do with getting to the other side of this vaccine race,"" Hogan said.

The league postponed a Friday night game between the Milwaukee Brewers and the St. Louis Cardinals because of a positive Covid test. And weekend play has been suspended for the Philadelphia Phillies.
MLB has updated its coronavirus protocols, according to ESPN, which reported Wednesday that the league is requiring the use of surgical masks for travel and the presence of a compliance officer to ensure league protocol is being followed.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - France's  Alstom  SA (PA:ALSO) clinched EU antitrust approval on Friday to acquire Canadian rival Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Inc's (TO:BBDb) rail business in a deal that will elevate it to the world's second-largest rail maker after China's CRRC Corp (SS:601766).
Alstom's success in gaining EU clearance for the deal valued up to 6.2 billion euros ($7.4 billion) contrasted with its failed attempt last year to combine its rail assets with  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), which was vetoed by regulators because the companies refused to offer more concessions.
""Thanks to the comprehensive remedies offered to solve the competition concerns in the areas of very high-speed, mainline trains and mainline signalling, the Commission has been able to speedily review and approve this transaction,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
The Commission said Alstom will sell a French rail factory in Reichshoffen, its regional train unit Coradia Polyvalent, and a Bombardier commuter trains division and related production facilities at its Hennigsdorf site in Germany. 
The company also agreed to sell Bombardier's stake in a consortium with Hitachi (T:6501) and provide access to some products within Bombardier's train control systems and signalling units to rivals.
Alstom said it expects to complete the deal in the first half of 2021.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire welcomed the EU green light.
Bombardier said: ""Today's decision marks a positive step for the growth opportunities of the European rail sector, which is a world leader thanks to strong domestic competition and commitment to the next generation of green and digital mobility solutions.""
Siemens said it was reviewing the decision and would decide in due course about further action.
Alstom’s Force Ouvriere union said the operation was financially risky and aimed only at becoming bigger, even if it meant some parts of the company had to be cut off. 

Reuters reported on July 27 that the concessions would help Alstom gained EU clearance for the deal.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher Friday, mainly due to a surge in Big Tech megacaps after they published blowout earnings after the closing bell on Thursday.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 32 points, or 0.1% at 26,345 points, while the S&P 500 was up 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite, inevitably, outperformed with a gain of 0.9%.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock gained 7.2% in the first few minutes of trading, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock gained 6.0% and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock rose 5.0%. Alphabet was the odd one out, its Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares falling 3.7% and its Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares falling 4.4% after it registered a first ever quarterly advertising revenue decline at Google.
Broader gains were capped, however, by the awareness that there has been no agreement on Capitol Hill on extending the enhanced unemployment benefits that sustained U.S. household consumption through the first months of the pandemic. Fears of a looming drop in spending were fed by data showing that personal incomes fell by 1.1% in June, more than the 0.5% drop expected.
The University of Michigan's final reading for its consumer sentiment index for July also disappointed, being revised down to 72.5 from an initial estimate of 73.2.
""Financial markets are already priced for a vigorous recovery, but with virus fears on the rise, jobs being lost and incomes being squeezed as unemployment benefits are cut, we feel the recovery could be much bumpier,"" said analysts at ING in a morning research note.
Record losses from the country's two biggest oil producers,  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), also weighed, with Chevron in particular hit by a multi-billion-dollar write-off of its Venezuelan business. Chevron stock fell 3.3% while Exxon Mobil stock fell 0.6%.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock rose 0.8% after reports saying that it is in talks to buy U.K.-based chip designer ARM for more than $32 billion from SoftBank (OTC:SFTBY). 
 Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) stock fell 3.2% after results that showed a big hit to capital spending by its major customers (notably the oil and gas industry), while Under Armour (NYSE:UA) stock fell 4.5%, reversing gains made in premarket trading, after reporting a steep fall in revenue that was only marginally better than feared.
In commodity markets, Crude Oil Futures recovered after Thursday's driven slide, while Gold Futures and Silver Futures both regained momentum as bond yields and - implicitly - real interest rates slid lower.

Morgan,"(Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) customer loyalty and response to the COVID-19 pandemic have proven brick-and-mortar stores are not essential to drive sales of its products, J.P.Morgan said on Friday, as the iPhone maker's blockbuster quarterly results pushed its shares up 7%.
The United States' most valuable company was forced to shut down more than 70 stores again in the third quarter in response to surging COVID-19 cases, but consumers were unfazed with the company topping analysts' estimates for iPhone sales by $4 billion.
Revenue gains were splashed across every category and geography for the quarter, while a juicy stock split was added for extra measure, giving Wall Street and investors more cheer.
JPM analyst Samik Chatterjee said the performance spoke volumes about the importance of Apple products to consumers, and showed them willing to circumvent the traditional practice of buying from the physical channel when required.
Online retailers have emerged as big winners during lockdowns with people preferring to shop from their homes, driving malls and physical shopping globally into crisis and questioning their future in retail globally. 
E-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) is also riding high on the online shopping boost. The company posted its biggest profit ever on the back of a 48% rise in online store sales.
At least seven brokerages raised their 12-month price targets on Apple's stock, with Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) making the most aggressive move and raising its target by $160 to $450. The current median price target on the stock is $409.63.

Shares of the California-based company were up 7% to $411 in pre-market trade, on course to open at a record.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Top asset managers including Vanguard Group,  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT) and Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN) have urged the Trump administration to reconsider proposed investment rules that would make it harder for retirement plans to use socially focused funds like those that invest in renewable energy.
Letters to the U.S. Labor Department from firms with assets approaching $10 trillion show how the finance industry has embraced causes once seen as distractions. Representatives of the firms showed the letters to Reuters on Thursday.
The department in June had proposed requiring retirement plan administrators to pick investments only on financial considerations.
It would bar them from using funds or vehicles focused on environmental, social or governance (ESG) criteria where the goal is to ""subordinate return or increase risk for the purpose of non-financial objectives,"" as officials put it in a press release.
Investor interest in ESG investing has exploded. The performance of the funds has matched or often outperformed traditional products, especially in recent years as fossil fuel company shares have lagged other sectors.
Comment letters to the department were due Thursday and include one from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest business trade group, stating it supports the ""underlying principle"" of the proposal while suggesting language changes.
Big fund firms were more skeptical. ""We see no basis to single out ESG products for enhanced regulatory scrutiny,"" wrote Vanguard, the largest mutual fund company, in a letter provided by a spokeswoman. Vanguard suggested the Labor Department require more disclosures instead.
Franklin Resources wrote that the changes ""would lead to confusion on the scope of ESG investments, increase the burden of implementation costs, heighten the litigation risk faced by fiduciaries, and limit investor choice.""
State Street's asset-management arm urged the Department to withdraw the proposed rule and instead work with stakeholders to add ""the benefits of value-driven consideration of ESG factors"" to pension plans.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares recovered from their lowest levels in a month on Friday, as investors looked past a severe economic contraction in the euro zone and on to company earnings, while the euro reached its highest in more than two years, set for its best month in a decade.
The euro zone's economy recorded its deepest contraction on record in the second quarter, preliminary estimates showed, but inflation unexpectedly ticked up in July.
Gross domestic product in the bloc shrank by 12.1% from the previous quarter, the European Union's statistics office, Eurostat, said in its flash estimates. The decline coincided with coronavirus lockdowns, which in many euro zone countries began to ease only in May.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.6%, though it was on course to end the month flat or lower. Technology shares (SX8P) led the rally, rising over 2% after Wall Street's tech giants, Apple (O:AAPL), Amazon (O:AMZN) and Facebook (O:FB), reported forecast-beating results overnight.
MSCI's All Country World Index, which tracks shares across 49 countries, was down 0.04% on the day. (MIWD00000PUS)
""Germany’s (-10.1%) and France’s ( -13.8%) numbers have already shaped expectations around the magnitude of the 2Q slump in the aggregated eurozone economy,"" ING strategists said in a note to clients. 
""Markets will therefore focus on assessing the slowdown in the Italian and Spanish economies, which were among the first and worst-hit countries in the pandemic.""
They added the euro could hit $1.20 within the next few days. The single currency passed $1.19 on Friday, though it fell back below the handle by midday in London. (EUR=EBS)
The dollar was set for its worst month in a decade against a basket of currencies, as abysmal economic data for the second quarter and rising global COVID-19 cases darkened the mood. The dollar index (=USD) gained 0.2% on Friday to 93.011 (DXY) [FRX/]
Expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy for years have contributed to a depressed dollar.
U.S. gross domestic product plunged 32.9% in the second quarter, the biggest decline on record. Jobless claims rose last week, another sign the economic recovery has slowed.
Those figures overshadowed positive manufacturing data from China and Japan. China's official Purchasing Manager's Index data showed that factory activity grew in July for a fifth straight month and at a faster pace, defying expectations of a slowdown. Japan's industrial output snapped four months of declines in June.
Earlier in Asia, shares turned lower on Friday amid the economic data from the United States and rising global COVID-19 cases. After rising in early trade, MSCI's broadest index of Asian shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) turned lower. It was last down 0.3%.
Australian shares (AXJO) were down 2.04% and Seoul's Kospi (KS11) ticked 0.64% lower. Japan's Nikkei (N225) dropped 2.82% as a stronger yen weighed on exporters.
Chinese blue chips (CSI300) were last up 0.35% in a session that swung repeatedly between gains and losses. 
Futures continued to point to a higher open on Wall Street on Friday. Apple (O:AAPL), Amazon (O:AMZN), Facebook (O:FB) and Alphabet (O:GOOGL) reported quarterly earnings on the same day for the first time ever, all topping Wall Street estimates.
""All of them punched the lights out with respect to their earnings numbers,"" said National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) strategist Ray Attrill.
E-mini futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) rose 0.2% and Nasdaq futures  gained over 1%.
U.S. stock markets, oil prices and the dollar slid on Thursday as the data underscored the economic impact of the coronavirus and U.S. President Donald Trump raised the possibility of delaying the November election.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 0.85%, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 0.38% and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 0.43%.
Crude oil recovered from an overnight slump, with global benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) rising 0.7% to 43.25 a barrel. U.S. light crude added 0.5% to $40.21 per barrel. (CLc1)
Gold also turned higher, with spot gold  trading 0.64% higher at $1,972.19 per ounce, just short of record highs. 
U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes (US10YT=RR) yielded 0.5363%. The two-year yield (US2YT=RR) touched 0.1152% compared with a U.S. close of 0.121%.

Italian 10-year bond yields were set for their biggest monthly drop since January on Friday, boosted by the recovery fund agreed by the European Union last week.

The Ministry of Finance, which began an investigation into Luckin Coffee (China) and Luckin Coffee (Beijing) in early May, found Luckin booked 2.25 billion yuan ($322.60 million) of sales through fake coupons from April 2019 to the end of last year, it said in a statement on its website on Friday.
It also found Luckin inflated sales by 2.12 billion yuan during the period, while costs were inflated by 1.2 billion yuan and profits by 908 million yuan. 
The ministry said that it would now impose administrative penalties on Luckin, without giving further details. 
The State Administration for Market Regulation said in a separate statement, again without giving details, that it too would take action against the two domestic entities of Luckin and related third party companies that helped Luckin with the false promotion.
Fortunes of Luckin, which directly competes with U.S. coffeehouse Starbucks (O:SBUX), have nosedived since the probe was disclosed in April. 
The delisting of its U.S. shares added to concerns about Chinese company governance after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warned in April of the dangers of investing in emerging market stocks, singling out China in particular. 
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said in April that it had initiated talks to cooperate with the SEC on a possible investigation into Luckin.
Luckin wound up an internal probe earlier this month that found the company's revenue was inflated by around 2.12 billion yuan in 2019.

During the investigation, Luckin sacked its CEO and COO, executives who had previously held top positions at Chairman Charles Lu's other firms.

463,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 08:26AM ET</span>","Exxon posts second straight quarterly loss on demand, price plunge","(Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) reported a $1.1 billion loss for the second quarter on Friday, the first back-to-back quarterly loss for the U.S. oil giant in at least 36 years.
Exxon stood out among its supermajor peers for not taking a large writedown on the value of its assets as the industry outlook darkens on the future of oil and gas prices. 
 Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) Corp,  Total  (PA:TOTF), Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), and Eni (MI:ENI) wrote down billions of dollars in assets.  BP  (L:BP) has signaled an up to $17.5 billion hit.
The COVID-19 pandemic slashed oil prices, sending Exxon's oil and gas production business to a loss. Its refining businesses was hit by a fall in demand, but an improvement in inventory valuations pushed overall refining profits into the black by nearly $1 billion.
The U.S. oil major reported a loss of $1.08 billion, or 26 cents per share, in the three months ended June 30, compared with a profit of $3.13 billion, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier. (https://exxonmobil.co/30d059Q)
An adjusted loss of 70 cents per share missed Wall Street's estimate of 61 cents, according to Refinitiv.
Oil and gas output fell 7% from a year earlier to 3.6 million barrels per day in the quarter as it curtailed output due to the oil price crash and threat that global oil storage would fill in May.
Prior to the pandemic, Exxon pursued an ambitious spending plan to boost oil output and turnaround sagging profits on a bet that a growing global middle class would demand more of its products. 
But CEO Darren Woods's plan to raise production and money by selling some assets has faltered and the company has slashed its capital spending plans for this year by 30%. 
Exxon is preparing deeper spending and job cuts, according to people familiar with the matter, as it fights to preserve a 8% shareholder dividend.

It said on Friday it had identified more potential cost cuts and was doing an ""evaluation across the businesses on a country-by-country basis.""

465,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 08:10AM ET</span>",The U.S. election is getting ugly - and investors are getting nervous,"By David Randall and April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are increasingly preparing for the risk of a contested U.S. presidential election come the fall, worried that an ugly political situation will create volatility across markets. 
A key risk is that Republican President Donald Trump is already questioning the legitimacy of the election, analysts said. His Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, currently has a 9 percentage point advantage among likely voters and a significant advantage among voters who are undecided, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll.
""It is going to get ugly,"" said Nick Maroutsos, head of global bonds at Janus Henderson Investors. ""I would expect a lot of volatility ... but it will be very short-lived, you are talking about a two-week span."" 
Trump escalated fears of a contested election in a tweet Thursday morning and suggested the election be delayed until people can ""properly, securely and safely vote."" 
Trump said he would not trust the results of an election that included widespread mail voting - yet he called absentee voting ""good,"" although it is largely conducted by mail. One in five voters currently vote by mail in presidential elections, and that number is expected to at least double in November.
The tweet caused a knee-jerk sell-off in equities, which reversed during the day's trading. Derivatives markets were pricing in the risk of higher volatility after the election. 
Trump has no direct authority to change the date of federal elections - Congress has that power - so the concern for investors is of a contested election rather than the actual election being postponed. 
An election without a clear winner the following day would likely weigh on the benchmark S&P 500, which is up nearly 45% since its March lows and hovering near record highs. The S&P 500 fell 1.8% the morning after the disputed Nov. 7, 2000 election between Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush, and fell 5% by the end of the week, according to data from Capital Economics.
A contested election due to mail-in ballots would likely be more extensive than the hanging chad issue in Florida in 2000, said David Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors, referring to the confusion over voter intention due to a ballot in Florida that led then-Vice President Gore to challenge the election outcome and call for a recount. The U.S. Supreme Court eventually ruled that Florida did not have to do a statewide recount, ensuring the election of then-Texas Governor Bush. 
""My guess is that markets would sell off and maybe sharply with that outcome,"" Kotok said. 
Among the biggest trades in options on the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) on Thursday was a call spread for December options at strike prices of 35 and 70, seemingly a hedge against a spike in the fear gauge. 
""We don't typically see call spreads out that far, and (the election's) the most likely thing to target,"" said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.
Over the past 10 days, the back end of the VIX futures curve has had greater movement than the front end. That's unusual, Murphy said, and it too could point to concern regarding the aftermath of the election or worries over a winter resurgence of the coronavirus.
Also, since the beginning of the week, skew has risen on the S&P 500, indicating greater demand for downside protection, Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets has noted. Investors have rolled out their hedges to the end of the year in part because of concerns about the election process, she said.
Still, any impact may be fleeting. 

""We are not going to change our portfolio composition drastically to cover what we believe to be a high volatility period for 2-3 weeks,"" Maroutsos said.

The company had cautioned earlier against a potential hit to sales from Botox and other aesthetic products during the pandemic, as people avoided non-emergency procedures due to shelter-in-place restrictions imposed to control the virus.
The drugmaker bought Allergan in May for a hefty sum, acquiring its medical aesthetics business including Botox, hoping the segments would emerge as new growth drivers before AbbVie's arthritis drug, Humira, loses U.S. patent in 2023.
Total Botox cosmetic comparable sales plunged 43.1% to $226 million and therapeutic sales fell 22.3% to $297 in the second quarter ended June 30, on a comparable basis.
International sales of Humira fell about 20% due to competition from cheaper versions.
Like several other drugmakers, AbbVie is also looking to develop a therapy for COVID-19 and collaborating with three organizations, including the Netherlands' Utrecht University, to develop an antibody that targets the spike protein of the virus.
AbbVie forecast a combined company 2020 adjusted profit estimate, which includes the results of Allergan from May 8 through Dec. 31, of $10.35 to $10.45 per share, representing annualized net accretion from the Allergan deal of 11%.
Second-quarter net loss attributable to shareholders was $738 million, or 46 cents per share, compared with a profit of $741 million, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier.

470,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 07:31AM ET</span>",Exclusive: TikTok owner ByteDance considers listing China business in Hong Kong or Shanghai - sources,"By Yingzhi Yang and Julie Zhu
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese tech giant ByteDance is considering listing its domestic business in Hong Kong or Shanghai, people familiar with the matter told Reuters, against a backdrop of rising Sino-U.S. tensions over its hit non-China video app TikTok. 
Of the two venues, the company prefers Hong Kong, according to two of the people. One of the two also said ByteDance is simultaneously studying the option to list its smaller, non-China business - which includes TikTok that is not available in China - in Europe or the United States.
The eight-year-old Beijing-based tech and media company had originally wanted to list as a combined entity, including TikTok and other operations, in New York or Hong Kong in a blockbuster deal. TikTok allows smartphone users to film and upload short videos with special effects within seconds.
But ByteDance has been in talks with bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) over the China business listing, one of the people said. The company was also discussing it with Chinese securities regulators, according to the other two people.
Reuters previously reported China accounts for the bulk of ByteDance revenue, which one source said was around $16 billion in 2019.
A standalone listing could value the China business at more than $100 billion in Hong Kong or on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market, according to two sources. 
The review of separate plans for the China business comes amid growing concerns over U.S. regulatory scrutiny and uncertainty over whether a 2013 audit deal between Beijing and Washington, that underpins Chinese firms listing in the United States, will remain intact. 
The people interviewed by Reuters said the idea of splitting the whole business into two public listings and the venue discussions are preliminary and subject to change. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the information was private.
Plans may also be complicated by some heavyweight ByteDance investors looking to take over TikTok at a valuation of $50 billion. TikTok faces pressure from U.S. regulators who have spoken about banning the app, or requiring ByteDance to sell it, over suspicions Beijing could force its owner to turn over data on U.S. users. 
ByteDance declined to comment. HKEX said it doesn't comment on individual companies. The China Securities Regulatory Commission didn't respond to a request to comment. 
BYTEDANCE VALUED AT UP TO $140 BILLION
The discussions about the two listings were initiated before the investor plans for a separate TikTok buyout emerged, according to one source, but after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) started to look into on TikTok's handling over user data last year.
The plans for the two listings may also not directly influence how TikTok's future will unfold, that person said.
ByteDance was valued at as much as $140 billion earlier this year when one of its shareholders, Cheetah Mobile (N:CMCM), sold a small stake in a private deal, Reuters has reported. 
It generated around $2.9 billion in profit for 2019, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. The company has set a 2020 revenue target of about 200 billion yuan ($28.62 billion). TikTok, over the same period, is expected to hit revenue of $1 billion.
The bulk of revenue comes from advertising on apps under its Chinese operations including Douyin - a Chinese version of TikTok - and news aggregator app Jinri Toutiao, as well as video-streaming app Xigua and Pipixia, an app for jokes and humorous videos.
Some of the company's other overseas apps include work collaboration tool Lark and music streaming app Resso. 
In March, ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming announced a more independent personnel structure for the China business, by appointing a dedicated chairman and chief executive for the China business, while retaining the role of global chief executive himself.
The China business listing idea comes as diplomatic strains have risen between Beijing and capitals in countries elsewhere including the United States, India and Britain. 
U.S.-listed Chinese companies also face tightened financial scrutiny and stricter audit requirements from U.S. regulators, prompting a number of Chinese companies including search engine giant Baidu (O:BIDU) and online travel firm Trip.com Group (O:TCOM) to consider abandoning a New York listing and move instead to an exchange closer to home.

Shanghai's tech-heavy STAR Market, seen as part of Beijing's campaign to become self-sufficient in core technologies, has become the second largest market globally for IPOs so far this year, after the Nasdaq, with $10.3 billion raised via offerings. Hong Kong's bourse ranked third with $8.9 billion raised, according to Refinitiv data.

471,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 07:31AM ET</span>","Chevron posts $8.3 billion loss on write downs, job cuts","By Jennifer Hiller
HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) on Friday reported an $8.3 billion loss on asset writedowns from plummeting fuel prices, a forced exit from Venezuela and expenses tied to thousands of jobs cuts.
Multibillion-dollar asset writedowns have become a prominent part of second-quarter energy results, as a global oil glut emerged as the COVID-19 pandemic cut fuel demand. Chevron rivals  Total  (PA:TOTF), Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), and Eni (MI:ENI) each wrote down billions of dollars in assets.  BP  (L:BP) has signaled an up to $17.5 billion hit.
Chevron wrote down its oil and gas production properties by $5.6 billion, including its entire investment in crisis-ravaged Venezuela, where it was the last major U.S. oil company still operating until ordered to wind down business by the Trump Administration.
The loss also includes $1 billion to cover severance pay for up to 6,700 of its 45,000-person staff to leave their jobs in a global restructuring.
The massive writedowns reflect the global economic downturn caused by the pandemic, and follow a $10 billion writedown of mostly natural gas properties in the fourth quarter of 2019. Oil companies are reducing the value of holdings as a realization grows that a deepening economic downturn could depress energy prices for years. 
The total value of U.S. goods and services produced last quarter fell at a 32.9% annual rate, the deepest decline in economic activity in modern history. 
""It will take years for that to recover and the price for our products is tied to economic activity,"" said Pierre Breber, Chevron's finance chief, in an interview. The company plans to continue to restrain spending on new projects, he said. 
The company's output last quarter fell by about 189,000 barrels of oil and gas compared with a year ago, reflecting its efforts to limit losses and earlier property sales. 
The writedown of oil and gas properties included non-shale operations in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. oilfield, offshore Gulf of Mexico fields, and undefined properties outside the United States, he said. 
""We would need to see sustained economic recovery and much lower inventory levels before we would add capital back to the Permian or other basins,"" said Breber. ""We're in a lower for longer world where demand is down and there's ample supply."" 
The writedowns pushed Chevron's loss to $8.27 billion, or $4.44 a share, compared to a profit of $4.3 billion, or $2.27 a share, a year ago. Adjusted loss was $3 billion, or $1.59 per share, compared to a profit of $3.4 billion, or $1.77 per share, last year, it reported. 
The loss reflects an average 65% reduction in the prices received for its petroleum produced last quarter as demand plummeted amid COVID-19 travel restrictions and declining industrial demand for fuels. 
Pre-market trading in the company's stock was indicated 3.6% lower on Friday. It closed at $86.27 on Thursday, down 29% from the start of the year. 
Chevron has resisted leaving Venezuela, arguing its presence was a stabilizing presence and supported local workers. Any exit would hand over its assets to Russian or Chinese oil companies, it has said. Chevron has operated in the country for nearly 100 years, mostly recently through joint ventures with Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA. 

But the Trump administration gave Chevron until December to wind down its business there amid U.S. sanctions designed to oust the government of President Nicolas Maduro. Chevron wrote off the $2.6 billion value of Venezuelan assets, which in June produced 7,000 barrels per day, Breber said.

Fiat Chrysler (FCA) said its adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) were negative for 928 million euros ($1.10 billion) in the April-June period, versus forecast for a 1.87 billion euro loss in an analyst poll compiled by Reuters. 
Chief Executive Mike Manley said the group's plants were up and running and car dealers were selling in showrooms and online.
""We have the flexibility and financial strength to push ahead with our plans,"" he said in a statement on Friday.

473,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 07:30AM ET</span>",BA owner IAG to raise $3.3 billion to ride out COVID crisis,"By Sarah Young and Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) plans to raise 2.75 billion euros ($3.27 billion/£2.48 billion) from shareholders to repair the coronavirus-sized hole in its finances and brace for a more chaotic future. 
Chief Executive Willie Walsh said the plan, backed by biggest shareholder Qatar Airways, was needed to survive the most severe crisis in aviation history after the group lost more in one quarter than it has ever lost in a year.
""These are really extreme times,"" Walsh told the BBC, adding IAG had hoped to be flying at about 50% capacity by July, but was instead at 20%. 
""We're seeing a much slower and more gradual build-up,"" he added. 
Airlines around the world have been brought to their knees by the halt to flights, forcing tens of thousands of job cuts, in what Walsh said was a crisis much worse for airlines than either 9/11 or the global financial crisis. 
""This is worse by any measure, by many times,"" he told investors. 
Walsh said the proposed fundraising would give IAG, which also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus, a ""very comfortable buffer"" to withstand its worst-case scenario planning. Travel is not seen recovering to pre-pandemic levels until 2023. 
Competitor Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF), which has secured a state-backed rescue to underpin its finances, also said on Friday it was ready to cut capacity plans further due to the anaemic recovery.
IAG on Friday slid to a second-quarter operating loss before exceptional items of 1.365 billion euros.
Goodbody analysts said the results showed how network carriers like IAG - with connecting short-haul and long-haul routes - would find it more difficult to recover than budget carriers such as Ryanair (I:RYA) and easyJet (L:EZJ). 
Shares in IAG fell 7% to their lowest since 2012 at 167 pence, and are down 72% this year. 
CASH CALL 
The capital increase, which is fully underwritten, is conditional upon shareholder approval on Sept. 8, which Walsh said would be his last day in the job after the postponement of his retirement to steer IAG through the pandemic. 
Qatar Airways, which owns 25% of IAG, has proposed adding two directors to IAG's board after backing the move. Walsh said of the new appointments: ""I don't think it signals anything other than Qatar's support for our business."" 
As well as Walsh being succeeded by Iberia boss Luis Gallego, chairman Antonio Vazquez will be replaced at the beginning of 2021 by Javier Ferran.
Walsh told Irish radio he believed shareholders would be supportive of the capital increase, which will be launched as soon as possible after approval at the meeting. 
IAG said the proceeds would not be used to fund the acquisition of Air Europa, the Spanish airline it agreed to buy for 1 billion euros last November, a deal it said it is trying to restructure. 
Spanish media have reported that IAG is seeking a reduced price of 500-600 million euros.
Walsh said he was optimistic British Airways would reach a deal with cabin crew trade union Unite over the 12,000 jobs the airline says it needs to cut, explaining that the scale of the downturn should now be clear to the union. 
After months of grounded planes, the tentative return to flying in Europe, needed to salvage the summer season that provides the bulk of airline profits, has been threatened by signs of rising COVID-19 cases and new travel restrictions.

Britain brought in quarantine rules for arrivals from Spain last week and has said it is looking at other countries. The United States and India, two big markets for British Airways, remain subject to quarantine rules.

Sales of Keytruda, Merck's key growth driver, rose nearly 29% to $3.39 billion, beating the average estimate of $3.13 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
However, Merck said sales of its vaccines and other treatments were hurt as patients avoided doctors' offices due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a $1.6 billion hit to its second-quarter sales.
The company also forecast a $1.95 billion hit to 2020 revenue from the pandemic.
Merck said it now expects full year adjusted profit of between $5.63 to $5.78 per share, compared with its prior forecast of between $5.17 and $5.37 per share.
Net income attributable to shareholders rose to $3 billion, or $1.18 per share, in the quarter, from $2.67 billion, or $1.03 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, Merck earned $1.37 per share, beating estimates of $1.04, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

477,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>",Corporate America Hunkers Down After Pandemic-Fueled Debt Binge,"(Bloomberg) -- Blue-chip U.S. companies are slowing down on borrowing after months of massive bond sales and hanging onto the money they’ve raised to insulate themselves from the pandemic.
The biggest U.S. banks hardly sold any notes after posting earnings, a time when they often issue heavily. Overall corporate bond sales in July dropped by a third to about $60 billion from the same time last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Corporations’ reluctance to spend now reflects the intensity of the downturn that the Covid-19 pandemic is triggering. The U.S. economy shrank at an annualized pace of 32.9% in the second quarter, the steepest drop since at least 1947, according to a report Thursday. Any slump in corporate expenditure will only make the downturn worse, and underscores the limits of the Federal Reserve flooding the financial system with money if parties are wary of spending.
“Companies have a lot of cash on their balance sheets and they don’t seem to need more at this point,” said Dominique Toublan, head of U.S. credit strategy at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) SA. “Keeping that cash a bit longer seems to be the safe thing to do given the current uncertainty.”
That may not bode well for the economy, but it could be a positive for bondholders: Lower supply combined with continued support from the Federal Reserve and strong investor demand for yield globally could bolster company debt even as risks for the securities grow, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. strategists wrote this week. The relatively light issuance from U.S. banks this month after their earnings are likely a taste of what we’ll see from other investment-grade companies in the coming months, they said.
Investment-grade companies have sold more than $1.2 trillion of U.S. bonds this year, according to Bloomberg data, more than they sold for each of 2018 and 2019. The biggest U.S. banks have issued more than $155 billion, exceeding the $135 billion they raised for all of 2019, according to Bloomberg data.
To the extent blue-chip companies are playing it safe now, they’re reversing the trend of most of the past decade. The market value of investment-grade corporate debt outstanding has more than doubled since the end of 2011, while revenue for S&P 500 members rose less than 40% between that year and the end of 2019. Debt relative to measures like earnings has only deteriorated this year as sales for many corporations have plunged.
The picture for companies was deteriorating even before Covid-19 spread. Total corporate profit after taxes fell 0.4% to $1.95 trillion in 2019 from the year before, according to gross domestic product figures.
Now the situation is worse, giving companies less incentive to invest in new factories or use their cash for anything other than holding on, said Lacy Hunt, chief economist at Hoisington Investment Management Co.
“There’s no motivation from earnings to invest in capital spending,” Hunt said.
Debt Buybacks
Corporations are often willing to spend money to reduce risk. Some, for example, are buying back debt, usually notes that mature in the next few years and will need to be refinanced anyway. Taking care of those bonds now reduces the potential for having to borrow in the future when it may be harder or more expensive.
High-grade companies tendered for a little more than $80 billion of bonds in the second quarter, compared with about $14.4 billion in the first quarter, according to BNP. AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), the world’s largest non-financial borrower, sold $11 billion of bonds on Monday to buy back high-interest debt due in the next five years.
In April and May,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co. and GE Capital sold more than $10 billion of bonds combined, and used the proceeds to refinance notes maturing over the next few years and other debt. GE overall reduced its debt outstanding in the first half of the year using proceeds from the sale of its biopharma business.
Even some junk-rated companies are cutting back. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)., which is benefiting from higher revenues as more consumers stay home and watch television and movies in the pandemic, said in its quarterly results this month that it won’t need to issue new debt for the rest of this year, and that it expects to have enough liquidity to fund its operations for at least the next 12 months.
Companies may rush to borrow again if the shutdown proves to be prolonged, or if it makes sense to refinance more debt maturing in 2021, according to Erin Lyons, a credit strategist at CreditSights. But there’s little sense from companies that they need to rush to lock in low rates now, because “rates aren’t going anywhere anytime soon,” Lyons said.
“The other wild card could be M&A,” Lyons said in a telephone interview Monday. “You could potentially see an increase in M&A as debt is cheap, and there’s going to be battered companies coming out of Covid, presenting a good opportunity to find good assets, cut costs and improve Ebitda.”

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Friday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq index set to outperform after stellar results from the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Investors will also be studying negotiations over the next coronavirus stimulus as the Covid-19 pandemic's second wave continues to work its way through the central U.S.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), US 500 Futures traded 5 points, or 0.2%, higher, Nasdaq 100 Futures up 108 points, or 1%. The Dow Futures contract rose 50 points, or 0.2%. These cash indexes are on pace for their fourth straight month of gains.
Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Facebook have driven markets higher in recent weeks, with the market capitalization of these four tech giants combined now making up 38% of the Nasdaq 100 index. 
Elsewhere, U.S. lawmakers are still struggling to find enough common ground to pass another stimulus package, a key sticking point being the $600 weekly pandemic unemployment benefit, which expires later Friday. A Republican proposal to slash that to $200 a week was rejected on Thursday.
“The enhanced unemployment benefit ($600 a week) has been a cornerstone in the rebound in consumption that was seen during May and June,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note, and “a failure to prolong the program will likely add fuel to the stalling fire.”
The U.S. economy is already showing signs of stress. Initial jobless claims climbed to 1.43 million last week, rising for the second straight week, while GDP fell by a record 9.5% in absolute terms in the second quarter.
Friday will feature reports on personal income and spending, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), and the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment at 10 AM ET. 
Meanwhile, the earnings season continues, with the likes of Merck (NYSE:MRK), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM),  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) reporting Friday.  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), a closely-watched proxy for business investment, rose 1.8% in premarket trading after handily beating expectations on both top and bottom lines.  Under Armour  (NYSE:UAA) stock rose 19% after its second-quarter results proved less dire than feared.
Oil prices edged higher, recovering from three-week lows hit on Thursday in reaction to the U.S. GDP and jobless claims numbers. 
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries will soon become the focus after the group decided earlier this month to dial back production cuts, a move that will see an increase in production of about 2 million barrels a day starting in August. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $40.14 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent rose 0.4% to $43.42.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1.5% to $1,971.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1844, largely unchanged.

In the second quarter, the heavy equipment maker reported a profit of 84 cents per share, down 70.3% year on year. 
Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv, on average, expected earnings of 68 cents per share.
Revenue declined 31% year on year to $10 billion, with sales declining across all regions and in its three primary segments, construction, mining, and energy and transport.
The heavy equipment maker, considered a bellwether for economic activity, said its financial results will be impacted by continued global economic uncertainty due to the pandemic. As a result, it declined to reinstate its earnings guidance which was withdrawn in late March.

Caterpillar said it is cutting costs and prioritizing investment in its services business which is expected to hold up better than equipment demand in the downturn.

A day after telling U.S. lawmakers that they weren’t rampant monopolists, and on a day when the U.S. economy confirmed its biggest contraction since records began, Big Tech issued a round of results that showed them making money like never before.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and, most of all, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) blew past expectations for the three months to June. Only Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) results contained any hint that there was a pandemic going on, its quarterly revenue declining for the first time ever as advertisers pared back their budgets.
“Right now, it's big tech's world and everyone else is paying rent,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.
That reality may result in some more urgent questioning from the next Congress, which may want to schedule further antitrust hearings for the day AFTER their earnings, rather than the day before.
2. Europe's 2Q GDP was even worse
It’s Europe’s turn to parade the awfulness of the second quarter of 2020. Eurozone GDP contracted by 12.1% in the three months through June, more than the 11.2% expected and considerably more than the 9.5% drop in absolute terms recorded by the U.S. on Thursday.
The starkest decline was in Spain, where GDP fell by 18.5%, while France contracted by 13.8% and Italy by a surprisingly mild 12.4%. Italy had had the worst outbreak in all of Europe, concentrated in its most economically important region, Lombardy. However, it had also gone into lockdown first, creating a lower base at the end of the first quarter.
However, German retail sales and French consumer spending data for June both beat expectations handsomely, underlining how the economy had already started to rebound by the end of the quarter.
3. Stocks set to open higher; Nasdaq shines
U.S. stocks are set to open mostly higher, with Nasdaq futures naturally outperforming on the back of the Big Tech earnings after the close on Thursday.
By 6:40 AM ET (1040 GMT), the US 30 Futures contract was up 52 points or 0.2%, while the US 500 Futures contract was up 0.2% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.9%
In addition to earnings from Big Oil (see below) there’ll also be updates from Merck, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), Charter Communications , Colgate-Palmolive and Caterpillar ahead of the opening bell Friday, with the last of these likely to draw particular attention, given its status as a bellwether for business activity.
4. Dollar hits lowest since May 2018 on recovery fears
The dollar fell to its lowest level since May 2018 as confidence in the U.S.’s ability to bounce back from the pandemic lockdowns weakened further.
By 6:40 AM, the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six developed-market currencies, was down 0.2% at 92.852, having earlier hit a low of 92.717.
The failure of lawmakers to reach an agreement on the next package of stimulus measures means that there will definitely be a gap in the payment of enhanced unemployment benefits, according to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.
That threatens not only to hit actual levels of spending by some 30 million people claiming those benefits, but also raise the fear of future unemployment among those who still have a job, making them less inclined to spend.
While the Covid-19 virus has shown signs of plateauing in the south and west in recent days, White House Task Force Coordinator Deborah Birx warned on Thursday that it is spreading more broadly across the Midwest, due largely to travel since lockdowns were eased.
5. After Big Tech comes Big Oil
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) will both report earnings for the quarter in which oil prices briefly turned negative.
Both are expected to swing to net losses after already flagging their intention to make massive write-downs of certain asset values, reflecting expectations that oil prices will stay lower for longer than previously though.
ConocoPhilips, the nation’s third-largest producer, said on Thursday it lost over $1 billion in the quarter due to lower prices and output, but added that it had expected to be back at full production by September.
U.S. crude futures were up 0.4% at $40.09 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent was up 0.3% at $43.38 a barrel"

State-owned Qatar Airways, one of the Middle East’s biggest carriers, has been building a stake in IAG since 2015 and now holds 25.1% of the company. 
IAG announced plans for the capital increase on Friday as it seeks to shore up its finances after the COVID-19 pandemic effectively brought the entire airline sector to a halt. 
It said that Qatar would back the move and subscribe for its pro rata entitlement. The Gulf carrier will also propose two directors to join the board as non-executive directors, within Qatar's proportionate representation rights under Spanish law, IAG added.
The Spanish-registered group, which also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus, said its annual shareholder meeting would be held on Sept. 8, at which shareholders will be asked to approve the capital increase. 
""We believe our shareholders will be supportive,"" IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh told Ireland's RTE Radio. 

If approved, the capital increase is expected to be launched as soon as possible after the shareholders meeting.

488,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>",Exclusive: SenseTime eyes STAR market IPO after $1.5 billion fundraising - sources,"By Yingzhi Yang, Kane Wu and Cheng Leng
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese start-up SenseTime is considering an initial public offering (IPO) on China's tech-focused STAR market after its latest fundraising that will value the company at $10 billion, three people with knowledge of the matter said.
The artificial intelligence company, which Washington put on a trade blacklist in October last year, is expected to raise $1.5 billion from the funding round which is due to be completed soon, two of the people said.
SenseTime, which provides technology-based applications including facial recognition，video analysing and autonomous driving, has been in talks with Chinese securities regulators for the Shanghai listing in recent weeks, one of the people said.
The plan for listing on China's year-old STAR market for start-ups is still preliminary with size and timetable undecided, said the sources, who did not want to be named as the information is confidential. 
Hong Kong-headquartered SenseTime declined to comment. The China Securities Regulatory Commission did not immediately respond to a request to comment. 
One of the people said that SenseTime's STAR listing process would take a while, and that there was no obvious valuation benchmark for investors as its main homegrown rival Megvii has not listed yet.
SenseTime's founder Tang Xiaoou had told Reuters in 2017 that the start-up was considering a listing in U.S, Hong Kong, or China https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sensetime-ipo-exclusive/exclusive-chinas-sensetime-plans-ipo-u-s-rd-center-as-early-as-2018-idUSKBN1DN0FY.
The U.S. ban has made an overseas listing difficult, if not impossible, as global investors and investment banks are likely to shy away from companies being targeted by the United States, two of the people said. 
The company was among eight Chinese tech companies placed on the U.S. entity list in October amid trade tensions between Beijing and Washington. The U.S. alleges the companies have played a role in human rights abuses against Muslim minority groups in China.
SenseTime said at the time that it strongly opposed the U.S. ban and would work with relevant authorities to resolve the situation.
Reuters reported in December that the five-year-old start-up had told investors it expected its 2019 revenue to increase by more than 200% year-on-year to around $750 million despite China-U.S. tensions. 

The company counts Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Ventures, part of U.S. semiconductor group Qualcomm, as one of its strategic investors. Other existing investors include SoftBank Vision Fund, HOPU Investment Management Company, Silver Lake Partners and  Alibaba  (N:BABA).

489,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>",Column: Keep Social Security and Medicare reform out in daylight where we can all watch,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Charlie Rich, the late country music singer and songwriter, had it right when he crooned this famous line: “Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors.” We need to remind Congress of the truth of that line as it tries to push a plan to negotiate changes to Social Security and Medicare as part of its latest pandemic relief bill.
Yes, you heard that right - in the midst of a raging pandemic, Senate Republicans are focusing on cuts to Social Security and Medicare.
That is the essence of the ironically named TRUST Act, the brainchild of Senator Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican. The bill is on track to be folded into the GOP relief plan. It would create a behind-closed-doors process for legislators to make changes to the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. Translation: it would allow lawmakers to do something the public clearly does not want - namely, cut benefits.
The TRUST Act calls for the U.S. Department of the Treasury to issue reports within 45 days of its passage on the financial status of the federal trust funds for Social Security, Medicare and federal highways. 
That would be followed by closed-door meetings of congressionally appointed bipartisan committees tasked with recommending legislation to restore solvency of the funds by June 1 next year. Finally - and crucially - Congress would be required to give the proposals an up-or-down vote, with no amendments allowed.
Social Security and Medicare do face financial challenges.
The combined trust funds for Social Security’s retirement and disability programs are on course to be depleted in 2035; without changes, funding from payroll tax receipts will be sufficient to pay only 80% of currently scheduled benefits. 
That is a problem that needs to be addressed, and House Democrats have been doing it through a transparent process of hearings. Their proposed legislative vehicle is the Social Security 2100 Act, sponsored by U.S. Representative John Larson, a Connecticut Democrat. It would restore Social Security’s financial solvency for the next 75 years, and includes modest broad and targeted benefit increases. The Larson plan https://reut.rs/2XbyZOG is funded by adding new payroll taxes to wages over $400,000 (currently, tax collection stops at $137,700 of annual income), and by gradually phasing in higher payroll tax rates.
Medicare faces a more immediate financial problem. The program’s Hospital Insurance trust fund - which finances Part A of the program - is financed mainly through a 2.9% payroll tax split by employers and employees. (Higher-income taxpayers also pay a higher payroll tax, of 2.35%, on earnings.) 
Before the pandemic, Medicare’s trustees projected that the fund would be exhausted in 2026. Now, that date could accelerate, depending on exactly how the pandemic impacts the fund. One recent independent analysis https:// suggests the exhaustion date could come as early as 2022 or 2023 as the recession cuts sharply into payroll tax receipts.
PROCESS PROBLEMS
But secret negotiations and fast-track votes are the wrong way to go, because this type of process opens the door to ideas that the public does not want.
Public opinion surveys https:// show that Americans worry about the future of Social Security and Medicare - and that when they are given a choice between raising taxes or cutting benefits, they choose taxes by a wide margin. 
Senator Joni Ernst, a Republican, explained it in surprisingly frank terms during a town hall meeting in her home state of Iowa last year. Ernst said members of Congress should hold discussions about Social Security “behind closed doors ... so we’re not being scrutinized by this group or the other, and just have an open and honest conversation about what are some of the ideas that we have for maintaining Social Security in the future.”
In Larson’s congressional committee, Republicans have proposed going on “a retreat” to negotiate on reform legislation.
No.
We need to see these discussions live and in the daylight, carried on C-SPAN, because previous Republican proposals tell us what they would now put forward in private. The big one is a gradual increase in the full retirement age - the age when you can qualify to receive your full benefit. This idea usually is framed with a vague assertion that “we’re all living longer,” so it makes sense to push the date back to avoid expanding the years of total coverage.
That assertion always has been false. The truth is that higher-income, better-educated people live longer than low-income Americans, especially people of color. And it is an outrageous idea to push in the midst of a pandemic, which will force millions of Americans to retire earlier than expected https://nyti.ms/30T5fXO due to the unique virus-driven recession.
The fast-track provision would hold lawmakers to an up-or-down vote on a reform plan, with no amendments allowed. ""It creates an opportunity for what politicians refer to as 'hold hands and jump,'"" said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, a leading progressive Social Security advocacy group. 
""That allows them to run away from specific parts of the legislation,"" she added. ""They can say 'I hated this idea but I had no choice.'""

492,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Bradesco plans long-term remote work, eyes 5-7% in cost savings","By Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian lender Banco Bradesco SA (SA:BBDC4) plans to have employees work from home an average of one week per month permanently in order to save on rent and sell some real estate, Chief Executive Octavio de Lazari Junior said in an interview.
Bradesco's remote work plans for its nearly 97,000 workers are the latest example of how the coronavirus pandemic has major companies rethinking real estate and redefining the workplace.
""Remote work full time is not productive, as people must exchange ideas and understand the bank's culture,"" Lazari said, explaining the balance between working from home and the office. ""We also had to take into account that Brazilians have different realities. Not everyone will be able to do a full workday from home.""
Bradesco estimates the new home office rotation will allow it to raise 600-800 million reais ($115-155 million) from the sale of real estate assets, while yielding annual savings of 100 million reais on rent. 
Currently, 94% of Bradesco's administrative staff and half its branch employees are working from home. Lazari himself said he is working just Mondays from the bank's headquarters.
He said he expects most of the workforce will start gradually returning to their offices by September or October, depending on the evolution of Brazil's outbreak, the world's second-worst after the United States.
The bank has bought half a million coronavirus tests for its employees. The end of assigned desks will allow flexible use of the remaining office space during the month.
The amount of time an employee eventually spends in the office will depend on their role. Those in telemarketing, for instance, will spend more than a week per month at home, while IT staff working on projects may spend more time in the office. 
The home office rotation is part of wider cost saving plans aimed at reducing Bradesco's total operating costs by between 5% and 7% next year, Lazari said, including cost controls on branch security, money transportation and other expenditures.
Bradesco will revamp roughly 700 of its more than 4,100 bank branches this year, focusing on business services rather than simple transactions such as bill payments and money transfers. Next year and in 2022, more branches will be revamped.

Lazari said reforms will cut costs per branch, as they will require less space, guards and armored cars to transport paper money. In discussing earnings on Thursday, Bradesco announced it will close more than 400 branches this year.

493,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China-backed hackers 'targeted COVID-19 vaccine firm Moderna',"By Christopher Bing and Marisa Taylor
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chinese government-linked hackers targeted biotech company  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, a U.S.-based coronavirus vaccine research developer, this year in a bid to steal data, according to a U.S. security official tracking Chinese hacking.
China on Friday rejected the accusation that hackers linked to it had targeted Moderna.
Last week, the U.S. Justice Department made public an indictment of two Chinese nationals accused of spying on the United States, including three unnamed U.S.-based targets involved in medical research to fight the novel coronavirus.
The indictment said the Chinese hackers ""conducted reconnaissance"" against the computer network of a Massachusetts biotech firm known to be working on a coronavirus vaccine in January.
Moderna, which is based in Massachusetts and announced its COVID-19 vaccine candidate in January, confirmed to Reuters that the company had been in contact with the FBI and was made aware of the suspected ""information reconnaissance activities"" by the hacking group mentioned in last week's indictment. 
Reconnaissance activities can include a range of actions, including probing public websites for vulnerabilities to scouting out important accounts after entering a network, cybersecurity experts say. 
“Moderna remains highly vigilant to potential cybersecurity threats, maintaining an internal team, external support services and good working relationships with outside authorities to continuously assess threats and protect our valuable information,” said company spokesman Ray Jordan, declining to provide further detail. 
The U.S. security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not provide further details. The FBI and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declined to disclose the identities of companies targeted by Chinese hackers. 
Moderna's vaccine candidate is one of the earliest and biggest bets by the Trump administration to fight the pandemic.
The federal government is supporting development of the company's vaccine with nearly half a billion dollars and helping Moderna launch a clinical trial of up to 30,000 people beginning this month.
China is also racing to develop a vaccine, bringing together its state, military and private sectors to combat a disease that has killed more than 660,000 people worldwide. 
'BASELESS'
The July 7 indictment alleges that the two Chinese hackers, identified as Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi, conducted a decade-long hacking spree that most recently included the targeting of COVID-19 medical research groups.
Prosecutors said Li and Dong acted as contractors for China's Ministry of State Security, a state intelligence agency. Messages left with several accounts registered under Li’s digital alias, oro0lxy, were not returned. Contact details for Dong were not available.
China has consistently denied any role in hacking and its foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing, Wang Wenbin, rejected as ""baseless"" the accusation that hackers linked to the government had targeted Moderna.
China leads the world in the development of a coronavirus vaccine and it is more worried that other countries using hackers to steal its technology, he said.
""We absolutely do not nor need to engage in theft to achieve this leading position,"" Wang said.
The two other unidentified medical research companies mentioned in the Justice Department indictment are described as biotech companies based in California and Maryland. Prosecutors said the hackers “searched for vulnerabilities” and “conducted reconnaissance” against them. 
The court filing describes the California firm as working on antiviral drug research and suggested the Maryland company had publicly announced efforts to develop a vaccine in January. Two companies that could match those descriptions:  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD) and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc.
Gilead spokesperson Chris Ridley said the firm does not comment on cybersecurity matters. Novavax would not comment on specific cyber security activities but said: “Our cyber security team has been alerted to the alleged foreign threats identified in the news.” 

A security consultant familiar with multiple hacking investigations involving premier biotech firms over the last year said Chinese groups believed to be broadly associated with China’s Ministry of State security are one of the primary forces targeting COVID-19 research, globally. This matches the description of the indicted hackers, as ministry contractors.

495,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 05:49AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Opportunity Knocks for Nokia's New CEO,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Nokia (HE:NOKIA)is finally getting some uplift from the the U.S.-led campaign against its biggest rival Huawei.
The Finnish maker of telecoms network equipment said it expects sales to rise and margins to increase in the second half of the year, as network operators who were put off from some big-ticket orders in the first half due to the pandemic get around to signing new contracts for 5G delivery.
As with its Swedish competitor Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), the long-term competitive outlook for Nokia (NYSE:NOK) continues to improve as the U.S.’s determination to squeeze Huawei out of western markets slowly persuades traditional allies to fall in with Washington’s lead.
The company reported adjusted operating profit of 423 million euros for the second quarter, beating consensus forecasts by more than one-third.
Nokia now expects operating margin to improve to 9.5% (albeit still within a wide range of possible outcomes) from a previous target of 9%, and earnings per share of 25 cents, up from a range mid-point of 23c in March. Nokia stock leaped by over 13% to a three-week high and is now tantalizingly close to a big upward gap that was created last October.
While sell-side analysts can expose themselves to accusations of engineering upside ‘surprises’ for the stocks they cover, Nokia’s dismal performance over the last four years has given them ample reason to be pessimistic, so the element of surprise in Friday’s release is more real than for many other stocks. Revenue still came in below forecasts, after all.
Having missed out on much of the boom in orders for 5G equipment due to the difficulties of absorbing Alcatel-Lucent (PA:ALUA), which it bought in 2016, Nokia stock is long overdue some outperformance. It’s still down 26% over the last three years, a period in which Ericsson stock has risen 96%. Its price-earnings ratio, though high at 58x, is distorted by an abnormally low denominator, and is in any case only half of Ericsson’s 121x.
The key variable is, of course, delivery. Nokia appeared to have clinched a transformative deal with Alcatel-Lucent only four years ago, before undoing its good work with a botched integration.
As of next week, there’ll be a new CEO in charge: Pekka Lundmark, a Finn whose experience in the dour world of fossil-fired power stations with Fortum is a stark contrast with Rajeev Suri, who symbolized the embrace of a globalized market.  
Lundmark takes over at a favorable time, when Nokia’s new ReefShark chipset is making it more able to compete even without the help of geopolitical pressure and when – you might think – the worst of its cyclical and internal problems are behind it.
Still, until Lundmark can prove his ability to run a global company, it remains the riskier choice of Europe’s two big 5G suppliers."
496,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 05:40AM ET</span>",L'Oreal sees sales grow for first time since January,"PARIS (Reuters) - L'Oreal's (PA:OREP) sales rose in July for the first time since January, Chief Executive Jean-Paul Agon said on Friday, striking a more upbeat tone for the rest of the year with signs of a turnaround in China.
Temporary store closures and depressed demand during lockdowns to fight the coronavirus pandemic resulted in a sharper-than-expected 18.8% fall in second-quarter comparable sales, the owner of the Maybelline and Lancome brands said. 
A recovery in China, L'Oreal's biggest market, and booming online sales of skincare products and hair tints across other markets, which have continued to thrive even as retailers re-open, would help earnings improve, the company said.
L'Oreal shares were up 1.3% at 0837 GMT after falling in early trading. 
""The world will likely not experience lockdowns in a similar way to the first half, stores will likely remain open,"" Agon told a conference call with analysts. 
L'Oreal was hit as department stores shut their doors temporarily and airport duty free shopping dropped off a cliff during the height of coronavirus lockdowns. 
Make-up sales were hit particularly hard as consumers stayed at home, but shoppers still bought some cosmetics online and stocked up on other products. L'Oreal's e-commerce revenues accounted for a quarter of all sales, up from just under 16% at the end of 2019. 
Agon said L'Oreal had trimmed costs by freezing staff headcount and clamping down on travel, and had cut out some expenses in stores. These included make-up testing displays, which consumers were not using during the crisis. 

The company still planned to invest in marketing campaigns, however, including online, to promote new product launches in the second half, Agon said.

HELSINKI/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Finnish telecom network equipment maker Nokia (NYSE:NOK) reported an unexpected rise in second-quarter underlying profit on Friday as it took on less low-margin business particularly in China, sending its shares up 13% in early trade.
Cutting less-profitable service business and not winning 5G radio deals in the cut-throat Chinese market helped Nokia, where new Chief Executive Pekka Lundmark takes over this weekend, upgrade its earnings outlook for 2020. 
""We do not mind trading poor revenue which doesn't have high quality margin for better revenue,"" outgoing chief executive Rajeev Suri told Reuters.
Nokia said its underlying earnings in April through June rose to 0.06 euros per share from 0.05 euros a year ago, beating the 0.03 euros consensus in a Refinitiv poll. 
Nokia, which had warned of a weak second quarter due to the virus, raised its forecast for 2020 underlying earnings per share to between 0.20 and 0.30 euros, from 0.18-0.28 euros.
Quarterly revenue fell 11% to 5.09 billion euros, below a consensus figure of 5.28 billion, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.
Most of the drop was due to the effects on the economy of COVID-19, but Suri also cited a sharp decline in China based on a ""prudent approach"" in that market, and proactive steps to reduce low-margin services business, though he didn't say what the latter consisted of. 
Nokia lowered its outlook for its market share in its main markets, measured by revenue, to underperform from its previous guidance of performing in line with rivals.
Suri's successor Lundmark still faces key decisions on finding a balance between improving profitability and defending Nokia's market share, which currently makes it number two behind China's Huawei [HWT.UL] but ahead of Sweden's Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) when measured by revenue. 
""While the improvement in profitability from extremely low levels is clearly very encouraging, we are unsure on how much further Nokia can take such an improvement when sales are coming under significant pressure,"" Liberum analyst Janardan Menon said.
Ericsson had reported a rise in 5G network sales and software revenue two weeks ago. 

Suri steps down after more than a decade in charge of Nokia and Nokia Siemens Networks. The leadership change comes as turbulence prevails in European telecoms markets, with increasing pressure from some governments for operators to exclude or limit the use of 5G equipment from Huawei.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Friday, helped by continued support from the European Central Bank and some positive corporate earnings, despite weak growth data and the continued threat of the Covid pandemic.
At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.7% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.6% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 0.5%. 
The second-quarter GDP data from France and Spain followed Thursday’s lead from both Germany and the U.S., reporting horrific drops of 13.8% and 18.5% in the quarter, respectively, caused by the lockdowns imposed to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. The official EU release is later in the session.
Against that backdrop, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde told French daily Le Courrier Cauchois that the ECB has to maintain its massive bond purchases ""at least until June 2021"" to help underpin the economy.
The pandemic shows few signs of slowing down, with global cases approaching 17,300,000, according to Johns Hopkins data, and deaths well over 670,000. A number of countries, including some in Europe, have seen rising numbers of new coronavirus infections, suggesting the lifting of lockdown measures has bred a second wave.
Still, there was some positive second-quarter corporate earnings news Friday. 
 BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) stock rose 5.3% after the French bank posted net profit of EUR2.30 billion, down just 6.8%, despite setting aside 1.45 billion euros ($1.72 billion) to cover credit losses. The bank's fixed-income trading division generated more money than any Wall Street bank's in the quarter, with the exception of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Nokia (HE:NOKIA) stock rose 13% after the Finnish maker of network equipment lifted full-year guidance on stronger profitability and cash generation.
 British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS) rose 1.8% after reporting a first-half profit. The tobacco giant also noted that it was awaiting U.S. approval to start a trial of its Covid-19 vaccine.
On the flip side, International Consolidated Airlines (MC:ICAG), the owner of British Airways, posted a net loss for the first half of fiscal 2021, and announced plans to raise 2.75 billion euros as the pandemic weakened its financial position. IAG (LON:ICAG) stock fell 7%.
Oil prices edged higher, recovering from three-week lows hit on Thursday in reaction to the U.S. GDP and jobless claims numbers. 
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are due to increase production by about 2 million barrels a day, starting in August.
U.S. crude futures traded 1% higher at $40.31 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1% to $43.67. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1.5% to $1,972.35/oz, set for the biggest monthly gain in more than four years, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1884, up 0.3%, on course for its best month in nearly 10 years.

Abramovich, Chelsea soccer club owner, is selling Highland Gold, in which he was a shareholder for many years, at a time when gold price  is close its record high as the COVID-19 pandemic drives investors towards the metal as a safe haven.
Fortiana Holdings Limited, a Cyprus-registered company of Vladislav Sviblov with interests in zinc and gold projects in Siberia, agreed to buy 145,759,871 shares in Highland Gold from Abramovich and his partners at 3.00 pounds ($3.94) per share.
Highland Gold is one of the top 10 gold producers in Russia with several mines in Russia's Far East. The offer will value the entire company at $1.4 billion, with a 4% premium to the market close on Thursday.
""This is a strategic investment for us, in line with our aim to build a broader asset portfolio in the natural resources sector in Russia,"" Sviblov said in the statement.
The price of the offer to remaining shareholders is expected to be not less than in this deal. The offer is expected to complete in the fourth quarter of 2020.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank-backed online fashion retailer Zozo Inc's (T:3092) shares closed up 21% on Friday in their largest single-session gain, a day after reporting a 34% jump in first-quarter operating profit as Japanese consumers embrace online shopping. 
The results are a bright spot in a fashion industry hammered by the coronavirus outbreak as consumers stay home, benefiting from brands shifting unsold inventory to the site. 
The profit growth is a tailwind for CEO Kotaro Sawada, who took over from flamboyant founder Yusaku Maezawa after the sale to SoftBank Group (T:9984), which exerts control via its domestic internet business Z Holdings (T:4689).
Maezawa pushed Zozo into the headlines with splashy but unsuccessful ventures like the Zozosuit body measuring suit but alienated key business partners. Tenants like Onward Holdings (T:8016) have returned to the site under the new management. 
SoftBank is making a major push into ecommerce with Amazon (O:AMZN) and Rakuten (T:4755) contender PayPay Mall. The site also features Zozo, which hopes to bring in new customers beyond its fashion-loving base. 
Zozo sees full year gross merchandise value, a measure of transaction volumes, rising 12% year-on-year to 387 billion yen, with operating profit seen rising 42% to 40 billion yen.

504,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 03:18AM ET</span>","Spain’s Economy Shrinks 18.5%, Deepest Recorded in Europe So Far","(Bloomberg) -- Spain’s economy shrank more than forecast in the second quarter, leaving it with a long-haul recovery that’s become even more complicated because of additional headwinds facing the tourism industry.
The record 18.5% drop in output -- led by plunges in consumer spending and investment -- is the deepest reported so far in Europe, where restrictions to control the coronavirus battered businesses and households. Economists had expected a contraction of 16.6% in output.
The virus fallout has been widespread and figures Thursday showed Germany, Europe’s largest economy, shrank 10% in the second quarter. The threat of job cuts across the continent and a renewed wave of infections mean a recent rebound in activity may not be sustained. The euro-area probably shrank about 12% in the period, according to a Bloomberg survey.
Spain had one of the earliest and deadliest outbreaks of the coronavirus in Europe along with Italy, and the government responded with a strict lockdown. Even with huge monetary stimulus by the European Central Bank, and an historic 750 billion-euro ($893 billion) European Union recovery fund, the country is facing a slow recovery.
The Spanish economy is heavily reliant on tourism, a sector that’s been slammed by the pandemic. A bad summer season took a turn for the worse when the U.K. announced last weekend that holidaymakers returning from Spain would have to quarantine because of an uptick in coronavirus cases in regions such as Catalonia.
The Spanish economy has also been particularly affected by the crisis because of the relatively small size of its companies, which leaves them more vulnerable and less capable of effectively responding to the shock. Business associations expect tens of thousands of small and medium-sized companies to go bankrupt before the end of the year.
Spain’s statistics agency warned of the difficulty in measuring economic output in the second quarter, when many Spaniards were in the depths of the country’s strict confinement. Revisions in the future could be greater than normal, it said."
505,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 02:45AM ET</span>","KLM says 1,500 new layoffs to bring total job cuts to 20%","AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - KLM, the Dutch arm of Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF), said on Friday it would cut 1,500 additional jobs as part of a restructuring in which it needs to cut emissions by 50% by 2030 as well as prepare for recovering traffic after the coronavirus crisis.
Parent company Air France-KLM on Thursday reported a 1.55 billion euro ($1.8 billion) operating loss for the second quarter, with traffic down 95% from a year earlier.
KLM said the new cuts would mean its workforce, which was 33,000 before the pandemic, would be reduced by 20% in all by 2022. It did not rule out further cuts.
""In all scenarios, demand is only expected to recover by 2023 or 2024 at the earliest,"" Chief Executive Pieter Elbers said in a statement.
The restructuring was aimed at retaining as many ""jobs as we can in a responsible manner and repaying loans as quickly as possible,"" he said.
By comparison, Air France SA plans to cut 6,500 jobs, or 16% of its workforce, through 2022..
The Dutch and French governments have given the two national carriers, which merged in 2004, a combined 10.4 billion euros ($12.4 billion) in bailout money, in a mix of loans and loan guarantees. 
Conditions imposed by the Dutch government include pay cuts for executives and pilots, and a ban on bonuses and dividends.
KLM, while smaller than Air France, contributed more to group profits in the years before 2020, leading at times to friction between the French and Dutch governments. 
Traffic is gradually resuming at KLM, although Elbers said the latest uptick in cases in many countries could threaten that. 

While most of KLM's routes have been restored, it said last week it planned to operate about 13,000 flights in August, still down 60% from the same month a year ago.

A decision on Monday by the board to back Vetter, a former chief executive of Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg, would go some way toward filling a leadership vacuum at the top of Germany's No. 2 bank.
Commerzbank declined to comment.
The lender was thrust into turmoil earlier this month when Chief Executive Martin Zielke and supervisory board Chairman Stefan Schmittmann said they would step down to give the bank a fresh start.
That followed a public campaign for change by top investor, the U.S. private equity firm Cerberus, which holds a 5% stake in the bank.
The supervisory board is due to convene on Monday about the chair position, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters.

Bloomberg first reported Vetter's candidacy on Thursday.

508,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 02:02AM ET</span>",Stocks - Europe Seen Mixed; French GDP Weighs,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening mixed Friday, helped by signs of economic recovery in Asia but with weak French growth data and rising global Covid cases still weighing.
At 2 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 1.6% lower, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.1%, while CAC 40 futures in France fell 0.2%.
Earlier Friday, China's official Purchasing Managers' Index data showed that factory activity grew in the second largest economy in the world in July for a fifth straight month and at a faster pace, while Japan's industrial output snapped four months of decline in June.
This provides welcome relief after second-quarter GDP data for both Germany and the U.S. showed horrific drops in growth Thursday, caused by the lockdowns imposed to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. 
French GDP followed the theme Friday, dropping by 13.8% in the second quarter, preparing the path for the official EU release later in the session.
“We know second-quarter GDP growth …. will be horrible,” said analyst Peter Vanden Houte at ING, in a research note. “The 10.1% drop in 2Q German GDP already sets the tone. But that is old news. The markets are now focusing on indicators that can give a flavor of the strength of the recovery now that all countries have come out of lockdown.”
That said, the Covid-19 pandemic shows few signs of slowing down, with global cases approaching 17,300,000, according to Johns Hopkins data, and deaths well over 670,000. A number of countries around the world, including some in Europe, have seen rising numbers of new coronavirus infections, suggesting the lifting of lockdown measures has bred a second wave.
The earnings season continued at a pace in Europe Friday. 
 BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) set aside 1.45 billion euros ($1.72 billion) in the second quarter to cover credit losses, but the French bank’s net profit fell just 6.8% to EUR2.30 billion.
Elsewhere,  Swiss Re  (SIX:SRENH) posted a net loss of $1.14 billion, hit by coronavirus-related claims, but the Swiss reinsurer expressed confidence about the rest of 2020.
EssilorLuxottica (PA:ESLX) reported a loss of 412 million euros, and the Franco-Italian eyewear manufacturer was unable to provide guidance for the rest of the year.  
Oil prices edged higher, recovering from three-week lows hit on Thursday in reaction to the U.S. GDP and jobless claims numbers. 
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries will soon become the focus after the group decided earlier this month to dial back production cuts, a move that will see an increase in production of about 2 million barrels a day starting in August.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $40.15 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.6% to $43.51. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1.4% to $1,969.30/oz, set for the biggest monthly gain in more than four years, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1884, up 0.3%, on course for its best month in nearly 10 years.

Britain's vote to leave the EU has forced banks to examine where to base their operations, given that the system of unfettered market access they have enjoyed on both sides of the English Channel, known as passporting, will end.
A Brexit transition period runs out at the end of the year, and details of the future relationship between Britain and EU have not yet been agreed.
""Selling financial services from the UK to EU clients will not be allowed,"" the bank said in a press release while reporting quarterly results. ""In the UK, the front office roles, mainly sales positions, and their associated set-up positions are impacted by these measures"".
BNP said some 400 new positions were being created in Europe, of which 160 were in the front office and 240 in support functions. As of the end-June, 260 of those positions have been taken up, it added.
It did not give details of where those new positions were based, or mention any corresponding job losses in London.

""The group is already prepared for the end of the Brexit transition period in December 2020,"" it said.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly down on Friday morning, with Chinese factory output continuing to expand but doubts creeping in over the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19.
The National Bureau of Statistics said earlier in the day that China’s official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for July was 51.1, higher than the previous month’s reading of 50.9, and indicating an expansion in factory activity.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.62% by 11:03 PM ET (4:03 AM GMT), reversing some earlier gains. Meanwhile, the Shenzhen Component gained 1.12%.
Across the Pacific Ocean, the U.S. released dismal data on Thursday which showed that U.S. GDP collapsed by 32.9% in the second quarter and 1.434 million unemployment claims were submitted for the week ending July 25. Although the figures beat analyst forecasts prepared by Investing.com, investors are digesting the highest GDP collapse since the Great Depression.
The dismal data eclipsed tech companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posting stellar earnings on Thursday. The U.S. also continues to battle a surge of COVID-19 cases, with almost 4.5 million cases reported as of July 31 according to Johns Hopkin University data.
“It’s shocking no matter how you look at it,” Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Schwab Center for Financial Research, told Bloomberg.
“The virus is getting worse in a lot of areas, and some places have started to shut back down again. If you look at earnings in terms of beat rates, the results have actually been pretty good, granted the expectations bar has been set very low.”
Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.51%. The city reported a record 149 cases on Thursday, but the government reversed an all-day dining ban, which began on Wednesday, from Friday onwards.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 2.15% and South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.39%
Down Under the ASX 200 fell 1.82%. Australia continues to grapple with a surge in COVID-19 cases, with the second largest city of Melbourne reporting a record 723 cases."
511,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 11:10PM ET</span>",Apple's stock split may not be good for the Dow,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced a stock split on Thursday and it may not bode well for future gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
The iPhone maker made the surprise announcement in its quarterly report, saying it will split its stock four-to-one when trading opens on Aug. 31, Apple's first share split since 2014.
Stock splits have become rare on Wall Street in recent years, with just three S&P 500 members announcing splits in 2020, compared to an average of 10 a year over the past decade, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Splitting their stocks is a way for companies to make it less expensive to buy individual shares, potentially attracting retail investors who make small trades. 
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s shares cost $3,051 each, while an Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) share sells for $1,538 and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG)'s shares cost $1,148.
With Apple's stock surging 6% in extended trade to $408 following its strong quarterly report, the split means shareholders will receive three shares for every one that they own. Investors will be able to buy shares for closer to $100 each.
Apple said it hoped to make the shares ""more accessible to a broader base of investors."" 
However, brokerages increasingly let customers buy parts of shares, making the benefit of share splits less clear than in the past. 
""Stock splits have become far and few between because people no longer care if it's a $500 or $100 stock, because investors can now buy fractions of shares,"" said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Splitting Apple's shares means the Silicon Valley company will have less influence within the Dow, which is weighted to the price of the shares of its 30 components. 
Apple was added to the Dow in 2015, and the 230% gain in Apple's stock since then has been a major factor driving gains in the Dow, widely viewed as a reflection of the U.S. stock market.
Apple currently accounts for about 10% of the Dow, and after the share split, it will make up only a quarter of that, ranking it the 18th most heavily weighted stock in the Dow. Potential future gains and losses in Apple's stock will have less influence in the Dow's performance. 
Apple's stock split will not affect its weight within the S&P 500, which is based on market capitalization.

The U.S. microblogging site said the hackers targeted about 130 accounts, tweeted from 45, accessed inbox of 36, and were able to download Twitter data from seven. 
Attackers also targeted specific employees who had access to account support tools, Twitter said https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html, adding that it restricted access to its internal tools and systems ever since the incident occurred.
Hackers had accessed Twitter's internal systems on July 15 to hijack some of the platform's top voices including U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden, reality TV star Kim Kardashian, former U.S. President Barack Obama and billionaire Elon Musk and used them to solicit digital currency.
Publicly available blockchain records show the apparent scammers received more than $100,000 worth of cryptocurrency.
The ""spear-phishing"" technique is a practice of sending emails ostensibly from a known or trusted sender in order to induce targeted individuals to reveal confidential information.

Reuters reported last week that more than a thousand Twitter employees and contractors as of earlier this year had access to internal tools that could change user account settings and hand control to others, making it hard to defend against the hacking.

Berkshire bought about 21.2 million Bank of America shares from July 28 to 30, according to a regulatory filing.
Following those purchases, Berkshire owned a total of 1.02 billion shares in Bank of America which roughly represents an 11.8% stake in the company. 
Berkshire has spent more than $1.7 billion on 71.5 million Bank of America shares since July 20, including the latest purchases, according to regulatory filings.
Berkshire began investing in Bank of America in 2011, a time many investors worried about the bank's capital needs, when it acquired $5 billion of preferred stock plus warrants to buy 700 million common shares.
By the end of March, Bank of America had become Berkshire's second-largest common stock investment, trailing only Apple Inc (O:AAPL). Berkshire also invests in several other banks. 

The latest purchases help Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire reduce its cash pile, which totaled $137.2 billion at the end of March.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines said on Thursday it has decided to drop its contract with ExpressJet, and consolidate all of its outsourced flying on 50-seat planes with regional rival CommutAir.
The decision could be a fatal blow to ExpressJet, which will begin to wind down its operations, according to a memo from Chief Executive Subodh Karnik to employees seen by Reuters.
Reuters reported United's choice between the two carriers on Monday, after it saw a union letter to ExpressJet pilots warning that the choice could have a ""dramatic impact"" on the future of ExpressJet.
In a statement on Thursday, United said CommutAir will become its sole operator of  Embraer SA  (NYSE:ERJ) E145 50-seat planes, under a transition that will take a number of months.
Chicago-based United has minority stakes in both ExpressJet and CommutAir, which bring passengers from smaller markets to destinations that United itself serves on larger jets.
United was ExpressJet's sole client, which like other global airlines is suffering from the coronavirus pandemic that has decimated air travel demand.
ExpressJet did not comment on the contents of Karnik's memo.
But in a statement, it said: ""We are very disappointed that United Airlines did not select ExpressJet Airlines to be its future ERJ145 United Express operator.""

ExpressJet said it will now explore all options for the company's future in 2021, while it expects to continue normal operations through the rest of this year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group said on Friday it has approved a 1 trillion yen ($9.6 billion) share repurchase, the final tranche of a record 2.5 trillion buyback that has helped propel its share price to two decade highs.
The Japanese conglomerate unveiled in March a 4.5 trillion yen plan to buy back shares and reduce debt. It has so far approved buybacks of two tranches of 500 billion yen each. In addition it announced a 500 billion yen buyback in March. 
SoftBank said in a statement the 4.5 trillion yen programme had intended to be executed over four quarters from the time of the original announcement, but that it was possible the repurchase may not be completed until April 2021 or later.
Under the plan the group has been selling down core assets including stakes in Chinese ecommerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding and U.S. wireless carrier T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc. 
SoftBank shares climbed as much as 2% following the announcement, with its share price up 43% year-to-date. 
The highly leveraged group, a contrast to its cash laden Japanese peers, has repurchased 170 billion yen of its domestic unsecured corporate bonds. 
With the proceeds from asset sales potentially more than its targeted amount, ""excess funds are likely being considered for Vision Fund 2"", wrote Kirk Boodry, analyst at Redex Research, in a note on the Smartkarma platform. 
SoftBank has struggled to attract outside investment for a second fund after the poor performance of the first $100 billion fund, and has been investing in a limited capacity using its own money. 
The fund can point to positive newsflow in recent weeks including the successful IPO of portfolio company Lemonade Inc, which listed in New York this month.

China’s state-owned oil giant is having advanced discussions with BP for a 10% stake in the Khazzan natural gas field, the people said. The minority stake could fetch about $1.5 billion, said the people, asking not to be identified as the matter is private.
No final decisions have been made and others have also expressed interest in the asset, the people said. Representatives for BP and CNPC declined to comment.
BP was in early talks to sell about a 10% stake in the Khazzan natural gas field, Bloomberg News reported in June. The oil major owns a 60% stake in the project, while its partner Oman Oil Co. still has a 30% stake after it sold a 10% holding to Malaysia’s state oil company in 2018.
China has been stepping up its presence in the Middle East as Beijing wants to increase its global influence and revive ancient trading routes under the Belt and Road initiative. Last year, State Grid Corp. of China agreed to acquire a 49% stake in Oman’s state-owned power transmission company in the first major privatization by the Middle East’s largest non-OPEC oil producer.
CNPC has operations in five Middle Eastern countries, including Oman, according to its website. It started in Oman with an acquisition of a 50% interest in oil field Block 5 in 2002. The Chinese oil giant paid about $1.2 billion in 2018 for stakes in two oil and natural gas concessions in Abu Dhabi.
BP shares declined 3.6% Thursday, as Brent crude futures fell the most in more than a month following dramatic U.S. economic data. The recovery in global oil demand is faltering amid the resurgence in coronavirus, even as the OPEC cartel and partners, including Oman, next week plan to resume some of the crude output halted during the depths of the pandemic.

518,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 08:25PM ET</span>",VW asks U.S. appeals court to reconsider ruling on diesel emissions updates,"By David Shepardson
(Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p)'s wholly owned U.S. subsidiary on Thursday asked the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals to reconsider a ruling that said two counties could seek financial penalties over excess diesel emissions that might cost the German automaker billions of dollars.
The 3-0 ruling in June said Utah's Salt Lake County and Florida's Hillsborough County could seek ""staggering"" damages over updates made to polluting diesel vehicles after they were sold. Other U.S. counties are also pursuing claims.
Volkswagen Group of America said the ruling, if upheld, could have sweeping ramifications for the U.S. auto industry and could force car companies ""either to avoid maintaining or improving the emission control systems of in-use vehicles... or pass on the substantial increased compliance costs to consumers.""
VW asked the panel to reconsider its ruling or for the full appeals court to take up the case, warning the decision could affect millions of vehicles recalled for emissions vehicles annually and could result in ""regulatory chaos.""
Volkswagen admitted to using illegal software to cheat U.S. pollution tests in 2015.
VW argues the case will determine if the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ""exclusively regulates auto manufacturers’ post-sale, nationwide changes to their cars’ emission control systems, or whether, as the panel held, all fifty states and thousands of counties also may regulate this post-sale process.""
The Justice Department opted not to offer its views before the appeals court ruled in June.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and automaker trade groups told the court earlier the issue could allow states and cities ""to disrupt the EPA regulatory process through imposition of their own tampering prohibitions.""
Volkswagen settled U.S. criminal and civil actions prompted by the emissions scandal for more than $20 billion, but that did not shield it from local and state government liability, the court found.
The judges wrote they were ""mindful that our conclusion may result in staggering liability for Volkswagen. But this result is due to conduct that could not have been anticipated by Congress: Volkswagen's intentional tampering with post-sale vehicles to increase air pollution.""
U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, who ruled in VW's favor in 2018 on the issue, noted the automaker's ""potential penalties could reach $30.6 million per day and $11.2 billion per year.

The scandal has cost VW 30 billion euros ($35.5 billion) in fines, penalties and vehicle buyback costs worldwide to date.

519,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 08:20PM ET</span>","Apple delivers blowout earnings amid COVID-19, market shrugs off iPhone delays","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) on Thursday delivered blowout quarterly results, reporting revenue gains across every category and in every geography as consumers working and learning from home during the COVID-19 pandemic turned to its products and services.
The report topped Wall Street expectations, with even long-overshadowed categories like iPads and Macs getting a boost. Shares rose as much as 6% in extended trading after the results.
The fiscal third-quarter results, which included iPhone sales some $4 billion above analyst expectations, came on the same day that U.S. gross domestic product collapsed at a 32.9% annualized rate last quarter, the nation's worst economic performance since the Great Depression.
Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri also confirmed supply chain rumblings that the new lineup of iPhones, usually released in late September, would face delays of a few weeks.
But executives predicted continued strong performance from the company's products.
Other major tech companies Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) also posted results that topped Wall Street targets, sending their shares up.
With 60% of sales coming from international markets, the Cupertino, California-based company posted iPhone revenues of $26.42 billion, $4 billion above analyst expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
In an interview with Reuters, CEO Tim Cook said that after disruptions in April, sales began to pick back up in May and June, helped by what he called a ""strong"" launch for the $399 iPhone SE introduced in April.
""I think the economic stimulus that was in place - and I'm not just focused on the U.S., but more broadly - was a help,"" Cook told Reuters.
The continued growth in services and accessories also showed the durability of the company's brand, which has prompted investors to view it as a comparative safe haven and pushed up share prices since March. 
GRAPHIC: Apple posts a surprise rise in revenue - https://graphics.reuters.com/APPLE-RESULTS/rlgpdnxmlpo/
The company saw strong sales in its greater China region, where aggressive pricing during a June holiday shopping season and lower-priced iPhone SE model released in April helped boost sales 2% to $9.33 billion.
""China remains a key ingredient in Apple’s recipe for success as we estimate roughly 20% of iPhone upgrades will be coming from this region over the coming year,"" Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities said in a note.
Apple also announced a 4-for-1 stock split, saying it wanted to keep shares accessible to a broad range of investors. Shares soared past $400 for the first time Thursday, though they had been proportionally higher before a 7-for-1 split in 2014.
Apple's fiscal third-quarter revenue and profits were $59.69 billion and $2.58 per share, compared with analyst expectations of $52.25 billion and $2.04 per share. 
Sales in its services segment, which also includes offerings such as iCloud and Apple Music, rose 14.8% to $13.16 billion, compared with and analyst expectations of $13.18 billion. Cook told Reuters that Apple has 550 million paying subscribers on its platform, up from 515 in the previous quarter.
Sales in the wearables segment that includes the Apple Watch rose 16.7% to $6.45 billion, compared with estimates of $6.0 billion.
Apple did not give a fiscal fourth-quarter forecast.
Apple benefited from remote work and learning trends, reporting sales in its iPad and Mac segments of $6.58 billion and $7.08 billion, which beat expectations of $4.88 billion and $6.06 billion.
""Both had some really significant product announcements at the end of March, beginning of April,"" Cook told Reuters. ""You combine that with the work from home and remote learning, and it's yielded really, really strong results.""
But the global smartphone market was already stagnating before the novel coronavirus caused it to contract, and Apple has leaned heavily into growing its services business, which is where the company's fastest revenue growth occurred during the fiscal third quarter. The biggest component of that business is the App Store, where Apple generates commissions between 15% and 30% on some sales. 

On Wednesday, Cook faced questions from U.S. lawmakers about Apple's practices related to the store, which have come under fire from independent app developers who say its rules and unpredictable approval process put them at a disadvantage against the iPhone maker.

520,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 08:15PM ET</span>","In India, a diminished Nissan bets big on a small SUV","By Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - By any measure, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) has had a dreadful run in India. A push to revive its lower-end Datsun brand flopped, sales have slumped 60% over the past five years and its sole plant in the country is operating way below capacity.
But the amount of money and energy that Nissan - battered by scandal and expecting a record $4.5 billion annual operating loss - will spend to turn its fortunes around in India will hinge on the sales of one vehicle, its new Magnite compact SUV, three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The SUV may also determine how much heft Nissan will wield as it and alliance partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) thrash out their respective roles in the Indian market.
Unveiled this month and due to be launched either late this year or early 2021, the Magnite will be Nissan's first new vehicle in India in two years. Moreover, it will be just one of three Nissan-branded models in the market after two others were pulled in April when tougher emission rules kicked in.
""Magnite will buy Nissan a couple of years to figure out a plan for India and the SUV's success will determine whether it invests more or scales down operations,"" said one source.
A second source called the sport-utility vehicle Nissan's ""last hope"" to revive the brand in India.
Japan's No. 2 automaker has, however, no plans to withdraw from India, where it has invested over $800 million, and discussions about strategy are ongoing, the sources said. They were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.
The Datsun brand is likely to be phased out as part of a global overhaul, they added. Nissan's only other models in India are three Datsun cars. 
Nissan said in a statement to Reuters it is committed to the Indian market and has a well-defined strategy for ""a sustainable and profitable business"". It declined to comment on sales goals for the Magnite.
WHO WILL LEAD?
Nissan's internal plans call for sales of 1,500 to 2,000 Magnites a month, the first source said - which if realised would exceed the average India monthly sales it achieved last business year with seven models.
The SUV will be priced ""aggressively"", the sources said without elaborating. Originally developed as a Datsun model, it is now expected to have features typically seen in a mid-range car, including a touchscreen and cruise control.
But the market is difficult - demand has been pummelled by the coronavirus pandemic and India's compact SUV segment is crowded. The Magnite will also go head to head with models from industry leaders - Maruti Suzuki's (NS:MRTI) Brezza and  Hyundai Motor 's (KS:005380) Venue.
Complicating matters, Nissan's India sales outlets have almost halved in number from around 270 in 2018 as dealers walked away from the brand, the third source said. The source added that Nissan hopes to export the model.
India represents a particularly thorny market for Nissan as it and Renault drastically restructure in the wake of former leader Carlos Ghosn's shock 2018 arrest and ouster.
To save resources, clarify decision-making and prevent overlap, the two firms have agreed to a 'leader-follower' strategy in key markets where one spearheads operations and the other is more in the backseat.
Nissan, for example, is taking the lead in the United States, China and Japan. But India is the sole major market where no such decision has been made, with the automakers saying they will coexist and compete. 
""If Magnite is successful, Nissan has stronger ground to argue to be the leader in India. If not, it is back to the discussion on who is bigger and smaller,"" said the first source.
On one hand, Nissan has less than 1% of the India market, selling just 18,000 vehicles in the last business year. Renault sold five times as many cars in the country.
But Nissan holds 70% of their jointly owned plant in the southern city of Chennai and exported 80,000 vehicles from the plant in the last business year, five times more than Renault. 
Two sources said the automakers are in talks for Renault to increase its stake in the plant, which can build 400,000 cars per year. The plant was operating at just 43% of capacity, Nissan said in January before the spread of the coronavirus in India.

Nissan did not respond to requests for comment on the stake sale talks or current utilisation rates. Renault also did not respond to requests for comment on the talks.

521,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 07:55PM ET</span>",Google ad rebound offsets Alphabet's first-ever sales drop,"By Paresh Dave and Munsif Vengattil
OAKLAND, Calif./BENGALURU (Reuters) - Google's ad sales have recovered since plummeting in March during the coronavirus pandemic, parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) said on Thursday, easing concerns about its first quarterly sales slide in its 16 years as a public company.
Alphabet shares were barely changed at $1,552, above their pre-pandemic high, after it said revenue fell 2% in the second quarter, less than analysts' estimate of a 4% decline.
Alphabet, whose ad sales account for about 78% of its revenue, has struggled during past economic slowdowns, as marketing is often the first budget item to get slashed.
But Google and its online advertising rivals  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) on Thursday all reported better results in the pandemic than in past recessions.
With its mostly free tools for web browsing, video watching and teleconferencing, Google has become a larger part of many consumers' lives as lockdown orders force people to rely on the internet for work and entertainment. In turn, the internet has become more attractive to advertisers than TV, radio and other avenues.
""We saw the early signs of stabilization as users returned to commercial activity online,"" Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts during a conference call on Thursday. 
Search ad sales at the end of June were about flat with a year ago, marking an improvement from a ""mid-teens"" percentage decline in March, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat told the analysts.
YouTube ad sales rose 6% in the second quarter, and were growing even faster by late June, Porat said. Sales of ads on partner properties fell 10% but were ""improving somewhat toward the end of the quarter as advertisers' spend began to return,"" she added.
Overall second-quarter revenue was $38.3 billion, with the slowest growth since a 2.9% increase during the Great Recession in 2009.
Alphabet announced a $28 billion boost to its share buyback program. It said it would still hire a big class of recent graduates even as it slashes spending on real estate and other activities. 
""What we're looking at is really how to reimagine what the workplace will look like,"" Porat said.
Total costs and expenses rose about 7% from a year ago to $31.9 billion in the second quarter, compared with a 12% jump a quarter ago.
Capital expenditures fell 12% to $5.4 billion, compared with a 3% drop last quarter.
Alphabet's profit was nearly $7 billion, or $10.13 per share, above analysts' average estimate of $5.6 billion, or $8.29 per share, for the quarter.
About 66% of its revenue came from Google search and YouTube ads, 12% from ads sold on partner properties online, 8% from its cloud business, and 14% from its mobile app store and about a dozen other smaller businesses.
But the company faces challenges across all those fronts. New data privacy laws, including one that went into effect this month in Google's home state of California, are depressing ad prices.
Antitrust regulators across the Americas, Europe and Asia are weighing whether Google has stifled competition on its way to dominating search, mobile software and other businesses, with some bodies even considering forcing it divest parts of its operations.

About 2,000 employees last month petitioned Google's emerging cloud business to scuttle deals with some police agencies, citing racial discrimination concerns. And whether a massive hiring spree will win other cloud clients is uncertain. Cloud sales in the second quarter of about $3 billion were in line with analysts' estimates.

The Plano, Texas-based driller filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. It joins a long list of other oil and gas producers that have been forced to seek protection in recent months. The most well-known of those names, Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK)., filed for Chapter 11 in June.
Denbury elected in mid-July to skip paying about $3 million of interest on senior subordinated notes maturing in 2023, triggering a 30-day grace period before it entered a formal default.
The U.S. energy industry has been hammered by low crude prices after the Covid-19 pandemic zapped demand, and natural gas prices have been depressed by a stubborn glut of domestic production. Many companies in the sector were circling the drain long before the pandemic, following years of heavy borrowing to fund constant drilling.

523,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 06:30PM ET</span>","Ford posts profit, but expects full-year 2020 loss","By Nick Carey and Ben Klayman
(Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) on Thursday said it expects a full-year loss but added it should have ample cash on hand throughout the rest of 2020, even if global demand falls further or the COVID-19 pandemic forces more shutdowns of vehicle assembly plants.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker also said that on July 27 it repaid $7.7 billion of an outstanding $15.4 billion on its revolving credit facilities, and extended $4.8 billion of its three-year revolving credit lines. 
Ford's comments came as the company posted a quarterly profit thanks to an investment by Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) in its self-driving Argo AI unit, more than offsetting a loss caused by a coronavirus-induced production shutdown.
The better-than-expected results and earnings outlook sent Ford's shares up 2.5% in after-market trading. 
""The strong execution enabled us to deliver much better financial results than we expected just three months ago,"" Chief Executive Jim Hackett said on a conference call with analysts.
German automaker VW last month closed its $2.6 billion investment in Argo, which now is valued at $7.5 billion. Each automaker has a stake of about 40% in Argo.
Ford said it expects a pre-tax profit of between $500 million and $1.5 billion for the third quarter and a loss for the fourth quarter, which features three significant product launches delayed by the shutdown earlier this year.
In April, Ford warned that its second quarter loss would more than double to more than $5 billion due to the coronavirus outbreak. 
Chief Financial Officer Tim Stone said a focus on cost-cutting, a productive restart following a two-month shutdown, strong performance by the automaker's captive finance arm and a solid pricing environment for its vehicles had helped mitigate the anticipated loss.
""With Ford having passed the worst of COVID upheaval, we believe the focus now returns to the company's redesign efforts. While the product opportunity is bright with F-150 and Bronco, there is more work to be done on restructuring,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Dan Levy said in a research note, referring to the company's popular pickup truck and the new SUV it will offer later this year.
The Dearborn, Michigan-based company said operating charges for its global restructuring would total $700 million to $1.2 billion for the year, down from $3.2 billion last year. Stone told reporters Ford's redesign was ""absolutely not stalled.""
Ford also said it had more than 150,000 reservations for the new Bronco, which launches in the fourth quarter. That number was above internal expectations and Ford executives said they are working to increase production further, including possibly adding another shift at a plant.
Ford ended the quarter with nearly $40 billion in cash, and said it should be able to maintain or exceed its target cash balance of $20 billion for the rest of 2020, even if global auto demand falls or if COVID-19 forces another big wave of plant closures.
Ford reported net income in the second quarter of $1.1 billion, or 28 cents a share, compared with a profit of $100 million, or 4 cents a share, a year earlier. 

Excluding items, Ford posted a second-quarter operating loss of $1.9 billion, or 35 cents a share. Analysts had expected a loss of $1.17 per share.

EA, popular for titles like ""Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order"" and ""Battlefield"", raised its full year adjusted revenue outlook to about $5.95 billion from about $5.55 billion, topping analysts' estimates of $5.61 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
EA earns a bigger chunk of its sales from live services, which include in-game purchases and ""EA Access"", a subscription-based online service, among other items.
Revenue from live services was up by $416 million in the quarter from a year earlier, primarily driven by ""FIFA"" and ""Sims"", a popular life simulation videogame, Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen told Reuters.
New players on ""FIFA"" more than doubled in the quarter. Data from Twitchtracker.com showed ""FIFA 20"" gameplay was watched for nearly 42,000 hours, on an average from April to June, up about 53% from the first three months.
Videogame sales have largely benefited as people played more games while staying at home and bought virtual in-game content across platforms, pushing June sales up 26% to $1.2 billion, which is the highest June spend in over a decade according to research firm NPD.
However, EA had earlier pushed the launch of its annualized football title ""FIFA 21"" to October, the start of its third quarter, which dragged current quarter adjusted revenue forecast of about $875 million below Street estimates of $1.29 billion.
Jorgensen said the company decided to give both FIFA and Madden NFL 21 two extra weeks in development which caused the delay.
EA shares, which jumped 29% this year, were up marginally after the bell.

Adjusted revenue for the first quarter ended June 30, rose to $1.39 billion, beating analysts' estimate of $1.05 billion.

In its report on 2019, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which is led by the Treasury Department and includes other government agencies, reviewed 231 transactions and did in-depth investigations of 113.
Amid a deterioration in U.S.-China ties, the number of deals involving Chinese companies reviewed by CFIUS dropped from 60 in 2017 to 55 in 2018 and 25 last year, the report showed.
In eight cases, CFIUS told the parties to the transactions that they could not identify a way to mitigate the national security harm and refused to approve the proposed deals, or the companies rejected the proposed mitigation. 

In a ninth case, CFIUS referred a deal to Trump, who prohibited it at the panel's recommendation. The report identified that deal as Beijing Shiji Information Technology Co's effort to buy StayNTouch, which allows hotel owners to manage their properties remotely.

Tech stocks were up modestly on Thursday in anticipation of the reports, helping the Nasdaq to close above the flat line. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 fell as investors took in government data showing a record plunge in economic output in the second quarter.
Big tech has notched gains despite weakness in most other S&P sectors. Apple, Amazon, Google's Alphabet, and Facebook combined make up $5 trillion in market value. They rank among the five largest stocks in the S&P.
2. Big pharma earnings also on tap
Merck & Company Inc (NYSE:MRK)reports earnings Friday morning before the opening bell. Analysts polled by Investing.com expect a 19% drop in earnings per share to $1.04 on revenue of $10.4 billion.
Covid-related lockdowns may have prevented people from starting cancer treatment this spring, which would have cut into the pharmaceutical giant's cancer drug sales. In April, Merck cut its 2020 outlook on EPS to a range of $5.17 to $5.37 and revenue in a range of $46 billion to $48 billion.
Merck is one of the companies working on a Covid vaccine, and executives may give an update on their progress. As Briefing.com noted, Merck trades at a forward multiple of 13, which is a premium to  Novartis AG  ADR (NYSE:NVS) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) but a discount to  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)and AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN)
3. Possibility of more dismal data on Friday
 After Thursday's dismal data on joblessness and economic output, Friday will feature reports on personal income and consumer sentiment. The personal income number for June is due out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). The consensus is looking for a decline of 0.9%, after a drop of 4.2% the prior month. Personal spending, also due out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT) is seen rising 5.9% compared to 8.2% the prior month.
At 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT) the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment data will be released. The outlook is for a reading of 73, down from 73.2 the prior month. The reversal of business reopenings across the country as new Covid cases spike is weighing on consumers' minds. On Thursday, the government reported an unprecedented 32.9% annualized plunge in gross domestic product in the second quarter and new jobless claims of 1.43 million.
Lawmakers still can't get together to pass another stimulus package, with a key sticking point being the $600 weekly pandemic unemployment benefit. A GOP proposal to slash that to $200 a week was rejected on Thursday. The benefit expires on Friday and some argue without its renewal, the economy will spiral into greater turmoil."

Shares of New York-based company were down 5% in extended trading.
Restaurants have been forced to bank heavily on sales from online orders and drive-thrus and also identify new ways to serve customers, as they battle constantly changing dynamics and consumer behaviors brought on by the health crisis.
Industry bellwether McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) on Tuesday said that drive-thru accounted for nearly 90% of its quarterly sales, while urban-centric Shake Shack has only started the design process for its first ever drive-thru location, planned to open in 2021.
The restaurant chain said same-store sales fell about 49% in the quarter ended June 24, as traffic more than halved. Total quarterly revenue fell to $91.8 million from $152.7 million, below average analysts' estimate of $93 million.
Digital sales accounted for three-fourths of the company's sales. 
Excluding one-time items, Shake Shack posted a loss of 45 cents per share, compared with market estimates of 37 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

It also said same-store sales decreased 39% between June 24 and July 22, with rural restaurants outperforming the urban ones.

Intesa overcame fierce opposition from UBI's management to take over Italy's healthiest second-tier bank, in a move that sent shockwaves through the industry and set the stage for possible further consolidation.
""It's a chess game and this first important move will have consequences for the entire sector,"" Massimo Masi, head of the UILCA union, said.
Intesa has said the deal will prepare the new group, Italy's biggest with around 950 billion euros in assets, to play a bigger role in Europe.
A generous increase of the terms of the bid helped Intesa cross a critical two-thirds majority threshold earlier this week, which guarantees approval of extraordinary shareholder decisions.
Intesa plans to merge UBI into the group to maximise savings and achieve a target of 700 million euros in synergies from 2024.
The final take-up exceeded expectations. Intesa had forecast acceptance could reach 85% in a best-case scenario, sources close to the matter had told Reuters.
Intesa will now offer to buy the residual UBI shares and investors can choose whether to tender them on the same terms of the bid or receive in cash the value of their UBI shares based on a five-day average calculated as of Thursday.
After naming a new board at UBI by mid-October at the latest, Intesa will be able to complete by the year-end the sale of 532 branches, mostly UBI's, which it has pledged to spin off to win antitrust approval.
An UBI shareholder meeting is expected to be called in the spring of 2020 to formally approve the merger into Intesa.

Investing.com - Apple reported on Thursday third-quarter results that beat analysts' forecasts as iPhone revenue topped estimates despite the impact from the Covid-19 pandemic.
The company approved a four-for-one stock split to ""make the stock more accessible to a broader base of investors.""
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares gained 1.23% in after-hours trade following the report.
Apple announced earnings per share of $2.58 on revenue of $59.69B. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $2.02 on revenue of $51.77B.
“Apple’s record June quarter was driven by double-digit growth in both Products and Services and growth in each of our geographic segments,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive. ""The record business results drove our active installed base of devices to an all-time high in all of our geographic segments and all major product categories.""
iPhone revenue rose 1.6% to $26.4 billion from a year earlier, topping estimates of $22 billion.
Revenue for the company’s fast-growing services segment, which includes Apple Music, Apple News and iCloud storage – rose 14.8% to $13.1 billion from a year earlier.
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) are up 31% from the beginning of the year, still down 3.77% from its 52-week high of $399.82 set on July 13. They are outperforming the Nasdaq 100 which is up 22.7% from the start of the year.
""Apple is well positioned to weather the pandemic-triggered downturn, helped by its services business, wearable products, and its stock buyback program. Along with strong momentum in the company’s services business, Apple is still driving innovation along with new ways to use technology hardware and software in order to fuel sales once the pandemic is contained. Any dip in Apple shares, in our view, should be taken as a buying opportunity, given the company’s strong global brand, cash position, and its push to diversify its revenue stream,"" Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said.

(Reuters) -  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) said on Thursday it has partnered with the U.S. unit of German rental car group Sixt SE to expand its in-app rental business to carless city dwellers eager to take a trip.
Lyft users can book a designated car through the ride-hailing app, add insurance and extras and directly pick up the car from the rental lot without waiting at the counter.
Lyft already runs a limited rental car program in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area without the involvement of any car rental companies. 
The new partnership allows it to quickly scale while avoiding the costs and regulations associated with owning and operating a national fleet.
""COVID has caused a change in behavior and people need different transportation options,"" Cal Lankton, Lyft's vice president of Fleet & Global Operations, said in an interview.
While rental car demand has plummeted across the country as a result of the pandemic and driven several companies, including Hertz Global Holdings (NYSE:HTZ) Inc, into bankruptcy, demand in large cities with lower car ownership rates has boomed.
In New York City, many rental locations have run out of cars and prices skyrocketed as residents seek to escape on extended trips.
Lankton said bookings for Lyft's Los Angeles rental fleet are higher than prior to the pandemic.
Sixt, for its part, is hoping the Lyft partnership will elevate its profile in the United States, where it primarily rents premium vehicles. One of the largest rental companies in Europe, the company has only 85 U.S. locations, the majority of them at airports.
""We have excellent customer ratings, but almost no one knows us here,"" said Sebastian Birkel, president of SIXT United States. ""So we have to grow as fast as we can.""

Birkel said Sixt was expanding downtown locations, but also believed business airport travel would return in the future.

Investing.com – The Dow ended above the lows of the day on Thursday, as gains in big tech kept a lid on losses from sectors tied to the progress of the economy in the wake of data showing the economy suffered its worst slump on record.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.85%, or 225 points, but had been down by 547 points at the lows of the day. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.43% and the S&P 500 slipped 0.34%.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) ended in the green ahead of their quarterly reports due after the closing bell.
Ahead of the earnings reports, some on Wall Street are betting that quarterly results will continue to show that big tech has benefited from the current environment.  
""The reality is that the strong are getting stronger with FAANG names such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple beneficiaries of the current environment and a dynamic front and center this week, which we believe will put further fuel into the tech rally moving forward,"" Wedbush analyst Danial Ives added.
Elsewhere in tech, chip stocks continued to power ahead thanks to a rally in chipmaker Qualcomm.
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) rallied 15% after reporting better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal third quarter and confirming it had settled a licensing dispute with Huawei that will boost revenue by $1.8 billion.
But financials and energy, both which are linked to the strength of the economy, were shunned following data showing U.S. GDP declined at an annualized rate of 32.9% in the second quarter of 2020, less bad than the expected decline of 34.5%, but still the biggest decline on record.
While the record decline in growth was largely priced in, investor hopes for a robust rebound still appear overly optimistic, with key data in the coming weeks likely to disappoint.
""With virus fears on the rise, jobs being lost and incomes squeezed, we feel the recovery could be much bumpier than markets seemingly do, and think we are in for some data disappointment over the next couple of months – starting with next week’s payrolls number,"" ING said in a note.
Energy fell nearly 4% to lead the broader market lower, pressured by falling oil prices on concerns about crude demand following weaker U.S. economic data.
Financials were not far behind, slipping about 2%, with banks including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  & Company (NYSE:WFC) in the red."

543,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 03:20PM ET</span>","S&P dips on grim data; U.S. election uncertainty, earnings","By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow were lower on Thursday after data painted a worrying picture of the economy, while President Donald Trump floated the possibility of delaying the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, feeding market uncertainty. 
Investors also fretted ahead of high-profile earnings reports and expiration of enhanced employment benefits on Friday while a polarized Congress kept negotiating its next stimulus package. 
Second-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data showed the U.S. economy suffered its steepest contraction since the Great Depression, as business activity came to a halt due to lockdowns aimed at fighting the pandemic.
Also jobless claims rose last week, adding to signs the momentum of economic recovery has slowed as coronavirus cases spiraled in southern and western U.S. states.
Shortly after the data, Trump, raised the idea of a delay in elections. The idea was immediately rejected by both Democrats and his fellow Republicans in Congress, the branch of government with the power to make that change.
But while the S&P was still lower it had pared losses sharply by late afternoon after hitting its session low, so far, at 1000 EDT (1400 GMT).
""Markets are trying to stabilize after having the door thrown open to the worry closet,"" said Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer, Abbot Downing in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
At 2:36 p.m. ET (1836 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 227.4 points, or 0.86%, to 26,312.17, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 14.19 points, or 0.44%, to 3,244.25 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 44.50 points, or 0.42%, to 10,587.44. 
Along with weak data, Schleif said worries included upcoming earnings from companies including Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Amazon.com (O:AMZN) and Washington's battle over stimulus along with uncertainty about the election.
But after the initial knee-jerk reaction, she said, people stepped back and focused on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's assurance on Wednesday that the central bank would ""do whatever it takes"" to support the economy. 
""You open the door it comes piling out, you're frightened and then you settle down and start picking stuff up and putting it back where it belongs,"" Schleif said.
The Fed also said a surge in virus cases was likely stalling the recovery, which will depend significantly on the virus path.
Trump administration officials planned more talks with lawmakers as hopes flagged for an agreement ahead of Friday's deadline.
Of the S&P 500's 11 major sectors energy (SPSY), financials (SPSY) and materials <.SPCM> lagged the most. Technology (SPLRCT) consumer discretionary (SPLRCD) and communications services (SPLRCS) eked out small gains. 
Still Wall Street's main indexes were headed for their fourth monthly gain in a row, with the benchmark S&P 500 only about 4% below its February record high.
""The markets have over the past several months been detached from reality and are being fueled by Fed buying and positive momentum,"" said Phil Toews, chief executive officer of Toews Corp in New York.
Tech-heavy Nasdaq was boosted by  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM), up 14.7%, after the chipmaker forecast fourth-quarter revenue largely above estimates.
Apple, Amazon.com, Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) were all due to report earnings after market close, with some on Wall Street questioning their valuations after this year's gains.

544,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 03:00PM ET</span>",United warns of more pilot furloughs as U.S. airlines eye second bailout,"By Tracy Rucinski and David Shepardson
CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Airlines (O:UAL) told its pilots it may need more furloughs than originally planned this year and next due to a worsening industry outlook as COVID-19 cases rise, unless there is another bailout or unions agree to reduce costs, a memo reviewed by Reuters showed.
The internal memo, which United confirmed was sent to pilots on Thursday, comes as unions lobby U.S. lawmakers to extend a $32-billion aviation stimulus plan that protected aviation workers' pay and jobs through September.
A second bailout, coined CARES Act 2.0, has Congressional support but could face hurdles among some Republican senators, people familiar with the matter said.
Airlines are suffering their worst crisis in history due to COVID-19, which crushed the U.S. economy in the second quarter.
Chicago-based United does not forecast a recovery until a vaccine is mass produced, something it does not expect until late 2021.
But once a recovery arrives, airlines say they need trained workers on hand to operate an industry that is vital to the global economy.
Tens of thousands of airline jobs are at risk.
FURLOUGH WARNINGS
""There are really only two ways to mitigate the full impact of furloughs. The first is another stimulus bill,"" United's head of flight operations, Bryan Quigley, said in the memo. 
The Chicago-based airline had previously said it would furlough 2,250 pilots between Oct. 1 and the end of 2020 and another 1,650 in 2021, depending on demand.
United did not provide additional comment.
It has already told 36,000 union workers, about 45% of the total, that their jobs are in jeopardy. 
The message follows a warning from budget carrier  Spirit Airlines  (N:SAVE) this week that 20-30% of workers may be furloughed in October.
Others including low-cost Allegiant (O:ALGT) and Hawaiian Airlines (O:HA) also warned this week of furlough notices, while United and American Airlines (O:AAL) extended deadlines for some employees to accept voluntary furloughs or early retirements.
Aside from federal aid, some of which must be re-paid, U.S. airlines have tapped new debt to boost liquidity during the crisis.
United's memo warned that those loans will hinder its ability to buy new planes, hire new pilots, or bring back pilots who were furloughed.

Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (N:LUV), which enjoy a stronger debt position than American and United, have said they can minimize or avoid involuntary furloughs thanks to strong take-up for employee buyouts.

Investing.com – The Dow moved off session lows Thursday, as gains in big tech ahead of key earnings for the sector due later in the afternoon helped lift investor sentiment after cyclical stocks nosedived on data showing the economy suffered its worst slump on record.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.79%, or 210 points, but had been down by 547 points at the lows of the day. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.50% and the S&P 500 slipped 0.37%.
It's just hours to go until mega-cap tech companies including Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL),   Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) are slated to deliver quarterly reports that will provide clues on whether the quartet's recent run higher has been justified.  
The earnings due after the bell will be a ""seminal night for the Street to digest how these tech stalwarts are faring during the dark COVID storm,"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note.
""The reality is that the strong are getting stronger with FAANG names such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple beneficiaries of the current environment and a dynamic front and center this week, which we believe will put further fuel into the tech rally moving forward,"" Ives added.
Elsewhere in tech, chip stocks continued to power ahead thanks to a rally in chipmaker Qualcomm.
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) rallied 15% after reporting better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal third quarter and confirming it had settled a licensing dispute with Huawei that will boost revenue by $1.8 billion.
But corners of the market like financials and energy linked to the strength of the economy were shunned following data showing U.S. GDP declined at an annualized rate of 32.9% in the second quarter of 2020, less bad than the expected decline of 34.5%, but still the biggest decline on record.
While the record decline in growth was largely priced in, investor hopes for a robust rebound still appear overly optimistic, with key data in the coming weeks likely to disappoint.
""With virus fears on the rise, jobs being lost and incomes squeezed, we feel the recovery could be much bumpier than markets seemingly do, and think we are in for some data disappointment over the next couple of months – starting with next week’s payrolls number,"" ING said in a note.
Energy fell nearly 4% to lead the broader market lower, pressured by falling oil prices on concerns about crude demand following weaker U.S. economic data.
Financials were not far behind, slipping about 2%, with banks including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  & Company (NYSE:WFC) in the red."

The offering of 95 million American depositary shares (ADS) was priced at $11.50 per share. The stock opened at $15.50 and extended gains to rise as much as $17.50, adding to the growing list of strong debuts this year.
The New York IPO of Li Auto, backed by food delivery giant Meituan Dianping (OTC:MPNGF) and TikTok owner ByteDance, comes at a time when U.S.-listed Chinese companies are facing tightened scrutiny and strict audit requirements from U.S. regulators, as tensions escalate between the two countries.
Sentiment toward Chinese firms among U.S. investors has also been hit by the fallout from  Luckin Coffee  (OTC:LKNCY) Inc, a Chinese coffee chain, which was listed on Nasdaq and earlier this year disclosed that some of its employees fabricated sales accounts.
The IPO of the 5-year-old Beijing-based automaker, two years after Chinese peer Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc went public in New York, is one of the biggest U.S. listings by a Chinese company this year. Investors value the company at around $10 billion.
Unlike rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nio's pure battery electric vehicles, Li Auto's sport-utility vehicle model Li ONE allows drivers to charge their cars with electricity or gasoline, a technology called extended range electric vehicle (EREV).
""There is demand for EREV, which alleviates range anxiety issues for customers,"" said Mingming Huang, founder of the 6-year-old Future Capital Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Fund, which was the first investor in Li Auto when the company started in 2015.
Huang also told Reuters Li Auto would not rule out the possibility of having a different powertrain in future models. Li Auto sold 9,666 vehicles in the first six months this year.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), UBS and CICC were among the underwriters for the IPO.

The company, in which  Altria Group  (N:MO) owns a 35% stake, has provided scientific data from over 110 studies evaluating the product's impact on tobacco users and non-users, including those who are underage.
Vaping companies are required by the FDA to provide a Premarket Tobacco Product Application (PMTA), which will include scientific data to show a product is appropriate for public consumption.
Manufacturers have until Sept. 9 to submit their application, failing which their products will be pulled from the market.

Once an application is submitted, companies can keep selling their products for a year from the date of deadline, without official approval, or until a negative action is taken by the FDA.

552,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>",NYSE-owner ICE says COVID-19 has complicated the M&A picture,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic has complicated merger and acquisition deal making, as social-distancing and restrictions on travel have made it harder for top executives to meet face-to-face, the head of Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE) said on Thursday.
""The COVID-19 environment has really created winners and losers in many spaces, including financial services,"" ICE CEO Jeffrey Sprecher said. ""We've had a lot of inquiries from fintech-type companies that are worried about their future funding capabilities.""
ICE, which bought the New York Stock Exchange in 2013, has grown from a small energy-trading business in 2000 to one of the world's biggest exchange operators, with a $51.6 billion market cap, largely through acquisitions. 
The most recent high-profile deal it explored was a more than $30 billion takeover of online marketplace eBay Inc (O:EBAY) that ICE abandoned in February following investor backlash. 
Since then, the coronavirus pandemic has quickly spread, leading to lockdowns around the world, forcing work-from-home mandates and limiting in-person meetings. 
Those measures have made it harder for chief executive officers to meet, get to know each other, and determine if their businesses would be a good fit, Sprecher said on a call with analysts. 
""We're in a great position if the right thing were to come along, but it's a complicated environment for M&A just due to the social distancing that's going on,"" he said.
The one area where there has been a pickup in M&A activity has been with smaller private equity-owned firms that are looking to sell themselves to larger companies with deep pockets, he said. 

ICE, which runs equities and futures exchanges, as well as clearinghouses and data businesses, is looking for potential acquisitions that would accelerate initiatives it is already working on, though nothing has ""moved the needle"" so far, he added.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Agricultural commodities trader Archer Daniels Midland Co (N:ADM) expects a groundswell of export demand in the second half of 2020, led by robust purchases by China, as the coronavirus pandemic fuels food security concerns around the world, the company said Thursday.
Ample U.S. supplies of crops like soybeans, corn and wheat could help propel ADM to a record fourth-quarter profit, Chief Executive Juan Luciano said during a quarterly call with analysts.
After record export volumes from South American facilities helped ADM deliver a stronger-than-expected second-quarter profit, Brazilian soy stocks are nearly depleted, Luciano said. The United States will be the prime supplier to the world, he added.
""The U.S. export market is setting up ... for very good times on very solid global demand and competitive prices,"" Luciano said.
""Potentially, we could have record profits in Q4 when you look at the volumes, plus the attractive prices, because we're going to have a big harvest in the U.S.""
Global agribusinesses like ADM and rival  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG) are among the companies that have fared better than expected during the pandemic despite food supply chain disruptions and volatile markets.
Bunge raised its full-year outlook after reporting a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday following record Brazilian crop exports.
Both companies have reported minimal disruptions to operations due to COVID-19.
China has recently been actively buying U.S. soybeans and corn, including its largest ever single-day corn purchase reported on Thursday.
However, China will need significant buying for the remainder of the year to reach the $36.5 billion in purchases promised in its Phase 1 trade deal signed in January.

Luciano said China needs about 25-26 million tonnes of soybeans for the remainder of 2020, about half of which is already booked. The rest will be U.S. beans shipped in the fourth quarter, he said.

(Reuters) - AstraZeneca (L:AZN) has been granted protection from future product liability claims related to its COVID-19 vaccine hopeful by most of the countries with which it has struck supply agreements, a senior executive told Reuters.
With 25 companies testing their vaccine candidates on humans and getting ready to immunise hundred millions of people once the products are shown to work, the question of who pays for any claims for damages in case of side effects has been a tricky point in supply negotiations.
""This is a unique situation where we as a company simply cannot take the risk if in ... four years the vaccine is showing side effects,"" Ruud Dobber, a member of Astra's senior executive team, told Reuters. 
""In the contracts we have in place, we are asking for indemnification. For most countries it is acceptable to take that risk on their shoulders because it is in their national interest,"" he said, adding that Astra and regulators were making safety and tolerability a top priority.
Dobber would not name the countries.
EU officials told Reuters this week product liability was among contentious points in European efforts to secure supply deals for potential COVID-19 vaccines from  Pfizer  (N:PFE), Sanofi (PA:SASY) and Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ).
The United States, however, already has a law to exclude tort claims from products that help control a public-health crises in the form of the 2005 Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness, or PREP Act.
AstraZeneca, Britain's second-largest drugmaker, has pledged to supply a total of more than 2 billion doses at no profit in agreements with the United States, Britain and European countries, among other nations and organisations.
Astra's deals differ from most rivals because it has secured government backing for production and development efforts, while competitors such as GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) are looking to negotiate a price for a finished product, contingent on approval.
To back its claim to forgo profits from the $1.2 billion collaboration in the United States, Astra has even granted the government access to financial accounts related to the venture, according to Dobber.
""There are very clear milestones before they are going to pay. Because we made the promise to manufacture the vaccine at no profit, auditors of the U.S. administration will get free access to our accounting books,"" he said.

De Beers, a unit of  Anglo American  (L:AAL), earlier reported plunging earnings in the first half of 2020 as a drop in rough diamond sales and prices hurt margins. 
Underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were just $2 million in the period, down from $518 million in the first half of last year.
De Beers CEO Bruce Cleaver told Reuters official consultations with workers will begin on Aug. 11. He said the business overhaul ""is likely to lead to some job losses, but I can't tell you at this point what that number will be"".
Cleaver said the process would last for three months and involve a review of mining, rough sales, retail and the corporate centre, but exclude joint venture businesses in Botswana and Namibia which have different governance structures.
De Beers employs 20,000 people across its entire business.
The country's coronavirus state of emergency, which ends in October, prohibits businesses from laying off workers.
Asked whether De Beers was planning job cuts in Botswana, executive vice president for diamond trading Paul Rawley said that as the transformation plan was a work in progress, he could take anything off the table.
South Africa's National Union of Mineworkers did not immediately reply to a request for comment on possible job cuts by De Beers.

Maintaining that the long-term outlook is positive, however, the miner said its business transformation plan aims to boost margins by, among other things, modernising the way it sells diamonds.

558,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 09:38AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Opens Lower After Historic GDP Drop; Dow Down 480 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened markedly lower on Thursday, with the pace of selling accelerating, after the U.S. reported its biggest quarterly economic contraction since records began. 
Gross domestic product contracted by 9.5% in absolute terms in the three months through June. Extrapolating that over a full year would give a contraction of 32.9%, although that figure is largely meaningless, given that the lockdowns that caused the recession have since been lifted in large part. 
At the same time, the Labor Department said that the number of Americans making initial claims for jobless benefits rose for the second straight week, albeit by only 12,000 to 1.434 million. Continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag, also rose.
By 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 482 points or 1.8% at 26,057 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.9%.
Although ""significant"", the GDP number ""tells us little about where we stand today and where we’re likely to head tomorrow,"" Oxford Economics analyst Greg Daco said via Twitter.
Related or not, the gloomy news from the economic front was followed within minutes by a suggestion from President Donald Trump' that the November presidential election be delayed. Trump repeated, without any fresh evidence, his past claims that the wider use of mail-in voting will lead to electoral fraud. Twitter has previously flagged such claims as misleading. The U.S. Constitution entrusts the organization of federal elections to the states, meaning that Trump - who is trailing his Democrat rival Joe Biden in most nationwide opinion polls - has no power to force a delay.
Banking stocks - often used as a proxy for the broader economy - were among the worst affected by the data, as the market priced in a higher probability of loan losses and a long period of margin-crushing low interest rates. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had said on Wednesday that ""we're not even thinking"" of raising rates, and the Fed's so-called 'dot-plot' reflected expectations among its top brass that rates would stay where they are for another two years. 
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock fell 4.9%, while Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) stock fell 3.2% and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock fell 3.5%.
Among the biggest gainers, on another heavy day for corporate earnings, was Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock, which rose 10.1% after the chipmaker announced a settlement with Huawei over a licensing dispute. Qualcomm will get $1.8 billion up front in respect of past fees, and also stands to gain from a fresh long-term sales agreement - as long as U.S. sanctions on Huawei aren't tightened further. 
The parabolic rise of Eastman Kodak (NYSE:KODK) stock flattened out as speculative interest paused for breath after two days in which it has risen nearly 20-fold. The stock was up 17.9%, at $39.01.
The economic and political news was enough to push the price of oil below $40 a barrel for the first time in over two weeks. By 10 AM ET, U.S. Crude Futures were down 4.0% at $39.62 a barrel.  Gold Futures were down 0.3% at $1,947.70 a troy ounce."
559,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>","Computing is the new horsepower, carmaker Audi says","By Edward Taylor and Jörn Poltz
INGOLSTADT (Reuters) - Carmakers that once competed mainly over the power of their engines are now vying over a much less tangible sort of power as they race to develop automated vehicles - computing. 
New Audi boss Markus Duesmann is assembling a team of about 200 engineers within parent company Volkswagen Group (DE:VOWG_p) to develop a new computer-driven vehicle system, he told Reuters. 
Dubbed ""Project Artemis"" after the Ancient Greek goddess of hunting, the plan is to chase down - and overtake - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), widely viewed as the industry leader in software. 
""When it comes to digitalisation we are lagging behind - for now,"" Duesmann said in an interview at Audi's headquarters in Ingolstadt, southern Germany.
With the advent of self-driving cars, vehicles need processors and software operating systems to analyse data from radar, lidar, and camera sensors to calculate driving reflexes so cars can navigate and avoid accidents on their own.
In the past, bigger cars with more powerful engines were automatically better. Now computing power and intelligence will be a key metric for defining what is premium, forcing Audi and Volkswagen to retool the way they design cars. 
""Technical development of vehicles is no longer organised according to a vehicle's size, but by the car's electrical and electronic architecture,"" Duesmann said, explaining that premium and value models would now differentiate themselves according to their computing power and sensor levels. 
To build the new system, Duesmann is assembling a ""results oriented"" engineering team to work on accelerating development of a scalable vehicle platform. 
""(Project) Artemis will be smaller than a Formula One team. I am thinking around 200 staff,"" he said. 
""To develop a new car with so many new features in this period until 2024 is so demanding that it is probably without precedent. That's why we have decided to work with a separate unit,"" said Duesmann, who is also head of research at Volkswagen Group. 
The idea is that an agile development group will be less encumbered by the bureaucracy within Volkswagen Group, which owns brands including Bugatti, Bentley, Porsche, Skoda, and Lamborghini, as well as Audi and VW. 
VW has more than 10,000 employees working in research and development at the company's Wolfsburg headquarters alone.
Artemis will be led by Alexander Hitzinger, who was responsible for autonomous driving at Volkswagen and built up the Porsche racing team that won Le Mans endurance race in 2015, 2016, 2017. Hitzinger also worked at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), where he set up and managed product development for autonomous vehicles.
The Artemis team will harness the engineering know-how within Volkswagen Group, but also have the authority to use outside partners.
""If we gain speed with a supplier or with a software company, we will consider it. Speed is extremely important,"" Duesmann said. China will also play a role, Duesmann added, declining to elaborate.
Project Artemis will sit alongside Volkswagen Group's Car.Software organisation, also based in Ingolstadt. 
""They need each other,"" Duesmann said, adding many of Artemis's staff would remain embedded within Volkswagen Group brands, but receive instructions from Ingolstadt.

""The result will be a common concept which is scalable for all of us,"" Duesmann said. ""The first model will be an Audi.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Some banks in the European Union hold large exposures of increasingly risky leveraged loans that could be hard to offload if investor appetite were to vanish due to the pandemic, the bloc's banking watchdog said on Thursday.
Banks have found the sector offering higher yields at a time of low interest rates, which have been cut further since March as central banks seek to mitigate economic downturns following COVID-19 lockdowns.
The European Banking Authority (EBA) said exposures at a sample of 26 European Union banks to loans made to highly indebted companies that typically don't have an investment grade credit rating, totals 400 billion euros ($470 billion).
While this is just 2.5% of their total assets, the holdings are concentrated in a few large and highly interconnected lenders, EBA said.
""As the pandemic and the ensuing economic lockdown impair leveraged borrowers' capacities to repay their debts, some banks may suffer losses related to the increase in credit risk and from their mark-to-market positions,"" EBA said.
""Banks may also face drawdowns on the revolving credit facilities granted to leveraged borrowers and may be left holding leveraged loans that they intended to securitise or sell (hung deals) if investors’ appetite vanishes.""
So far, default ratios have remained very low due to low maturing volumes, but stresses from COVID could change this, EBA said.
The Bank of England has estimated that the global leverage loan market is worth up to $3.2 trillion. The BoE and other central banks around the world including the European Central Bank have already begun asking banks about their exposures to leveraged loans. 
""The relaxation of lending standards on leveraged finance has clearly increased the riskiness of these exposures,"" EBA said, adding it was important that banks' boards have a complete picture of exposures.

(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) laid out new diversity initiatives for corporate leadership, franchisees and suppliers at its global convention on Wednesday.
The announcement was part of Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski's effort to reinject some of early owner Ray Kroc's collaborative spirit with a modern twist and to reset the narrative after a tumultuous nine months since he took over in November.
The Chicago-based burger chain's biennial worldwide meeting was held virtually this year because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The revised values - which pertain to serving, inclusion, integrity, community and family - come after former Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook was ousted over an improper relationship. McDonald's values were last reworked in 2008, when James Skinner was chief executive.
A few months after Easterbrook's departure, the coronavirus pandemic broke out and McDonald's restaurants scrambled to secure supply chains and protective gear and shift operations to drive-thru and delivery.
McDonald's U.S. franchisees felt they were not getting enough financial support, and the feud broke out publicly.
Employees walked off the job over what they said was a lack of proper protection and adequate pay. Black franchisees were leaving because of a growing financial disparity between their stores and those of white owners, Business Insider reported.
Organizations large and small have been addressing racism internally after nationwide protests over the May killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by Minneapolis police.
McDonald's new diversity initiative deals with bias in hiring, increasing diversity among leadership, franchisees and advertising and reducing barriers to diverse suppliers.
Metrics will be developed in coming weeks. McDonald's said the meaning of diversity varies in the 120 countries where it operates.
In a video shown to attendees, Heidi Capozzi, global chief people officer, who joined McDonald's in April, said progress would be tracked annually.

""Thanks to the scale of the McDonald's system, the impact we can have is unlike any other company,"" she said.

Kodak shares rose four-fold on Wednesday, with retail traders on the popular Robinhood trading app piling into the stock.

The financial analytics firm said 9.48% of the stock was currently being ""shorted"", where investors bet that the shares will fall.

The loan to Kodak comes at a time when the Trump administration has been looking to bolster the ability to produce drugs and their raw materials in the United States after the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the industry's dependence on China and India for its supply chain.

The former U.S. secretary of state and one-time presidential candidate is throwing his weight behind the KFA Global Carbon ETF, an exchange-traded fund tracking the three most robust markets for carbon credits. Based on an index developed by IHS Markit Ltd. and Climate Finance Partners, the ETF begins trading Thursday under the symbol KRBN.
The fund offers retail investors exposure to the carbon credit market, one of the chief mechanisms for limiting greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris climate accord Kerry helped negotiate in 2015. Kerry is also hoping the ETF will help set a single worldwide price for carbon -- a crucial steppingstone the framers of the Paris agreement couldn’t agree on.
“We are leapfrogging to the stock exchange,” Kerry said in a phone interview.
Kerry is an adviser to Climate Finance Partners and owns a small stake in the firm co-founded by Eron Bloomgarden and Richmond Mayo-Smith. New York-based Krane Funds Advisors runs the ETF with Climate Finance Partners as a sub-adviser.
The ETF will employ futures contracts as it seeks to outperform the IHS Markit Global Carbon Index, a benchmark that reflects pricing on emissions trading systems developed by the European Union, California and a group of states in the Northeastern U.S. Credits trade for roughly $30 per carbon ton in the EU, $17 in California and $6 in the Northeast.
China, the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, is starting an emissions trading system this year that will probably be added to the index, said Jonathan Krane, founder of Krane Funds.
“A lot of countries are launching carbon credit markets,” he said. “As those exchanges become more liquid, they will be good candidates to add into our carbon fund.”
President Donald Trump announced in 2017 that the U.S. would begin the multiyear process of withdrawing from the Paris agreement.

The Michigan-based company also beat second-quarter sales and profit estimates, sending its shares nearly 4% higher in premarket trading. 
Work from home policies and closure of schools have led to a surge in demand for cereals, oatmeal and snacks in North America, with Kellogg's organic net sales in the region rising 11% in the second quarter ended June 27. 
Net sales stayed roughly flat from a year ago at about $3.47 billion, due to the sale of Kellogg's Keebler cookie business last year. Analysts had expected net sales of $3.30 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. https://reut.rs/3f7fa12 
Organic net sales rose 9.2% in the quarter.
Excluding items, Kellogg earned $1.24 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 94 cents.
Net income attributable to the company climbed to $351 million, or $1.02 per share, from $286 million, or 84 cents per share, a year earlier. 
The company forecast full-year organic net sales to rise about 5%, ahead of a prior forecast of a 1% to 2% increase, and its adjusted earnings per share to fall about 1%, compared with previous outlook of a 3% to 4% fall.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investment banks in London are trying to tempt more staff into the office, laying on free food, Friday night drinks and other perks to lure bankers back where they can pass skills to others -- and compliance departments can keep a closer eye on them.
Mass remote-working has been largely successful for many financial firms, improving communications and sparing staff from long commutes during a near-global coronavirus lockdown. But some firms are keen to reunite teams after the hiatus.
In public, they tend to cite the importance of building teams, boosting morale and mentoring junior staff.
""Relationship building and developing a knowledge base are important for new associates and others, and that's easier in the office,"" said Ram Nayak,  Deutsche Bank 's (DE:DBKGn) global head of fixed income and currencies.
Three banking sources said having staff on site also makes it easier to reduce compliance risks, and helps managers gauge individual output in the final quarter when bonuses are tallied.
Working from home could even bring new dangers: Britain's FICC Financial Markets Standard Board this week published a best-practice guide to handling conduct risks such as trading errors, domestic violence, and substance or alcohol abuse.
As part of its return-to-work process, Goldman Sachs (N:GS) is offering to feed staff at the headquarters of its international business in London, where just a handful of nearby food outlets have reopened. 
Around 40% of the 6,000 staff who work at its Plumtree Court building - which boasts onsite childcare and a medical centre - have returned to the office at some point since June, with 10-15% present on any given day, two sources said. 
Staff have also been able to relax on its rooftop garden or take classes at its fitness centre, which reopened on Monday.
TRACKING TRADERS
UBS (S:UBSG) is treating its London-based traders to Friday night drinks to boost team spirit during its gradual return to the office, another two sources said. 
But the steps are still small, and many bankers are likely to be working in their pyjamas for months more at least.
Around 70,000 of  Barclays ' (L:BARC) 88,000 global workforce have worked from home during the pandemic and just 700 are timetabled to return to workplaces across Britain, India and the United States in July and August. The remainder will work remotely until at least end-September, a spokesman said. 
Chief Executive Jes Staley, who had said in April he felt packing thousands of staff into city-centre offices could become ""a thing of the past"", this week told reporters he wanted to see his staff back together. 
A handful of HSBC's (L:HSBA) investment bankers have returned to its UK headquarters, but no date has been set for the 'first phase' of a mass-return, two additional sources said.
The 'first phase' will see fewer than 20% of colleagues return to each office. In some buildings, maintaining social distancing means the returning number will be far less than 20%.
Deutsche's Nayak said trading floors would return slowly. The bank has asked a small proportion of London-based staff to return in September after a first wave of employees returned this month, according to a July 14 staff memo.
UK state-backed NatWest Group (L:NWG) has told its 50,000-strong workforce the ""vast majority"" can work remotely until 2021. Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) said it wanted staffers to return in the fourth quarter, assuming it was safe to do so. 
PANDEMIC-PROOFING
Some banks are striving to ensure their offices are better protected against pandemics in the long-term. 
""With people spending up to 90% of their time indoors, there's an urgent need to re-engineer indoor spaces to create workplaces that are productive and safe,"" said Liviu Tudor, founder of Genesis Property, who is advising banks including  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) on ""immunising"" their offices.
A SocGen spokeswoman described its enhanced measures as ""progressive, agile and reversible"" and said they could be adapted as the pandemic evolves.
Pandemic-proofing offices could cost up to 2% of a building's total construction cost, Tudor estimated. This could include installing quarantine rooms, disinfectant UV lighting, upgraded air filtering systems, thermal scanners and even repainting walls with anti-microbial paint.
Employee union Unite, which represents thousands of bank staff, said on Wednesday it would intervene if it felt bosses could do more to ensure safety.
Canary Wharf Group (CWG), which manages Britain's second financial hub to the east of the City, is providing more parking for cars and bikes for workers nervous about crowded transit.
Footfall in its shopping malls was ""growing steadily"" but it was ""time for the rest of the businesses at Canary Wharf to come back"", said CWG Executive Chairman George Iacobescu.
But the Chartered Institute for Securities & Investment said on Wednesday only 25% of members expected to return to the office for the same number of working days as before.

""We've watched these mega dealing rooms grow - that doesn't work with social distancing,"" said one senior asset manager, forecasting occupancy of just 40% and 25% in his firm's two offices. ""The cult of the dealing room is probably dead.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump may give himself credit for the performance of the U.S. stock market during his term, but only around a third of Americans agree, according to a Reuters poll.
Trump has repeatedly highlighted on Twitter and to reporters the stock market’s stunning run-up, making it part of his case for re-election this November. The benchmark S&P 500, which cratered in February and March when coronavirus hit the U.S. economy, has squeaked into positive territory for the year to date and is trading less than 5% below its record intra-day high, hit on Feb. 19.
""I was honored to see that the stock market... set a record in a short period of time,"" Trump said in March, before the coronavirus pandemic fully hit the U.S. economy.
The poll of 1,005 people, conducted last week, showed 34% thought the market had performed better than it otherwise would have due to Trump's policies. The results showed a split along party lines, with 65% of those who identify as Republican agreeing, versus only 15% of those who identified as Democrat.
A higher percentage thought the opposite, with 41% saying the market performed worse due to Trump's policies. Of those who identified as Democrat, 58% agreed and of those that identified Republican, 13% agreed.
A quarter of respondents said his policies had not impacted the market.
In answers to a second question, 39% of respondents said that Trump has focused on boosting the stock market ""even if it has hurt regular workers."" Of those who identified as Democrat, 63% agreed, while for those who identified as Republican, 14% agreed.
Only 8% of respondents said Trump focused on helping regular workers, ""even if it has hurt stock prices."" Of those who identified as Republican, 15% agreed, while of those who identified as Democrat, 5% agreed.
Just over a quarter, 26%, of all respondents said he focused on helping both stocks and regular workers.
Trump's Democrat opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, has attacked Trump on the issue of the markets.
""Throughout this crisis, Donald Trump has been almost singularly focused on the stock market: the Dow and NASDAQ; not you, not your families,"" Biden said this month in a speech near his birthplace of Scranton, Pennsylvania.
The poll comes as the benchmark S&P 500 has staged a nearly 44% comeback from its March lows, thanks in part to unprecedented monetary support from the Federal Reserve and a $2 trillion stimulus package from Congress.
Those gains, however, are unlikely to translate into new jobs, according to Citi global markets strategist Matt King and Catherine L. Mann, global chief economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C).
""How much does putting another 1,000 points on the S&P really generate in terms of increased employment — especially when you are starting from what were already close to record highs pre-COVID-19?"" they noted.
An analysis of 2016 Federal Reserve data by Edward Wolff, an economics professor at New York University, said that 84% of stocks owned by U.S. households are held by the wealthiest 10% of Americans, limiting the power of a stock market rally to turn into broad gains in household wealth.

COVID-19 has wiped out holidays abroad for Europeans for months, and now the threat of a second wave of infections and new restrictions on travel during the usually lucrative summer season are causing more pain in a sector where balance sheets are already strained.
TUI's UK unit was forced to cancel thousands of holidays earlier this week when Britain advised against travel to Spain, bringing back a 14-day quarantine rule for arrivals just weeks after saying travel there was safe.
The company said on Thursday the closure of the 166 stores in the UK and Ireland would still leave it with 350 stores in those geographies, but made sense when 70% of TUI's UK bookings were made online. 
The closures would affect 900 employees but the company would try to move 70% of those staff into new homeworking sales and service jobs, meaning about 270 jobs were at risk.

Germany-headquartered TUI said in May it needed to cut 8,000 jobs and shed 30% of its costs to prepare for a tourism market which would be smaller for some years.

LONDON/ROME (Reuters) - Activist hedge fund TCI Fund Management said it has complained to the European Commission over ""illegitimate expropriation"" by the Italian government of Atlantia's motorways unit Autostrade per l'Italia.
TCI, an investor in Atlantia, said in its letter of complaint that Italy's order that Atlantia sell down its stake in Autostrade ""seriously threatened the fundamental principles of the EU Capital Market Union"". 
The move adds a new dimension to the battle over Autostrade, whose future has been in question ever since a motorway bridge it operated in the northern city of Genoa collapsed in mid-2018, killing 43 people.
The disaster exposed a record of management failure and fuelled heavy political pressure to strip the motorway concession from the powerful Benetton family that controls Atlantia through its 30% stake.
After months of dispute, the government reached a preliminary compromise that left Autostrade with the concession but forced Atlantia to hand over control to state lender CDP and allied investors.
However, TCI said the deal disregarded the rights of other investors in Atlantia. 
""The Italian government has repeatedly violated the principles of legal certainty, legitimate expectations and proportionality which are all key pillars of the Italian Constitution and the European Union,"" said the letter seen by Reuters.
""If the government want to punish the Benetton family with a low price, it is punishing international investors, and this is illegal,"" Jonathan Amouyal, a partner at TCI Advisory Services, told Reuters.
""What we want is a fair process and a fair price,"" he said, adding that he believed Autostrade's valuation was between 11-12 billion euros at pre-money equity value.
TCI has asked Rome to set up a competitive auction for the sale of Atlantia's controlling stake in Autostrade or, alternatively, to allow for demerging the unit and a subsequent sale, Amouyal said.
Atlantia and the government will need time to discuss the sale process and the valuation of Autostrade, two sources close to the matter said, adding a final accord will be not be ready for July 27, as several newspapers have said.
Autostrade presented a new economic and financial plan for its motorway network late on Thursday, the transport ministry said in a statement. 
Officials at Autostrade and the transport ministry will discuss the details of plan - which envisages more than 13 billion euros of investments and a 1.75% cap to road toll annual increases - next week, the ministry said. The plan is one of the pillars to calculate the company's value.

Atlantia owns 88% in Autostrade, with Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG), China's Silk Road and France's EDF (PA:EDF) holding the rest.

(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) on Thursday reported second-quarter revenue that beat expectations, as strong sign-ups for broadband offset weaker advertising sales at cable networks and broadcast TV.
In the three months, Comcast gained 323,000 broadband subscribers, beating analysts’ average estimate of 247,000 net additions, according to research firm FactSet. Revenue from the business grew 7.2% to $5 billion.
Comcast’s NBCUniversal segment, which includes NBC Entertainment and Universal Pictures, reported revenue of $6.12 billion, down 25.4% from a year earlier. Revenue at the filmed entertainment unit fell 18.1% from a year earlier due to shuttered movie theaters. Theme park revenue plummeted 94.1%. 
Broadcast TV advertising revenue was down 27.9% and ad revenue at Comcast's cable networks fell 27%. 
The company said it had 10 million signups to its Peacock streaming service, launched nationwide on July 15.
On Tuesday Comcast and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (N:AMC), the world’s largest theater chain, announced a deal that will allow Universal Pictures’ movies to be made available to U.S. audiences at home after three weekends in cinemas - a model that upends the traditional practice of keeping a movie in theaters for 90 days before releasing it on other platforms.
Comcast's video losses in the second quarter were better than expected. The company lost 477,000 video customers, fewer than the 513,000 loss estimated by FactSet and more than the 409,000 video customers it lost in the first quarter.
Comcast reported second-quarter revenue of $23.72 billion, beating the Wall Street consensus estimate of $23.57 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
British pay-TV group Sky generated second-quarter revenue of $4.08 billion, beating the average estimate of $3.91 billion.

Net income attributable to Comcast fell to $2.99 billion, or 65 cents per share, from $3.13 billion, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier.

DuPont, which makes materials used in products ranging from engine covers to brake fluid, is heavily exposed to the auto industry, which has been among the hardest hit after the coronavirus lockdowns emptied roads and shuttered car showrooms.
The company, however, beat estimates for both adjusted profit and sales, helped by cost cuts and higher organic sales in its nutrition and electronics units, which benefited from a surge in demand for food ingredients and memory chips.
DuPont shares were flat in early trade.
The company booked the impairment charge under its Transportation & Industrial segment, which reported the sharpest decline in sales at 34%, saying the business was now worth less because of continued weakness in global automotive production. 
Even before the outbreak, DuPont had been grappling with lower sales in the unit, particularly due to lower prices for nylon, a stiff plastic used in making auto parts and industrial equipment.
Expecting a modest revival in automotive and residential construction industries, DuPont projected adjusted earnings between 71 and 73 cents for the current quarter, marginally above the 71 cents estimated by analysts according to Refinitiv IBES data. 
Net loss available to shareholders, which included the hefty charge, was $2.48 billion, or $3.37 per share, in the three months ended June 30 compared to a loss of $571 million, or 76 cents per share, a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, DuPont posted earnings of 70 cents per share, handily beating 59 cents estimated by analysts. 

The Wilmington, Delaware-based company, once part of the conglomerate DowDuPont that was split up last year, reported sales of $4.8 billion, just above estimates of $4.7 billion.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open sharply lower Thursday, on concerns about the strength of the U.S. recovery after a dovish Federal Reserve statement.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), US 500 Futures traded 33 points, or 1%, lower, US Tech 100 Futures down 127 points, or 1.2%. The Dow Futures contract fell 240 points, or 0.9%. 
The Federal Reserve concluded its two-day meeting late Wednesday, with the central bank keeping its benchmark rate near zero and suggesting it would remain so for some time amid economic uncertainty.
""The economy will need high levels of accommodative monetary policy for an extended period,"" Fed chairman Jerome Powell said.
Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats are still struggling to pass the latest stimulus measures before Friday, when some earlier measures are due to expire. 
The only major change to the FOMC statement change is that it adds an explicit warning that “the path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus,” said analyst James Knightley at ING, in a research note. “It seems to be yet another effort to try to provide a dose of realism in contrast to what appears to be equity market optimism that recovery is plain sailing from here.”
“The central bank is sounding even more dovish, likely culminating in a strategy shift in September,” Knightley added.
The focus will now turn to the first take on second-quarter GDP, at 08:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), with analysts forecasting a 34% annualized decline during the three-month period.  Earlier Thursday, German GDP contracted by 10.1% in the second quarter, its steepest plunge on record, and wiping out nearly 10 years of economic growth in adjusted terms.
The weekly initial jobless claims are also due at the same time, and are expected to remain elevated after last week’s release turned higher, breaking a long run of declining claims.
Meanwhile, the earnings season continues apace, with the prime focus being on Big Tech. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are all due to report numbers after the close Thursday, a day after their CEOs were grilled - very lightly - by a congressional anti-trust panel. These four companies make up around 16% of the S&P 500 index.
Concerns over the strength of the economy also hit oil prices, despite a huge drop in U.S. crude oil supplies last week. The U.S. Energy Information Administration recorded a 10.612 million-barrel draw in inventories for the week ending July 24, its biggest since 2019. U.S. crude futures traded 1.8% lower at $40.52 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent fell 1.3% to $43.48.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,946.40/oz, still at highly elevated levels, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1749, down 0.4%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Carlyle Group  Inc (O:CG) reported a smaller-than-expected 7% on-year drop in second-quarter distributable earnings on Thursday, as profits in its private equity and credit divisions partly offset declines in real estate and energy businesses.
Carlyle said distributable earnings (DE) - the cash available for paying dividends - fell to $198.4 million from $213.4 million a year earlier. This translated to DE per share of 53 cents, which significantly surpassed the Wall Street consensus average of 36 cents, according to data from Refinitiv.
Like other private equity firms, Carlyle saw a rebound in the value of many of its funds, as U.S. stock markets rallied during the second quarter from a widespread selloff in March that was driven by investor fears over the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Washington, D.C.-based company said its corporate private equity funds appreciated by 13% in the quarter, while credit funds rose by 8%. Its real estate funds and natural resources funds rose by 2% and 3% respectively. 
By comparison, Blackstone (NYSE:BX) said its private equity portfolio grew 12.8% in the second quarter, with opportunistic and core real estate funds rising by 1.6% and 3%, respectively.
Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Carlyle reported a profit of $145.9 million, up from a $612 million loss in the first quarter, driven by the appreciation of its funds.
""Our outlook remains appropriately prudent given an uncertain economic backdrop, though we continue to be active and well positioned to find attractive investment opportunities around the world,"" Carlyle Co-CEO Kewsong Lee said in a statement.
Carlyle said its total assets under management was $221 billion at the end of June, up from $217 billion in the prior quarter.

Carlyle declared a quarterly dividend of 25 cents per share.

589,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Panasonic aims to boost energy density in Tesla batteries by 20% - executive,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp (T:6752) plans to boost the energy density of ""2170"" battery cells it supplies to Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) by 20% in five years and commercialize a cobalt-free version ""in two to three years"", the head of its U.S. EV battery business said.
This is the first time Panasonic, a leading cell provider for the world's top electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla, has outlined these targets, putting down a marker in a highly competitive sector to stay ahead of the game.
Panasonic introduced the ""2170"" lithium-ion cells, with the nickel-cobalt-aluminium (NCA) cathode chemistry, for Tesla's Model 3 in 2017. Researchers say it already has the highest energy density at above 700 watt-hour per litre.
With an even higher density, these cells could help increase how much an EV can run on a single charge, while also paving the way for smaller batteries and roomier car interiors.
A cobalt-free version on the other hand would cut reliance on a costly and controversial component, which makes batteries stable but poses ethical issues given controversial labour conditions in top producer the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has long said he wants to move to zero-cobalt battery cells. 
Panasonic has already cut cobalt content to under 5% in the NCA cathode and plans to improve its batteries in stages, its U.S. EV battery chief Yasuaki Takamoto told Reuters. 
But the firm has declined to link its battery roadmap to Tesla's future models.
Panasonic recently lost its status as Tesla's exclusive battery supplier. The U.S. firm has partnered with South Korea's LG Chem (KS:051910) and China's CATL (SZ:300750).
CATL is supplying Tesla with low-cost lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries that contain no cobalt.
According to Takamoto, the average density of LFP battery cells is less than half the level of Panasonic's latest NCA batteries. He did not name any companies.
'2170' CELLS 
Panasonic has already developed technologies resulting in a more than 5% increase in the energy density of ""2170"" cells. 
From September, the firm will start converting lines at its factory in Nevada that it operates with Tesla as it prepares to further boost the energy density of the cells, Takamoto said.
To control safety risks associated with higher density and less cobalt, Panasonic is adjusting the composition and design for better thermal stability, Takamoto said.
He also noted there will be various battery requirements coming into play as EV usage diversifies.

Tesla's Musk has promised to reveal significant battery advances during a ""Battery Day"" presentation scheduled for Sept 22. Tesla plans to introduce an EV battery that will last one million miles later this year or early next, which it jointly developed with CATL.

592,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>",Big Tech results move center stage after Congressional bruising,"By Sagarika Jaisinghani and Neha Malara
(Reuters) - Four of the United States' big tech firms, accounting for nearly a fifth of the S&P 500's total value, report results on Thursday on the heels of a bruising Congressional hearing to look into alleged abuse of their global dominance.
It will be the first time Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) post financial results on the same day and investors wonder if they can deliver enough to extend a rally that has been central to Wall Street's recovery since March.
Deemed ""stay-at-home"" winners as millions of Americans were ordered indoors to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, shares in the big tech players have scaled record highs at a time when the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) is up less than 1% on the year.
But with many of Apple's stores still closed and Amazon's e-commerce costs soaring, there are question marks, and some on Wall Street argue that stock prices for all four have been bloated beyond rational valuations.
Shares in  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) fell 4.4% the day after its report last week, despite better-than-expected cloud revenue and its stock is now nearly flat on the month after hitting an all-time high in early July.
""It's simply momentum,"" Leo Kelly, founder of Verdence Capital Advisors, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum, ahead of the results, due after the closing bell.

Alphabet's Google and Facebook took particularly sharp jabs on Wednesday from Democrats and Republicans who say they have crippled smaller rivals in the quest for market share, the latest blows in an increasingly threatening regulatory landscape.
Apple's headache is a slowdown in hardware sales as the world slides into recession, with analysts predicting pandemic disruptions will see revenue fall about 3% and the iPhone business by nearly 14%.
Similarly, Facebook and Google are contending with a collapse in marketing spending. Refinitiv analysts estimate Facebook could generate its slowest revenue growth - around 3% - since it became a public company.
Still, despite the surge in stock prices raising the specter of another tech bubble - Amazon is up 64% this year and the others 13%-29% - analysts remain confident about the longer-term growth prospects for the four companies. 
""Even the bears will say that these are fantastic companies and they are not going to stop being fantastic,"" said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.

""The unifying factor is they have the ability to both grow and control their cost structures through the pandemic. That is always a good place to start from when you have a downturn.""

593,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>","'So far, so good' on leading COVID vaccine, says AstraZeneca","By Pushkala Aripaka and Ludwig Burger
(Reuters) - Britain's AstraZeneca (L:AZN) said on Thursday that good data was coming in so far on its vaccine for COVID-19, already in large-scale human trials and widely seen as the front-runner in the race for a shot against the novel coronavirus.
The drugmaker, Britain's most valuable listed company, also announced second quarter results that beat its sales and profit estimates, thanks to strong sales from a diverse product line-up.
""The vaccine development is progressing well. We have had good data so far. We need to show the efficacy in the clinical programme, but so far, so good,"" Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said on a media call.
AstraZeneca has already reached deals with countries to make more than 2 billion doses of its COVID-19 vaccine, developed in partnership with the University of Oxford, and says it could be approved by the end of this year. 
The company has had a busy few months: it took on development of the COVID-19 shot, received billions in government funding, signed several supply deals, and was even the subject of a mega-merger speculation - all while marching on with its core business. 
It stuck by its 2020 outlook on Thursday, and its shares were up about 3% at 88.6 pounds after product sales of $6.05 billion in the three months to June surpassed consensus of $6.01 billion. The figure excludes payments from tie-ups. 
Newer drugs for diabetes, heart conditions and cancer, including its top selling lung cancer drug Tagrisso, performed well in the quarter and AstraZeneca remains on track for a third consecutive year of growth.
Among drugs with better-than-expected revenues, sales of respiratory drug Symbicort rose 12% to $653 million, about $90 million above consensus, while revenue from cancer drug Lynparza jumped 62% to $554 million.
There are no approved vaccines for the illness caused by the new virus, but AstraZeneca's shot is widely considered the leading candidate after results from early-stage human trials showed it was safe and produced an immune response.

Core earnings of 96 cents per share beat analysts' expectation of 93 cents. Total revenue rose 11%.

(Reuters) - Organizers of a  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) advertising boycott said on Thursday the campaign would ""not go away"" until their concerns were addressed and they would ask advertisers in Europe to join their cause.
The campaign, set up in June by U.S. civil rights groups, aims to pressure the world's largest social media company to take concrete steps to block hate speech and misinformation from its platform in the wake of George Floyd's death in May.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has not yet taken the ""type of meaningful action that we want to see"", the ""Stop Hate for Profit"" campaign said in a press release, adding that many companies were not ready to return to the platform.
""The global campaign, which includes paid media, will be asking advertisers in Europe to stand with the 1,100 advertisers in the U.S. in the fight against hate and disinformation on Facebook,"" a campaign spokesperson said.
It comes as Facebook, and other big tech giants, came under fire on Wednesday at a U.S. congressional hearing for the alleged abuse of market power.
""Some of the most iconic brands in the world"" had pulled millions of dollars in advertising from Facebook since the start, the campaign said, adding the movement would continue until Facebook made ""reasonable changes"".
Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. His death has sparked worldwide protests against racial inequality and police brutality.
The campaign previously outlined 10 changes it wants, including allowing victims of severe harassment to speak with a Facebook employee and giving refunds to brands whose ads show up next to offensive content that is later removed.

Facebook said earlier in July it was ""grateful"" to these groups for their ""continued engagement.""

606,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>",Experimental Johnson & Johnson vaccine protects monkeys in a single dose: study,"By Julie Steenhuysen
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Thursday kicked off U.S. human safety trials for its COVID-19 vaccine after releasing details of a study in monkeys that showed its best-performing vaccine candidate offered strong protection in a single dose.
When exposed to the virus, six out of six animals who got the candidate vaccine were completely protected from lung disease and five out of six were protected from infection as measured by the presence of virus in nasal swabs, according to the study published in the journal Nature.
""This gives us confidence that we can test a single-shot vaccine in this epidemic and learn whether it has a protective effect in humans,"" Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&J's chief scientific officer, told Reuters in a telephone interview.
The U.S. government is backing J&J's vaccine effort with $456 million in funding as part of a spending spree aimed at speeding production of a vaccine to end the pandemic, which has infected millions and killed more than 660,000 people.
Stoffels said prior tests of this type of vaccine in other diseases found that a second shot significantly increases protection. But in a pandemic a single-shot vaccine has a significant advantage, sidestepping a lot of the logistical issues involved in getting people to come back for their second dose. 
The company plans to take up the question of one or two doses in its phase 1 trial, which kicked off this week in the United States. 
Depending on those results, J&J plans to start large-scale, phase 3 testing with a single-shot regimen in the second half of September. Around the same time, the company will start a parallel phase 3 study testing a two-shot regimen of the vaccine, Stoffels said. 
J&J's vaccine uses a common cold virus known as adnovirus type 26 or Ad26 to ferry coronavirus proteins into cells in the body, causing the body to mount an immune defense against the virus.
In the monkey study, scientists from J&J and Harvard's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center studied seven different potential vaccines in 32 animals and compared the results to 20 control animals who got placebo shots.
Six weeks later, all of the animals were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. All 20 animals that received the placebo developed high levels of virus in their lungs and nasal swabs. 
In the best-performing candidate, which J&J selected for human testing, none of the animals had virus in their lungs and only one showed low levels of virus in nasal swabs. Lab tests showed they all had developed antibodies capable of neutralizing the virus after a single shot.

""This study shows that even just a single immunization with the Ad26 vaccine leads to neutralizing antibody responses and robust protection of monkeys against COVID-19,"" said Dr. Dan Barouch, a vaccine researcher at Beth Isreal Deaconness who led the research in collaboration with J&J.

The greenback has sunk in recent weeks to around its lowest levels since September 2018 amid zero rates from the Federal Reserve, substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus programs and the U.S.’s struggle with Covid-19.
“Dollar depreciation generally coincides with declining cross-border M&A activity, and vice versa,”  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists led by Lotfi Karoui wrote in a note on Wednesday. “While the correlation is only modestly positive, it is somewhat counterintuitive.”
Investors often believe a weaker dollar will stoke M&A activity as American companies look cheaper to potential foreign buyers, the strategists said. But their analysis of U.S.-Europe deals shows the opposite is true. The reason: a strong dollar typically reflects robust growth in the U.S. relative to Europe, which in turn fuels interest from strategic buyers.

LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Global shares fell on Thursday as the Federal Reserve's pledge to use all its tools to support the U.S. economy failed to reassure investors uneasy about a stalemate on fiscal support and rising coronavirus cases.
Europe's STOXX 600 (STOXX) slipped 0.7% on a busy day for earnings. Earlier gains in Asian shares were undone, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside of Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) edging down 0.1%.
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 49 countries, was 0.3% lower, ending three days of gains.
Investors were worried about a surge in virus cases in the United States, along with parts of Europe and Asia. Australia, India, Vietnam, and North Korea were all on high alert.
On Wednesday, all Fed members voted as expected to leave the target range for short-term interest rates between 0% and 0.25%, where it has been since March 15, when the virus was beginning to hit the nation.
The unchanged policy setting together with a pledge the Fed would use its ""full range of tools"" if needed boosted risk appetite overnight. All three Wall Street indexes closed higher.
But the Fed was already disappearing in the rear-view mirror on Thursday. Investor focus returned to negotiations over a new coronavirus relief package for the world's largest economy.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that his administration and Democrats in Congress were still ""far apart"" on a new coronavirus relief bill. A failure to agree risks letting a $600-per-week unemployment benefit lapse when it expires this week.
""Were that program to expire completely, it's a meaningful hit to the economy and thus to sentiment and risk appetite,"" said James Athey, investment director, Aberdeen Standard Investments.
""At these equity prices there is absolutely no margin baked in. They are priced for utter perfection. Hence a little unease this morning.""
In currencies, the dollar index recovered after crashing to 93.17, the weakest since June 2018. [USD/]
The dollar (=USD) has been fallen on expectations the Fed will maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy for years to come and on speculation it will allow inflation to run higher than it has previously indicated before raising interest rates.
The dollar's weakness has supported the euro (EUR=EBS), which is headed for its biggest monthly gain in 10 years, having risen about 5% so far this month. It was last down 0.3% at $1.1754.
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar  slipped 0.6% to $0.7149 after reaching its highest levels since April 2019.
German government bond yields edged towards two-month lows after data showed the economy contracted by 10.1% in the second quarter, its steepest plunge on record.
Germany's 10-year yield (DE10YT=RR) was down 2 basis points to -0.52% in early trade, nearing Wednesday's two-month lows.
In commodity markets, oil prices fell amid concern that surging coronavirus infections worldwide will jeopardise a recovery in fuel demand. [O/R]

Hong Kong's Hang Seng TECH index (HSTECH) launched on Monday and the Shanghai stock exchange published the STAR 50 index <.STAR50> for the largest stocks on its year-old Nasdaq-style board last week.

The TECH index could grow from $150 billion to $870 billion and the STAR 50 from $40 billion to $800 billion in this time.

611,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>","Exclusive: As Japan weighs missile-defence options, Raytheon lobbies for Lockheed's $300 million radar deal","By Tim Kelly and Yoshifumi Takemoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. defence company Raytheon (N:RTN) is lobbying Japanese lawmakers to replace  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) as the supplier of powerful radars as Tokyo reconsiders plans for two Aegis Ashore missile defence sites, three sources said.
""It's game on,"" said one of the sources, who has direct knowledge of Raytheon's lobbying campaign. Raytheon's pitch includes a proposal to put its SPY-6 radar on refitted destroyers, as the U.S. Navy plans to do. The company says that would save money and time as Japan tackles new missile threats, drones and stealth aircraft.
Lockheed Martin has a contract with Japan to build its $300 million SPY-7 radars at the two cancelled Aegis Ashore sites, but says other sites or ships are possible.
But critics say dedicating ships to missile defence pulls them away from other duties, and new destroyers can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. And Japan could face financial penalties if it pulled out of its contract with Lockheed Martin.
""We are looking at the various options available to us,"" a defence ministry spokesman said. 
A key battle for the two companies will be winning the support of former defence ministers and deputy ministers who as early as next week will make recommendations to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
That group, led by former defence minister Itsunori Onodera, formed in June after current defence chief Taro Kono suspended the Aegis Ashore plan. It has weighed in on missile defence and discussed proposals that Japan acquire strike weapons for that mission, Japanese officials have said. 
The group of lawmakers will release their recommendations on Friday after they present them for approval to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's defence policy committee, Onodera told reporters after the group met on Thursday.
Japan under Abe has beefed up its military with stealth fighters designed to fly off carriers, longer-range missiles, new amphibious units and stronger air defences meant to deter threats from neighbours, including North Korea and China. 
Kono said he ordered the Aegis sites relocated because rocket boosters that accelerate interceptor missiles into space could fall on residents. But concern over mounting costs was the main reason for that decision, according to the three sources.
China is rapidly expanding and improving its ballistic missile arsenal, and in 2017 North Korea tested a missile that flew over the Japanese island of Hokkaido.
With around three times the range of radars currently used by Japan, both SPY-6 and SPY-7 would greatly enhance Japan's ability to detect multiple attacks.
One option for Japan that would avoid any political fallout would be to buy both radars, using SPY-6 on Aegis ships and deploying Lockheed's SPY-7 as an early warning radar, one of the sources said.

Onodera's backing would make that change more likely because he approved the Lockheed Aegis radar acquisition two years ago. At the time he was unaware that testing in Hawaii could add at least $500 million to Aegis Ashore's $4 billion budget, separate sources told Reuters last year.
In an interview in the Asahi newspaper on Thursday, Onodera said the ""ideal option"" for Japan would be to find a safe ground-based location. He also noted that building Aegis ships would cost both money and manpower.
Onodera's office declined an interview request, but one source familiar with his position on the radars described him as ""flexible.""
Masahisa Sato, a former deputy defence minister who also served as a deputy minister of foreign affairs, said Japan's choice is between SPY-7 at new sites, with the missile launchers deployed elsewhere, or building Aegis ships equipped with SPY-6.
""I am recommending an increase in Aegis ships,"" he said. ""SPY-7 is under development and there is a question about how it would perform in a new configuration,"" Sato added.
Lockheed Martin said its system could be adapted to ships, and disputed questions about performance.
""SPY-7 radar is the most advanced radar in the world today and we believe it is the best solution for Japan's defence needs,"" the company said in an e-mail.

For its part, Raytheon said the SPY-6 will be deployed on 50 U.S. Navy ships, calling it the ""most advanced radar technology in production today.""

Investing.com -- Even backward-looking numbers can shock.
Investors had been reassuring themselves going into this quarter's earnings season that the Covid-19 shock was priced in, that the worst was behind us, and that the key variable was what people would say about the pace and extent of the recovery. 
However, they're being forced to reassess that after a round of earnings that contained more bad than good, along with economic data that suggested the drop in output was even worse than expected in the second quarter.  Germany's DAX fell over 2.3% by mid-morning in reaction to news that Europe's largest economy had shrunk by 10.1% in the second quarter, far more than expected. That dragged the benchmark STOXX 600 index down 1.3% in sympathy.
A couple of caveats need to be applied to this number. It was the first time that the Federal Statistics Office had put its first estimate of GDP out only 30 days after the end of the previous quarter. Previously it had taken a more leisurely 45 days. So there could be more margin for upward revisions: Germany still hasn't published data for either retail sales, foreign trade or industrial production in June, by which time lockdowns had largely been lifted.
There's particular reason to hope, given that the labor market appears to have stabilized. German jobless numbers for July showed a seasonally-adjusted drop of 18,000, instead of the 43,000 rise expected. Sadly, that performance wasn't yet replicated in Italy, where the jobless rate rose to 8.8% in June from an upwardly-revised 8.3% in May.
Worse-than-expected data can sometimes be shrugged off, but it's harder to do so when companies and banks are disappointing at the same time, and some of the disappointments in Wednesday's releases came from surprising quarters:  Volkswagen AG  (DE:VOWG) was forced to cut its dividend after swinging to an 800 million-euro operating loss; in the U.K., Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY), habitually the most profitable of the U.K.'s big banks, swung to a pretax loss of 676 million pounds ($879 million) after booking loan loss provisions of 2.4 billion pounds, joining  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in taking a much bigger hit against their loan books than expected.  
In similar vein, Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA) swung to a loss in a manner that raised eyebrows, publishing a set of results that maintained that everything was basically rosy except for a 2.08 billion-euro impairment its U.S. business, which resulted in a net loss of 1.16 billion euros. On Tuesday, its bigger rival  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) had tried a similar trick, posting a huge loss that it attributed to an 86% writedown of its U.K. business, while presenting a relatively strong set of operating results for its other businesses, while ING (AS:INGA) had done the same with a 300 mlllion-euro impairment. 
Such discretionary accounting moves, that result in big changes in book valuation while management strives to tell the analyst community that the underlying business is 'just fine, honestly,' raise more questions than they answer, undermining confidence that measures to stabilize the economy are actually working. 
Other disappointments were more predictable:  Renault  (PA:RENA) had already flagged the impairments that led to its record loss of over 7 billion euros, while Airbus's announcement that it will cut production of the A350 - a day after Boeing (NYSE:BA) also warned of production cuts to its long-haul fleet - merely confirmed impressions that it will be years before long-haul travel sector recovers. That was also underlined by Italy's  ENI  (MI:ENI) joining the crowd oil and gas majors who have cut their dividend."

The Asia-focused lender set aside $1.57 billion for potential loan losses in the first six months and said second-half provisions will be lower, even as the pandemic wreaks havoc, according to a statement on Thursday.
“Low interest rates and depressed oil prices continue to be headwinds and we expect new waves of Covid-19 related challenge in the coming quarters, but I am confident that our resilience and client franchise will see us through,” said Chief Executive Officer Bill Winters in the statement.
Like its Wall Street rivals, Standard Chartered got a boost from resurgent financial markets, reporting a 35% rise in revenue for the trading division. That helped offset declining earnings from other areas such as transaction banking and wealth management.
Shares in Standard Chartered were little changed in London, up 0.3% at 9 a.m.
Expectations Beat
The London-based bank, whose largest market is Hong Kong, reported a higher than expected first-half pretax profit of $1.96 billion. It also said income in the second-half is expected to be lower year on year. Analysts at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). said the results were “considerably ahead” of expectations.
Speaking to reporters on a call, Winters said the biggest risk to a sustained economic rebound is a stalled U.S. recovery. Winters said that despite tensions over the former British colony’s future, Hong Kong had seen a “massive inflow” of capital in recent months and called its peg to the U.S. dollar “unassailable.”
The bank has embarked on a new round of job cuts, joining rivals such as Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) and  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) in restarting reductions put on hold at the outset of the pandemic, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday. The firm has drawn up lists of several hundred jobs it plans to eliminate and a cutback program is set to get underway, according to a person familiar with the situation. The company employs about 85,000 people.
Winters said the cuts would be “small” compared to the workforce and that no employee who lost their job as a result of the latest round of cuts “would lose a paycheck in 2020.”
Standard Chartered’s results come days before HSBC publishes its own half-year figures. Investor attention is focused on how the banks have fared against a backdrop of an increasingly tense standoff between China and the West over issues including a sweeping new security law in Hong Kong.
“Any attempts to undermine Hong Kong I’m afraid it would have some pretty deleterious efforts on the financial system more broadly and it’s hard to see any policymakers in the world thinking that’s a good thing to do anytime but particularly now during the pandemic,” said Winters in his interview.

614,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 04:15AM ET</span>","Starved of dollars, Nigerian businesses struggle for survival","By Alexis Akwagyiram and Chijioke Ohuocha
LAGOS/ABUJA (Reuters) - As women in hairnets and anti-coronavirus masks sort through folded nappies coming off a conveyor belt, the head of the Nigerian firm they work for wonders how much longer he can afford to keep them in employment.
Around 80% of the materials that go into Lagos-based diaper and sanitary towel manufacturer Wemy's products are imported. To buy them, Paul Odunaiya needs dollars, which he can no longer find. 
""We're pleading with our suppliers to wait a bit longer so that we can source dollars and pay them,"" Odunaiya told Reuters.
With the price of oil, Nigeria's main export, depressed and foreign exchange reserves dwindling, its central bank is hanging on to its dollars to support the local naira - leaving a dwindling supply of hard currency to buy the imports that are the bedrock of Africa's largest economy.
Muda Yusuf, director general of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce, said that, like Odunaiya, the dollar shortage is hitting most of its 2,000 members hard.
""If the situation persists it will lead to lay-offs,"" he said. ""If you are not producing, there will be a shortage of goods in the market, prices will go up.""
Inflation has risen for 10 straight months, hitting a two-year high of 12.56% in June, piling on greater economic hardship for a population of whom 40% already live below the official poverty line of 137,430 naira ($382) per year.
Added to that, there have been two devaluations of the naira's official rate this year. 
With the oil market depressed by a producer price war and the pandemic-induced global recession, central bank reserves have fallen 20% in the past year to $36.1 billion, around five months of import cover. 
The bank initially sought to stem the decline by suspending dollar auctions in March and continues to severely ration their supply.
""It's been excruciating,"" said Fred Ameobi, executive director of Coscharis Group, a conglomerate whose businesses include automobile assembly.
The government says the economy could shrink by up to 8.9% in 2020, while many of the local banks that Nigerian companies rely on have seen their dollar credit lines halted by international lenders who fear they won't be paid back.
Many firms have resorted to the black market, where the naira trades at around 20% below the official rate, making dollar purchases even more expensive.

For now Odunaiya, whose firm had year to March turnover of 2.5 billion naira, sees only hard times ahead. ""It's going to be a tough year ... Some businesses will die.""

Investing.com - European stock markets slumped Thursday, with the German market underperforming on disappointing economic data as well as generally weak corporate earnings.
At 4:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.9% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.7% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 1.3%. 
Economic data last week, in the form of purchasing managers indexes, indicated that the euro area recovery has gathered speed in July. The drop in the number of people out of work in Germany in July played into that theme, but was outweighed by data showing that the German economy contracted 10.1% in the second quarter, its steepest plunge on record.
Like the German GDP figure, the earnings releases reflect the previous quarter, and have tended to show the severity of the hit from the coronavirus pandemic.
French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA), down 2.8%, posted a record net loss of 7.29 billion euros in the first half of this year, while German rival Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), down 5.3%, unveiled a first-half operating loss of 800 million euros, forcing the carmaker to slash its dividend.
Additionally,  ENI  (MI:ENI) stock fell 3.5% after the Italian oil giant reported a second-quarter loss and reduced its dividend. Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) just about avoided its first quarterly loss in recent history, while French rival  Total  (PA:TOTF) booked exceptional impairments of $8.1 billion in the second quarter, but maintained its dividend.
 Casino  Guichard Perrachon (PA:CASP) slumped 12% after reporting a much wider loss for the first half, Lloyds Bank (LON:LLOY) dropped 8.1% after reporting a rare pretax loss in the first half of the year.
On the flip side, AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) gained 3.1% after the pharmaceutical giant said that second-quarter net profit surged and that late-stage trials for the vaccine it is developing with University of Oxford researchers are under way, while Anheuser Busch Inbev (BR:ABI) jumped 6% after an encouraging beer sales recovery in June.
Late Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve kept its benchmark rate near zero and suggested rates would remain in this range for some time.
""The economy will need high levels of accommodative monetary policy for an extended period,"" Fed chairman Jerome Powell said.
Second quarter GDP figures are due for release later Wednesday in both the U.S. and Germany and will reveal the depth of the economic fallout from the pandemic. Expectations are for an annualized decline in U.S. GDP of 34% on the quarter and an absolute decline of 9.0% in Germany.  
Oil prices were lower Thursday, amid worries about the U.S. economic recovery, despite a huge 10.6 million-barrel drop in U.S. crude oil supplies last week.
U.S. crude futures traded 1% lower at $40.83 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.8% to $43.72.

 Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) jumped 9.4%, providing the biggest boost to the STOXX 600 after saying it was encouraged by a global beer sales recovery in June.
Weak oil prices weighed on the energy sector (SXEP) even as Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) avoided its first quarterly loss in recent history after bumper earnings in its trading business, while France's  Total  (PA:TOTF) said it would maintain its dividend.
Asian stock markets and Wall Street overnight gained as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell promised to ""do what we can, and for as long as it takes,"" to limit economic damage from the pandemic and boost growth.

The country's seven major automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd (T:7201), sold a combined 1.88 million vehicles last month, down from 2.39 million units a year earlier, according to Reuters calculations based on sales data released by the companies. 
The decline in monthly sales has slowed ever since a 50% drop posted in April, and compared with a 38% fall in May.
Global production at these automakers last month fell 26.1% to 1.65 million units on-year, while there was a 62% slump reported in May.
Global demand for cars has been falling since March due to stay-at-home orders in many countries to control the virus outbreak. This led to a drop in visits to car dealerships, while people concerned about their finances also reconsidered big purchases.

Many countries have been easing the lockdown restrictions, but industry experts anticipate that it could take up to five years for demand to recover to 2019 levels.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Nestle (S:NESN) cut its full-year underlying sales growth forecast to 2-3% on Thursday, saying demand had slowed as customers worked their way through cupboards they stocked up with food at the start of coronavirus related-lockdowns.
Packaged food companies have weathered the crisis better than other industries as consumers bought coffee, pasta or infant formula in bulk during COVID-related lockdowns, although Nestle's business supplying restaurants and cafes has suffered. 
Organic sales growth, which excludes the effect of currency swings and acquisitions, eased to 1.3% in the three months to June, from 4.3% in the first quarter, the maker of KitKat chocolate bars said in a statement.
""Most categories saw consumer destocking in the second quarter,"" Nestle said.
The Swiss giant lowered its expectations for organic growth this year to 2-3%, from ""more than 3.5%"" previously. Its trading operating margin is expected to improve after progressing to 17.4% in the first half.
French peer  Danone  (PA:DANO) also on Thursday reported lower like-for-like sales in the second quarter and  Unilever  (AS:UNA) (L:ULVR) posted a smaller-than-expected fall in second-quarter sales last week. Neither gave a growth forecast for this year. 
At Nestle, organic growth for the first half reached 2.8%, above a forecast for 2.3% in a company-compiled analyst poll.
Net profit grew by 18.3% to 5.9 billion Swiss francs ($6.46 billion) in the first half, ahead of a forecast for 5.07 billion francs in the poll. 
""A solid set of figures which were ahead of street expectations and once again underscore the group’s solid characteristics,"" said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox.
Nestle said the overhaul of its business toward high-margin foods such as plant-based burgers remained on track. As part of the shift it has put underperforming North American water brands and Chinese peanut milk Yinlu up for sale.

Shares in the group, which have risen over 5% so far this year were indicated to open 0.42% higher, in line with the market.

Eni now sees its full-year dividend at 55 euro cents a share, compared with an expectation of 89 euro cents back in February. The decision to cut follows similar moves at Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc and Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR).

Africa's biggest steel producer, which is majority-owned by ArcelorMittal SA, said its headline loss had increased to 2.613 billion rand ($157 million) for the six months to June 30 from a loss of 638 million rand a year earlier.
ArcelorMittal South Africa said some parts of its business would remain idle until demand recovered, including placing the melting operations at its Vereeniging Works on care and maintenance from the third quarter.
The company said it expected steel demand to be at between 70% to 75% of pre-lockdown levels for the foreseeable future.
""On the back of a demanding 2019, the first half of 2020 proved to be incredibly difficult with the widespread health, social and business impact brought about by the global COVID-19 pandemic,"" ArcelorMittal South Africa Chief Executive Kobus Verster said.
The steel producer, which has long battled against cheap imports, rising costs and a flagging local economy, said last month it had begun talks to cut an unspecified number of jobs as it slashes costs to deal with the impact of the pandemic.
Job cuts are politically sensitive in a country where unemployment stands at a record high of about 30%.
During the period, liquid steel production fell 54% to 1.1 million tonnes and sales volumes dropped 47% to 1.1 million tonnes.
The company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) fell from a profit of 167 million rand to a loss of 1.256 billion rand.

Investors had already been warned that the coronavirus pandemic had affected almost all parts of the energy giant’s business -- from forecourts to its upstream division. But that impact was offset by gains from buying and selling crude and fuels, the company said in a statement on Thursday.
Like its peers Total SE and Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR), who reported similar gains, Shell’s oil trading business benefits from its extensive infrastructure, giving the company an advantage in periods of extreme price volatility.
Shell’s adjusted net income was $638 million in the second quarter, down 82% from the same period a year earlier but far better than the average analyst estimate of a $664 million loss.
Contango Play
“Results reflected lower realized prices for oil, LNG and gas, lower realized refining margins, oil products sales volumes and higher well write-offs,” the company said. “This was partly offset by very strong crude and oil products trading.”
Shell and its peers exploited so-called contango plays as oil prices hit rock-bottom. The trade consists of filling up onshore storage or oil tankers with cheap crude and simultaneously selling it on the forward market at higher prices. The move helped the trading division of Norway’s Equinor ASA, which is much smaller than Shell’s, to make a record $1 billion gain in the second quarter.
In addition to taking advantage of a contango structure, Shell also made money on its jet-fuel book in particular, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Shell’s gearing, a measure of indebtedness, rose to 32.7%. While investors were forewarned that gearing would rise by as much as 3% on the back of Shell’s multibillion dollar writedown, it further delays its ability to reach its target of 25%.

BUDAPEST/PRAGUE (Reuters) - The auto industry, long a driver of economic growth in central Europe, is likely to be one of the main drags on the region's efforts this year to recover from the impact of COVID-19. 
After communist rule ended in central Europe three decades ago, foreign carmakers invested heavily in a region that had a cheap and efficient workforce. The auto sector became an important source of foreign investment, employment and growth. 
But with car production hit by factories idling during coronavirus lockdowns, and many still not back at full throttle, the industry is expected to be worse hit by COVID-19 than many others in central Europe. 
That is bad news for the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, which are particularly reliant on the auto industry.
""Proportionally this sector is expected to suffer the biggest drop in the manufacturing sector in the region. This is where the recovery will be the slowest so it could be one of the main drags on GDP,"" said Peter Virovacz, an economist at ING in Budapest.
Writing to other European Union states and EU institutions in April, the heads of the Czech, Polish, Hungarian and Slovak auto industry associations said their four countries employed 1.3 million people directly or indirectly in the auto sector and accounted for nearly a fifth of EU vehicle production.
The sector generates 4-6% of Hungary's gross domestic product and a tenth of the Czech Republic's GDP. In Slovakia, it accounts for 13% of GDP and half of industrial production. 
But some car producers in central Europe expect output to drop 20-25% this year, reflecting a global production slump, and GDP is likely to be dented.
The EU executive, the European Commission, has forecast a 7.0% decline in GDP this year in Hungary, a 7.8% fall in the Czech Republic and a 9.0% drop in Slovakia. Poland's GDP, which is less dependent on the auto sector, was seen declining 4.6%.
STEPPING PRODUCTION 
Carmakers have largely avoided mass layoffs in the region and are bringing back staff, gradually increasing the number of shifts - and output - while observing social distancing rules. 
Germany's  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) said its Hungarian plant was working in two shifts and would reintroduce a third from the first week of August.
Kia Motors Slovakia, part of South Korea's Kia Motors Co., is aiming to reintroduce a third shift from September.
""In the second half of 2020, we hope for more orders and an improvement in the situation on the automotive market so we can fully use production capacity,"" a company spokesman said. Kia's Slovak production dropped 27% in the first half of the year. 
Groupe PSA Slovakia, owned by Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA, has said it has enough orders until the autumn.
In Hungary, Suzuki (T:7269) expects a 20% drop in output this year compared to its original forecast. It returned to two shifts in mid-July.
The Czech Automotive Industry Association forecasts car production in the country to drop by a fifth in 2020, and auto sector revenue to fall by at least 215 billion crowns ($9.6 billion).
In their April letter, the four national auto industry associations asked the EU for the swift re-establishment of supply chains, financial support and a review of regulatory requirements. 
Peter Erdelyi, chairman of the Hungarian Car Importers' Association, said there had been no response yet. 
A European Commission spokesperson told Reuters by email that any regulatory flexibility should not involve a delay or rollback of EU environmental ambitions.
""Strict environmental legislation is the best way to promote competitiveness and innovation,"" the spokesperson said.
NO BUYERS, NO ORDERS
Thousands of component suppliers, employing tens of thousands in central Europe, have also been hit hard.
Koyo Bearings Czech Republic, part of Japan's JTEKT Corporation, is running at 70% of levels before the pandemic. 
""We expect demand will continue to gradually grow,"" Koyo's director, Petr Novak, said. ""But we will not reach the levels of the pre-pandemic situation until maybe the middle of 2021. This is our best, optimistic scenario.""
Novak said Europe, which accounts for 80% of the factory's sales, was not recovering as quickly as hoped and there were concerns about a second coronavirus wave.
The firm is planning week-to-week, with many of the 470 staff at home on government schemes to help businesses through the pandemic, he said.
Plastic molding company FAMU Kft, near Budapest, is planning only weeks ahead. 
""Our survival strategy has been that we managed to win new markets and business in electronics and other segments,"" said Jozsef Nyiro, who runs the company.
Nyiro, who is chairman of the Hungarian Automotive Suppliers' Association, said the next few months would be critical for suppliers.

""A task for the government is to regenerate buyers' demand ... because if there are buyers then we get orders,"" he said.

628,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 02:35AM ET</span>",Samsung expects smartphone demand to drive second half earnings,"By Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd expects a global recovery in demand for smartphones and consumer electronics to underpin profits in the second half of the year, after a coronavirus-propelled shift to online working boosted quarterly earnings.
Samsung (KS:005930), the world's top maker of memory chips, tempered its relatively upbeat forecast when announcing second quarter results on Thursday with a warning that the pandemic and trade disputes posed ongoing risks for earnings. 
Samsung posted a 23% jump in operating profit in the April-June quarter on the back of strong DRAM memory chip sales to online server providers, along with cuts in marketing costs.
Prices for the chips, which create temporary workspaces to allow devices to multitask, spiked in the second quarter as people shifted to working and learning online from home because of the pandemic. Samsung's Korean peer SK Hynix and U.S. firm Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) also benefited from the trend. 
Operating profit at Samsung's chip business surged 60% to 5.43 trillion won in the second quarter, accounting for two thirds of its total 8.1 trillion won profit. 
Samsung said it expected server demand for chips to remain solid for the remainder of the year and a boost in smartphone demand, given planned product launches and anticipated demand for 5G-capable phones.
Still, Samsung and other Asian tech companies in the global supply chain have been rocked by trade tensions between the United States and China that has put cross-border trade in components, devices and technology at the mercy of politics.
""Given many uncertainties including COVID-19, trade tension and that customers may change their inventory and investment strategies, it's still difficult to say when (DRAM) price will hit an inflection point,"" senior vice president of memory business Han Jin-man said. 
The company would keep a close eye on chip inventory levels at data centre firms who stockpiled in the first half to meet telecommuting demand, he said.
SK Hynix and some analysts have painted a more downbeat outlook, expectating a fall in DRAM chip prices.
""Demand for the second half ... will be relatively weak ... but it's not going to be a hard landing as the market had feared,"" said Choi Young-san, analyst at E-Best Securities.
SMARTPHONE LAUNCHES
Quarterly operating profit in Samsung's mobile division rose 25% to 1.95 trillion won. Total revenue dropped 6% to 53 trillion won. 
During the quarter, China's Huawei overtook Samsung as the world's biggest seller of phones, shipping 55.8 million devices to Samsung's 53.7 million, according to research firm Canalys.
Huawei's rise was spurred by sales in China, where fresh COVID-19 cases are low, but Samsung is likely to gain back market share as demand in other countries recover.
Samsung plans to unveil new flagship smartphones, including the Galaxy Note and a foldable phone in the second half, as well as expand sales of mid-tier models. 
Samsung also said its display business, which makes screens for mobile phones, TVs and monitors and counts Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a customer, is expected to improve late this year as set makers launch new products to meet demand from lockdowns easing and people shopping for year-end holidays. 

Samsung's shares rose 0.2% on Thursday, matching a 0.2% gain in the wider market.

629,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 02:18AM ET</span>",Total Makes Surprise Profit as Trading Gains Offset Oil Slump,"(Bloomberg) --  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) made a surprise profit after “very good” trading gains offset some of the slump in oil and gas prices due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Mirroring the performance of some of its peers, the French energy giant published a litany of grim figures -- including an $8.1 billion writedown -- for the second quarter, when much of the world was plunged into lockdown to slow the spread of the virus. Yet its traders successfully exploited the extreme volatility in oil and gas prices resulting from the crisis, helping the company avoid the loss that analysts had expected.
Second-quarter adjusted net income was $126 million, Total said in a statement on Thursday. That’s down 96% from a year earlier, but better than the average loss of $443 million expected by analysts.
Total endured an energy-market crisis, “gas prices dropping to historic lows and refining margins collapsing due to weak demand,” Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said in the statement. Yet the company still made a profit thanks to “the outperformance of trading.”
The combination of slumping demand due to Covid-19 lockdowns and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia meant the oil market started the second quarter deep in a price structure called contango. This allowed traders to make easy money by buying crude cheap, storing it, and selling it forward.
The biggest players with access to onshore storage tanks or ships could make the most money. Norway’s Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) gained about $1 billion in the second quarter as its traders exploited the contango.
E&P Loss
Total’s earnings report wasn’t short on bad news. Its exploration and production division posted a $209 million loss, compared with a profit of $2 billion a year earlier. The company’s fuel-retail networks in Europe suffered a 30% drop in demand in the quarter and its refineries ran at just 60% of capacity. Its writedown was related mainly to the value of Canadian oil sands assets.
Energy consumption and prices started to recover in June, but the company emphasized the uncertainty, volatility and potential for continued weakness in global markets. The price of liquefied natural gas on long-term contracts is expected to decline in the second half, and significant deliveries of the fuel may be deferred, it said.
Where it really mattered, Total offered some more good news for investors. It maintained its dividend at 66 euro cents a share and reaffirmed that it was sustainable with Brent crude at $40 a barrel.
Equinor and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc have already slashed their payouts, and BP (NYSE:BP) Plc and Eni SpA are expected to follow, meaning Total may be the only European oil major to fully withstand the current storm.

630,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 02:07AM ET</span>",Stocks - Europe Seen Mixed; Fed Helps But Auto Sector Suffers,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening mixed Thursday, helped by strong gains on Wall Street after the Federal Reserve reiterated its support for the U.S. economy but weighed down by disappointing corporate news, particularly from the auto sector.
At 2:10 AM ET (0610 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% lower, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.3%, while CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.3%.
Late Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.6% higher, the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.4% and the S&P 500 added 1.2%, after the U.S. Federal Reserve kept its benchmark rate near zero and suggested rates would remain in this range for some time.
""The economy will need high levels of accommodative monetary policy for an extended period,"" Fed chairman Jerome Powell said.
This now puts the focus squarely on Capitol Hill to see whether Republicans and Democrats can reach a consensus on the latest stimulus measures before the expiry of some existing measures on Friday.
Second quarter GDP figures are due for release later Wednesday in both the U.S. and Germany and will reveal the depth of the economic fallout from the pandemic. Expectations are for an annualized decline in U.S. GDP of 34% on the quarter and an absolute decline of 9.0% in Germany.
July unemployment figures from Germany will also be studied carefully. So far job losses have stayed relatively contained in Europe thanks to governments' job retention schemes, but these can’t last forever and earnings data so far has suggested many companies remain under pressure.
Airbus Group SE (PA:AIR) announced a fresh cut in production of its A350 long-range jet on Thursday as it posted a larger-than-expected second-quarter loss.
French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) posted a record net loss of 7.292 billion euros in the first half of this year, while German rival Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) unveiled a first-half operating loss of 800 million euros, forcing the carmaker to slash its dividend.
Oil prices were largely unchanged Thursday, with traders having to weigh up the competing influences of a huge drop in U.S. crude oil supplies with signs that the recovery in demand is struggling to gain traction.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration recorded late Wednesday a 10.612 million-barrel draw in inventories for the week ending July 24, its biggest since 2019. On Tuesday, the oil industry's own data showed a draw down of 6.8 million barrels last week.
However, “a resurgence in Covid-19 cases, along with continued travel restrictions has meant that this demand recovery has stalled, or at least slowed. This does not come at a great time for the market, with OPEC+ supply set to increase, with the group easing cuts from the 1 August,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $41.22 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.1% to $44.06.
Elsewhere, gold futures was flat at $1,953.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1761, down 0.3%.

Volkswagen predicted sales for the full year to significantly fall from 2019 levels, but added that as lockdowns eased, global sales have staged a gradual recovery.
The carmaker posted an adjusted operating loss of 800 million euros ($940 million) in the January to June period, down from a 10-billion euro adjusted operating profit in the year-earlier period, and said it will cut its dividend for 2019. 

It proposed a dividend of 4.80 euros per ordinary share and 4.86 euros per preferred share, slashing its initial proposal of 6.50 euros per ordinary share, and 6.56 euros.

Group operating losses, factoring out the effect of Nissan's losses, were at 2 billion euros, the company said. Sales fell 34.9 %, a result the company attributed mainly to the global COVID crisis.

Renault, which with alliance partners Nissan and Mitsubishi is embarking on a major turnaround programme, burned through $6.375 billion euros in cash over the first half.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), the world's largest pension fund, has been closely watching global macro-economic policies since the coronavirus outbreak as these measures may affect markets, the president said.
""As authorities in the world have conducted large-scale fiscal and monetary policy, one of our focus points is how such measures would affect markets,"" Masataka Miyazono, who took over as president in April, said in a interview with Reuters on Wednesday.
GPIF managed 150.6 trillion yen as of end-March and does not usually disclose its influences.
Since the current financial year started in April, Japan's government has compiled two extra budgets for a stimulus package, worth 233.9 trillion yen in total, aiming to cushion the economic blow from the outbreak.
Rating agency Fitch on Wednesday lowered its outlook for Japan's long-term foreign currency debt rating to negative from stable, citing the heavy blow from the coronavirus crisis and rising public debt.
""Currently we are not concerned (about such downgrading moves) but of course we should carefully monitor that point as an investor,"" Miyazono said.
GPIF had reported a record quarterly loss of 17.71 trillion yen ($168.6 billion) in the three months through March as global stock markets plunged during the COVID-19 pandemic.
But Miyazono said the fund's investment philosophy of pursuing stable profits would not change.

GPIF in April raised its allocation target for foreign bonds to 25% from 15% and lowered domestic bonds allocation to 25% from 35%. Its portfolio is evenly split at 25% each across domestic and foreign stocks and domestic and foreign bonds.

The planemaker also said it hoped to avoid consuming cash before M&A and customer financing in the second half of the year after a quarterly outflow of 4.4 billion euros as deliveries tumbled due to the coronavirus collapse in air travel.
Airbus posted an adjusted second-quarter operating loss of 1.226 billion euros ($1.44 billion) as revenues slid 55% to 8.317 billion. Analysts were expecting a loss of 1.027 billion on revenues of 8.552 billion, according to a company-compiled consensus.
The losses include 900 million euros of balance sheet impairment charges related to the industry's worst crisis.
Airbus said it had cut A350 production to five jets a month, after bringing the monthly rate down from 9.5 to six in April.
The move came a day after U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) said it was making further cuts in output of its 787 and 777 jets, which compete with the A350 on long-haul networks.
Airlines were already facing a glut of the industry's biggest jets before the COVID-19 crisis and those models are expected to be the slowest to recover once demand returns to normal levels, which Airbus says could take until 2023 or 2025.

635,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 01:10AM ET</span>","Kraft Heinz meat, cheese sales lag as shoppers buy premium products","By Richa Naidu
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Second-quarter sales of Kraft Heinz’s (O:KHC) Oscar Mayer deli meats and cheese slices grew more slowly than those of higher-end rival products such as ham from pigs fed vegetarian diets on family farms, retail data shows. 
The nearly $7 billion U.S lunch meat market grew by 18% in the 8 weeks to June 13, but Oscar Mayer sales rose only 9%, according to Nielsen data analyzed by  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC). Meanwhile, sales of rival brands like Hormel Foods' (N:HRL) Applegate and  Tyson Foods ' (N:TSN) Hillshire surged 37% and 27%, respectively.
Cheese and chilled processed meat are Kraft Heinz's top two U.S. businesses by retail sales, but Euromonitor data shows Kraft Heinz’s market share in both categories has steadily shrunk since 2015. The company is due to report quarterly earnings on Thursday.
To fuel growth, Kraft Heinz needs to innovate, a process that could take several years, analysts said.
""The higher priced brands are seeing the strongest growth. People aren't trading down to private-label, they're buying the quality stuff,"" Wells Fargo analyst John Baumgartner said. ""Oscar Mayer doesn't have that quality perception with consumers - they're going to have to launch a product that's really clean-label so they can charge more."" 
To appeal to environmentally conscious consumers, the labels of Applegate's roughly $16-a-pound hams say prominently that its pigs are ""humanely raised"" and given vegetarian feed on family farms. The packaging of Oscar Mayer products, which cost about $4.85 per pound in stores, say they don't contain hormones, nitrates or artificial ingredients - a years-old declaration in the industry. 
While Hillshire has rolled out cheese and cracker snack plates with premium prosciutto and wine-infused salami, Oscar Mayer's cheaper plates come with hickory-smoked ham and hard salami. 
Kraft Heinz CEO Miguel Patricio, who began revamping operations when he took over about a year ago, said in April the company had postponed a lot of innovation this year to spend more on media and reduce the number of products it makes. Kraft Heinz declined to comment for this story. 
The company's U.S. cheese sales rose 24% in the 8 weeks to June 13, the Nielsen data shows, once more lagging rivals - including premium private-label brands - that drove 32% growth in the $19 billion U.S. packaged cheese market.

Kraft Heinz has taken some steps to innovate. In September, a fund backed by the company led a $3.5 million investment in animal-free dairy cheese startup New Culture. Kraft Heinz's Cracker Barrel (NASDAQ:CBRL) cheddar cheese is considered premium and has seen some innovation, but it was launched in 1954 and analysts say it needs to further revamp its portfolio through tie-ups with specialty cheese-makers or regional dairies.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly up on Thursday morning in Asia, with the U.S. Federal Reserve avoiding surprises as it concluded its two-day meeting on Wednesday.
Interest rates continue to hover near zero, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell vowed to use all available tools to support the recovery from the most severe economic downturn “in our lifetime” at a virtual press conference on Wednesday.
“The Fed’s large, looming presence and ability to act more if needed has provided a backstop for risk assets over the near term,” Jason Pride, Glenmede chief investment officer, told Bloomberg.
“The focus now shifts to the Federal Open Market Committee’s September meeting, when investors might expect more action,” he added.
A far more pressing question for investors is whether Republicans and Democrats can reach a consensus on the latest stimulus measures before the expiry of some existing measures on Friday.
""If Congress does that to the satisfaction of the market, they’ll just drag the rest of the global markets higher with them,"" CommSec market analyst Tom Piotrowski told Reuters.
But with U.S. President Donald Trump saying on Wednesday that his administration and Democrats in Congress were still ""far apart"" on the measures, and other Republicans opposed to the $1 trillion worth of measures proposed by their own party, investors will be keeping an eye on the progress the two parties make before the expiry date.

In a statement, the company said August would be the third month in a row in which it would ramp up operations.
Aeromexico shares rose after the announcement, closing the day 5.04% above the prior session at 5 pesos a share, despite the carrier posting a second-quarter loss of nearly $1.2 billion after the market closed on Tuesday.
Later on Wednesday, the company said in a filing to the Mexican stock exchange that a New York bankruptcy court had given the airline permission to keep paying salaries, loans and its tax obligations. The court also gave the green light to ""keep existing contracts with key suppliers, travel agencies, partner airlines and insurance companies."" 
The court authorized Aeromexico to meet obligations in certain ""customer programs,"" including for co-branded  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) cards and Chubb (NYSE:CB) Seguros Mexico insurance, and to continue with existing derivative contracts.
The Mexican airline can ""fulfill and honor"" obligations to customers as it sees fit, according to the court, as well as continue to use third-party services for customers.
The bankruptcy court in New York's Southern District also ruled that the company could maintain and renew its letter of credit and surety bond programs without interruption.

Aeromexico, part-owned by Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), late last month became the third airline in Latin America to file for bankruptcy protection, where carriers hit by the coronavirus have had limited help from governments.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Commercial lenders in Hong Kong say they are concerned about a 30% drop in building values over the past 12 months and will consider calling in or restructuring loans if values fall much further. 
If lenders demand repayment of loans or try to tighten terms, it could set off a wave of property sales that might depress prices even further in the Chinese-run territory, which is already stuck in a recession due to the U.S.-China trade spat, violent street protests last year and the new coronavirus. 
""The market is not going to get better in the next half to one year,"" said a real estate investor who provides financing in the city. ""If you’re in the Hong Kong market, I’d say de-risk if you can. Get your money back.""
Banks and non-bank lenders - the array of brokers and investment firms that make up the unregulated 'shadow bank' sector - have lent billions of dollars over the last few years in the world's most valuable real estate market.
Lenders and borrowers were happy when prices were rising, but there is now widespread concern as values decline. 
Mezzanine investors, firms which lend money in generally shorter time frames and at higher interest rates, are seen as most at risk. 
Under Hong Kong Monetary Authority rules, banks cannot lend more than 40% of the asset value to commercial property buyers in order to minimize the damage caused by defaults. Mezzanine investors and other shadow banks are not bound by that.
""There are mezzanine investors that are overly aggressive in providing exceptionally high loan-to-value (LTV) at circa 80% against underlying assets' true value,"" said Ryan Chung, managing director at Huatai International, a major mezzanine investor in the city. 
""Given office rental has retreated roughly 10% first half (of this year) and occupancy rate is on the soft side, it definitely impacts the asset valuation and potentially triggers financial covenants,"" said Chung, referring to the conditions of loans.
Chung said some lenders are now demanding new property valuations in order to check that the latest value does not breach the LTV limit set out in the covenant. 
DEFAULTS STARTED 
Earlier this month, mezzanine investors demanded Goldin Financial Holdings (HK:0530) repay about HK$3.5 billion ($451.55 million) on a loan facility pledged to an office tower in a second-tier eastern Kowloon business district.
Goldin sold a residential land plot this week for HK$3.5 billion in order to repay the debt, taking a HK$2.75 billion loss on its original investment. The creditors that lent the senior debt took possession of the 27-storey property. 
Goldin bought the tower in 2018 from its chairman for HK$17 billion, making the total LTV ratio 60%. Goldin said this month the property had a market value of between HK$15 billion and HK$16.5 billion, but some valuers and creditors told Reuters that even a valuation of HK$15 billion - which would put the LTV ratio at 68% - was too high. 
Falling valuations are worrying banks, which are discussing internally the gap between ""economic realities and market valuations,"" one executive at a major foreign bank with significant mortgage business in Hong Kong told Reuters. 
Defaults have already happened, said the financing investor who predicted no improvement in the market, but banks are not disclosing them. ""Everyone is rolling over (extending the loan due date) in hope things will get back,"" the person said. That could work for another three to six months, he said, but after that the situation could be more serious. 
Alfred Lam, chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Property Finance, said his members were not yet calling in loans but there was rising worry. 

""Our members are concerned,"" he said. ""Some of them previously lent at high LTV, if prices drop another 10%-20%, then even if you receive the asset you can’t cover the costs.""

(Reuters) - United Airlines (O:UAL) on Wednesday extended a deadline for most employees to decide whether to take voluntary furlough deals to Aug. 10, as it waits to see if the U.S. Congress extends an airline bailout in the first week of August.
United announced the extension in a memo to employees seen by Reuters, adding that it was working with unions, which are lobbying U.S. lawmakers for an extension of the bailout that would prevent voluntary furloughs and delay impact on employees until early 2021.
United confirmed the memo and declined to comment further. Most employees had previously faced a Thursday deadline to decide whether to apply to leave.
""While nothing is certain, our union partners have built a strong campaign to advocate for an extension"" of the payroll assistance program, the memo said. ""We have worked closely with them to support those efforts."" But the letter added that United is ""not counting on Congress passing an extension.""
Chicago-based United said last week more than 6,000 employees had opted for exit packages. But after sending 36,000 notices of potential furloughs this month, that relatively low take-up suggests United might have to furlough a significant number of workers.
On Monday, a majority of the U.S. House of Representatives signed a letter calling for a six-month extension of the $32 billion aviation industry payroll aid program, arguing it is crucial to keeping hundreds of thousands of aviation workers employed.
The payroll program is set to expire Sept. 30.
Congress awarded $25 billion in payroll assistance to U.S. passenger airlines in March, along with $4 billion for cargo carriers and $3 billion for airport contractors. Most bailout funds do not have to be paid back.

(Reuters) - Payments processor  PayPal Holdings Inc  (O:PYPL) said on Wednesday that a surge in e-commerce transactions and new accounts that drove quarterly profits 86% higher was continuing and would support additional investments in mobile-payment tools.
The news lifted the stock as much as 6% in after-hours trading. The stock, seen as an e-commerce investment play, was already up 44% since PayPal last reported results on May 6.
The company said it expected the trends to continue and that it now expected earnings per share for the full year to increase about 25% on 22% revenue growth.
Three months ago, the company had withdrawn full-year guidance because of uncertainty about the economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.
""We have more confidence in the elevated e-commerce trends we are seeing,"" Chief Financial Officer John Rainey told analysts.
What in late April felt like a potentially short-lived surge of panic buying supported by government stimulus checks has become a ""durable and profound behavioral shift,"" Rainey said.
The company processed $222 billion in payments over the period, up 30% from a year earlier, adjusted for foreign exchange. The rate of payment growth compares with a year-earlier increase of 26% that had slowed to 19% in the first quarter when the pandemic broke and retail spending collapsed broadly.
The company added 21.3 million accounts during the quarter, up 137% from a year earlier.
The company said it would invest $300 million more this year, mostly on its mobile phone app that displays QR codes so that people can go into stores and pay without touching anything.
Net income increased to $1.53 billion, or $1.29 per share, in the quarter ended June 30, from $823 million, or 69 cents per share, a year earlier. [https:// 
Revenue increased 25% to $5.26 billion, topping the average analyst estimate of $5.0 billion.

(Reuters) - Eastman Kodak Co (N:KODK) CEO Jim Continenza added $79 million to his net worth on Wednesday when his options in the imaging company turned from worthless to lucrative thanks to a U.S. government loan for a pharmaceutical ingredients supply deal that super-charged the value of his shares. 
Kodak's stock increased 1,167% in value in two days, after the administration of President Donald Trump agreed to provide a $765 million loan for the company to produce pharmaceutical ingredients to help fight the coronavirus pandemic. Trump announced the deal at a news conference on Tuesday evening. 
Continenza's stock options, granted to him when he became Kodak's CEO and executive chairman in 2019, had no value on Monday, but were worth $59 million on Wednesday following the rally in the stock, according to an analysis by compensation consultant Farient Advisors. Continenza also owned 650,000 Kodak shares as of June 23, which went up in value on the news by $20 million.
Kodak did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Before news of the deal, Kodak, which emerged from bankruptcy in 2013, was only worth a little over $100 million. It ended trading on Wednesday with a market capitalization of $1.5 billion. 
While Kodak's rally enriched all its shareholders, more than half the company is owned by a few key insiders, including board directors Philippe Katz and George Karfunkel. They booked the majority of the gains in the company's rise in market value.
Rochester, New York-based Kodak, founded in 1888, is best known for its cameras, which went out of favor with consumers as they turned to smart phones to take pictures. Kodak was also known for its film and film processing, businesses that dried up with the growth of digital photography.

This was not the first example of a U.S. government contract quickly enriching corporate executives. Stock options awarded to executives at U.S. vaccine maker  Novavax  Inc (O:NVAX) swelled in value after a $1.6 billion grant from the federal government last month.

644,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 06:36PM ET</span>",Shale Drillers Signal Bleak 2020 While Trump Champions Oil Patch,"(Bloomberg) -- Shale explorers Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) Inc., WPX Energy (NYSE:WPX) Inc. and  QEP Resources  Inc (NYSE:QEP). signaled a grim rest of 2020 for the U.S. oil patch just hours after President Donald Trump arrived in the Permian Basin championing “American energy dominance.”
In second-quarter earnings reports published after the close of trading in New York, QEP cut its production outlook, WPX further reduced its capital spending budget, while Concho stuck with plans to keep crude volumes flat from 2019 levels, ending years of growth. QEP shares dipped as much as 20%.
It’s a downbeat reality check for the industry, which is emerging from the worst oil price crash in a generation and another sign that the decade-long, debt-fueled surge of production growth is over. Meanwhile, Trump, speaking in front of an oil rig near Midland, Texas, vowed to defend U.S. shale against “zealots, radicals and extremists trying to shut down your industry.” Never again would America be beholden to foreign nations for energy, he said.
All three U.S. shale producers posted net losses that would have been much worse had it not been for their large hedge books, which protect against price declines. Concho takes out some of the industry’s largest hedges, with about three-quarters of its 2020 production insured to some extent against this year’s price declines.
That allowed Concho to keep its dividend for the period. Asset sales and other one-off items in a volatile quarter meant that Concho beat estimates for its adjusted earnings by a wide margin.
Even so, hedging only protects oil companies against price declines for so long, and at around $40 a barrel, much of U.S. shale is getting less than what’s needed to cover drilling and completion costs in many areas.
Elsewhere, TechnipFMC (NYSE:FTI) updated its 2020 outlook on Wednesday to tell investors that the global oilfield equipment maker now expects to produce as much as $150 million in free cash flow this year, compared with no expectation for free cash flow before. The Houston-based company reported second-quarter earnings of 9 cents a share, excluding certain items, which beat analysts’ estimates.
American shale oil producers are expecting a particularly tough earnings season as the pandemic rips its way through the global economy, depressing demand for crude. Their rapid growth over the past decade was based on borrowed money, which they are struggling to pay back now that prices and production have dropped.

The Wells notice was issued to the index provider for failing to provide sufficient disclosures on some volatility-related indexes in 2018, according to the filing from Tuesday. 
The SEC is planning to file an enforcement action against the index provider, a joint venture between S&P Global and exchange operator CME Group (NASDAQ:CME), the filing said.

""The Staff's recommendation may involve a civil injunctive action, a cease and desist proceeding, disgorgement, pre-judgment interest and civil money penalties.""
A Wells notice does not necessarily mean the SEC will bring any action against the company or that the recipient has violated any law.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The former chief executive of specialty finance lender Hercules Capital (NYSE:HTGC) Inc was sentenced on Wednesday to six months in prison for paying $450,000 to help his daughters gain an unfair edge in the college admissions process.
Federal prosecutors in Boston say Manuel Henriquez and his wife, Elizabeth Henriquez, sought to rig their two daughters' college entrance exam results and secure the older one's admission to Georgetown University in Washington as a fake tennis recruit.
Lawyers for Henriquez, who co-founded Palo Alto, California-based Hercules Capital, sought leniency during a hearing held virtually because of the coronavirus pandemic. He apologized for crimes that had made him ""a common thief.""
But U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton said a message needed to be sent to other ""over-the-top wealthy"" millionaires who think the law does not apply to them. He also ordered the 56-year-old to pay a $200,000 fine.
""You have woefully misused your great wealth, and for the commission of this crime, you need to go to jail,"" he said.
Henriquez, who stepped down from Hercules Capital after the charges were announced in March 2019, is among 55 people charged with participating in a scheme in which wealthy parents conspired with college admissions consultant William ""Rick"" Singer to fraudulently secure their children's admission to top schools.
Singer pleaded guilty last year to facilitating college entrance exam cheating and using bribery to secure students' admission to colleges as fake athletic recruits.
Prosecutors said Henriquez and his wife, beginning in 2015, paid Singer about $50,000 to have an associate proctor the SAT and ACT college entrance exams for their daughters and feed them answers.
Prosecutors said the couple also paid $400,000 to have Singer arrange to have a Georgetown tennis coach he was bribing designate their older daughter as an athletic recruit. 
Elizabeth Henriquez was sentenced in March to seven months in prison.

To date, 28 other parents have pleaded guilty, including ""Full House"" star Lori Loughlin.

(Reuters) -  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) on Wednesday forecast fourth-quarter revenue largely above Wall Street expectations, powered by sales of its chips used in 5G devices and reaching a settlement with Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL].
Shares of the company were up as much as 13% in extended trading despite a forecast for fourth-quarter chip revenue slightly lower than analysts expected because of a delayed ""flagship phone launch"" analyst believe is Apple's new iPhones.
The company also said it resolved a licensing dispute with Huawei, which will pay Qualcomm a catch-up payment of $1.8 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter. While Huawei is still barred from buying Qualcomm's chips under U.S. regulations, it has now resumed paying licensing fees for wireless technology, Qualcomm said.
After resolving a bruising legal battle with iPhone maker Apple Inc (O:AAPL) last year, Qualcomm entered 2020 with a deal to resume selling chips to Apple and predicting revenue growth from 5G devices, which fetch higher chip revenue per phone for the company. Qualcomm forecast fourth-quarter chip shipments with a midpoint of 155 million units, slightly below expectations of 159 million units, according to FactSet data.
Chief Financial Officer Akash Palkhiwala told Reuters in an interview that Qualcomm expected to make up some of those sales in the fiscal first quarter.
""We're seeing a partial impact from the delay of a flagship phone launch. And so what we've seen is a slight delay that pushes some of the units out from the September quarter to the December quarter for us,"" he said.
Qualcomm executives did not name the customer, but analyst widely believe it to be Apple. 
While Qualcomm has long supplied processors and modems to help phones connect to wireless data networks, it has pushed into also selling radio-frequency chips to help phone makers handle the more complex signals involved in 5G networks. 
Palkhiwala said Qualcomm expected to win sales with all major smartphone makers, including the customer facing a delayed flagship launch in the fiscal fourth quarter, though he did not name specific customers. ""Suffice to say, I think going forward we expect to be selling to all of them,"" he said.
Qualcomm, the world's biggest supplier of mobile phone chips, said it expects current-quarter adjusted revenue of between $5.5 billion and $6.3 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $5.78 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Qualcomm, which generates most of its profits by licensing its technology to mobile phone makers and others, said licensing revenue in the segment was $1 billion, well above estimates of $851 million, according to FactSet.
Revenue from its chip segment - its largest by sales - was $3.80 billion, compared with estimates of $3.90 billion.

The San Diego-based firm said it shipped 130 million chips capable of wireless data connections, compared with estimates of 134.7 million, according to FactSet data. The shipments put average selling prices for chips at $29.23, lower than the $32 in the previous quarter when the company had released higher-priced flagship chips.

Investing.com - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) surged in after-hours trade on Wednesday after reporting better-than-expected earnings above the high range of its guidance.
Qualcomm shares gained 12% in after-hours trade following the report.
Qualcomm announced earnings per share of 86 cents on revenue of $4.89 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of 70 cents on revenue of $4.81 billion.
Chip sales fell 17% to 130 million, but the company is expecting to turn around performance in the fiscal fourth quarter, guiding chip shipments in the range of 145 million to 165 million.
For the fourth quarter, the company guided revenue in the range of $7.3 billion to $8.1 billion and non-GAAP diluted EPS between $1.05 and $1.25.
The upbeat guidance was boosted by settlement with Huawei. Qualcomm said the settlement would add about $1.8 billion in revenue and $1.38 in earnings per share. 
Fourth-quarter QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business revenue was expected in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.9 billion, while QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business revenue was guided in a range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion.
""Our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 includes an impact of greater than ($0.25) to EPS attributable to a planning assumption of an approximate 15% year-over-year reduction in handset shipments due to COVID-19, including a partial impact from the delay of a global 5G flagship phone launch. However, the actual impact may differ materially due to the challenging economic environment and highly uncertain effects of COVID-19,"" the company said.

651,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 04:30PM ET</span>","Exclusive: WTO unlikely to get interim leader as U.S. insists on its candidate, causes impasse","By Andrea Shalal and Emma Farge
WASHINGTON/GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization will likely not appoint an interim chief to succeed outgoing Director-General Roberto Azevedo in late August, three sources following the process said on Wednesday, after Washington's insistence on a U.S. candidate caused a deadlock.
Keen to avoid a leadership void, WTO members were due to select an acting chief from among Azevedo's deputies to take over from the Brazilian while they consider eight candidates vying to head the global trade watchdog, which is facing an acute crisis amid rising U.S.-China tensions and intense criticism from Washington.
Azevedo resigned a year before the end of his term to allow his successor time to prepare for the next major ministerial conference in 2021.
Under the new proposal, four deputies - from the United States, China, Germany and Nigeria - would keep their current responsibilities, instead of one being named to act as interim chief until Azevedo's replacement is chosen later this year.
""The U.S. is insisting on an American, but China and Europe put the brakes on that,"" said a former WTO official familiar with the current process.
A decision to finalise the interim arrangement is expected on Friday when WTO members are due to meet. A new, permanent director-general is expected to be named by Nov. 7, a timeframe which could allow for input following the U.S. election.
No comment was immediately available from the U.S. Trade Representative's office in Washington. WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell said: ""Let’s wait and see what happens on Friday.""
The choice of an acting chief, an administrative job described by Rockwell as ""making sure the trains run on time"", was supposed to be easy. Members had thought German Karl Brauner was likely to get the temporary job.
However, Washington has been pushing its candidate, Alan Wolff, six sources told Reuters, and this paralysed the process. Intense consultations have ensued.
""They jumped into the fray. The Americans are saying they want an American,"" said one delegate. 
While trade insiders have praised Wolff's extensive experience, many consider the choice to be controversial, partly because of geopolitical tensions.
Not only is Washington at loggerheads with another key member, China, but it has paralysed the WTO's top appeals court by blocking the appointment of new judges. U.S. President Donald Trump has even suggested quitting the body, although no firm plans have been announced.
ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF U.S. CANDIDATE
Some experts argue Wolff would be a good choice given his expertise, and that it is Washington's turn since it has never headed a body it had a major hand in shaping.
Crucially, he is thought to have a good working relationship with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, one of the few top Trump advisers who has survived the president's entire first term.
Some members say the controversy over the caretaker role bodes ill for the choice of a more permanent chief, which members must make by consensus.
""If we can't even decide on the interim, how will we choose a DG?"" said one delegate.
Rufus Yerxa, a former WTO deputy director general who now heads the National Foreign Trade Council, said it could prove difficult to choose a successor for Azevedo even after the U.S. election, if the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, wins.
Biden's team would likely want to hold off on finalizing a selection until his inauguration in January. ""That could lead to a longer hiatus,"" he said. 
However, others say the failure to select an interim leader could put pressure on WTO members to move forward more quickly with selecting a successor for Azevedo, the first chief in WTO history to leave early.

""It makes the void more pronounced,"" said one of the sources. ""If you have an acting (chief), there's no hurry.""

654,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 04:20PM ET</span>","Boeing slashes jet output, eyes factory shake-up as COVID-19 hammers sales","By Ankit Ajmera and Eric M. Johnson
(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) slashed production of its biggest twin-engined jets, delayed its new 777X by up to a year and began sunsetting the iconic 747 as it posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss dominated by the COVID pandemic on Wednesday. 
The cuts mark the industry's latest effort to tackle a crisis that has decimated demand for air travel, with oversupplied wide-body models like the 787 Dreamliner and 777 plunging deeper into an existing downturn.
Boeing also remains exposed to tensions between the United States and China, which has shelved plans to buy big U.S. jets.
""Our industry and our company are weathering challenges like none we have ever experienced in our lifetimes,"" Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told analysts.
Boeing said it would cut 787 output to six a month in 2021 - down from a previous goal of seven and the third such cut since a year ago when output touched a record 14 a month.
It also plans to cut combined output of the 777 mini-jumbo and its new 777X sister model to two a month in 2021 from a previous goal of three, while delaying the 777X entry to service by a year to 2022, confirming a Reuters report.
Boeing shares fell 3% partly on the lower production, though analysts said it had managed to contain its cash burn, a central concern for investors.
Boeing lost an adjusted $4.79 per share, against average estimates of a loss of $2.54, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The commercial airplanes unit was hit by $468 million in severance expenses related to plans to cut 19,000 jobs of its roughly 160,000 workforce and Boeing warned deeper cuts were possible.
""We'll have to further assess the size of our workforce,"" Calhoun told employees. 
The financial impact of the health crisis has compounded the safety grounding of Boeing's narrow-body 737 MAX 16 months ago.
Calhoun told analysts MAX deliveries would resume in the fourth quarter, a fresh delay of several weeks that raises the prospect that its U.S. return to service could slip into 2021. 
Boeing also slowed plans to lift battered MAX production, by pushing its target of 31 jets a month into 2022 from 2021.
""We still see a path to positive cash flow in 2021,"" CFO Greg Smith added, noting it would take a year after MAX deliveries begin to clear a backlog of around 450 parked jets.
787 FACTORY STUDY
In a further shake-up, Calhoun said Boeing was looking at whether to consolidate 787 production in one location as it cuts output. 
It splits production on the 787 Dreamliner between Everett, Washington, and North Charleston, South Carolina.
That raises questions over the future of the Everett hub because the largest 787-10 can only be built in South Carolina.
Smith said Boeing would be able to return to a rate of 10-11 787s monthly at some point. 
Calhoun said it was too early to predict the outcome of the study, part of a wider industrial reassessment.
The wide-body production cuts reflect fears that it could take until 2023 for air traffic to return to normal levels. Long-range routes - served by bigger jets like Boeing 787 and Airbus (PA:AIR) A350 - have been hit harder than short hops.
Industry sources said Boeing's production cuts would put pressure on Airbus to further cut its own wide-body production. Airbus declined comment ahead of earnings on Thursday.
Boeing also confirmed the last of its legendary 747 would roll out of the factory in 2022. 
The easily spotted hump-topped jumbo had democratized global air travel in the 1970s and was a favorite of presidents and potentates, before it fell behind modern twin-jets. 

The coronavirus pandemic has added to the pain.

Investing.com - PayPal reported on Wednesday second-quarter earnings and revenue that topped expectations as the Covid-19 pandemic boosted demand for digital payments.
PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) shares gained 0.05% in after-hours trade following the report.
PayPal announced earnings per share of $1.07 on revenue of $5.26 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.87 on revenue of $4.99 billion.
The beat on the top line was driven by a larger-than-expected increase in new accounts that underpinned payment volumes.
Reported net new active accounts jumped 22% for the quarter year-on-year, bringing total active accounts to 346 million, up 21%. That was above consensus estimates of 335 million.
Total payment volume (TPV), a key measure of performance, rose 19%, to $222 billion, above consensus estimates of $210.73 billion.
""In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital payments have become more important and essential than ever,"" the company said.
For the third quarter, PayPal guided TPV growth in the ""high 20s,"" and revenue and diluted non-GAAP EPS to grow about 23% and 25%, respectively.

656,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 04:10PM ET</span>",Wall St. closes higher after Fed vows more support for the virus-battered economy,"By Sinéad Carew
New York (Reuters) - U.S. stocks added to gains on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve repeated a pledge to use its ""full range of tools"" to support the economy but cautioned that the outlook ""will depend significantly on the course of the virus.""
At the end of its two-day policy meeting the Fed said it will keep its interest rate target range until it is confident the economy has weathered the coronavirus pandemic and is on track for maximum employment and price stability goals.
While strategists said they found no surprising decisions after the meeting, many pointed out that the Fed's focus on the virus highlighted the uncertainties it is facing. 
""The Fed is putting health again front and center in its statement, which is impactful and meaningful, especially when we’re waiting on a bipartisan agreement on the fifth round of the CARES Act. It’s a bit ominous, to be frank,"" said Nela Richardson, investment strategist at St. Louis-based Edward Jones. 
But Richardson noted the ""commitment to do whatever it takes to get the economy going again"" and a recognition the economy has improved and ""come up from the bottom.""
And with Fed confirmation of an extraordinarily uncertain path, ""investors can feel certain that monetary stimulus is going to remain accommodative for the foreseeable future,"" said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi Personal Wealth Management.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 162.69 points, or 0.62%, to 26,541.97, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 40.16 points, or 1.25%, to 3,258.6 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 140.85 points, or 1.35%, to 10,542.94. 
Wall Street's major indexes were already higher before the Fed commentary as investors anticipated earnings reports due on Thursday from Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Alphabet's Google (O:GOOGL). 
These companies were among the biggest boosts for Nasdaq even as the chief executives of all four companies also faced jabs from lawmakers at a congressional hearing on antitrust issues.
""You'll often see an uptick in those shares ahead of earnings and if they disappoint then they tend to sell off,"" said Citi's Snyder.
Investors were also focused on contentious negotiations in Washington around what should go into government's next coronavirus relief plan.
Advanced Micro Devices Inc (O:AMD) shares rose after the chipmaker raised its full-year revenue forecast and boosted the Philadelphia chip index (SOX). 
 Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) climbed after the coffee chain said business was ""steadily recovering"" worldwide and it would report a profit in the current quarter.
Of the S&P 500 firms that have reported results, 79.1% have surpassed a low bar of quarterly profit expectations, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Recent data pointed to a possible slowdown in business and hiring as several U.S. states reimposed restrictions after a spike in COVID-19 infections, while deaths in the country caused by the disease surpassed 150,000 on Wednesday.

 Boeing Co  (N:BA) shares slipped after it slashed production on its widebody programs and reported a bigger-than-expected loss due to the fallout from the pandemic.

Investing.com -  American lawns never saw so much love. Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG) rallied after reporting strong growth, a bump in guidance, and a special dividend.
The marketer of branded consumer lawn and garden as well as indoor and hydroponic growing products said its U.S. Consumer and Hawthorne segments led to 28% company-wide sales growth to $1.49 billion and a 22% improvement in non-GAAP adjusted earnings in the fiscal third quarter.
The company increased its guidance for full-year sales, adjusted earnings, and free cash flow as a result of the performance.
Shares have more than doubled since March and hit a new 52-week high on Wednesday. The stock has two buy ratings, two holds and no sells, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. Shares traded up 12% on Wednesday.
The board of directors approved payment of a special dividend of $5 per share and increased its regular quarterly dividend by 7%, to 62 cents per share. 
“As we enter the final weeks of fiscal 2020 and prepare for the start of our next fiscal year, we remain optimistic about the strength of our business as well as our ability to continue to enhance shareholder value,” said Jim Hagedorn, chairman and chief executive officer. The company will also make special one-time payments to nearly 3,000 associates.
“Consumer purchases entering August are up 23% at our largest four retail partners and we’ve seen increases in every product category,” Hagedorn said. “We also continued to see strong third quarter growth at Hawthorne in every product category and geography.”      
The company’s newly revised sales guidance of 26% to 28% growth assumes the U.S. Consumer segment grows 20% to 22% in fiscal 2020 and Hawthorne sales increase 55% to 60%. That compares to expectations set in June of U.S. Consumer sales up 9% to11% and Hawthorne up 45% to 50%.
Scotts revised guidance for non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share of $6.65 to $6.85, which compares with the June forecast of $5.65 to $5.85 per share.  
“The growth we saw in June and July clearly exceeded our expectations as we have seen unprecedented levels of consumer engagement later in the summer than normal,” said Randy Coleman, executive vice president and chief financial officer.

667,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>",GM says it can pay off $16 billion loan if U.S. recovery continues,"By Nick Carey and Ben Klayman
(Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) on Wednesday said if the U.S. economy continues to recover from the coronavirus pandemic and the auto industry does not experience any further production shutdowns, the No. 1 U.S. automaker should be able to generate enough cash to pay off a $16 billion loan by the end of the year.
""Obviously, it is still a very fluid situation as you know and we're watching the virus, the economy and its impact on the overall industry very closely,"" Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara told reporters.
She spoke after GM posted a smaller-than-expected second-quarter loss thanks to solid high-margin pickup truck sales and aggressive cost-cutting that helped mitigate the impact of a forced shutdown that left its North American plants shut for eight of the 13 weeks in the quarter. 
After initially rising, GM's shares were off 1.7% in early afternoon trading. 
""We maintain a sell (rating) following the stock's sharp rebound, not expecting GM's vehicle sales to return to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon and consider its new model pipeline as relatively unexciting compared to peers,"" CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson said in a research note.
If the recovery continues, GM expects adjusted operating earnings in the second half of the year in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion, with the third quarter slightly stronger than the fourth quarter, Suryadevara told analysts on a later call. She said in that scenario GM should generate cash flow of between $7 billion and $9 billion during the second half.
Analysts were expecting second-half operating earnings of more than $4.4 billion. 
Suryadevara also said GM should repay its $16 billion revolving credit line by the end of 2020, an action that again depends on a continued economic recovery and annual industry-wide U.S. new vehicle sales of 14 million units this year.
But spiking COVID-19 cases across Southern and Southwestern U.S. states have left that recovery in doubt. 
Weekly jobless claims numbers from the Labor Department released last week showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose, unexpectedly, for the first time in nearly four months, suggesting the labor market was stalling amid the resurgence in new COVID-19 cases and depressed demand.
Asked whether spiking COVID-19 infection rates were hurting demand anywhere, Chief Executive Mary Barra told analysts GM was ""cautiously optimistic,"" citing improving China and U.S. sales.
GM said it was ""working all avenues"" to boost U.S. dealer inventories and all of its U.S. full-size pickup truck and full-size SUV plants are back at three shifts. Nearly all of its other plants are now working at pre-pandemic shift levels.
GM also said it would increase production of light-duty full-size pickups at its Fort Wayne, Indiana, assembly plant by about 1,000 units a month beginning Sept. 1.
GM reported a net loss for the quarter of $758 million, or 56 cents per share, down from a profit of $2.4 billion, or $1.66 per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the loss was $806 million.

Excluding onetime items, GM reported a loss of 50 cents per share. Analysts had expected a loss of $1.77 per share.

Investing.com - Folks are eatin’ good in the neighborhood again.
Poor grammar aside, Dine Brands Global (NYSE:DIN) rose 10% on Wednesday after reporting improved sales and traffic at Applebee’s and IHOP locations in the second quarter.
Shares of casual dining peers also rose, including Texas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH), up 6.1%, Bloomin’ Brands, up 2%, Chuy’s Holdings, up 7%, and Brinker International (NYSE:EAT), up 5.6%.
Shares of Dine Brands are down about 44% in 2020. The stock has three buy ratings, one hold and no sells.
Covid-related lockdowns across the country in the spring forced Americans to stay at home or order in. With the lifting of those restrictions, people flocked back to their neighborhood haunts.
Comparable same-restaurant sales at Applebee's improved 11 out of 13 weeks through the week ended June 28. IHOP’s comparable same-restaurant sales improved sequentially for 12 consecutive weeks out of 13 in the same period. About 95% of the 3,154 domestic locations were open for dine-in or take-out and delivery as of June 30.
“Throughout the second quarter, weekly comparable sales and traffic at both Applebee’s and IHOP improved as state and local governments began to ease restrictions on dining room operations. This, coupled with the significant growth of our brands’ off-premise business, contributed to the progress made during the quarter,” said Steve Joyce, chief executive officer of Dine Brands Global.
Off-premise sales at both brands increased significantly. At Applebee’s, off-premise sales accounted for 60.5% of the sales mix for the second quarter, compared to 16.3% for the first quarter of 2020 and 13% for the fourth quarter of 2019. IHOP’s off-premise sales accounted for 53.6% of sales, compared to 12.8% for the first quarter of 2020 and 10.1% for the fourth quarter."

671,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 12:25PM ET</span>",Bad timing: COVID compounds woes of Renault-Nissan alliance,"By Gilles Guillaume and Naomi Tajitsu
PARIS/TOKYO (Reuters) - When the French part of the Renault-Nissan alliance reports its results on Thursday, investors expect confirmation of a harsh reality: automakers that already had weaknesses are having them mercilessly exposed by the COVID-19 epidemic.
All the world's car companies have been in crisis at one time or another in the past few years, but it so happens that the virus hit just as the alliance faced its own reckoning after the messy ouster of its architect Carlos Ghosn.
That leaves  Renault  (PA:RENA) and partners Nissan (T:7201) and Mitsubishi (T:7211) vulnerable to what Carlos Tavares, boss of rival PSA (PA:PEUP), described as a ""totally Darwinian period"" in global automaking.
COVID-19, combined with other headwinds facing the industry, ""will winnow out the ones that are agile and frugal, and the ones that aren't,"" Tavares, whose own company reported a first-half profit this week, told France's Les Echos newspaper.
Interviewed by a newspaper recently in Lebanon where he fled from Japan, Ghosn took his own swipe at his old employers calling their results ""pathetic"" and driven as much by a lack of joint leadership as the COVID-19 pandemic.
Analysts' consensus forecast is that Renault will report a 1.8 billion euro ($2.1 billion) operating loss for the first half of 2020, according to Refinitiv data, and a net loss of around 5 billion euros when exceptional costs and the effect of Nissan's losses are factored in. Analysts estimates diverged widely.
That will represent a double whammy this week for the alliance, after Nissan Motor Co on Tuesday warned of a record $4.5 billion operating loss this year and its lowest sales in a decade. 
Renault said after those results that Nissan's performance will represent a net loss for the French firm of 1.24 billion euros in the second quarter.
The alliance says it has a turnaround plan. It has said it will cut vehicle ranges by a fifth, slash thousands of jobs, and double down on a plan for alliance members to cooperate more closely on car production.
""Renault is among those (carmakers) than can remain independent, as long as they continue to reinforce their cooperation,"" said Denis Schemoul, analyst with IHS Markit.     
LEAKY BOAT
The challenge for the alliance, though, is whether it can repair its leaky boat and simultaneously try to ride out the COVID-19 storm.
A major handicap is that its global footprint, once a strength, has become a vulnerability. 
While European sales have started to recover, demand has been slow to pick up in North America, Nissan's biggest market, as a surge in coronavirus infections in the past month has kept many people away from car dealerships. 
Meanwhile, Mitsubishi has been stung by declining demand in southeast Asia, its biggest market, which was affected by the coronavirus later than other regions.
The alliance has for years countered the effects of an ageing model range by discounting, but that ate into margins, leaving it little cushion in a crisis. 
In the quarter that ended in June, Nissan's operating margin fell to -13.1% from 0.2% a year ago. In comparison, PSA posted a group margin of 2.1% for the first half.
The alliance's planned cost-cutting offers little immediate relief. In the April-June period, Nissan booked a restructuring charge of 40.1 billion yen ($382 million). Renault estimates its restructuring will cost it 1.2 billion euros over three years.

Thursday's earnings announcement will be the first in his new job for Luca de Meo, the former Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) executive who started as Renault CEO this month. He has said he feels a ""sense of urgency"" to implement the turnaround plan.

NEW YORK (LPC) - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Merchant Banking Division (MBD) is seeking up to $17 billion for private credit investments for senior debt financings and special situations transactions, according to documents from Connecticut's state pension plan. 
Consisting of total investor commitments and anticipated leverage, MBD is targeting US$7bn for Broad Street Loan Partners IV (Loan Partners IV), according to the documents. The fund will participate in senior loan deals in the upper middle market and smaller deals in the broadly syndicated loan market.
A Goldman Sachs spokesperson declined to comment. 
The Goldman unit is also seeking between US$5bn and US$10bn for West Street Strategic Solutions I (WSSS I), a special situations fund that will invest in transactions that include growth capital and balance sheet restructurings.
Loan Partners IV has raised approximately US$1bn from investors, excluding leverage, while WSSS I has raised approximately US$6.4bn, according to US Securities and Exchange Commission regulatory filings.
""We accelerated the marketing of a new credit fund called West Street Strategic Solutions as a part of our transition to fund-driven investing. Client receptivity has been very strong,"" David Solomon, the firm's chief executive officer, said on the bank's second-quarter earnings call. ""We believe this strategy is well-timed to capture opportunities in the market today and provide critical private financing to companies in need.""
MBD’s fundraise comes at a competitive time in the private credit market, with 486 funds in the market this month, the most in the past five-and-a-half years, according to data from research firm Preqin. Almost 300 of those vehicles are raising capital for direct lending, most often associated with senior debt, and special situations, according to the data. 
Fund managers investing in direct lending and special situations are targeting more than US$124bn of the US$239bn being raised across private credit funds globally, as of July 2020, according to Preqin. 
Concurrently, lending to private equity-backed companies in the middle market, the most common type of private credit transaction, fell as much as 70% in the second quarter, according to Refinitiv LPC data. 
Limited partners (LPs) such as university endowments, insurance companies and pension funds invest in private credit funds. 
The Connecticut pension fund is considering a US$350m commitment to Goldman Sachs' investment funds to manage across different credit strategies, including Loan Partners IV and WSSS I. 
The pension fund portfolio has a 5% allocation to private credit, Shawn Wooden, Connecticut state treasurer, said in an email. 
""The purpose of this allocation is to generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns above public market debt strategies and reduce volatility through lower correlation to other asset classes,"" he said.
The private credit allocation can include sub-strategies that invest in senior debt, junior debt, distressed debt and special situations, Wooden said.
After several months of caution following the Covid-19 outbreak, LPs have broadly resumed normal operations, according to a June investor survey from Campbell Lutyens, a firm that helps credit managers raise money.
Loan Partners IV will operate with fund-level leverage, which would allow Goldman Sachs to borrow money to invest alongside LPs' commitments. 
The two funds will mainly invest in North America-based companies. After paying investors' fees, target returns for Loan Partners IV will be 10% and 12%-14% for WSSS I.

""Credit markets have been volatile during the beginning of 2020, and the coronavirus pandemic has the potential to undermine corporate fundamentals for some time,"" Wade O'Brien, a managing director at investment and advisory firm Cambridge Associates, said in an email. ""Attractive opportunities remain in credit, but investors may need a different playbook than the one developed during the last financial crisis.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - CME Group (O:CME), the world's biggest futures exchange operator, on Wednesday said its quarterly profit fell as steps taken by the U.S. government to ease the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic curbed hedging demand for some of its top products.
The Chicago Board of Trade-owner's net income was $503.3 million, or $1.40 per diluted share, down from $513.8 million, or $1.43 per diluted share, a year earlier.
The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred volatility in equity markets, benefiting some exchange operators, like Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ), which last week reported better-than-expected earnings as stock and options trading volume soared.
But CME's volumes were mostly down, after the U.S. Federal Reserve flooded the markets with liquidity in response to the pandemic and said interest rates would stay near zero for the foreseeable future, reducing the demand for hedging through futures on rates, commodities and currencies.
While interest rates have experienced ""unprecedented low volatility"" across the yield curve in response to the Fed's actions, the longer-term outlook for interest rate futures is positive, said Sean Tully, a senior managing director at CME.
""Once the Federal Reserve reduces its intervention in the market and once the pandemic recedes, the needs for hedging, the needs for our products, are going to be much, much larger, I think, than ever before in history,"" he said on a call with analysts.
Clearing and transaction fees, CME's biggest revenue stream, fell 10.6% to $940.2 million from a year earlier as the company's average daily volume tumbled 15.8% to 17.6 million contracts.
Revenue from CME's market data and information services business rose 5% to $134.7 million.
Total revenue fell 7.1% from a year earlier to $1.18 billion.

Stripping out one-time items like acquisition costs, CME earned $1.63 per share, topping analysts expectations by a penny, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Leading medical glove maker Top Glove Corporation (KL:TPGC) has submitted information to prove it did not use forced labour, a U.S. Customs official said on Wednesday, following an import ban on the company.
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) placed a detention order on imports from two subsidiaries of Top Glove two weeks ago, an action taken on firms suspected of operating with forced labour.
""Top Glove submitted an initial petition to CBP. CBP responded by identifying additional information needs. Dialogue between CBP and Top Glove is ongoing,"" the CBP said in an email to Reuters.
It said it could not specify a timeline for resolving the concerns and will not modify or revoke a ""Withhold Release Order"" until it receives proof that establishes the admissibility of the affected merchandise.
Banned importers have three months to submit proof, including a detailed statement demonstrating that the detained goods were not produced with forced labour, the CBP says.
Top Glove did not respond immediately to a request for comment on the petition.
""Extensive reporting by non-governmental organisations and the media has documented the existence of forced labour in the rubber glove industry in Malaysia,"" CBP said, adding that it continues to receive and investigate allegations of forced labour in industries connected to U.S. supply chains.
The bar on Top Glove's units did not dampen investor appetite in the company, whose share price rose to historical highs in the week after the Customs' detention. Top Glove's shares have climbed 456% this year, driven by demand associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Share prices of other major glove producers, including Hartalega Holdings, Kossan Rubber Industries and Supermax Corporation have soared 267%, 330% and 1,244% respectively year-to-date.

DUBLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - Leasing giant AerCap (N:AER) said on Wednesday it had cancelled 15 orders for the grounded Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX aircraft as it slows the pace of new plane deliveries to weather the coronavirus crisis.
Announcing the cancellations - which leave 80 of the MAX jets still on its order books - the world's largest aircraft owner also called for more production cuts by Boeing and rival Airbus (PA:AIR) to help balance the jet market.
AerCap, which has deferred dozens more MAX deliveries, said it remains uncertain when the five MAX planes already on lease will return to service, as regulators review changes to the jet after two fatal crashes. 
U.S. authorities said last week they expect to give a green light in the ""near future"". As a result, AerCap reached agreement with Boeing this month to restructure its order book, it said on Wednesday. 
AerCap boss Aengus Kelly called for a further aircraft manufacturing slowdown as he reported a drop in second-quarter net income to $246 million from $331 million a year earlier, amid a global travel slump unleashed by the pandemic.
""I think we'll see more production cuts both from Boeing and Airbus, to help us get to that equilibrium,"" he said during an earnings call with analysts.
""I would be hopeful that tomorrow when Airbus release their results we'll see another production cut there,"" the AerCap CEO said. Airbus declined to comment ahead of its own results announcement on Thursday.
Leasing firms are traditionally conservative about production to preserve the value of their fleets, but the call from the world's largest lessor puts pressure on Airbus to defend output levels that some analysts consider too high.
AerCap said it was well placed to weather the coronavirus crisis thanks to its $27 billion in unencumbered assets and record-high liquidity including $3 billion in new funding.
""We have begun leasing airplanes again, but it's almost exclusively focused on the European market,"" Kelly said, adding that earlier signs of a U.S. travel rebound had since ""run out of steam"" amid new virus outbreaks and lockdowns.
Despite European reversals such as renewed British quarantine measures for Spanish arrivals, a recovery is now ""well underway"" in the region, Kelly said.

""No doubt there will be setbacks, but the willingness and the desire of the consumer to travel is very clear.""

Investing.com -  Less skin, more skin-care.
L Brands (NYSE:LB) soared as much as 39% on Wednesday, a day after the Victoria's Secret owner revealed an aggressive cost-cutting plan and said its Bath & Body Works unit actually grew last quarter as customers pampered themselves while stuck at home. 
Shares are trading at about $25.84, having tripled since March.
The company will cut 850 corporate jobs, of 15% of its workforce, which will contribute to an expected $400 million in annualized cost reductions. About 250 Victoria’s Secret stores will close in 2020. 
The company is breaking up the band, with Bath & Body Works become a pure-play public company and the Victoria’s Secret family operating as a standalone group.
L Brands said net sales for the second quarter are expected to be down approximately 20% compared to last year, including an increase of roughly 10% at Bath & Body Works and an approximate 40% decline at Victoria’s Secret.   
Most Bath & Body Works and Victoria’s Secret stores in North America have reopened, and sales at both businesses have been strong and have exceeded the company’s expectations. 
Analysts are celebrating. 
B.Riley FBR analyst Susan Anderson reiterated a buy rating with a price target of $24, Briefing.com said. L Brands has eight buy ratings, five holds and one sell, with an average price target of $18, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.
CNBC reported that JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) upgraded the company saying that the risk/reward was “hard to ignore.”
BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel said L Brands will be much healthier as it becomes leaner, according to CNBC.
“It’s a classic example of a brand that stretched too far in pursuit of growth,” Siegel said. “But its revenues are the confirmation it still has tremendous buy-in from consumers.” 
The company will report its second quarter earnings results on Aug. 19.

LONDON (Reuters) - More public institutions, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds and public pension funds, plan to increase their weighting in government bonds than cut back, as they chart a move to perceived safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.
More than a quarter of the 71 public institutions surveyed said they were looking to raise their allocations to government bonds, compared with 13% who said they intended to decrease investment, according to a survey by Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF).
It was the first time in the annual survey's history that more investors had indicated growing demand for government debt, after several years of shifting investments away from low-yielding bonds.
The survey, conducted between April and June, polled 750 institutions, including 490 public pension funds, 174 central banks and 86 sovereign funds holding around $39.5 trillion in assets.
At the same time, many public investors were also planning to add risk assets such as equities and infrastructure, particularly in developed economies.
And despite worries about pandemic-related price corrections, 30% of institutions said they planned to up their allocation to equities, many of them significantly so, with only 5% aiming to cut back.
Institutions were also looking to real assets over the next 12 to 24 months, with around a third of pension funds and sovereign funds aiming to raise holdings of real estate and nearly two-thirds of sovereign funds seeking more infrastructure investment.
The popularity of alternative assets reflected concern about returns for investors in other parts of their portfolio, OMFIF said, based on the survey results.
Since the start of 2020, many institutions have begun drawing down reserves to support their economies during the COVID crisis, OMFIF said, adding some sovereign funds have acted as rainy day funds in using reserves to aid stimulus programmes or take over distressed companies, such as airlines.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened smartly higher on Wednesday as a torrent of largely reassuring earnings persuaded some investors that the worst of the pandemic is over.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 24 points, or 0.1% at 26,403 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was outperforming again, with a gain of 0.7%, helped by strong quarterly reports from the likes of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and fast-growing online marketplace Shopify (NYSE:SHOP). FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) stock also gained 15% after its quarterly report underlined how cybersecurity has gained in importance to companies against the backdrop of increased remote working and online shopping.
Sentiment was further helped by another strong reading from the housing market, a part of the economy that has thrived in recent months against a backdrop of lower refinancing rates and the increased attractiveness of real estate as an investment against a backdrop of high volatility in securities markets. Pending home sales rose 16.6% on the month in June, down from a 44% gain in May but above expectations for a 15% rise.
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) stock and General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock both fell slightly, despite posting slightly less-dismal-than-expected results for the quarter, while Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock fell 0.5% after the aerospace giant missed expectations and announced another cut to production runs.
The moves are nonetheless hostage to macro developments in the course of the day. The Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Markets Committee meeting and Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference at 2:30 PM are likely to stay the main focus of the day.
Comments from senior Fed officials before the regular 'blackout' period before the FOMC tended to the gloomy side, with more than one expressing the fear that the economy was stalling and may need more ""accommodative"" policy in future. No change in policy is expected in today's statement.
The standout individual performer, for the second day running, was Eastman Kodak Co (NYSE:KODK). The once-dominant maker of photographic film, whose business model was wrecked by the advent of digital technology, had life breathed into it by a $765 million government loan to help it ramp up production of ingredients for generic medicines. The move, under the aegis of the Defense Production Act, is aimed at reshoring production of important medicines back from China. Trading in Eastman Kodak stock was repeatedly halted, limit up, in the first hour of the session.
In other markets,Crude Oil Futures rebounded after the American Petroleum Institute reported a surprisingly large drop in crude inventories last week (mitigated by inventory builds in gasoline and distillates).

NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Some investors of TikTok's parent company ByteDance seeking to take over the popular social media app are valuing it at about $50 billion, significantly more than peers such as  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP), according to people familiar with the matter.
Beijing-based ByteDance is considering a range of options for TikTok amid pressure from the United States to relinquish control of the app, which allows users to create short videos with special effects and has become wildly popular with U.S. teenagers. The app's success has helped turn ByteDance into one of only a handful of truly global Chinese conglomerates.
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a U.S. government panel which reviews deals by foreign acquirers for potential national security risks, has raised concerns about the safety of the personal data that TikTok handles under its Chinese owner, Reuters has previously reported.
Privately held ByteDance has received a proposal from some of its investors, including Sequoia and General Atlantic, to transfer majority ownership of TikTok to them, the sources said. It has also fielded acquisition interest in TikTok from other companies and investment firms, the sources said.
The investors' bid values TikTok at 50 times its projected 2020 revenue of about $1 billion, according to the sources. By comparison, Snap is valued at 15 times its projected 2020 revenue, at about $33 billion, according to data provider Refinitiv. 
It is unclear whether ByteDance's founder and CEO, Yiming Zhang, will be satisfied with the offer. ByteDance executives recently discussed valuation projections for TikTok that exceed $50 billion, one of the sources said.
TikTok is growing rapidly as it rakes in more cash from advertising, and its management team expects to achieve $6 billion in revenue in 2021, one of the sources said. ByteDance, which owns other apps including TikTok's Chinese counterpart, Douyin‎, has set itself a revenue target for 2020 of about 200 billion yuan ($28 billion), Reuters has previously reported.
ByteDance was valued at as much as $140 billion earlier this year when one of its shareholders, Cheetah Mobile Inc (N:CMCM), sold a small stake in a private deal, one of the sources said.
If a deal for the whole of TikTok cannot be reached, ByteDance is exploring divesting only TikTok's U.S. operations, one of the sources said. It is not clear what such a deal would be worth and what ties TikTok in the United States would maintain with its global operations. 
There is no certainty that ByteDance will agree to any deal, the sources said. It is pushing ahead with structural changes that will further ringfence the U.S. business of TikTok from its global empire, the sources added. These changes could include a new holding company for TikTok and an independent board, one of the sources said, cautioning that no decision has been made. The company has already separated TikTok operationally from its other apps through dedicated teams.
The sources requested anonymity because the deliberations are confidential.
ByteDance, General Atlantic and Sequoia declined to comment, while Cheetah Mobile and a CFIUS spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment.
TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer said in a blog post on Wednesday that the company was committed to following U.S. laws, and was allowing experts to observe its moderation policies and examine the code that drives its algorithms.
TARGET OF U.S. LAWMAKERS
As relations between the United States and China deteriorate over trade, Hong Kong's autonomy, cyber security and the spread of the novel coronavirus, TikTok has emerged as a flashpoint in the dispute between the world's two largest economies.
Last week, the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs unanimously passed a bill that would bar U.S. federal employees from using TikTok on government-issued devices. It will be taken up by the full Senate for a vote. The House of Representatives has already voted for a similar measure.
President Donald Trump and top administrations officials have said they are considering a broader ban on TikTok and other Chinese-linked apps.

ByteDance acquired Shanghai-based video app Musical.ly app in a $1 billion deal in 2017 and relaunched it as TikTok the following year. About 70% of the equity capital ByteDance has raised from outside investors has come from the United States, according to one of the sources.

Higher prices for its cash-cow pickup trucks in the U.S. helped offset a loss of production and sales from the shutdown of its factories and showrooms early in the second quarter to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Sales in May and June improved over April, putting the automaker on a path to remain in the black for the full year.
The automaker said Wednesday it lost 50 cents a share in the latest three-month period, compared with a consensus forecast for a loss of $1.66 per share. That performance underscores the company’s financial resilience in the face of the pandemic in the U.S. and China -- its two biggest markets.

685,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 07:41AM ET</span>",Stalled cruise industry targets repeat guests with Cha Cha lessons and Chopin,"By Helen Coster
(Reuters) - Retired New Yorkers Mahlon and Kim Russell have taken 15 cruises over the past 15 years, visiting destinations from Tahiti to St. Petersburg, primarily with Norwegian Cruise Line.
After canceling a fall trip to Europe, in July the Russells booked a 10-day cruise around Australia and New Zealand - for January 2022.
""We love cruising,"" said Mahlon Russell. ""But we don't love it enough to be the first ones out of the gate.""
The cruise industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, with shares of the three major global operators down an average of 51% since the start of March, as their revenue stream has dried up.
But the three - Carnival Corp (N:CCL), Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (N:NCLH), and  Royal Caribbean  Cruises (N:RCL) - are expecting solid 2021 bookings, leaning heavily on repeat cruisers like the Russells. 
Operators are reporting a mix of new cash bookings and people redeeming credits they received for canceled cruises this year. In 2019, over 80% of people who went on cruises said that they would book another cruise as their next vacation, industry trade group Cruise Lines International Association found in a survey. 
""We absolutely believe when we come out of this we will lean into our repeat cruisers,"" said Carnival Cruise Line president Christine Duffy in an interview. ""They really are the ambassadors for the cruise industry.""
Regular cruisers are less likely to be scared off because the vacation concept is familiar and they have seen other blows to the industry - like the 2003 SARS outbreak or 2012 Costa Concordia disaster - as isolated events, said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Benjamin Chaiken.
Keeping those regulars engaged has been a part of the industry's comeback strategy. During the pause in operations - which will continue through at least the end September for ocean-going ships departing the United States - cruise operators are using low-cost digital marketing to remind repeat guests what they are missing.
In one video posted on social media and emailed to past customers, Regent Seven Seas Cruise Director David Nevin hosts a virtual 'tea time' and sings ""Hallelujah"" in the ship's vacant Constellation Theater. Small luxury cruise provider Seabourn has hosted at-home Cha Cha dance lessons from a ship choreographer named Pasha, and a concert performed by pianist Panos Karan, decked out in a tuxedo.
There are no signs of buffets, spa treatments or other pandemic turn-offs. Instead, Carnival-owned Holland America Line features a performance from cruise musician Mohamed Shams, who plays Schubert's ""Impromptu in G flat minor"" from his grandmother's house in Queens, New York - her teddy bear collection perched atop the piano.
Executives hope their marketing efforts will stoke demand for a restart that initially will involve limited capacity and fewer trips. 
""Very loyal cruisers know exactly what suite they wish to have. What deck they wish to be on,"" said Chris Austin, Seabourn's Senior Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing. ""Loyal cruisers definitely say 'Yes, I want to be in the Mediterranean for 14 days sailing around the Greek Isles in 2021' and they know that they want the Wintergarden Suite.""
STAYING AFLOAT
To resume cruising from the United States, operators must submit for approval their health and safety plans to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which issued and then extended the 'No Sail Order' that grounded ships. The operators must also comply with rules governments around the world set to obtain access to ports.
Most companies have yet to announce details for the health and safety protocols they expect to come with a restart, but there is pressure to get it right. Some of the earliest COVID-19 outbreaks occurred aboard Carnival-owned cruise ships; all three operators have been the target of class action lawsuits related to the pandemic.
Cruising operators are currently burning up to $650 million per month to cover their costs while they wait, as they service idled ships. Some have increased their cash flow through a combination of debt and equity offerings, allowing for longer runways with no revenue.
Carnival CEO Arnold Donald said on the company's July 10 earnings call that it has enough liquidity to withstand another full year without revenue. Norwegian CEO Frank Del Rio said in an earnings statement in May that the firm could weather over 18 months of suspended voyages. 
Royal Caribbean has enough liquidity to last until mid-2021 with no operations, according to a June 4 report from Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investor Service. Royal Caribbean declined to comment.
To entice customers wary of the fast-moving rule changes that have come with the pandemic, many cruise lines are offering more flexible policies, such as the ability to cancel within 48 hours of departure and receive credit for a future cruise.
But for even the most hardcore cruisers who are considering booking trips, sanitization is likely to matter more than Schubert. 

""I don't know how they will handle the massive changes they need to make the experience safe,"" said Mahlon Russell, the frequent cruiser. ""But I'm not going on a cruise ship until I know that it works.""

686,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 07:40AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Rolls-Royce plans $1.9 billion share issue to bolster finances, sources say","By Abhinav Ramnarayan, Arno Schuetze and Clara Denina 
LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce (L:RR) is planning a share issue to raise up to 1.5 billion pounds ($1.9 billion) to plug a capital shortfall as a slow recovery in demand for air travel threatens the aviation industry, four sources told Reuters.
The British aerospace engineer is expected to pursue a rights issue with new shares offered to existing investors at a discount to the market price, they said.
The Derby-based business, whose shares have tanked nearly 60% since early March, is in talks with BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) about the share sale, which could take place in September, two of the sources said. 
Rolls-Royce told Reuters it was still reviewing options to strengthen its balance sheet but no decisions had been taken. ""Our current financial position and liquidity remain strong,"" a spokesman said.
Jefferies, BNP Paribas and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.
Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 and Airbus 350, said it would burn through 3 billion pounds in the first half of the year as hours flown by its engines halved due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The company, most of whose revenues come from airlines paying it for engine flying hours, expects a further 1 billion pound outflow in the second half of 2020.
Rolls-Royce, with a market value of 5 billion pounds, could raise up to 1.5 billion pounds in the share sale, the sources said, although one source said the deal size would largely depend on how much the firm raised from selling assets.
Rolls-Royce's Spanish unit ITP Aero is among assets earmarked for sale to raise funds, the sources said.
Several aviation and travel companies are expected to tap equity capital markets to shore up their balance sheets in coming months. Rising borrowing costs mean many deals are likely to involve some form of share issue.

British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) said last week it was considering a 2.75 billion euro rights issue, announcing its plans after Reuters reported a share sale was in the works.

687,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 07:34AM ET</span>","General Motors Swung to Loss, Burning $8 Billion During Q2 Lockdown","Investing.com - General Motors (NYSE:GM) burned through $8 billion in cash in the second quarter as Covid-19-driven lockdowns shuttered its factories and crushed its sales. 
However, the company's net loss of 50c a share was less than a third of what analysts had feared ahead of time, and even the 53% drop in revenue to $16.80 billion was slightly better than forecast. 
The cash burn, which compared to operating cash flow of $11.9 billion a year earlier, had been the number most eagerly awaited by analysts, and was bang in the middle of the $7 billion to $9 billion range that chief executive Mary Barra had forecast. The company ended the quarter with over $30.6 billion in liquidity at its automaking operations.
That ought to reassure the company's investors, who - according to Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar - are focused on one thing only at present: survival.
""At this point, all investors want to know whether there is light at the end of the tunnel and whether car producers have enough cash to survive as they manage through the crisis and try to generate sales,"" Anwar said. 
Anwar added that the company's return from lockdown has been anything but easy, punctuated by ""supply-chain disruptions, temporary shutdowns caused by new positive cases and worker absences.""
Sales recovered from a low point of -34% on the year in April to being down only 20% on the year in June, with the Buick Encore and Chevrolet Trailblazer notably picking up market share in the small SUV segment.
GM stock rose 3.9% in premarket trading, although it's still down by more than 25% from its February high.
General Motors's report follows an earnings beat by Tesla on July 22, who reported EPS of $2.18 on revenue of $6.04B, compared to forecasts EPS of $0 on revenue of $5.15B.

688,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 07:32AM ET</span>",Boeing Posts Q2 Net Loss of $2.4 Billion; Hit by Covid and 737 Grounding,"Investing.com - Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported disappointing second quarter earnings  Wednesday, registering a larger than expected $2.4 billion loss with the coronavirus pandemic hitting the airline which was already beset with problems of its own making.
Boeing announced a loss per share of $4.79 on revenue of $11.81 billion, resulting in a net loss of $2.4 billion. Its operating cash burn was $5.3 billion in the quarter, primarily reflecting lower commercial deliveries and services volume due to Covid-19 and the grounding of its best-selling plane, the 737 Max, since March 2019 following two fatal crashes.
“The diversity of our balanced portfolio and our government services, defense and space programs provide some critical stability for us in the near-term as we take tough but necessary steps to adapt for new market realities,” said Boeing President and Chief Executive Officer Dave Calhoun. “We are taking the right action to ensure we're well positioned for the future by strengthening our culture, improving transparency, rebuilding trust and transforming our business to become a better, more sustainable Boeing. Air travel has always proven to be resilient - and so has Boeing.”
The company said its 737 program resumed early stages of production in May and it expects to gradually increase the production rate to 31 per month by the beginning of 2022, with further gradual increases to correspond with market demand. The company took a 737 MAX customer consideration charge of $551 million in the quarter, compared with a $5.6 billion charge in the same period last year.
It added that the production rate for its 787 model will be reduced to six per month in 2021, while the 777/777X combined production rate will be gradually reduced to 2 per month in 2021, with 777X first delivery targeted for 2022. 
At 07:45 AM ET (1145 GMT), Boeing stock traded 1.8% higher premarket. Boeing shares are down 47% from the beginning of the year.

691,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 07:18AM ET</span>",European Analysts Face Earnings ‘Tsunami’ in Work-from-Home Era,"(Bloomberg) --
Investors and analysts are preparing for the busiest day so far this year for European corporate results when firms worth more than $2 trillion report their latest figures on Thursday. This time, many will still be working from kitchen tables, living-room desks and home offices.
Not only are the firms numerous, with more than 60 companies in the Stoxx 600 Index set to report, they are also large: their combined market value amounts to nearly a quarter of the benchmark. That’s more than three times the market value of April 30, the busiest earnings day of the previous reporting period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nestle SA (SIX:NESN), AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) Plc and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc are the headliners.
“It’s like a tsunami,” Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK Plc, said by phone. “It’s an easy way for companies to bury news and I’ve only got one set of eyes, especially when there’s also macroeconomic data to look at.”
While the last Thursday in July is traditionally a hectic day for corporate earnings, analyzing the numbers is complicated by the coronavirus pandemic and associated lockdown measures that have roiled businesses and supply chains globally. German gross domestic product and Spanish inflation are further data points that market watchers need to keep eye on that morning. Second-quarter results have so far been broadly positive compared to analysts’ low expectations, particularly after the first quarter was marked by several firms pulling forecasts and suspending dividend payments.
Equity analysts at money manager J. Stern & Co. in London have held more than a hundred virtual meetings with companies and industry experts in the last few months to gauge the impact of the pandemic, according to Katerina Kosmopoulou, a London-based partner who’s currently working remotely from Innsbruck, Austria.
Office Pajamas
The hour gained by not having to commute is an extra hour spent working, Kosmopoulou said, given the massive amount of information to plow through. Communication has also been adapted to the remote environment. Rather than the ad hoc face-to-face chats that used to occur at someone’s desk, J. Stern’s investment team now get on a daily call to share information.
“If everyone is in an office, people get distracted by all sorts of meetings that are in the calendar,” Kosmopoulou said. “Whereas if everyone is working remotely, everyone’s committed to that daily call.”
For some, remote communication cannot replace face-to-face. Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Richard Clarke misses talking to his team in person, as well as being able to physically look at the company’s management in the eye. “It’s easier for them to not answer the question when you’re over the phone rather than in person,” he said.
Still, there are some advantages to working from home during earnings season, according to Clarke, who covers hotels, leisure and catering companies based in Europe and the U.S.
“Given the huge spread of times over which earnings are released, working from home makes it a little easier to deal with,” Clarke said by phone. “When some of our companies report at 6 a.m., it’s more pleasant being able to do it in your pajamas having gotten up 10 minutes earlier rather than braving the commute or being flown to Paris for a company meeting.”

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to edge higher at the open Wednesday, with investors showing caution ahead of the latest Federal Reserve meeting and with earnings season in full swing.
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), US 500 Futures traded 5 points, or 0.2%, higher, US Tech Futures up 50 points, or 0.5%. The Dow Futures contract rose 14 points, or 0.1%. 
The Federal Reserve concludes its two-day meeting later Wednesday, with investors looking for guidance on the U.S. economy’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.
The risks to the recovery since the central bank’s last meeting appear to have grown substantially, given the spike in infections and the associated slowdown in economic activity in three of the country's four most populous states — California, Florida and Texas — this month. 
The new Fed policy statement, to be released at 2 PM ET (1800 GMT), will show just how seriously U.S. central bankers assess them. The central bank has already indicated its concern, on Tuesday extending from Sept. 30 to Dec. 31 the availability of the emergency credit programs it set up early in the pandemic.
“The focus of monetary policy will now shift from stabilization to accommodation,” said analyst Morten Lund, at Nordea. “The accommodation tools currently being discussed are centered around forward guidance. Thus, a key lesson from the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis was that monetary policy was tightened too early by not giving strong enough forward guidance, which eventually slowed the recovery.”
Also in the spotlight will be the heads of the Silicon Valley tech giants, with the CEOs of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) set to testify at a hearing of the House antitrust subcommittee in Washington.
Meanwhile, the earnings season continues apace, with numbers expected Wednesday from the likes of Boeing (NYSE:BA), General Motors (NYSE:GM),  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX).
On Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats are scrambling to pass the latest stimulus measures before Friday, when some earlier measures are due to expire. 
Economic data centers around June pending home sales, at 10 AM ET, which are expected to rise 15% from the previous month, which itself showed a record jump of 44%.
Oil prices pushed higher Wednesday, helped by a surprise drop in U.S. inventories. U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% higher at $41.48 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent rose 1.3% to $44.13.
Government crude oil stocks data are due at 10:30 AM ET, with analysts expecting an addition of 357,000 barrels for the week ending July 24, although the surprise drop in inventories recorded by American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday puts a big question mark next to that expectation.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,952.20/oz, still at highly elevated levels, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1732, up 0.2%.

Federal prosecutors are also seeking three years of supervised release and an agreed-upon restitution payment of nearly $756,500 to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's self-driving car company Waymo, according to the court papers filed in the U.S. District Court for Northern District of California.
Levandowski's attorneys have asked for 12 months of home confinement for him, with an obligation to perform community service, and a $95,000 fine, the court papers added.
""It is, unfortunately, no exaggeration to say that a prison sentence today can amount to the imposition of a serious health crisis, even a death sentence, given the BOP's (Federal Bureau of Prisons) current inability to control the spread of the coronavirus,"" Levandowski's attorneys wrote.
The case stemmed from accusations by Google and its sister company Waymo in 2017 that Uber jump-started its own self-driving car development with trade secrets and staff that Levandowski unlawfully took from Google.
Uber issued company stock to Alphabet and revised its software to settle the case, and the Department of Justice later announced a 33-count criminal indictment against Levandowski.

Levandowski filed for bankruptcy protection in March, shortly after a court confirmed that he must pay $179 million to Google to end a legal battle over his split from the Alphabet Inc unit.

700,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>",Will investors look past Amazon's COVID-19 e-commerce costs?,"By Lisa Baertlein and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - Investors' penchant for prioritizing growth over profit at Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) will be put to the test on Thursday, when investors absorb the impact of second-quarter pandemic-related costs that could top $4 billion.
The world's biggest e-retailer - a relatively rare high-growth investment thanks to its lucrative cloud computing business - is in a position to gobble up market share as virus-weary shoppers shift purchasing online and business shutdowns hammer store-based retailers.
Still, some analysts question whether Amazon's stock can keep climbing from its current $3,000 level.
Shares are up 25% since April 30, when Amazon warned that expenses for COVID-19 testing and other safety and staffing measures could outpace surging revenue in the second quarter. At that time, the company forecast quarterly operating income of minus $1.5 billion to plus $1.5 billion. Amazon reported operating income of $3.1 billion in the year-earlier quarter.
""We recognize there is a high level of uncertainty on costs due to the pandemic, and therefore a higher risk of (Amazon) falling short"" on operating income results, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts said in a note. Amazon has regularly beaten Wall Street's quarterly operating income estimates by around 50%, the analysts said.
Amazon remains the go-to site for online shoppers, but challenges are mounting. Novel coronavirus infections are raging in the United States, a market that accounts for about 70% of its retail business, and a $600 weekly pandemic unemployment payment could expire and crimp consumer's spending.
Amazon increased investment after the pandemic-fueled spike in online shopping caused disruptions ranging from unavailable merchandise to long wait times - sending shoppers into the arms of rivals Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT)
When Jefferies surveyed more than 500 consumers in late April, 69% of respondents said they were experiencing delays or out of stock issues on Amazon. Among them, 62% said they were buying more from other online sellers - primarily Walmart and Target. And, 28% of the shoppers who increased purchases from other sites said they planned to continue doing so after the health crisis ends.
Betting against Amazon has been risky in the past, said Morningstar consumer analyst RJ Hottovy. ""We believe the market has moved back to a 'growth-over-profitability' mindset,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Walmart is launching a rival to Amazon's $119 a year Prime subscription that includes perks like free shipping.

701,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 06:05AM ET</span>","All eyes on pandemic, economy as Detroit automakers post results","By Nick Carey
(Reuters) - Detroit's automakers will report results this week, highlighting the damage the coronavirus pandemic wrought on the second quarter, but investors will be focused on what they say about current demand as infection rates spike in key truck markets like Texas and COVID-19's ongoing impact on the U.S. economy.
To slow the outbreak's spread, North American production was shut down for much of the second quarter at General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU). It only restarted in mid-May. 
Although sales fell 34% at GM, which reports earnings on Wednesday, 33% at Ford and 39% at FCA, the automakers said demand was improving toward the end of the second quarter and touted the resilience of the U.S. consumer.
High-margin pickup trucks remained a bright spot for Detroit's automakers during the quarter, putting pressure on them to replenish supplies fast.
While investors want to know how much cash Detroit's automakers burned through during the second-quarter shutdown, all eyes will be on what comes next - as the coronavirus pandemic rages through states that provided a hefty chunk of their sales throughout the outbreak's early stages.
""U.S. retail automotive sales have recovered sharply close to pre-COVID levels,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts wrote in a research note this week, ""but the resurgence of COVID across the South and Southwestern parts of the country creates outlook uncertainty.""
The pandemic is also not just a health crisis, but an economic one that could continue to drag down sales.
Weekly jobless claims numbers from the Labor Department released last week showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose for the first time in nearly four months, suggesting the labor market was stalling amid a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases and depressed demand.
""Unemployment is a huge factor for buying a car, as is consumer confidence,"" Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs said. ""We think there's a lot of risk on the horizon for the automakers and unemployment is the big concern.""
Automakers also face increased competition from used vehicles.
Americans typically become more frugal and favor used cars in uncertain times. Cars remain a vital commodity in a country where getting to work without a vehicle is impossible in all but a few large cities.
Meanwhile, sales to rental car companies, corporations and government agencies have collapsed and recovery will be slow.

Concerns also remain over the ability of Detroit's automakers to keep plants open as the pandemic spreads.

703,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>",Heathrow tells UK: do passenger testing or lose 'quarantine roulette',"By Sarah Young
LONDON (Reuters) - Heathrow Airport, once Europe's busiest airport, called on Britain to urgently back a passenger testing regime, warning that without one, the country's strict quarantine rules will stop travel, stall the economy and lead to more job losses. 
Heathrow said that to avoid losing a game of global ""quarantine roulette"", the government should change its rules to cut quarantine from 14 days to around eight days for passengers who take two tests over the course of a week. 
The worst public health crisis since the 1918 influenza outbreak has wrought economic turmoil across the world and just as the travel industry restarted there are now fears of a second wave of shutdowns after Britain hastily imposed a quarantine on travellers from Spain.
""The UK needs a passenger testing regime and fast,"" Heathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye said. ""Without it, Britain is just playing a game of quarantine roulette.""
The cost of having a coronavirus test at the airport would be about 150 pounds ($195) per person and the passenger would be expected to pay, Holland-Kaye told Reuters on Wednesday.
While he conceded that it was not cheap, he said consumers and business travellers would be prepared to pay, and it would help Britain protect its aviation industry, which has already announced over 20,000 job cuts, and facilitate trade. 
""We are an island nation - we cannot cut ourselves off from the world for the foreseeable future,"" Holland-Kaye told the BBC. ""We've got to find a way of keeping people safe from a second wave but also getting the economy going again.""
Quarantine rules are in place for arrivals to Britain from the United States, a lucrative market for Heathrow accounting for 20% of its traffic, as well as other countries such as India and Spain. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE 
Responding to Heathrow's criticism, a minister said there was no easy solution to allow quarantine-free travel from countries with higher infection rates. 
""It can incubate over a period of time so there's not a silver bullet of just testing immediately at the border,"" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told the BBC. 
But Holland-Kaye said the government was receptive to Heathrow's double testing plan, which needs agreement that two tests, one on arrival and one either five or eight days later, can reduce the number of days a person spends quarantining.
""They've certainly come alive to that in the last few days following the Spain experience with the realisation that there needs to be an alternative,"" he said. 
Heathrow said it was trialling testing with companies Swissport and Collinson Group and the system could be up and running within two weeks. 
The test would add a significant cost to the cost of travel, with Heathrow's biggest operator British Airways selling European tickets from about 50 pounds and tickets to the United States from about 400 pounds.
The potential extra cost illustrates the challenge to airlines desperate to fill planes and start generating profits again after the pandemic wiped out air travel for months.
Airports are also suffering. Heathrow passenger numbers fell 96% in the second quarter on revenue which was down 85% pushing the airport to a 1.1 billion pound loss for the first six months of the year. Despite the loss, the airport said its finances remained robust.

704,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 05:43AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Signs of Life in Mining, Fashion, Offset Grim Bank Results","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Is that a light at the end of the tunnel? For some, it’s still too early to say, but Wednesday’s slew of European earnings suggests that others are confidently looking forward to better times.
The STOXX 600 was up a mere 0.1% by mid-morning in Europe, but that covered a wide spectrum of reactions to reports that served up a decent mix of good and bad. 
Santander (MC:SAN)'s massive writedowns and loss grabbed the morning headlines, while  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) were both able to cushion the blow of souring loans with windfall returns from trading, just as their brethren on Wall Street had done.
Elsewhere, there were signs of life too obvious to ignore in the mining sector, which is enjoying a healthy rebound in demand out of China for base metals after a pandemic-driven collapse in the first quarter. Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO)  may have reported a 28% drop in free cash flow for the first half, but was relaxed enough about the outlook to raise its interim dividend by 3%.
 Rio Tinto  (NYSE:RIO) stock is now some 14% above its pre-pandemic levels, despite an embarrassing and costly episode in which it blew up some sites sacred to Australia’s aboriginal population while developing a new mine. It also had the good luck to discover a gold-bearing ore formation at one of its newer copper mines in Australia this month.
There was also evidence that companies are getting to grips with the ongoing uncertainties of working in the post-Covid world. U.K. fashion retailer Next  (LON:NXT), one of many to suspend guidance after the first quarter, reinstated it with a pleasingly high full-year target of 195 million pounds in pretax profit.  It also said the second quarter hadn’t been as bad as first seemed likely: full-price sales fell 28%, less than the company’s most optimistic hopes.
“There is still much that remains uncertain and our central scenario cannot be accorded the same degree of confidence that our guidance would normally receive at this time of year,” the company said. “The duration of social distancing rules, post-lockdown consumer behaviour, earnings, unemployment, and, most importantly, whether there will be a second wave lockdown, all remain unknowable.”
“Nonetheless, our experience over the last 13 weeks has given us much greater clarity on our Online capabilities during lockdown and the state of consumer demand, and we are now more optimistic about the outlook for the full year than we were at the height of the pandemic.”
 Next  stock hit a new post-pandemic high before retracing to be up 5.8% by mid-morning.
On the continent, too, sports gear maker Puma  (DE:PUMG) struck a similar note, saying that the second quarter hadn’t been as bad as feared, and saying it expected a return to growth next year even though the outlook for the rest of 2020 was still highly uncertain.
And there was further proof of the ability of businesses to adapt as Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) recorded a sharp rise in online sales, something that LVMH’s earnings earlier this week had suggested was too much to expect from a boutique-based business. Kering shares rose 4.4%."

The UK guidance, issued on Monday, brought advice in line with travel advice to mainland Spain. On Saturday Britain said all travellers from Spain would be subject to a 14-day quarantine due to a spike in new coronavirus cases there.
TUI UK has cancelled all holidays to mainland Spain until August 10, but criticised the blanket British policy for the whole of Spain when the outbreaks have been focussed regionally.
""We... call upon the UK Government to work closely with the travel industry and remove the ‘blunt tool’ approach to quarantine and consider the rapid introduction of regional Travel Corridors,"" said Andrew Flintham, Managing Director of TUI UK and Ireland. 
""The level of uncertainty and confusion created this week is damaging for business and customer confidence in travel."" 

He added that customer feedback suggested people still wanted to travel on summer holidays, and the company had added seven new flights to destinations in Greece and Turkey to meet demand from those whose holidays had been cancelled.

The scramble to limit risks comes as gold prices hit record highs this week, spurred by investors hunting for safe haven assets in markets rattled by worries of rising coronavirus cases, lofty equity valuations and a falling U.S. dollar.
A deepening rift between the United States and China has also become a factor drawing mainland investors to gold.
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the country's biggest lender, said on Wednesday it would bar its clients from opening new trading positions for platinum, palladium and index products linked to precious metal from Friday. That directive, according to the lender's customer service department, was in response to ""violent price volatility"" and ""the need to control risks.""
Agricultural Bank of China (OTC:ACGBF) said it had recently suspended new businesses related to gold, while Bank of China said it halted new account openings for platinum and palladium trading.
The Shanghai Gold Exchange said on Tuesday gold and silver holdings were high, and it would take risk-control measures if warranted to protect investors.
The Shanghai Futures Exchange, where gold and silver futures contracts are traded, also urged its members to strengthen risk-management efforts and invest rationally.
""Gold remains a niche investment in China due to limited investment channels,"" said Frank Hao, an analyst at Hywin Wealth Management in Shanghai. ""Investors mainly rely on purchasing paper gold products at commercial banks as a way to counteract risks.""
Chinese investors are also actively trading gold ETFs, whose turnover has jumped in recent weeks.
Huaan Gold ETF (NYSE:GLD), Asia's biggest gold exchange-traded fund, has seen its assets under management soar more than 68% to over 11.8 billion yuan ($1.69 billion) since end-2019.
Regulators are mindful of risks after investors were caught off-guard in late April when Bank of China settled a crude oil futures trading product known as Yuan You Bao at minus $37.63 per barrel, following a historic slide in oil prices into negative territory. 
The bank subsequently agreed to settle with more than half its customers facing losses, potentially taking a 6 billion to 7 billion yuan hit.
Hao said any further gains in gold may spur more speculation, despite regulatory attempts to tamp it down.
""If the gold price rises past $2,000, some more hot money will certainly flow into the market, and some investors will divert their stock investments to gold,"" he said.

Half the funds will be used for refinancing, primarily for Axiata's subsidiaries, group deputy chief executive Izzaddin Idris told reporters.
""There's always that idea that if our subsidiary companies are going to raise their own funds in U.S. dollars, it will cost them much more. So if Axiata is able to borrow at much cheaper cost, then it makes sense for us to raise the funds and on-lend to the operating companies,"" he said.
Axiata has appointed CIMB, Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), UBS and Citi as joint lead arrangers for the bond, and hoped to complete the issuance next month.
In May the group secured $800 million in syndicated multi-currency Islamic financing facilities for its sustainability-linked initiatives.
Separately, Axiata said while there remains no rush to bring its telecoms towers unit Edotco Group to market given room in its balance sheet to borrow more funds, the valuation for the business has risen.
Izzadin said based on an investor's interest last year to acquire a stake in Edotco, the business was valued at around 8-9 billion ringgit.
""In recent months, in recent weeks, we have parties indicating the valuation of much higher than that, easily 12 billion ringgit,"" he said.
Axiata has put plans to list Edotco on the back burner since 2018, citing no immediate need for fundraising.
Last year, however, it said that plans to generate more profit and cash for the group would entail monetising Edotco.

Wall Street closed lower on Tuesday and the negative sentiment continued through the Asian session, with Japan’s Nikkei falling on a rising yen and weak start to the earnings season. 
But the MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 49 countries, was up around 0.1% and mixed corporate earnings saw MSCI's main European Index rise around 0.3% at 0757 GMT <.MSER>.
""Global stock markets appear to be starting to get a little wobbly as the latest earnings numbers start to paint a picture of a global economy that could start to face a challenging time in the weeks and months ahead,"" wrote Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.
""The resurgence of coronavirus cases that are starting to get reported across the world is prompting the realisation that hopes of a V-shaped recovery are starting to look like pie in the sky,"" he added.
Deaths from coronavirus in the United States had their biggest one-day increase since May on Tuesday, with this month's spike in infections having forced some states to make a U-turn on reopening their economies.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam warned that the city was on the brink of a large-scale outbreak and tightened lockdown measures.
Japan expects the economy to contract this year, with a return to growth next year, four government sources told Reuters.
Global airlines cut their coronavirus recovery forecasts on Tuesday, saying it would take until 2024 - a year longer than previously expected - for passenger traffic to return to pre-crisis levels.
London's Heathrow called on the government to urgently introduce a passenger testing regime, warning that the country risked losing a game of global ""quarantine roulette"".
The dollar index, which steadied overnight, continued falling in early London trading, hitting fresh two-year lows (=USD).
As sentiment soured, high-grade euro zone bond yields dropped to their lowest in more than two months, with the German 10-year yield at -0.511% (DE10YT=RR).
The euro, which rallied last week when European Union leaders agreed on a massive EU-wide recovery fund, climbed 0.4% to $1.1762 (EUR=EBS).
Gold, which rallied to an all-time high of $1,980.57 on Tuesday, slipped to $1956.3200 .
Oil prices climbed after a surprise drop in U.S. crude inventories was enough to offset concerns about U.S. fuel demand amid record increases in COVID-19 infections in some states.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were up 29 cents, or 0.7%, at $43.51 a barrel by 0756 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CLc1) gained 24 cents, or 0.6%, to $41.28 a barrel.
Investors are focused on the U.S. Federal Reserve, as it begins its two-day meeting.
The Fed is expected to sound reassuringly accommodative at its policy review later in the day and perhaps open the door to a higher tolerance for inflation - something dollar bears think could squash real yields and sink the currency even further.

Sentiment is also dampened by the U.S. Congress and White House struggling to agree on a new deal to replace enhanced coronavirus unemployment benefits, which are due to expire on Friday.

At 4:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France up 0.8% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 0.2%. 
Deutsche Bank posted a second-quarter loss despite a strong performance at its investment bank, as it put aside 761 million euros ($891.5 million) to cover credit losses. Its stock climbed 0.4%.
Santander stock dropped 3.6% after reporting a 12.6 billion-euro impairment, resulting in an unexpected heavy loss, while Barclays, down 3.3%, set aside 1.6 billion pounds.
Elsewhere,  Tullow Oil  (LON:TLW) said it expects to report lower revenue and forecast pretax impairments of between $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion in its first-half results. Its stock dropped 4.7%. 
In the retail sector,  Next  (LON:NXT) jumped 7.3% to a four-month high after it reinstated full-year guidance in the wake of a second quarter that turned out far better than it expected.  Kering  (PA:PRTP) rose 4.8% after reporting a smaller-than-expected decline in quarterly sales thanks to strong online business that contrasted with its rival LVMH.  Puma (DE:PUMG) stock also rose 4.1% on the back of a loss that was narrower-than-expected.
Elsewhere, Sanofi (PA:SASY), up 0.8%, and GlaxoSmithKline (LON:GSK), up 0.9%, signed a deal to supply Britain with up to 60 million doses of a possible Covid-19 vaccine the pair are developing.
Mining giant  Rio Tinto  PLC (LON:RIO) rose 0.8% after announcing a dividend increase and a strong outlook for the rest of the year.
However, the day will be dominated by the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy decisions and press conference at 2 PM ET (1800 GMT). The Fed isn't expected to change its interest rates or bond-buying policy, but on Tuesday extended most of its emergency lending facilities for another three months. Some have speculated that Chairman Jerome Powell may indicate a future further loosening of policy at his press conference.
Oil prices edged higher, helped by a surprise drop in U.S. inventories although gains are minor given concerns about the potential hit to fuel demand from the pandemic remain.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $41.30 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent rose 0.8% to $43.94.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,953.55/oz, still at highly elevated levels, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1757, up 0.4%.

The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said the fine was reduced from 200,000 pounds for early admissions regarding audits for 2014 and 2015. The truth and fairness of the financial statements for the two years were not in question, and the breaches were not intentional, the FRC said.
BDO had no immediate comment.
One of the breaches related to a failure in documentation. Other breaches related to provisions for claims and the use of independent actuaries as experts.
""The failings in this case related to an area of high audit risk, namely the consideration of an insurance company's approach to its provision for claims,"" said Jamie Symington, the FRC's Deputy Executive Counsel.
""The auditors relied on the opinions of independent expert actuaries without taking sufficient steps to gain an understanding of or to evaluate their work.""
Some of the shortcomings came to light in the FRC's annual checks on samples of 2015 audits of Britain's leading accounting firms, the watchdog said.
The watchdog said the fine, which included a reprimand for BDO partner David Roberts, reflected that BDO and Roberts have a good compliance history and disciplinary record with no prior sanctions.
BDO, among the next tier down from the Big Four auditors of KPMG, Deloitte, EY and PwC, is required to implement a training programme to improve how it obtains and evaluates independent actuarial audit evidence.

The region, which has imposed strict lockdown measures as it deals with the outbreak, is home to many oil producers, who have seen the price of their main resource tumble as they spend to help support their economies.
Half of the eight fund managers polled by Reuters said they would increase their allocations in Saudi Arabia, the Gulf's largest economy.
While Saudi Arabia's main stock index (TASI) is down 11% this year, it is up 3.25% this quarter. In a separate Reuters poll this month, the oil producer's GDP was seen shrinking 5.2% this year, before rebounding next year.
""We are looking for opportunities ... across sectors less impacted by both the oil price slump and the pandemic,"" said Jai Lawrence, asset management analyst at Almal Capital.
While some large companies in Saudi Arabia have taken a hit, the country is ""a more diversified market with stock-specific opportunities available, which could be drivers of portfolio returns,"" said Emirates NBD's Dipanjan Ray, citing the potential merger of the kingdom's banks NCB and Samba.
Overall, fund managers said they were keeping their allocations in the UAE unchanged, because while the pandemic has hurt sectors such as real estate and tourism, the diversified nature of its economy could boost recovery.
""At this stage we believe the Dubai market has already discounted a lot of the negative consequences of the current crisis and there is medium to long-term upside,"" said Mohamed Jamal of Waha Capital.
Three of the managers polled increased allocations for Kuwait, drawing on its inclusion in the MSCI emerging markets index in November.
They said the timeline of the recovery was uncertain but Emirates NBD's Ray said he expected economic activity to normalise across all sectors over the next 12 months.
He said his firm had invested defensively going into the pandemic crisis, but ""we have rotated into high-quality recovery-oriented names.""

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening just lower Wednesday, as doubts emerge over the timing of new stimulus in he U.S. while results from  Deutsche Bank , Barclays  and Santander put the banking sector in the spotlight.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.3%, while CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1%.
President Donald Trump expressed dissatisfaction late Tuesday about some aspects of the $1 trillion stimulus package hammered out with fellow Republicans.
This suggests a lack of unity in the Republican Party camp that makes it difficult for Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to broker a deal with Democratic leaders in Congress by Friday, when the $600-per-week enhanced coronavirus unemployment benefit is due to expire.
Meanwhile, the pandemic continues to rage in parts of the U.S., hot spots in Europe and across big emerging economies including India and Brazil. Governments are having to double down on the vast amounts of stimulus and unprecedented central bank support unleashed since the crisis began. 
Global Covid-19 deaths have topped 659,000, with the number of cases beating 16.7 million as of July 29, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
The day will be dominated by the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy decisions and press conference at 2 PM ET (1800 GMT). The Fed isn't expected to change its interest rates or bond-buying policy but on Tuesday extended most of its emergency lending facilities for another three months. Some have speculated that Chairman Jerome Powell may indicate a future further loosening of policy at his press conference.
In Europe, the focus will be on bank earnings, where huge provisions against loan losses loomed large.
German's Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) posted a second-quarter loss despite a strong performance at its investment bank, as it put aside 761 million euros ($891.5 million) to cover credit losses.
Santander (MC:SAN) also reported a 12.6 billion-euro impairment, resulting in an unexpected heavy loss, while  Barclays  (LON:BARC) set aside 1.6 billion pounds.
Belgian chemicals company  Solvay  (BR:SOLB) reported a fall in second-quarter net profit as the pandemic hurt demand. It expects a challenging third quarter.
Elsewhere, Sanofi (PA:SASY) and GlaxoSmithKline (LON:GSK) have signed a deal to supply Britain with up to 60 million doses of a possible Covid-19 vaccine the pair are developing.
Oil prices were largely unchanged, with a surprise drop in U.S. inventories having little impact upon a market still concerned about the potential hit to fuel demand from the pandemic.
The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday that U.S. crude inventories dropped by 6.8 million barrels last week. U.S. government data are due later.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $41.12 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent fell 0.3% to $43.74.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,947.30/oz, still at highly elevated levels, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1737, up 0.2%."

No vaccine has yet been approved to treat or prevent COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus that has killed more than 659,000 people and unleashed economic havoc worldwide.
Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed. Sanofi and GSK, which had first teamed up in April, confirmed in a statement that regulatory approval for their vaccine could be won by the first half of 2021 if clinical data was positive.
Britain has moved early in striking vaccine supply deals, and ministers have stressed the importance of securing supplies of a range of candidates. 
""The fact remains that there are no guarantees,"" said business minister Alok Sharma.
""In the meantime, it is important that we secure early access to a diverse range of promising vaccine candidates, like GSK and Sanofi, to increase our chances of finding one that works."" 
Last week Britain struck deals for 30 million doses of the experimental BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, and a deal in principle for 60 million doses of the Valneva vaccine.
That followed a previously announced pact with AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) for production of 100 million doses of its potential vaccine, being developed in partnership with Oxford university.

With no working vaccine against COVID-19 yet developed, Britain now has 250 million doses potentially available.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Sun Life Financial  Inc (TO:SLF) expects Asia's contribution to its income to rise to about 25% in five to six years, from 18% now, driven by its push to sell insurance products via digital channels and higher demand after the coronavirus pandemic.
The Canadian insurer has recently ramped up its digital capabilities in some Asian markets, helping it cushion the impact of a slowdown in physical sales by agents amid virus-related lockdowns, the president for Sun Life Asia said.
It will further bolster its digital capabilities to tap into a growing awareness of life and health insurance products in a region where insurance density is quite low, Léo Grépin added.
""We think that is, and that's going to be even more going forward, a competitive advantage,"" Grépin said. 
Sun Life has a presence in seven markets in Asia, including China, Hong Kong, India, and the Philippines. 
Insurance firms in Asia mainly rely on their army of agents for sales, but regulators are now encouraging the use of digital tools to ease the challenges posed by the pandemic.
Asia is a promising market for global insurers due to the low penetration of insurance and fast-growing economies.
Insurance premiums as a percentage of gross domestic product in emerging Asia Pacific markets was 3.89% on an average last year, versus 11.43% in the United States and 10.30% in Britain, a Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) Institute report shows.
While an economic slowdown and a drop in income has created near-term challenges, the pandemic has also raised awareness about the need for insurance in Asia, Grépin said.
""The awareness will stay (and) the economic side of the crisis will resolve itself,"" he said, adding Sun Life was already seeing a rebound in sales in China and Hong Kong.
Sun Life's underlying profit from Asia rose 27% in the first quarter, with most of the earnings coming from before lockdowns were imposed in March, versus 8% and 7% in the United States and Canada respectively.

It will report April-June results on Aug 6.

Braking and steering systems including the Autopilot function were part of the investigation, a transport ministry official said on Wednesday. 
The ministry declined to elaborate but South Korean media said Tesla's Model 3 was under investigation, and the probe might take anywhere from six months to a year. 
Tesla would cooperate with the investigation, an official at its South Korean unit said.
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board last year cited driver errors and Tesla’s Autopilot design as the probable cause of a January 2018 crash of a Model S in California.

In Hyundai's home market, Tesla had its best month in June, with its Model 3 beating Hyundai’s Kona EV, as well as premium models from BMW and Audi.

Investing.com – Canon Inc (T:7751) has seen a two-digit slump in its shares, a two-decade low, as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic slashes demand for its iconic cameras and printers.
Canon shares tumbled 12.93% to JPY1808.50 ($17.1996) by 12:23 AM ET (5:23 AM GMT), the biggest intraday decline since July 2012.
The Japanese company saw demand for its products tumble more than expected due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decreased demand saw the company slashing its interim dividend and forecast a JPY45 billion annual profit, which missed even the lowest analyst forecasts.
Canon has struggled to maintain growth, with smartphones now widely replacing cameras to take pictures. The company has since diversified into areas such as diagnostic imaging equipment to channel new growth avenues. But falling demand across all its products as companies tighten their belts in the global economic downturn saw the company report its first quarterly loss.
Although the company saw collapsed corporate and consumer demand due to office closures and lockdown measures in many countries, Canon’s challenge is to harness the rapidly increasing demand for medical equipment. The company will need to find efficient ways to overcome travel as well as logistical restrictions in order to negotiate deals and install the equipment at the purchaser’s premises."

(Reuters) - U.S. oil refiners in coming days are expected to report the worst second-quarter results in a decade, with production outrunning demand while pandemic-related closings have sapped summer travel.
Fuel consumption has tumbled, with latest U.S. data showing a 25% drop on auto travel from a year earlier and a 75% decline in passengers at airports. Refiners get the bulk of their profits from domestic fuel sales, with the June quarter among the biggest for travel.
The seven top independent refiners, including  Valero Energy  Corp (N:VLO), Phillips 66 (N:PSX), PBF Energy Inc (N:PBF) and Marathon Petroleum Corp (N:MPC), are expected to post losses. 
Valero on Thursday is expected to report a per share loss of $1.41, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, compared to a profit of $1.51 a year earlier. The group's average per share deficit will be $1.05, according to Refinitiv, compared to a $1.65 profit a year-ago. 
Refinery crude processing rates remain about 2.8 million bpd, or 17% below the seasonal average over the past five years, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Profits also were hurt by high inventories, as refiners ramped up in anticipation of business reopenings.
Refiners with retail networks could receive a boost from sales of tobacco and beer, which ticked up in the quarter and could offset lower year-on-year volumes, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
""Refiners benefited as consumers who may have shopped at bigger, more crowded stores like Walmart (N:WMT) shifted spending to smaller refiner retail locations,"" said Matthew Blair, refining analyst at Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Co.
WEST COAST WOES
Companies with heavy West Coast presence face added trouble because of California's second lockdown, with tech companies such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) having employees work from home. 
""West Coast refining margins will be extremely weak due to a hit in driving demand...California was one of the first states to enter lockdown and has been hit again,"" said Blair.
Marathon's Martinez, California, refinery has remained idle and at least one of PBF Energy's two California plants could be idled to reduce losses, Credit Suisse said.

""We don't see gasoline demand recovering to pre-pandemic levels in California,"" Credit Suisse refining analyst Manav Gupta said in a note.

The power giant has approached sovereign funds including Singapore’s GIC Pte and China Investment Corp. about potentially acquiring a minority interest representing between 10% and 20% of China Three Gorges’ international assets, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.
The move toward a stake sale follows the reorganization of the company’s overseas assets into a separate unit that Bloomberg News reported in December. China Three Gorges has been working with advisers on setting up an entity to hold the international assets and bringing in strategic investors, the people have said.
The overseas portfolio as a whole could be valued at as much as $20 billion, the people said. The company might consider listing the unit or some of the assets at a later stage, they said.
The size of the stake could still change depending on the assets that are ultimately included in the deal, the people said. Considerations are still ongoing and no final decision has been made, they said.
A minority stake sale would help the company both reduce debt and respond to the Chinese government’s urging state-owned companies to implement mixed-ownership reform, a policy meant to increase their efficiency and competitiveness.
Talks are progressing slowly due to factors including the impact of severe flooding in the southern part of the country, which has seen more than 2 million people along the Yangtze River evacuated, and ongoing challenges from the coronavirus pandemic, the people said.
Representatives for CIC and GIC did not immediately comment on the matter. A representative for China Three Gorges did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment.

Investing.com – Asian stock markets were mostly up on Wednesday, with investors looking to the U.S. Federal Reserve, scheduled to announce its rate decision later in the day, for clues to the U.S. economy’s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Fed is widely expected to continue its dovish approach, extending almost all its lending programs by three months, to the end of 2020, with the battle against COVID-19 far from over in the U.S. as well as globally. The number of global COVID-19 cases topped 16.6 million as of July 29, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
“There’s enough stimulus and support in the market from a monetary policy perspective, but also from fiscal, and that keeps a nice floor under the market,” Amanda Agati, chief investment strategist for PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC), told Bloomberg.
“But we also think it’s going to be very difficult to make a lot of forward progress in this environment,” she warned.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.89% by 11:06 PM ET (4:06 AM GMT) while South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.33%.
Down Under, the ASX 200 fell 0.13%. The Australian Bureau of Statistics said earlier in the day that the consumer price index fell 1.9% quarter-on-quarter, and 0.3% year-on-year, in the second quarter.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.27%. New, unprecedented social distancing measures came into force on Wednesday as the city battles a third wave of COVID-19 cases. Chief Executive Carrie Lam warned on Tuesday the city is on the brink of a large-scale outbreak, with the city recording 106 new cases on Tuesday.
China’s Shanghai Composite gained 1.51% while the Shenzhen Component jumped 2.06%.
Meanwhile, Republicans and Democrats are scrambling to pass the latest stimulus measures before Friday, when some earlier measures are due to expire. But with some Republicans, including U.S President Trump, opposing the Republican’s proposed $1 trillion measure, investors will be looking to see if both parties can come to a consensus before the deadline."

The Air Line Pilots Association International (ALPA) said three FedEx pilots infected with the coronavirus were forced into mandated hospital facilities for up to 10 days in Hong Kong. Those pilots were asymptomatic. 
Several other pilots who tested negative, but had been in contact with individuals who tested positive, were put in government camps ""under extremely difficult conditions,"" the world's largest pilots' union said. 
""Not only do these situations pose unacceptable risks to our pilots' safety and wellbeing, but they also create added stress and distraction for flight operations,"" said Dave Chase, chairman, FedEx ALPA Master Executive Council. 
FedEx in a statement said the company was fully engaged with government authorities to support its crew members in situations that required medical treatment or self-isolation in Hong Kong. 
The statement comes as Hong Kong implemented tightened testing and quarantine arrangements for sea on and air crew entering the Asian financial hub starting Wednesday. 
Before arriving, crew must test negative for COVID-19 within 48 hours of boarding. On arrival, they will be tested again and must self isolate without going into the community, the government said.
There have been numerous instances of aircrew flouting quarantine rules, including a FedEx pilot who flew from Boston to Hong Kong. 
On July 26, one Twitter user based in Hong Kong posted that he had met the pilot on the city's historic Peak tram as he awaited his test results.
""You are not going to believe this! An American guy got on the tram and started chatting... Said he won't get results for two days-AND HE'S ON THE PEAK TRAM.""
After arriving in Hong Kong, crew have not been given clear guidelines as to what they can or cannot do while awaiting their test results, said one pilot who declined to be named because of corporate policy. 
Authorities in the former British colony have warned the city faces a critical period to contain the virus. Strict new measures that ban restaurant dining and restrict gatherings to two people also came into effect on Wednesday.

Hong Kong reported 106 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, including 98 that were locally transmitted.

CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Spirit Airlines  (N:SAVE) is preparing to inform unions on Friday that 20-30% of workers may be furloughed in October, an internal memo shows, becoming the first low-cost U.S. carrier to detail potential job cuts due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Workers at risk of being furloughed include pilots and flight attendants, according to the memo seen by Reuters. 
Spirit Airlines, the 7th largest U.S. carrier as of January, confirmed the memo was sent to employees on Tuesday but said it has no further comment.
""It's now clear that the demand increase we saw in June was an outlier, and the downward trend will continue,"" CEO Ted Christie says in the memo.
The airline's expected daily cash burn of more than $100 million each month, over the next several months, ""is not sustainable,"" he added.
Spirit is among the U.S. airlines that received a government bailout to keep workers employed through September as they suffer a sharp downturn in demand due to virus-related lockdowns and travel curbs. Now many are warning of furloughs once the stimulus package expires because demand has not yet recovered. 
On a conference call last week, Christie said the company was still looking at ways to mitigate the need for involuntary action after Sept. 30. 
""I think we're still reading the game film, to be honest, because the summer has been up and down both sides, and we want to make sure that we digest all the information before we make a call,"" Christie told investors after posting a wider-than-expected quarterly loss.
Some industry experts have, however, said airlines with lower cost structures and single fleet types like Spirit could weather the pandemic better than U.S. majors.

While large carriers American Airlines (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) have warned that more than 60,000 jobs are at risk between the two in the fall, low-cost carriers Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) and JetBlue Airways (N:JBLU) have said they think they can avoid furloughs for the time being.

(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) said on Tuesday it had restricted Donald Trump Jr.'s ability to tweet from his account for 12 hours, after it required him to delete a post that violated the social media site's policy on coronavirus misinformation.
The eldest son of U.S. President Donald Trump posted a since-deleted tweet on Monday with a viral video of doctors talking about the drug hydroxychloroquine.
The video was posted by others on  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc-owned YouTube and taken down for breaking those sites' rules on COVID-19 misinformation after racking up tens of millions of views.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month revoked its emergency-use authorization for hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 after several studies cast doubt on its effectiveness. The president regularly promoted the drug and said he had used it himself.
""They're censoring my account. They're censoring others,"" Donald Trump Jr. said in an interview with Fox News Channel later on Tuesday.
""This never happens to someone saying something that benefits the left. It only hurts conservatives,"" he said, adding that he had posted the video because it seemed ""very contrary to the narrative that they've been force-feeding us.""
President Trump retweeted to his 84 million followers a post on Monday containing a link to the misleading video, which was also deleted as part of Twitter's enforcement actions. The White House did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The president also retweeted a post accusing Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, of suppressing the use of hydroxychloroquine. 
Fauci, who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Tuesday he has ""not been misleading the American public under any circumstances.""
In the misleading video, doctors touted hydroxychloroquine as a cure for COVID-19 and discounted the need for face masks against the pandemic. The right-wing news site Breitbart News, which posted the video, also showed a screenshot of its 17 million video views on Facebook before it was taken down.

""It took us several hours to enforce against the video and we're doing a review to understand why this took longer than it should have,"" said a Facebook spokesman.

(Reuters) - Over about eight years, the American drugstore chain  Rite Aid Corp  (N:RAD) quietly added facial recognition systems to 200 stores across the United States, in one of the largest rollouts of such technology among retailers in the country, a Reuters investigation found.
In the hearts of New York and metro Los Angeles, Rite Aid deployed the technology in largely lower-income, non-white neighborhoods, according to a Reuters analysis. And for more than a year, the retailer used state-of-the-art facial recognition technology from a company with links to China and its authoritarian government.
In telephone and email exchanges with Reuters since February, Rite Aid confirmed the existence and breadth of its facial recognition program. The retailer defended the technology’s use, saying it had nothing to do with race and was intended to deter theft and protect staff and customers from violence. Reuters found no evidence that Rite Aid’s data was sent to China.
Last week, however, after Reuters sent its findings to the retailer, Rite Aid said it had quit using its facial recognition software. It later said all the cameras had been turned off.
""This decision was in part based on a larger industry conversation,” the company told Reuters in a statement, adding that “other large technology companies seem to be scaling back or rethinking their efforts around facial recognition given increasing uncertainty around the technology’s utility.”
Reuters pieced together how the company’s initiative evolved, how the software has been used and how a recent vendor was linked to China, drawing on thousands of pages of internal documents from Rite Aid and its suppliers, as well as direct observations during store visits by Reuters journalists and interviews with more than 40 people familiar with the systems’ deployment. Most current and former employees spoke on condition of anonymity, saying they feared jeopardizing their careers.
While Rite Aid declined to disclose which locations used the technology, Reuters found facial recognition cameras at 33 of the 75 Rite Aid shops in Manhattan and the central Los Angeles metropolitan area during one or more visits from October through July.
The cameras were easily recognizable, hanging from the ceiling on poles near store entrances and in cosmetics aisles. Most were about half a foot long, rectangular and labeled either by their model, “iHD23,” or by a serial number including the vendor’s initials, “DC.” In a few stores, security personnel – known as loss prevention or asset protection agents – showed Reuters how they worked.
The cameras matched facial images of customers entering a store to those of people Rite Aid previously observed engaging in potential criminal activity, causing an alert to be sent to security agents’ smartphones. Agents then reviewed the match for accuracy and could tell the customer to leave.
Rite Aid told Reuters in a February statement that customers had been apprised of the technology through “signage” at the shops, as well as in a written policy posted this year on its website. Reporters found no notice of the surveillance in more than a third of the stores they visited with the facial recognition cameras.
Among the 75 stores Reuters visited, those in areas that were poorer or less white were much more likely to have the equipment, the news agency’s statistical analysis found.
Stores in more impoverished areas were nearly three times as likely as those in richer areas to have facial recognition cameras. Seventeen of 25 stores in poorer areas had the systems. In wealthier areas, it was 10 of 40. (Ten of the stores were in areas whose wealth status was not clear. Six of those stores had the equipment.)
In areas where people of color, including Black or Latino residents, made up the largest racial or ethnic group, Reuters found that stores were more than three times as likely to have the technology.
Reuters’ findings illustrate “the dire need for a national conversation about privacy, consumer education, transparency, and the need to safeguard the Constitutional rights of Americans,” said Carolyn Maloney, the Democratic chairwoman of the House oversight committee, which has held hearings on the use of facial recognition technology.
Rite Aid said the rollout was “data-driven,” based on stores’ theft histories, local and national crime data and site infrastructure.
Cathy Langley, Rite Aid’s vice president of asset protection, said earlier this year that facial recognition – which she referred to as “feature matching” – resulted in less violence and organized crime in the company’s stores. Last week, however, Rite Aid said its new leadership team was reviewing practices across the company, and “this was one of a number of programs that was terminated.”
'ORWELLIAN SURVEILLANCE'
Facial recognition technology has become highly controversial in the United States as its use has expanded in both the public and private sectors, including by law enforcement and retailers. Civil liberties advocates warn it can lead to harassment of innocent individuals, arbitrary and discriminatory arrests, infringements of privacy rights and chilled personal expression.
Adding to these concerns, recent research by a U.S. government institute showed that algorithms that underpin the technology erred more often https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-crime-face/u-s-government-study-finds-racial-bias-in-facial-recognition-tools-idUSKBN1YN2V1 when subjects had darker skin tones.
Facial recognition systems are largely unregulated in the United States, despite disclosure or consent requirements, or limits on government use, in several states, including California, Washington, Texas and Illinois. Some cities, including San Francisco, ban municipal officials from using them. In general, the technology makes photos and videos more readily searchable, allowing retailers almost instantaneous facial comparisons within and across stores.
Among the systems used by Rite Aid was one from DeepCam LLC, which worked with a firm in China whose largest outside investor is a Chinese government fund. Some security experts said any program with connections to China was troubling because it could open the door to aggressive surveillance in the United States more typical of an autocratic state.
U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican and acting chair of the U.S. Senate’s intelligence committee, told Reuters in a statement that the Rite Aid system’s potential link to China was “outrageous.” “The Chinese Communist Party’s buildup of its Orwellian surveillance state is alarming, and China’s efforts to export its surveillance state to collect data in America would be an unacceptable, serious threat,” he said.
The security specialists expressed concern that information gathered by a China-linked company could ultimately land in that government’s hands, helping Beijing to refine its facial recognition technology globally and monitor people in ways that violate American standards of privacy.
“If it goes back to China, there are no rules,” said James Lewis, the Technology Policy Program director at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Asked for comment, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: “These are unfounded smears and rumors.”
'A PROMISING NEW TOOL'
Rite Aid, afflicted with financial losses in recent years, is not the only retailer to adopt or explore facial recognition technology.
Two years ago, the Loss Prevention Research Council, a coalition founded by retailers to test anti-crime techniques, called facial recognition “a promising new tool” worthy of evaluation.
“There are a handful of retailers that have made the decision, ‘Look, we need to leverage tech to sell more and lose less,” said council director Read Hayes. Rite Aid’s program was one of the largest, if not the largest, in retail, Hayes said. The Camp Hill, Pennsylvania-based company operates about 2,400 stores around the country.
The  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) said it had been testing facial recognition to reduce shoplifting in at least one of its stores but stopped the trial this year. A smaller rival, Menards, piloted systems in at least 10 locations as of early 2019, a person familiar with that effort said.
Walmart Inc (N:WMT) has also tried out facial recognition in a handful of stores, said two sources with knowledge of the tests. Walmart and Menards had no comment.
Using facial recognition to approach people who previously have committed “dishonest acts” in a store before they do so again is less dangerous for staff, said Rite Aid’s former vice president of asset protection, Bob Oberosler, who made the decision to deploy an early facial recognition system at Rite Aid. That way, “there was significantly less need for law enforcement involvement,” he said.
'TOUGHER' NEIGHBORHOODS
In interviews, 10 current and former Rite Aid loss prevention agents told Reuters that the system they initially used in stores was from a company called FaceFirst, which has been backed by U.S. investment firms.
It regularly misidentified people, all 10 of them said.
“It doesn’t pick up Black people well,” one loss prevention staffer said last year while using FaceFirst at a Rite Aid in an African-American neighborhood of Detroit. “If your eyes are the same way, or if you’re wearing your headband like another person is wearing a headband, you’re going to get a hit.”
FaceFirst’s chief executive, Peter Trepp, said facial recognition generally works well irrespective of skin tone, an issue he said the industry addressed years ago. He declined to talk about Rite Aid, saying he would not discuss any possible clients.
Rite Aid originally piloted FaceFirst at its store on West 3rd Street and South Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles, a largely Asian and Latino neighborhood, around 2012.
Of the 65 stores the retailer targeted in its first big rollout, 52 were in areas where the largest group was Black or Latino, according to Reuters’ analysis of a Rite Aid planning document from 2013 that was read aloud to a reporter by someone with access to it. Reuters confirmed that some of these stores later deployed the technology but did not confirm its presence at every location on the list.
Separately, two former Rite Aid managers and a third source familiar with the FaceFirst rollout said the systems were concentrated, respectively, in the “tougher,” “toughest” or “worst” areas.
Reuters reviewed a 2016 spreadsheet from the company’s asset protection unit in which Rite Aid rated 20 higher-earning Manhattan stores as having equal risk of loss – labeled “MedHigh.” Two of 10 stores where whites were the largest racial group had facial recognition technology when Reuters visited this year, whereas eight of the 10 in non-white areas had the systems.
One spot ranked ""MedHigh"" was a store at 741 Columbus Avenue in New York’s whiter, wealthier Upper West Side. Another was the pharmacy’s West 125th Street store in nearby Harlem, a majority African-American neighborhood. The Harlem store got facial recognition technology; the Upper West Side one did not, as of July 9.

'LOOKS NOTHING LIKE ME’
Starting in 2013, as Rite Aid deployed FaceFirst’s technology in Philadelphia, Baltimore and beyond, some serious drawbacks emerged, current and former security agents and managers told Reuters.
For instance, the system would “generate 500 hits in an hour all across the United States” when photos in the system were blurry or taken at an odd angle, one of the people familiar with FaceFirst’s operations said.
FaceFirst’s Trepp said the company has high accuracy rates while running “over 12 trillion comparisons per day without any known complaints to date.”
During that earlier period, Tristan Jackson-Stankunas said Rite Aid wrongly fingered him as a shoplifter in a Los Angeles store based on someone else’s photo. While Reuters could not confirm the method Rite Aid used to identify him, the store had FaceFirst technology by that time, according to a Rite Aid security agent and a Foursquare review photo showing the camera.
According to a complaint Jackson-Stankunas filed with the California Department of Consumer Affairs a week after the incident, he was looking for air freshener in September 2016 when a manager ordered him to leave the store. The manager said he had received a security image of Jackson-Stankunas taken at another Rite Aid in 2013 from which he allegedly had stolen goods, according to the complaint.
When Jackson-Stankunas viewed the photo on the manager’s phone, he told Reuters, he saw nothing in common with the person except their race: Both are Black.
“The guy looks nothing like me,” said Jackson-Stankunas, 34, who ultimately was allowed to make his purchase and leave the store. Rite Aid “only identified me because I was a person of color. That’s it.”
The California department told him his complaint fell outside its purview, directing him to another state office, email records show. Instead, he said he decided to write the store a bad review on  Yelp  (NYSE:YELP).
Rite Aid and the manager who allegedly was involved declined to comment on Jackson-Stankunas’ account.
At one store Reuters visited, a security agent scrolled through FaceFirst “alerts” showing a number of cases in which faces were obviously mismatched, including a Black man mixed up with someone who was Asian. Reuters could not determine whether the incorrect matches resulted in confrontations with customers.
FaceFirst CEO Trepp said that his company takes racial bias seriously and would not work with any business that disregarded civil rights. “We cannot stand for racial injustice of any kind, including in our technology,” he said.
Generally, Trepp said, Reuters’ findings about his company contained “extensive factual inaccuracies” and are “not based upon information from credible sources.” 
A NEW SYSTEM
Early in 2018, Rite Aid began installing technology from DeepCam LLC, ultimately phasing out FaceFirst in stores around the country, interviews with Rite Aid loss prevention agents and internal vendor documents indicate.
Six security staffers who used both systems said DeepCam’s matches were more accurate – sometimes to a fault. The technology picked up faces from ads on buses or pictures on T-shirts, three said. One famous face captured in DeepCam was Marilyn Monroe’s, one of the agents said.
At least until 2017, FaceFirst had employed an older method of biometric identification that compared maps of subjects’ faces, two people familiar with its system said. Only later did it move over to software based on “artificial intelligence” like DeepCam’s. Though the data and algorithms differ by brand, these systems draw upon potentially millions of samples to “learn” how to match faces.
DeepCam cameras photographed and took live video of every person entering a Rite Aid store, aiming to create a unique facial profile, Rite Aid agents said. If the customer walked in front of another DeepCam facial recognition camera at a Rite Aid shop, new images were added to the person’s existing profile. Two agents said they lost access to the images after 10 days unless the person landed on a watch list based on their behavior in stores.
When agents saw someone commit a crime – or just do something suspicious, one said – they scrolled through profiles on their smartphone to search for the individual, only adding the person to the watch list with a manager’s approval. The next time the shopper walked into a Rite Aid that had the technology, agents received a phone alert and checked the match for accuracy. Then they could order the person to leave, agents told Reuters.
Rite Aid said adding customers to the watch list was based on “multiple layers of meaningful human review.” The company told Reuters its procedures ensured customers were not confronted unnecessarily.
If a person was found to be engaging in criminal behavior, Rite Aid said, “we retain the data as a matter of policy to cooperate in pending or potential criminal investigations.”
Other U.S. retail stores have tried DeepCam. Independent 7-Eleven franchise owners in Virginia told Reuters they conducted trials of the software starting in 2018 and later dropped it. They said they largely found the system accurate but not user friendly and too expensive to maintain. The system was advertised online as costing $99 a month.
7-Eleven Inc did not answer requests for comment.
THE CHINA CONNECTION
The two founding owners of U.S.-based DeepCam LLC were Don Knasel and Jingfeng Liu, who set up the firm in Longmont, Colorado, in 2017, state records show. Liu’s residential address in Longmont was listed as its headquarters.
A Chinese native with U.S. citizenship and a doctorate from Carnegie Mellon University, Liu had the skills to do business in both the United States and China.
According to China’s official business registration records, he is chairman of another facial recognition firm in China called Shenzhen Shenmu Information Technology Co Ltd, whose website is DeepCam.com.
For a time, the U.S.-based DeepCam LLC and Shenzhen Shenmu were closely connected: In addition to Liu’s role in both companies, they shared the same website and email accounts, according to internal records seen by Reuters.
Internal correspondence reviewed by Reuters suggests that DeepCam reached a deal with Rite Aid by March 2018, when a colleague emailed Knasel to congratulate him. Internal records also indicated that China-based Shenzhen Shenmu helped its American counterpart with product development and that Liu was expected to pay at least some of the bills. That same month, a U.S. executive wrote: “Hi Jingfeng- Thanks for the credit card. Here is the receipt for the Indianapolis Trade Show.”
In an interview, Liu confirmed the financing, saying of Knasel: “Whenever he needed money, I give him some money.” Liu said Knasel told him about the Rite Aid project but left him in the dark about the business. Knasel “never let data cross between the two countries,” Liu said.
As the Rite Aid rollout proceeded in 2018, correspondence among DeepCam staff, seen by Reuters, expressed concerns about publicly revealing any links to China, as well as using the term “facial recognition” in the U.S. market for fear of attracting the attention of the American Civil Liberties Union.
Days after the ACLU wrote a March 2018 blog post https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/are-stores-you-shop-secretly-using-face critical of retailers’ suspected use of the technology, including Rite Aid’s, Knasel emailed staff: “It looks like the ACLU may be starting to stick its head up....We need to tone down facial recognition, which I have tried to do....If they come after us, we are dead....so we have to avoid.” The punctuation in the message is Knasel’s.
Jay Stanley, the ACLU senior policy analyst who co-authored the blog post, told Reuters that the right response to civil liberties concerns about surveillance technology ""is not to start using it in secret.""
It is ""to stop using the technology altogether. We are glad Rite Aid seems to have ultimately recognized this.""
Today, both Liu and Knasel say no ties exist between the U.S. and Chinese businesses.
“We never do any business in USA,” Liu wrote in a brief email to Reuters in March. “We focus in China market.”
More recently, in an interview and an email, Liu said he had not spoken with Knasel for more than a year and, to his disappointment, had not benefited from the U.S. venture.
In a statement to Reuters, Knasel sought to distance himself from Liu, Shenzhen Shenmu and DeepCam.
He did not address questions about DeepCam’s deal with Rite Aid. DeepCam, he said, is “winding up” its operations and now has no assets. He added that DeepCam never supplied China-based Shenzhen Shenmu with any data.
In February, Rite Aid told Reuters that DeepCam had been “re-branded” as pdActive. PdActive is a facial recognition company run by Knasel, who said it is not a rebranding of DeepCam but a different company that has no owners who are Chinese citizens.
Knasel remained connected to DeepCam through another company he runs, dcAnalytics, which Knasel said licensed DeepCam’s technology until November 2019. Since then, Knasel said, U.S.-based dcAnalytics has been using “proprietary” technology, as well as facial recognition cameras purchased from DeepCam.
Knasel said dcAnalytics is “committed to upholding the highest standards possible to make sure facial recognition technology is used fairly, properly and responsibly.”
SENSITIVE QUESTIONS
Steve Dickinson, a Seattle attorney who practiced law in China for more than a decade and writes about cybersecurity, said geopolitical tensions have added sensitivity to any work Chinese surveillance firms do in the United States.
Last year, the U.S. government blacklisted several Chinese companies – including Hikvision (SZ:002415), one of the biggest surveillance camera manufacturers globally – alleging involvement in human rights abuses. China has deployed facial recognition cameras widely within its borders, providing a level of monitoring unfathomable to many Americans.
At the time, a U.S. Hikvision spokesman said the firm “strongly opposes” the decision and that punishing Hikvision would harm its U.S. business partners and discourage global companies from communicating with the U.S. government.
Liu described his company as nothing like the Chinese video surveillance giants. With about 20 employees, he said, it is “a tiny company pretending to be big,” struggling unsuccessfully to get government contracts and nearly bankrupt.
Reuters found that he and his company have financial and other ties to the Chinese government, however.
Most notably, Shenzhen Shenmu’s largest outside investor, holding about 20% of its registered capital, is a strategic fund set up by the government of China. Called the SME Development Fund (Shenzhen Limited Partnership), it has built a 6 million yuan ($855,000) stake in Shenzhen Shenmu since early 2018, Chinese public business records show.
A person with the same name as a Shenzhen Shenmu board director has also worked for the venture firm managing the SME fund, according to the records and the investment firm’s website.
The fund acknowledged investing in Shenzhen Shenmu and said it ""does not participate in the daily operation and management of the enterprise.""
Liu is a member of China’s Thousand Talents program, according to a local government website. That program was started by Beijing as a way to bring top academics working in important fields abroad back to China. According to allegations https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/harvard-university-professor-and-two-chinese-nationals-charged-three-separate-china-related by the U.S. Justice Department, the program aimed to steal foreign technology.
In a statement, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs described such allegations as false and as “stigmatization” by the United States.
Liu told Reuters he tried to get into the program but does not know if he is. The achievement was reported in an article on Shenzhen Shenmu's website, but Liu said he only wanted to use the distinction to help him sell products. Reuters was unable to confirm with China’s government whether Liu was a member.
Another website, that of a Shenzhen Shenmu subsidiary, Magicision, claims its technology has helped officials arrest fugitives and suspected criminals in China.
Liu was vague about the firm’s public security work, saying his company has tried unsuccessfully to get contracts with Chinese law enforcement. He called the website’s information “bullshit marketing.”
About the Chinese government’s interest in his company’s data, however, he was clear.
“The China government never care about us,” he said. “We are too small.”

“I know (the) China threat is a hot, eyeball-attractive topic. But what you have in mind is totally untrue.”

(Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp 's (O:SBUX) business is ""steadily recovering"" worldwide as most of the coffee chain's stores have reopened with the easing of coronavirus-led restrictions, it said on Tuesday.
Shares of the Seattle-based company rose about 6.5% in extended trading after it said it would return to profitability in the current quarter on improving sales and margins.
Comparable store sales fell 40% globally and 41% in the Americas for Starbucks' third quarter ended June 28. This was less than analysts' forecast for declines of 42.05% and 42.82% respectively, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Starbucks, like many restaurants and coffee chains, took a big hit from government-imposed measures to curb the pandemic, prompting it to rely more on delivery and drive-thru services to make up for lost business.
More people used the chain's drive-thru and delivery options to buy coffee and food, with mobile orders rising 6 percentage points from a year ago to make up 22% of total transactions in the quarter.
Starbucks plans to deploy new handheld point-of-sale devices for employees to take orders in drive-thru lines to speed service. It will also roll out curbside pickup and a new plant-based protein box.
""Our recovery strategy is working,"" said Chief Executive Kevin Johnson said during a call with investors. ""We have future-proofed our business model and reinforced our balance sheet to enable us to play offense.""
About 97% of global Starbucks-operated locations are now open. This includes 99% of outlets in China and 96% of stores in the United States, which started the quarter with less than half of locations open.
For its full fiscal year, which ends in September, Starbucks expects global same-store sales to be 12-17% lower. Comparable sales in China should see a substantial recovery by December and U.S. sales expected are to recover by March 2021.
Ninety-day active U.S. members in the Starbucks Rewards loyalty program dropped 5% year over year to 16.3 million as customers used it less often because of temporary store closures.
Excluding one-time items, the company lost 46 cents per share in the quarter, but that was better than analysts' expectations of a 59 cent per-share loss.

Total net revenue slumped about 38% to $4.22 billion, but still beat the average analyst estimate of $4.07 billion.

730,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 07:20PM ET</span>","L Brands forecasts smaller-than-expected sales decline, shares surge","(Reuters) - L Brands Inc (N:LB) on Tuesday forecast a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly sales on strong demand for its Bath & Body Works hand sanitizers and other personal care products, and said it would cut 15% of its corporate staff.
Shares of the company surged 17% in extended trading after the Victoria's Secret owner also said its cost-cutting efforts, including layoffs and inventory management, would help it save about $400 million annually.
L Brands is focusing on its high-margin Bath and Body Works division as the COVID-19 pandemic drives customers to stock up on personal care products such as hand sanitizers. 
Columbus, Ohio-based L Brands estimated a 10% rise in second-quarter revenue for the brand, even as it expects total net sales to be down about 20% from a year earlier.
Analysts on average were expecting total net sales to decline about 35% to $1.9 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""BBW is being helped by hand sanitizer while its candle sales slow. Sanitizer has been a lifesaver,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Randal Konik said.
The company projected a drop of about 40% in sales at its Victoria's Secret unit, which it plans to run as a separate, standalone company after failing to sell a majority stake to private-equity firm Sycamore Partners.
L Brands has reopened most Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret Stores in North America after the easing of coronavirus-induced lockdowns.

The company is expected to report results on Aug. 19.

731,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 07:00PM ET</span>","Amgen second-quarter revenue rises 6%, shares fall 2%","By Deena Beasley
(Reuters) -  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) said on Tuesday second-quarter revenue rose 6% as higher sales of newer drugs, including recently added psoriasis treatment Otezla, offset declining sales of older medicines which were due in some cases to people staying home to avoid exposure to the new coronavirus. 
The results were largely in line with Wall Street estimates, and the company's shares fell nearly 2% in extended trading.
Amgen said sales of drugs such as osteoporosis treatment Prolia fell as people, especially older women who use the physician-administered drug, put off going to the doctor due to the pandemic. 
""Stringent stay-at-home orders resulted not just in social distancing, but in medical distancing,"" Amgen commercial operations chief Murdo Gordon said on a conference call.
But he added that sales of Prolia and other drugs picked up in the latter half of the quarter, in part because the company worked closely with healthcare providers to identify alternative sites for patients to receive their injections.
For the full year, Amgen narrowed its outlook for adjusted earnings per share to between $10.73 and $11.43 from its previous range of $10.65 to $11.45. The company said it still expects full-year revenue of $25 billion to $25.6 billion.
The current pandemic ""creates significant uncertainty,"" Chief Financial Officer Peter Griffith said.
Total revenue for the quarter of $6.2 billion was in line with the average Wall Street estimate as compiled by Refinitiv.
Otezla, acquired from  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG) in November, had sales of $561 million for the quarter, beating analyst expectations of $540 million.
Adjusted earnings, helped by lower expenses, rose 4% to $2.52 billion, or $4.25 per share, beating the average estimate of $3.84 per share. 
Amgen's ""performance was solid during the quarter,"" Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans said in an emailed statement, adding that investor focus is now shifting to the company's drug development pipeline.
Amgen expects key clinical data in the second half of this year from trials of experimental drugs, including tezepelumab in patients with severe asthma, omecamtiv mecarbil in heart failure patients and sotorasib for lung cancer.

Amgen shares fell 1.7% after hours to $251 from their Nasdaq close at $255.27.

732,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 06:45PM ET</span>",Masks Made From Banana-Tree Species Cut Covid’s Plastic Waste,"(Bloomberg) -- Fiber from a relative of the banana tree could replace plastic in millions of face masks and hospital gowns the world is making to fight the coronavirus.
Abaca -- a fiber from the Philippines used in teabags and banknotes -- is as durable as polyester but will decompose within two months, said Philippine fiber agency head Kennedy Costales. “With this pandemic, if we all buy masks made of synthetic fiber, they will pile up in dumpsites because they take so long to decompose,” he said.
Global efforts to ban single-use plastics have retreated as nations prioritized hygiene over the environment for packaging and medical supplies, creating a bright spot for chemical companies such as  LyondellBasell Industries  NV (NYSE:LYB) and Trinseo (NYSE:TSE) SA. Sales of disposable face masks are set to rise more than 200-fold worldwide this year to $166 billion, according to a United Nations trade article, citing consultancy Grand View Research.
Companies have been reluctant to replace plastic with biodegradable alternatives because of concern about cost and whether the new materials are sufficiently strong and effective for medical use.
A preliminary study by the Philippine Department of Science and Technology showed abaca paper to be more water resistant than a commercial N-95 mask, and to have pore sizes within the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommended range to filter hazardous particles.
Costales said abaca demand could grow “exponentially” this year, with 10% of production going to medical uses, compared with less than 1% in 2019.
“Abaca fiber is rapidly gaining popularity as governments and manufacturers all around the world scamper to produce more reusable and safe medical garments for healthcare professionals,” said Pratik Gurnani, senior consultant at Future Market Insights.
In Demand
The Philippines is the world’s largest producer, supplying 85% of the fiber in 2017, according to the latest data from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Global production is projected to be worth $100 million this year, Gurnani said.
The fiber, stripped from the trunks of the abaca tree, was used for saltwater-resistant ship ropes and Manila envelopes in the 19th century. Up to 30% of Japan’s banknotes are made of it and abaca yarn has been used in Mercedes-Benz cars.
Even though the plant fiber is more expensive to produce than plastic alternatives, manufacturers of protective health gear from China, India and Vietnam have placed new orders for the fiber over the past months, prompting Philippine fiber factories to double their output, said abaca exporter Firat Kabasakalli.
“People see this pandemic lasting for some time, so even small companies are trying to make protective equipment, which require our fiber,” said Kabasakalli, general manager of Dragon Vision Trading. “We are getting a lot of inquiries from new clients abroad.”
Missed Opportunity
One company in southern Philippines which makes greeting cards and paper from the fiber for export to the U.S. and Europe has shifted to making masks.
“The awareness of consumers now is higher when it comes to taking care of the environment,” said Neil Francis Rafisura, general manager of Salay Handmade Products Industries Inc. “There are people who will pay a premium for environmentally friendly products.”
Abaca production can’t keep up with demand, according to Costales. While he estimates growers will increase output to 74,000 metric tons this year, that’s not enough to meet even last year’s supply deficit of about 125,000 tons, he said. Part of the reason is that farmers in the Philippines lack government subsidies to raise output.
“Abaca is like precious gold for the Philippines, but it’s been often overlooked because the government prioritizes crops that feed people,“ Costales said. “This is a missed opportunity for us.“

(Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc (O:AMD) raised its full-year revenue forecast on Tuesday, driven in part by an overall surge in chip demand due to a global shift to work from home, and market-share gains from larger rival  Intel Corp  (O:INTC).
AMD's shares jumped 10% in extended trading after it also forecast current-quarter sales above Wall Street targets. The stock has gained about 50% this year through Tuesday's close as investors cheered its success in next-generation chips, at a time when Intel faces delays in building the smaller, faster 7-nanometer chip technology.
AMD, which relies on outside foundries to make its chips, has started to take market share from Intel with offerings made on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd's (TW:2330) 7-nm process technology.
On a conference call with analysts, AMD Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su said capacity for making 7-nm chips at TSMC factories was ""tight"" but that AMD believes it can meet demand as customers switch from Intel.
""The full-year raise is because demand has gone up from our initial expectations, and some of that is due to the market, and some of that is due to the strength of our product traction. We are increasing capacity to meet those needs. But it is tight,"" Su said.
AMD also met its goal of double-digit market share in server processors, Su said.
Revenue from AMD's computing and graphics segment, which includes graphic chip sales to data centers, rose 45% to $1.37 billion, beating analysts' estimate of $1.36 billion, according to research firm FactSet.
AMD now expects 2020 revenue to grow by about 32%, driven by strength in PC, gaming and data center products.

It expects third-quarter revenue at about $2.55 billion, plus or minus $100 million, compared to analysts' average estimate of $2.32 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

(Reuters) - EBay Inc (O:EBAY) beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit on Tuesday and raised its full-year outlook, as the e-commerce company benefited from a surge in online shopping by people staying indoors due to coronavirus-driven lockdowns.
Business has been booming for e-commerce firms and companies with strong online presence as the COVID-19 pandemic has led more people to use their mobile phones and computers to shop.
Ebay now expects full-year adjusted profit between $3.47 and $3.59 per share. Analysts were expecting $3.51 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian said that e-commerce related stocks have largely outperformed since the beginning of the pandemic and expectations are really high.
""It's not a surprise to see some weakness on results,"" Arounian added.
Shares of eBay, which have surged about 56% so far this year, fell nearly 3% to $54.75 in extended trade.
The company last week agreed to sell its classified ads business to Norway's Adevinta (OL:ADEV) in a deal worth $9.2 billion, succumbing to longstanding pressure from activist investors Elliott Management Corp and Starboard Value. 
Pressure from the activist investors also resulted in the company naming Walmart (N:WMT) executive Jamie Iannone as its top boss in April, handing over the reins to an outsider. 
""I think the stock is down due to ... some concern that the new CEO might reinvest some of the recent upside to try to strengthen the company's competitive position,"" Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said. 
Revenue rose to $2.87 billion in the second quarter, from $2.42 billion a year-ago, beating analysts' estimate of about $2.8 billion.

Excluding items, the company earned $1.08 per share, above estimates of $1.06 per share.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - AMC Theatres (N:AMC) and Comcast Corp's (O:CMCSA) Universal Pictures agreed to a major shift that will allow the studio's movies to be made available to U.S. audiences at home after just three weekends in cinemas, the companies announced on Tuesday.
AMC, the world's largest movie theater chain, will receive a portion of the revenue that Universal generates from ""premium video-on-demand"" sales during the first weeks a film is offered to at-home viewers.
Financial details were not disclosed.
Studios have been pushing to make their movies available in living rooms sooner than the typical timeline of roughly 90 days after they debut in cinemas. Theaters have long resisted that idea, and the standoff had prompted AMC to say earlier this year it would no longer show Universal films in its theaters.
On Tuesday, AMC said it supported the agreement to offer films in homes after just 17 days.
""AMC enthusiastically embraces this new industry model both because we are participating in the entirety of the economics of the new structure, and because premium video-on-demand creates the added potential for increased movie studio profitability, which should in turn lead to the green-lighting of more theatrical movies,"" AMC's chief executive, Adam Aron, said in a statement.
AMC Theatres is aiming to reopen its cinemas, which have been closed because of the coronavirus pandemic, in August.
Universal distributes the ""Fast & Furious"" and ""Despicable Me"" franchises, among other films. 
The deal with AMC ""is driven by our collective desire to ensure a thriving future for the film distribution ecosystem and to meet consumer demand with flexibility and optionality,"" said Donna Langley, chairman of Universal Filmed Entertainment Group.
Under the agreement, Universal holds the option to offer movies via AMC Theatres On Demand and other online platforms. 

Universal and AMC are discussing distribution plans for Europe and the Middle East, the companies said.

736,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",China’s $941 Billion Wealth Fund Loses Talent at the Worst Time,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s sovereign wealth fund is losing senior-level talent at one of the worst possible times.
Three of China Investment Corp.’s top executives have resigned since April, leaving the $941 billion fund without some of its most experienced managers during a period of historic volatility in global markets. The departures add to a steady exodus in recent years that has included at least 17 team heads and managing directors.
Conversations with former and current managers point to shrinking opportunities, sliding compensation competitiveness and rising restrictions, all of which erode CIC’s attractiveness as a government-owned institution trying to operate as a market-based investor. The departures have now become significant enough that they threaten to hurt the fund’s returns, according to Li Jie, head of the foreign reserves research center at Beijing’s Central University of Finance and Economics.
“There’s no doubt that CIC’s appeal to talent in the market has been declining,” Li said.
Work experience at the fund has brightened executives’ resumes as they seek new opportunities and challenges elsewhere, several people familiar with the matter said. All declined to be identified, citing a reluctance to be seen discussing sensitive information in public.
Representatives from CIC didn’t respond to requests for comment.
CIC, the world’s second-biggest sovereign wealth fund after Norway’s, embarked on a global hiring spree of investment professionals from Wall Street and elsewhere after an initial $200 billion of capital upon inception in 2007. The timing was good; after the credit crisis, many Chinese-born out-of-work executives in the U.S. were looking for a job.
Most Scarce Resource
The firm had 205 investment professionals managing its overseas portfolio as of June 30, 2019 (the latest figures available). Its most notable investments have included a large stake in Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc., mining company Teck Resources (NYSE:TECK) Ltd. and a $13.8 billion purchase of Europe’s Logicor.
CIC’s overseas portfolio returned an average 6.1% annually in the 10 years through 2018, beating a long-term target set by the fund’s board. It gained 17% last year as global stocks rallied, Executive Vice President Zhao Haiying said in an interview in May.
Senior CIC leaders have long stressed the need to attract top talent.
In a 2017 article, Ding Xuedong, the former chairman, wrote that the sovereign wealth fund’s talent was its “most, most scarce” resource. Founding chairman Lou Jiwei also recalled how building a global portfolio from scratch hinged on the hiring progress.
“At the beginning, when there weren’t enough people, we had to rely on asset allocation to get beta,” he wrote in an internal book compiled by CIC in 2017 to mark its 10-year anniversary, which also featured Ding’s missive. “After realizing beta, we tried to seek alpha from various aspects,” Lou said, using the investment language for average returns and excess profit. “Without the people, you may not even have beta.”
Yet the strategic importance CIC placed on bolstering returns on reserves has only weakened after the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, the main agency managing reserves, also diversified its own investments in recent years, the Central University of Finance and Economics’ Li said.
Tougher Deals
Rising yuan volatility and geopolitical tensions mean there’s greater priority placed on the safety of reserves, rather than higher returns, he said. That in turn reduces the possibility of any new capital injections in the near term.
CIC has received little fresh capital to deploy after 2012, as the nation’s foreign-exchange reserves reversed their years-long surge, falling 22% from a peak in 2014. A plan considered by CIC’s management in 2018 to raise money independently by selling bonds overseas has never materialized.
Deals are also harder to find amid growing protectionism in countries from the U.S. to Australia, particularly as the ruling Communist Party’s increased emphasis on its leadership in state-owned companies blurs CIC’s longstanding message to the market that it only wants to be a financial investor and won’t seek control.
Diminished deal-making opportunities has left CIC’s investment professionals less motivated, people familiar with the matter said. At one point, CIC even discussed a plan to manage external money, although that idea was ditched due to regulatory and technical barriers, two former employees said.
“The success of sovereign wealth funds, as with any knowledge-based organization, hinges on teamwork, deep industry relationships and people,” said Abdiel Santiago, chief executive officer of Panama’s sovereign wealth fund Fondo de Ahorro de Panama. “Financial assets don’t run themselves, and when leadership and talent suddenly leave, the void results in a difficult road toward their replacement, and at potentially great opportunity cost.”
While it’s difficult to quantify the direct damage of manager departures on performance, it could be substantial. Susan Gao, who resigned in April, had consistently beaten the MSCI All-Country World Index with her Global Large Cap Value Equity Portfolio over the past 10 years, including by a hefty 19 percentage points between April 2013 and 2016.
Pay Problems
CIC’s most senior management isn’t blind to the revolving door. Ding wondered why “some comrades left. Was our compensation not attractive?” he asked a colleague soon after his appointment in 2013. Ding viewed retaining talent so they could pass on their cumulative experience as his most important mission. “Is a pay rise an option?”
He got a long answer from Zhang Qing, who recounted the conversation in the 2017 book before himself resigning a few years later as executive vice president of CIC’s direct investment unit. Zhang cited reasons ranging from employees’ own inability to adjust to the job, incentive mechanisms that fail to properly reflect performance, highly educated staff doing “trivial work” and inadequate coordination between front, mid and back-office departments.
Another reason, according to the people interviewed, is limited promotion opportunities, particularly for those who have risen to managing director or department head level. Becoming an even more elevated company-level official, which is rare in itself, is more likely to lead to a pay cut rather than a rise given the tighter restrictions around senior cadres, typically appointed by the ruling Communist Party.
Efforts to increase pay have only been met by the Party’s disciplinary tightening. CIC in 2016 said it cut average staff expenses by 4% and started to link any pay rises to company performance after inspectors found that salaries at CIC were “rising too fast” and that “per-capita management costs are too high.”
Managing directors and department heads at CIC typically earn between 1 million yuan ($143,000) and 2 million yuan a year depending on performance, the people said. That’s higher than some government officials but a drop in the bucket versus pay on Wall Street.
Now with the coronavirus stamping its presence all over 2020, the prospects of any more money seem slim. There’s also speculation that the finance ministry, which owns CIC, is pondering a further pay cut to the fund’s front-office staff after their travel budget was downgraded last year and they were only allowed to fly coach.
CIC has also lost its position as the Chinese government’s only diversified global investment platform following the widening of SAFE’s investment scope and establishment of other government-backed vehicles like the Silk Road Fund. Fan Hua, the former head of CIC’s asset allocation department and a senior managing director who left in 2018, is now the CIO of China Merchants Bank Co.’s wealth management subsidiary. Wang Ou, CIC’s former head of private equity, is now at China Renaissance Holdings Ltd. as a strategic consultant.
A better system that can retain talent is essential at CIC, because people can pass on “institutional memory” and help ensure past mistakes aren’t made in the future, former President Gao Xiqing said in the 2017 book. If an institution is too fluid, with employees leaving and new members frequently joining, that structure can be damaged.
“Over the past 10 years, that’s what we gained, and also what we lost,” he said.

738,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 05:18PM ET</span>",China’s Covid-19 Rebound Lost Momentum in July as Consumers Wary,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economic recovery lost some upward momentum in July, with the effect of stronger market sentiment damped by muted demand in the real economy.
The overall indicator for the economy in July was unchanged from last month, after improving in May and June. The calculation of the indicators has been revised from this month to include metrics for car purchases, real-estate sales and the building sector.
The world’s second-largest economy returned to growth in the second quarter on the back of industrial output and investment, while consumers have been less willing to return spending to their pre-pandemic levels. Renewed virus outbreaks and Yangtze River flooding have had little direct economic effect so far, but may be keeping optimism in check.
Smaller firms grew more confident in July, with the overall index in Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc’s survey rising to the strongest since January, before the coronavirus pandemic caused the lockdown of Wuhan and the rest of the country.
China’s Economy Returns to Growth Amid Global Virus Struggle
“A worry now is that recovery momentum on the supply side may be dragged down if demand fails to pick up,” Bloomberg Economist David Qu wrote in a report this week. “Recent U.S.-China tensions also risk creating economic drags that could further damp recovery in the longer term.”
Purchasing manager indexes are expected to show July being about the same as June, when the first official data for the month are released on Friday.
Exports orders for smaller firms resumed expansion, according to Standard Chartered, boding well for many companies which had been hit hard first by the trade war, and then by the pandemic. China’s exports have belied the general weakness seen in other Asian countries and across the world, unexpectedly rising slightly in June.
However, the outlook for global trade is not strong, with Korean exports in the first 20 days of July falling by more than in June.
KOREA REACT: Early Exports Underscore Uneven Global Recovery
Car sales, which are a big chunk of consumer spending, improved from June but were still flat so far this month. Factory deflation will continue to hit profits, even if prices declined less than in May or June.
The government has prioritized infrastructure investment as one of the main drivers of economic recovery, with local governments increasing borrowing to pay for various projects. Stockpiles of steel reinforcing used in construction have reacted and fallen from the mid-March peak, but are still higher than a year ago, while property sales in China’s four top-tier cities were lower so far in July compared to the same period a year ago.
After the biggest rally in years, Chinese stocks have been hit by panic selling in recent days, with traders, company insiders and overseas investors all fleeing the country’s stock market as rapidly worsening relations with the U.S. hits sentiment. However, the main stock index is still up almost 10% from the end of June.
Note on Early Indicator construction
From this month, Bloomberg has changed some of the components for this early look at the the economy, adding home sales in the biggest four cities, weekly car sales, and inventories of steel reinforcing, while removing iron-ore prices, sales manager sentiment, and property-related stocks.
Bloomberg Economics generates the overall activity reading by aggregating the three-month weighted average of the monthly changes of eight indicators, which are based on business surveys or market prices.

Investing.com – Late selling hit the Dow on Tuesday, pressured by a fall in 3M and McDonald's on weaker-than-expected quarterly results, while weaker consumer confidence raised concerns about the economic recovery.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.77%, the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.27% and the S&P 500 was down 0.65%.
Heavyweight Dow components 3M and McDonald’s came under pressure after delivering quarterly earnings that fell short of expectations, with both companies citing coronavirus-led weaknesses in results.
3M (NYSE:MMM) fell 4.8% after the manufacturer reported second-quarter earnings that fell short of expectations, weighed down by weakness in its transportation and health care businesses.
McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) slipped 2.5% after its second-quarter earnings missed consensus estimates, as government measures to control the virus dented international sales.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) jumped 4% after delivering second-quarter results that beat on both the top and bottom lines as the drugmaker's sales of cancer and blood thinner drugs offset weaker sales of other drugs in its in portfolio.
As well as better-than-expected earnings, shares of Pfizer got a boost from the announcement that the company together with its partner  Biontech Se  (NASDAQ:BNTX) will launch a late, late study of their potential Covid-19 vaccine.
The economic front, meanwhile, served as a reminder that the recent spike in cases across the U.S. has put the economic recovery in jeopardy as the consumer, the backbone of the economy, showed signs of weakness in July.
""It seems that reality is setting in for the consumer. In June, the expectations index was 106.1, but the index declined sharply to 91.5 in July as the hopes for a V-shaped recovery faded,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate Armed Services Committee's Republican chairman said on Tuesday he will block the renewal of the term of a Federal Communications Commission member over the independent agency's decision to allow Ligado Networks to deploy a low-power nationwide mobile broadband network.
Senator Jim Inhofe said he was placing a hold on FCC Commissioner Mike O'Rielly's nomination to serve a new term unless O'Rielly agrees to vote to overturn the Ligado Order, which is opposed by the Pentagon, other U.S. agencies and global positioning system users like major airlines. 
The five-member FCC voted unanimously to approve the Ligado order in April.
""This isn’t just about our military, but all users of GPS are united in opposition,"" Inhofe said. ""All of America can’t be wrong, and he understands that.""
A spokesman for O'Rielly declined to comment. 
In May, a group of U.S. agencies asked the FCC to reconsider its decision, saying it could pose a threat to GPS systems.
The Air Line Pilots Association, International Air Transport Association, Airlines for America,  Iridium Communications  (NASDAQ:IRDM) and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) also urged reconsideration.
Previously, 32 U.S. senators said U.S. military operations could be harmed by the network proposed by Ligado, formerly known as LightSquared, which emerged from bankruptcy in 2015.
Ligado said ""the Department of Defense, its contractors, and their special interest lobbyists have blanketed the Hill to spread misinformation and distort the exhaustive, engineering, and fact-driven process.""
The spectrum block Ligado wants to tap is in the L-Band, which is also home to spectrum used by GPS systems used by the military, businesses and consumers.

The Transportation Department this month urged the FCC to reconsider, saying the decision could cost federal users of the spectrum and private users of GPS both ""tens of billions of dollars.""

746,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 04:24PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: 3 Things to Watch for July 29,"By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com  -- Markets closed lower today after 3M and McDonald’s provided mixed second quarter earnings.
The pace of infection in hotspots including California, Florida, Arizona, and Texas appears to have abated in recent days, but infectious disease specialist Dr. Anthony Fauci warned the Midwest could be next to see a surge in cases.
Tech stocks faltered and Bernstein downgraded Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to underperform from market perform, citing worries over valuation.
There’s so much going on tomorrow, that we’re giving you four things that may move markets, rather than the usual three: 
The Fed
The Federal Reserve’s two-day monetary policy meeting started Tuesday, and will culminate with a policy update at 2 p.m. EST (1800 GMT) on Wednesday. A press conference with Chairman Jerome Powell will follow.
The Fed is expected to leave interest rates alone to support an economy weakened by the spread of the coronavirus.  
Earlier Tuesday, the Fed said its lending programs would be extended through the end of the year. Those include the Main Street lending facility that lends to small- and medium-sized businesses. It had been set to expire at the end of September. 
The extension will “provide certainty that the facilities will continue to be available to help the economy recover,"" the Fed said, calling the programs ""a critical backstop.""   
Quarterly earnings flurry
Companies across the board are reporting earnings Wednesday. Analyst estimates were compiled by Investing.com. Here is a sampling:
 PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) is expected to report earnings per share of 87 cents and revenue of $4.99 billion. Shares are up about 65% in 2020. 
Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is forecast to report a loss per share of 1 cent on revenue of $506 million. The stock flirted with an all-time high earlier this month. 
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) should report earnings per share of 70 cents on sales of $4.8 billion. Shares are trading close to a record high.
GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) is set to publish earnings per share of 49 cents on $9.64 billion. GSK recently said it will develop and evaluate a Covid-19 vaccine with Medicago.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) publishes earnings at a time when no one’s flying and no one needs new planes. The company is expected to report a loss per share of $2.51 on revenue of $13.24 billion. 
Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) is forecast to report a loss per share of 3 cents on revenue of $1.72 billion. With elective surgeries on hold around the world, the medical devices company’s outlook isn’t so rosy. 
 General Electric  Company (NYSE:GE) is expected to report a loss per share of 1 cent on sales of $17 billion. The stock is down by about half since the beginning of 2020. 
Eco indicators
Pending home sales for June are expected to rise 19% from the previous month, which itself showed a record jump of 44%. The National Association of Realtors Pending Home Sales Report measures the change in the number of homes under contract to be sold but still awaiting the closing transaction, excluding new construction. Homebuilders have reported strong demand for the month.
 Crude oil inventories come in Wednesday morning at 10:30 AM ET (1430 GMT). Analysts expect an addition of 357,000 barrels for the week ending July 24, compared with an increase of 4.9 million barrels the previous week.
Silicon Valley goes to Congress
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify at a hearing of the House antitrust subcommittee along with the heads of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). 
Zuckerberg is expected to portray his company as an “American success story in a competitive and unpredictable market, now threatened by the rise of Chinese social media apps” (TikTok, anyone?), Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

747,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 04:20PM ET</span>",Wall St. pauses as pandemic hurts consumer confidence and earnings; stimulus underwhelms,"By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - Wall Street closed lower on Tuesday as investors fretted about weakening consumer confidence, disappointing financial results and a smaller than hoped for coronavirus aid plan from U.S. Senate Republicans. 
Weighing down the Dow were industrial conglomerate 3M Co (N:MMM) after it reported a second-quarter plunge in demand across its businesses and McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) after a surprisingly big drop in global same-store sales.
Data released in the morning showed U.S. consumer confidence ebbed in July as coronavirus infections flared up across the country.
As they waited on a stimulus package and for quarterly reports in one of the busiest weeks in earnings season, investors were also anticipating the U.S. Federal Reserve's Wednesday wrap-up of its two day policy meeting. 
""It's probably not a bad place to take some profits and rebuild some liquidity because any of those three events could lead to volatility,"" said Sameer Samana, Senior Global Market Strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis. 
Samana said ""its going to be very hard for the Fed to surprise on the positive side."" 
Florida reported a record one-day rise in coronavirus deaths, and cases in Texas passed the 400,000 mark, stoking fears the United States was losing control of the outbreak.
But Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia called the consumer survey ""unsettling"" evidence that ""individuals are increasingly concerned about the recent surge in coronavirus impacting their finances and their mobility."" 
Feeding the fears, members of congress were sparring over a $1 trillion aid proposal from Senate Republicans announced on Monday, four days before millions of Americans lose unemployment benefits.
""There has be tremendous compromise from both parties to get to some agreement,"" he said, noting a congressional recess scheduled for August adds deadline pressure.
""It's particularly critical at this time since the market is really feeding off the largess that's been expended by fiscal and monetary authorities,"" he said.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 205.21 points, or 0.77%, to 26,379.56, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 20.87 points, or 0.64%, to 3,218.54 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 134.18 points, or 1.27%, to 10,402.09.
Materials (SPLRCM) and Energy (SPNY) were the biggest percentage decliners of the S&P's 11 major sectors. Defensive real estate <.SPLRCR> and utilities (SPLRCU) sectors were the biggest gainers. 
The Fed was expected to reiterate its accommodative stance after its meeting on Wednesday afternoon. On Tuesday, it said it would extend several lending facilities through year end, a sign the pandemic's economic impact has been longer than expected.
Another focus this week is results from Wall Street's trillion-dollar market value companies - Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) - as well as  Facebook Inc  (O:FB).
Of the S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings so far this quarter, about 80% surpassed significantly lowered forecasts for quarterly profit, according to Refinitiv IBES data, An average of 71% companies beat profit estimates over the past four quarters.

 Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) shares rose after it raised its full-year forecast on strong demand for cancer drugs and blood thinners. Late on Monday, the drugmaker announced a pivotal global study to evaluate a COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

748,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 04:20PM ET</span>",Nordic Fund Divests $45 Million From JBS on Amazon Concerns,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s top meat producer is starting to see blowback from investors over its approach to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) deforestation.
Nordea Asset Management said Tuesday it’s divesting from Brazil’s  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY) “over its ties to farms involved in Amazon deforestation” after a new report which suggest the meat giant has illegal ranchers indirectly in its supply chain.
“We have really seen quite disappointing performance across the environmental, social and governance spectrum“ of the company, Eric Pedersen, Nordea’s Head of Responsible Investment, said by email.
Nordea also cited JBS’s response to the Covid-19 outbreak and its past corruption scandals in Brazil.
JBS declined to comment on the divestment, but the company said it’s unfortunate Nordea didn’t contact the meat producer so that it could present all its actions and measures reinforcing its commitment to sustainability.
The company also reinforced its commitment to a supply chain that’s free of links to deforestation and said its governance standards have improved in recent years. Regarding the coronavirus outbreak, JBS said it has implemented a strong protocol for workers’ safety while ensuring continued production of food.
Amazon deforestation has surged in the past two years under the government of Jair Bolsonaro, who defends opening up the world’s largest rainforest to further agriculture and mining. Earlier this month, after foreign investors and companies expressed environmental concerns, the government decided to put a four-month ban on fires in the region. Still, Bolsonaro and his administration often put the blame on political opponents, alleging that they spread lies about deforestation, even though global scientists and experts attest to destruction of the ecosystem.
Funds With $3.7 Trillion Warn Brazil of Investor Backlash
Nordea, which has €230 billion ($270 billion) under management, had about $45 million invested in its JBS stake, and buy orders have been halted since last year, according to Pederson.
“The latest news on illegal cattle seems to just confirm” poor practices on the part of JBS, Pederson said in a reference to a story published Monday by The Guardian that linked the meat producer to an illegal cattle rancher as its indirect supplier.
Nordea is part of a group of institutional investors managing about $3.7 trillion in assets that have pressured Brazil to do more to protect the environment and protect the rights of indigenous groups in the Amazon.
The group wants to “make sure that the investors’ increasing emphasis on sustainability risk is understood,” Pederson said.

753,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 04:19PM ET</span>",Hong Kong Traders Love Chinese Firms Raising Funds at Home,"(Bloomberg) -- For Hong Kong’s Chinese companies, selling shares back home is a sure-fire way to boost their stock’s valuation.
The city’s investors are rewarding Chinese firms with plans to raise funds onshore. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. more than doubled in Hong Kong ahead of its Shanghai debut, while Geely Automobile Holdings (OTC:GELYF) Ltd. and Dongfeng Motor Group Co (OTC:DNFGF). have risen as much as 34% after saying they would sell shares on the mainland.
Chinese companies are increasingly looking at home to list as U.S.-China tensions have made a New York listing less desirable for some while reforms are boosting the attractiveness of mainland markets. There, stocks typically trade at higher valuations than in Hong Kong. The big recent gains in the city for Chinese firms planning domestic listings have the market betting on who may be next.
“Having an A-share listing is a clear trend and a big focus in the Hong Kong market,” said Kenny Wen, a strategist at Everbright Sun Hung Kai Co. “It’s an attractive option as it helps a company raise money for capital spending, increases a firm’s profile and could boost shares in Hong Kong.”
Investors and analysts are expecting companies with big capital demands, along with technology and health care firms, to be lured to raise funds onshore.
Here is a list of potential candidates discussed by analysts:
Telecom
The impact of mainland listing for Hong Kong shares of China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd. and China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) Corp. would be “debatable,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Hong Kong Ltd. analysts including Edison Lee wrote in a recent note. But SMIC’s deal “has created significant excitement,” while the premium that China United Network Communications Ltd. enjoys in Shanghai shows the possibilities.
China Mobile and China Telecom were listed in Hong Kong in 1997 and 2002, respectively. But they, and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) Hong Kong Ltd., all trade at less than their book value in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, United Network, a shareholder of Unicom, trades at 1.1 times book in Shanghai.
Health Care
China International Capital Corp. analysts have cited 11 health care firms traded in Hong Kong which meet the criteria to also have a mainland listing. They include WuXi Biologics (Cayman) Inc., Sino Biopharmaceutical Ltd. and Ping An Healthcare and Technology Co. All three stocks have been sharp outperformers this year, rising at least 39%.
Kingdee
Kingdee International Software Group Co. is also among the mainland listing candidates cited by CICC and Everbright Sun Hung Kai. “Its market cap meets the requirement and it has that capital demand,” said Wen of Everbright. Kingdee issued a profit warning this month, citing reasons including increasing investment in cloud-related products. Still, its shares have surged 147% this year.
Zhuzhou CRRC
Investors are speculating high-speed train manufacturer Zhuzhou CRRC Times Electric Co. could spin off some of its chip business and list it on the Star board, according to two traders who asked not to be named. Shares sharply underperformed last year in Hong Kong, skidding 35%. Revamping and expanding a chip-module production line was one of the company’s biggest investments last year, according to its annual report.

Investing.com – The Dow drifted lower on Tuesday, paced by declines in 3M and McDonald's following mixed second-quarter earnings results and signs the strength of consumer is on the wane.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.36%, the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.27% and the S&P 500 was flat%
Heavyweight Dow components 3M and McDonald’s came under pressure after delivering quarterly earnings that fell short of expectations, with both companies citing coronavirus-led weaknesses in results.
3M (NYSE:MMM) fell 4.7% after the manufacturer reported second-quarter earnings that fell short of expectations, as weakness in its transportation and health care businesses weighed.
McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) slipped 2.5% after its second-quarter earnings missed consensus estimates, as government measures to control the virus dented international sales.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) jumped 4% after delivering second-quarter results that beat on both the top and bottom lines as the drugmaker's sales of cancer and blood thinner drugs offset weaker sales of other drugs in its in portfolio.
As well as better-than-expected earnings, shares of Pfizer were boosted by an announcement that the company together with its partner  Biontech Se  (NASDAQ:BNTX) will launch a late late study of their potential Covid-19 vaccine.
The economic front, meanwhile, served as a reminder that the recent spike in cases across the U.S. has put the economic recovery in jeopardy as the consumer, the backbone of the economy, showed signs of weakness in July.
""It seems that reality is setting in for the consumer. In June, the expectations index was 106.1, but the index declined sharply to 91.5 in July as the hopes for a V-shaped recovery faded,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.

758,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 01:25PM ET</span>",Pfizer says it will charge other developed countries on par with U.S. for vaccine deals,"By Manas Mishra and Michael Erman
(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) on Tuesday said other developed countries would not get a lower price for its coronavirus vaccine than what it will charge the United States under a contract announced last week. 
The U.S. government agreed to pay nearly $2 billion to buy enough of a COVID-19 vaccine being developed by Pfizer and German biotech BioNTech SE (F:22UAy) to inoculate 50 million people at a price of $39 for a two-dose treatment course.
That deal likely set a global benchmark for vaccines at about the same price as a seasonal flu shot and could pressure other vaccine makers to set similar prices.
""All the countries that are developed right now will not receive a lower price for the same volume commitment than the U.S.,"" Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said on a conference call. 
Pfizer said the vaccine's price could change once the pandemic period ends, compared with its initial decision aimed at ensuring broadest access. 
Pfizer is one of many companies racing to bring COVID-19 vaccines to market, seen as essential to ending a pandemic that has claimed more than 655,000 lives globally.
Bourla told Reuters that Pfizer was in concurrent talks with the European Union and several of its member states on supplying them with the vaccine.
""We are negotiating with the EU because that would be much easier. But also we are having extensive discussions with several member states, just in case we can't find agreement with the EU,"" Bourla said.
BioNTech and Pfizer on Monday began a large, late-stage trial of one of their vaccine candidates to demonstrate its efficacy hours after  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) announced the start of a 30,000-subject trial of its vaccine using a different technology.
Bourla called an executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump last week that would tie what Medicare pays for drugs to lower prices in other countries “an enormous distraction at a time where the industry needs to be completely focused on developing a potential COVID-19 vaccine or treatment.”
The CEO said Pfizer could rethink U.S. expansion plans if the Trump order were to be implemented.
On Tuesday, Pfizer beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter profit by 12 cents a share and raised its full-year earnings forecast range by 3 cents, as the U.S. drugmaker predicted a recovery in vaccination rates and doctor visits after patients avoided treatments over coronavirus fears in the year's first half.
The company took a roughly $500 million hit to total sales in the second quarter as the drop in visits to hospitals and doctors' offices curtailed demand for several products. 
The impact was offset somewhat by demand for blood thinner Eliquis, which has been used to help treat COVID-19 patients.

Pfizer now expects 2020 adjusted profit of $2.28 to $2.38 per share. Pfizer shares rose 4% to $39.07.

LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan's (N:JPM)'s development finance institution has structured its first deal, a $250 million five-year green bond for a power firm in Georgia, as it targets $100 billion for development projects annually, executives say.
The deal for Georgia Global Utilities, to be settled on Thursday, is the first where that arm of the bank has been named development finance structuring agent.
Adding developmental finance and green funding to the deal, meaning capital is raised to support economic development and environmental projects, helped entice a broader range of investors, said Stefan Weiler, head of Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa debt capital markets at JPMorgan.
""If we hadn't, this deal would have been trickier and may not have happened at all,"" he told Reuters.
JPMorgan in January launched its development institution through which it aims to fund more than $100 billion annually in development activities from investment banking deals, with extra contributions from its markets businesses.
""We're seeing debt capital market deals and export finance deals among other types of transaction,"" said Faheen Allibhoy, managing director of the bank's development finance institution.
""Our pipeline is diverse, including from financial institutions in Africa, an infrastructure project in the Middle East, a renewable energy project in Latin America, and transport-related in Asia.""

From the investor side, the bank was seeing a lot of demand from development finance institutions as anchor investors, non-traditional investors with a green or environmental, social and governance (ESG) focus, as well as large bond houses with pools dedicated to emerging markets and, increasingly ESG, she said.

Investing.com - Omnicom Group (NYSE:OMC) slipped 5.5% on Tuesday after revenue missed estimates, and it doesn’t seem like things are going to improve any time soon.
Omnicom reported second quarter sales of $2.8 billion compared to the $2.96 billion expected by analysts tracked by Investing.com. Earnings per share of 92 cents beat the estimate of 81 cents.
Shares of Omnicom have dropped 28% since the start of the year.
The New York-based company said clients reduced or planned to reduce their demand for Omnicom’s services, resulting in lower revenue in the first quarter. That should continue through the rest of 2020, the company said in a statement. “Such reductions in revenue could adversely impact our ongoing results of operations and financial position and the effects could be material,” Omnicom said.
The company pointed to industries including travel, lodging and entertainment, energy and oil and gas, non-essential retail, and automotive as those that have cut, postponed, or reduced marketing communication expenditures.
Healthcare and pharmaceuticals, technology and telecommunications, financial services, and consumer products companies have “fared relatively well to date,” but “conditions are volatile and economic uncertainty cuts across all clients, industries and geographies.”
“Demand for our services can be expected to decline as marketers reduce expenditures in the short term due to the uncertain impact of the pandemic on the global economy,” the company said."

Since the heavy equipment maker is considered a bellwether for global economic activity, signals such as an earnings guidance or resumption of share repurchases should reassure Wall Street about underlying business conditions.
Caterpillar's profit is expected to plunge 77% year-on-year to 64 cents a share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue is estimated to decline 35% to $9.38 billion.
The Deerfield, Illinois-based company has not yet provided new earnings guidance after it withdrew the 2020 outlook in late March citing uncertainty about the pandemic. To preserve cash, share repurchases have been suspended.
A recovery in machine retail sales in Asia and slowing sales declines in other regions have raised hopes that the worst is over for the construction and mining equipment maker.
Easing coronavirus restrictions in the United States should also aid the sales recovery. Underscoring the optimism, the company's stock has gained 34% since mid-May, outperforming the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI.>.
Elizabeth Vermillion, an analyst at CFRA, recently upgraded Caterpillar's shares to 'Buy' as she expects its revenues to top analysts' estimates in 2020 and 2021. Vermillion says an earnings guidance will put investors at ease.
However, a resurgence in coronavirus cases in the United States as well as a second wave of infections in Asia and Europe have raised the risk of fresh lockdowns which could derail the nascent recovery in equipment demand.

Separately, renewed tensions between the United States and China could weigh on Caterpillar's business in the world's second largest economy where it faces stiff competition from local players. China accounts for up to 10% of the company's sales.

769,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 11:27AM ET</span>",Banks Balk at Compensation for Rate 'Big Bang' Losses,"(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.,  Deutsche Bank  AG (NYSE:DB) and  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. are among banks telling clients they won’t compensate them for trades that lose value during the “big bang” transition sweeping through Europe’s interest-rate derivatives market.
Banco Santander SA (NYSE:SAN) and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) SA also won’t reimburse for losses on so-called swaption trades caused by a change in how the industry prices these deals, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named discussing private information. Swaptions are derivatives that give the owner the right to buy an interest-rate swap in the future.
Lenders are responding to an overhaul that wiped millions of euros off some swaptions portfolios this week and will be closely watched in the U.S., where banks await similar changes due in October.
Banks Scramble to Cut Derivatives Losses on Eve of Market Reset
Banks and money managers had been racing to cement gains and avoid losses before the shift from the Eonia benchmark to the new euro short-term rate. The benchmark is used to help value hundreds of billions of euros of swaption contracts.
The firms expressed concern about a recommendation from a European Central Bank-backed committee to make voluntary payments following the switchover on Monday. JPMorgan told clients the process needed to be contractually enforceable, while Nomura said there was no market consensus on how to address the problem. These banks also won’t receive compensation if they have lost out.
Nomura said it was concerned about inconsistencies and “cherry picking,” with participants taking different approaches to voluntary compensation. The bank told clients in a letter that it would keep its policy under review. Nomura spokeswoman Aoife Reynolds confirmed the contents of the letter but declined to comment further.
JPMorgan told clients before the switchover it recognized the advantages of compensation, provided this complied with fiduciary and general corporate obligations.
“We remain open to finding a solution that would allow for compensation to be exchanged in a workable way, prior to July 24,” JPMorgan said in a letter, which Patrick Burton, a spokesman for the bank, confirmed was genuine. “If no acceptable solution is reached by that date, we will, as a default position, adhere to the existing terms of the contracts that we have in place with our clients.”
Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) will simply honor the terms of the original swaption contracts, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named given the sensitivity. The bank knew the compensation program would only work if the majority of those involved took part, and it became clear in the last few weeks that this wouldn’t happen, the person said.
An ECB spokesman declined to comment and referred to the working group’s recommendation, which said market feedback had not produced a preferred option or even a consensus about the scope of swaption contracts to be compensated.
Not everyone is ruling out redress. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). aims to accommodate payment requests to the extent the lender can recover the funds from counterparties on related market hedges, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named given the sensitivity.
‘World Peace’
Priya Misra, head of global rates strategy at TD Securities in New York, said she was unsurprised some had declined to pay.
“I think of it like world peace,” she said. “Voluntary compensation needs both sides to agree to work, otherwise the compensating party is worse off. Also it is an OTC market, so who decides if you and your counterparty disagree on the amount?”
Pension funds and insurers are more likely to have in-the-money legacy receiver swaps and therefore gain from the switch, she said, while their counterparties could lose out.
“If even a few large dealers opt out of compensation, it reduces competitive pressure on others and can ‘allow’ others to opt out,” she said, adding that if banks take the same approach in the much larger U.S. swaption market, it would have a “significant profit and loss impact” for many participants.
Firms won’t decide against compensation lightly, said Suzanna Brunton, a managing associate at Linklaters LLP in Paris. Relevant factors are likely to include the need to treat counterparties consistently and the lack of clarity around how to calculate payments, she said.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:
“There is no legal parachute for the dealers on the losing side. Selective compensation is far from ideal as you may end up paying some counterparties but not receiving from others. It may end up being only a limited amount of banks participate, if any.”
-- Tanvir Sandhu, Chief Global Derivatives Strategist
The ECB began phasing in ESTR last October, and the benchmark will fully replace Eonia, which is still linked to more than 100 trillion euros of financial instruments, in early 2022. Regulators prefer ESTR because it’s underpinned by more robust trading, making it a truer reflection of the cost of capital and less susceptible to corruption.

(Reuters) - The collapse of global air travel has stopped  General Electric  Co's (N:GE) turnaround plan in its tracks and the company will have to convince investors on Wednesday that it is on course to reduce cash burn through the rest of 2020.
The manufacturing icon has predicted a cash outflow of between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion for the second quarter, following a $2.2 billion outflow in the first quarter, as the crisis halts orders and deliveries for clients across the aviation business. 
Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said in May the company would do better in the second half of 2020 while admitting that for the full year it would be in negative territory on cashflow. 
If GE does not stop haemorrhaging in the next two quarters, however, Wall Street analysts will be forced to revise their current estimate of an outflow of $2.5 billion for the year to a far bigger number.
GE's ability to generate cash has been one of its strengths historically and particularly for manufacturers is viewed as a good indicator of a company's performance and ability to grow its business. 
""COVID-19 overnight stalled GE's turnaround,"" said Nicholas Heymann, industrial analyst at brokers William Blair.
""It's not a sinking boat but it is sitting dead in the water. (The) job for the rest of the year is to get it out of the water.""
The pandemic has brought global travel to a virtual halt and execerbated troubles for a once high-flying aviation unit that was already struggling with the grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s 737 MAX planes, for which it provides engines.
Added to that, several large U.S. power plants with banks of GE generators are halting or deferring maintenance due to quarantines and lockdowns, threatening to squeeze revenue that the company was counting on to help lift profits.
Together, aviation and power normally make up the bulk of GE's quarterly revenue. 
""Larry said a year ago he is managing the company for free cash flow,"" said RBC Capital Markets Deane Dray, who forecasts free cash flow at a negative $3.8 billion for the quarter. 
""(For the market) it all depends on how well GE performs within their own FCF guidance and what is the explanation of the variances."" 
Healthcare is the only bright spot currently, with demand for ventilators, X-ray machines and other equipment expected to boost profit.
Wolfe Research analyst Nigel Coe expects the aviation business to lose $200 million to $300 million in the second-quarter.

""Given the nature of GE's business, FCF is normally very strong in the second-half of the year and we will be looking for confidence if that's still the case,"" Coe said.

(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) on Tuesday reported a broad drop in global same-store sales and missed profit expectations, as its restaurants were shut due to the COVID-19 pandemic, limiting operations to only drive-thru and delivery.
Shares of the Chicago-based burger chain sank more than 2.5%.
Global same-store sales fell 23.9% in the second quarter, dragged down by big international markets including the United Kingdom, France and Latin America. 
Analysts had forecast a 23.24% fall, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
In the United States, where the company operates more than a third of its restaurants, same-restaurant sales fell 8.7% but were better than the anticipated 9.97% fall, as most locations were able to stay open with drive-thru and delivery options.
On a conference call with investors, executives struck a cautious tone but noted that U.S. July sales have improved and should end ""slightly positive"" for the full month.
The second quarter ""represents the trough in our performance as McDonald's has learned to adjust our operations to this new environment,"" Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski said.
Restaurants struggled to cope with the changing dynamics and consumer behaviors around the health crisis, forcing them to simplify menus and shift largely to online and mobile orders for pickup, delivery and drive-thru. 
As lockdowns eased, sales improved and losses were not as bad, providing some optimism for a measured rebound.
About 96% of McDonald's locations are operating with drive-thru, delivery or reduced seating capacity. 
The company plans an advertising push in the second half of the year, having ""amassed a sizeable marketing war chest,"" Kempczinski said.
It had cut spending on U.S. marketing 70% in the second quarter to ""conserve resources"" but will now reinvest that money.
Most of that will promote core menu items and digital ordering, though some menu innovation is planned.
The company also expects to collect during the second half of the year the majority of rent it had deferred from franchisees.
McDonald's also sees a chance to grow in Europe, where ""some independent restaurant units ... are having some bigger challenges, which may present some further opportunities for us.""
Revenue fell 30.5% to $3.76 billion but beat the estimate of $3.68 billion.

Net income fell 68% to $483.8 million. Excluding one-time items, McDonald's earned 66 cents per share, 8 cents below expectations.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) must soon find a solution for its struggling steel unit and say how it will spend the 17.2 billion euros ($20.2 billion) in proceeds from the sale of its elevator division, a top-20 investor said.
""There has to be a solution for steel in the near term. It would be good if there was clarity until the next annual general meeting,"" said Ingo Speich, head of sustainability and corporate governance at Deka Investment, Thyssenkrupp's 11th-largest shareholder, who has been an outspoken critic of Thyssenkrupp's performance in the past.
Speich's remarks come ahead of the deal's closing, which sources say is expected on Friday.
Thyssenkrupp's next AGM is scheduled for Feb. 5, 2021.
The group has said it might sell, keep or merge its steel division with a peer, with  Salzgitter  (DE:SZGG),  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC), SSAB  and Baoshan Iron & Steel (SS:600019) all considered potential partners, sources have said.
""Completely divesting steel will be difficult,"" Speich said, adding a joint venture or merger with a peer would be the most likely options.
""Time is against Thyssenkrupp and in favour of its peers,"" Speich said.
The sale of elevators to a consortium of Advent, Cinven (CINV.UL) and Germany's RAG foundation will effectively hand Thyssenkrupp a financial lifeline to turn around its other business units, which range from car parts to submarines.
But the group has signalled that most of the proceeds will be used up by cutting down debt, paying off pension liabilities and for offsetting business lost thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, leaving little to fund future projects.
One of the people said that less than 2 billion euros might be available to invest in growth.
Thyssenkrupp's shareholders are not expected to get a share either, Speich said: ""The company needs every cent.""

Thyssenkrupp declined to comment.

Americans with jobs have been eager to move away from densely packed cities and apartment buildings, and the drop in borrowing costs to a record low in the quarter widened the pool of potential buyers.
“Mortgage rates are the icing on the cake for households that were thinking about buying,” said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist for Haus, a co-investment platform for homebuyers. “They found an unexpected opportunity during the worst economic downturn America has seen since the Great Depression.”

777,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 09:55AM ET</span>",A trading tool that's transforming the $10 trillion-plus corporate bond market,"By Dhara Ranasinghe and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - Expectations of a borrowing deluge from corporates globally are turning bond market attention to a little-known tool that's already helping smooth trading of illiquid debt the way exchange-traded funds (ETFs) did years ago.
The innovation, known as portfolio trading, involves bundling several bonds into a single package to trade. Once unwieldy and time-consuming, tech innovation is rapidly turning it mainstream.
More significantly, the strategy may have earned its stripes during the coronavirus-linked market mayhem.
During volatile times, trading in corporate bonds and other risky assets can dry up, forcing sellers to slash prices. But market participants have reported several instances when even debt from stricken hospitality and travel firms, packaged into bond portfolios, smoothly changed hands.
Cumulative portfolio trading volumes globally on bond trading platform Tradeweb topped $100 billion in June, rising from just over $2 billion when it launched portfolio trading for U.S. investment grade and high yield bonds in January 2019. The cumulative total was almost $51 billion in January 2020.
It executed 54 portfolio trades in Europe in March, versus 19 in February and 15 in January. 
""We have been doing (portfolio trading) a lot more since March and that's because it reduces the size of the outright risk associated with a one-way trade on a single bond,"" said David Arnaud, a fixed income fund manager at Canada Life Investments. 
In a portfolio trade, an asset manager picks a basket of securities to buy or sell, then analyses them on various metrics such as liquidity, inclusion in ETFs and transaction size.
Once constructed, an order is sent, either directly to counterparties or over trading platforms, which quote a price reflecting the value of all the securities the portfolio contains.
For some, this complements fixed-income ETFs which allow investors to trade baskets of securities simultaneously.
But a portfolio trade can make liquidity pools available to a wider array of bonds, even those not in ETFs. It can be useful for investors who want, for instance, to trade off a single factor such as duration or credit agency ratings. 
The tool proved handy for Andrew Falco, global head of FX and fixed income trading at Fidelity International. Seeking higher exposure to longer-maturity debt, Falco's team used it for a ""very decent sized transaction"", he said.
TIME, COST, REGULATION
The trend is gathering speed in world corporate bond markets, worth more than $10 trillion. Robert Simnick, credit portfolio specialist at Invesco Asset Management, told a recent conference he had executed nearly 130 portfolio trades in the last two years, with about 100 bonds in each.
""There were a couple of guys doing this last year and now I have a whole portfolio trading chatroom dedicated to this kind of trading,"" Simnick added.
A survey of 49 European investors by consultancy Greenwich Associates found 40% planned to execute portfolio trades in the coming year or had recently done so.
Technology has allowed the trend to gather speed by computerising a process that previously relied on spreadsheets and manually inputting data. In an electronic format, a portfolio trade becomes a much easier ""workflow"" for a dealer because the bonds are already in the system and can be grouped together more easily than was previously the case.
Mehmet Mazi, global head of debt trading and financing at HSBC, said pricing and transacting several hundred bonds now takes just a couple of minutes. 
""The first portfolio trade we did a few years ago took three weeks because we didn't have the technology, we had to do it manually,"" Mazi said. 
The strategy, like others, isn't perfect. Some traders said it stalled at the height of the March turmoil, when even the highly liquid U.S. Treasury market and ETFs were seizing up.
But several factors may drive its growth. 
For one, corporate borrowing is soaring, with companies likely to take on $1 trillion of new debt this year, Janus Henderson predicts. 
Guy America, global head of credit trading at JP Morgan, expects the tool to grow with the underlying market. 
Then there's regulation, more specifically MiFID II rules requiring post-trade transparency and proof of best execution. 
Chioma Okoye, European credit product manager at Tradeweb, said an asset manager can ask up to three dealers to quote a package price for their portfolio. All quoted prices, for the package and per bond, are shown on Tradeweb, making it easy to prove ""best execution"" to clients.

Finally, Kenneth Monahan, a senior market analyst at Greenwich Associates, said estimates suggest investors using portfolio trading can cut execution costs roughly in half. ""I believe that credit portfolio trading will have profound effects on market structure,"" he said.

778,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 09:44AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Opens Lower Ahead of Tough Talks Over Stimulus,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Tuesday as investors turned cautious ahead of what's likely to be a tense few days of negotiations over the next round of measures to support the U.S. economy through the Covid-19 pandemic.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 93 points, or 0.4%, at 26,492 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4%. 
Senate Republicans outlined their proposals on Monday, with a sticker price of around $1 trillion. That leaves a big gap to bridge with the $3.5 trillion package of measures that has already passed the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives. Two of the thorniest differences between the plans are the Republicans' intention to cut the current enhancement of unemployment benefits by two-thirds from the start of October, and the Democrats' insistence of $900 billion of funds for state and municipal governments. 
Analysts warned that the proposed cuts could hit consumer spending, which accounts for the bulk of the U.S. economy, in more than one way. ""Obviously, those out of work will experience a fall in income,"" said Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management, in a morning briefing. ""Those in work may experience an increase in fear of the consequences of unemployment. If fear does increase, the $1,200 (that is currently being distributed) would likely be saved rather than spent.
The major indexes suffered from a slew of mostly underwhelming earnings releases, notably from McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and industrial giant 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), although the majority still managed to engineer the usual positive earnings surprise. McDonald's stock fell 1.4%, while 3M stock fell 4.5%. However, JetBlue stock pared early losses to be up 0.7%, despite the airline reporting a wider-than-expected loss and giving a downbeat outlook for the rest of the year.
Confidence remained the watchword after the Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell by more than expected in July, dropping to 92.6 from 98.3 in June.
One of the most prominent gainers was Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock, which rose 2.0% after the pharma giant said its second-quarter earnings fell by less than expected in the three months through June, despite the fact that the pandemic had stopped its sales force from visiting healthcare professionals, and had also delayed demand for many of its medicines by disrupting hospital schedules.
 Pfizer  and its German partner BioNTech on Monday announced the start of a hybride phase 2/3 clinical test of their candidate vaccine for treating Covid-19.  Moderna  also announced the start of a phase 3 trial for its drug. Phase 3 tests are typically the last before a company seeks regulatory approval for a drug.
BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock rose 0.7% while Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock rose 3.7%.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) on Tuesday reported an unexpected quarterly loss due to disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, sending its shares sliding 4% in pre-market trade.
It also unveiled a strategy that includes streamlining product portfolio and shifting resources and investments in markets with growth potential as part of new Chief Executive Jochen Zeitz's strategy to turn around the 117-year-old motorcycle company that has been grappling with an aging customer base.
The Milwaukee-based company reported a loss of 60 cents per share for the quarter through June, compared with a profit of $1.23 per share a year ago. Analysts had on average expected the profit to come in at 4 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Motorcycles and related products revenue dived 53% year-on-year to $669 million, hurt by the temporary suspension of production during the quarter due to lockdowns to curb the spread of the virus.
The company's shares were trading down 4.9% at $27.85 in pre-market hours. 
Harley has been struggling for years to woo younger riders in the United States, its biggest market, to reduce reliance on baby boomers, who drove sales for decades. The pandemic has exacerbated its challenges.
In the latest quarter, retail sales in the United States plunged 27% year-on-year, the steepest fall in at least six years.
In response to weak demand, the company has tightened supplies and cut production. This reduced global dealer inventory by 32% during the quarter and drove up prices for pre-owned bikes which used to be a drag on new bike sales.
Zeitz, who took the reins in February, plans to focus on 50 markets in North America, Europe and parts of Asia Pacific, and shrink planned motorcycle models by about 30%. 

His strategy will eliminate 700 positions, but is estimated to result in annual savings of about $100 million.

781,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 08:10AM ET</span>","Small Business Focus: Care Bears boost Florida toy importer, but he needs $10 million right away","By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Florida's Basic Fun has seen a sharp pickup in business since coronavirus shutdowns started lifting in May, but the toy importer needs more cash to buy goods for the Christmas shopping season.
Overall sales for the year may be down just 10% from 2019's $150 million, Chief Executive Jay Foreman predicts, half his May estimate https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-smallbusiness/a-florida-toy-importer-braces-for-retail-upheaval-idUSKBN23217T and a remarkable improvement from April, when he saw a 30% decline for the year. 
That's because the toy importer's sales to big retailers such as Walmart Inc (N:WMT),  Target  Corp (N:TGT) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) are up over 20% year-on-year. Basic Fun is one of millions of U.S. small businesses facing an uncertain future during the coronavirus pandemic. Reuters is tracking the progress of several of these companies in months to come. 
Toys are part of the ""stay at home culture,"" Foreman said. In particular, Care Bears, a retro product line of cuddly collectibles first popular in the 1980s, are ""selling like crazy,"" he said, and could mean a strong holiday season. 
""In a crisis like this, it is a perfect product to hit the market,"" he said.
There is one problem, though - Basic Fun needs $10 million, immediately, to order more bears and other products for the holidays from manufacturers. 
Normally, Foreman would turn to banks, but his revolving credit facilities are based on trailing and projected earnings, and he can't make solid projections. Meanwhile, about 20% of customers, like amusement parks, are still closed, and some customers are late paying Basic Fun.
The business uncertainty is making it difficult to decide how and when to bring back the 22 workers, who were furloughed in April.
A $2.4 million federal Payroll Protection Program loan helped Foreman pay salaries and rent, but did little to address his liquidity problem.
He was banking on the U.S. Federal Reserve's mid-sized business lending program to tide over the company. But top banks are shunning the program, and the banks that are involved are mostly serving existing customers, Foreman said. 
He is negotiating with vendors for extended payment terms and has asked banks for an asset-backed loan instead.
STATE FAIRS SHUTTERED 
Even if he does get the capital, Foreman's next concern is that his cash could be locked up in unshipped or unsold inventory if continued spread of the coronavirus in the United States results in fresh lockdowns. 
""I probably spend 20% of my day thinking about COVID-19,"" Foreman said, and another percentage of the day on finance related issues. 
At least 32 states have reported record increases in cases in July and 16 states have reported a record increase in deaths during the month, according to a Reuters tally https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-usa-idCNL2N2ET0NB. 
Meanwhile, Texas and California are among the states that have reimposed some restrictions, and canceled events. The State Fair of Texas, the country's largest, normally draws over two million visitors and sells Basic Fun merchandise. It has been postponed https://bigtex.com/about-us/faq until 2021. 
State fairs, carnivals and amusement parks normally account for one-fifth of Basic Fun's sales. 
Basic Fun needs more hands to manage the current orders, and to work on the product lines for next year. Any addition to the headcount, however, would inflate the salary bill and increase its capital needs.

""Everybody is concerned what happens if there is another lockdown in the fourth quarter,"" Foreman said. ""That is a big unknown.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The negative impact of currency fluctuations on North American companies' first-quarter results rose from the preceding quarter but was well below its year-ago level, according to data from treasury and financial management firm Kyriba on Tuesday.
The collective exchange rate impact, including on companies in the United States, Canada and Mexico, was $10.77 billion, compared with the $7.99 billion negative effect in the fourth quarter of 2019, Kyriba said in a report.
The results show ""a small, but increasing upward trend after a three-quarter decline in headwinds,"" according to strategists at Kyriba.
The first-quarter level, though, was well below the $23.39 billion negative effect in the first quarter of 2019.
Kyriba, which acquired currency risk consulting firm FIREapps last year, said 267 North American companies reported negative currency impacts in the first quarter, up from 233 in the fourth quarter.
The U.S. dollar index (=USD) rose 2.6% in the first quarter of this year but has been weakening more recently and many strategists see further weakness ahead.
The dollar fell to an almost two-year low against the euro on Monday on concerns about the growing number of coronavirus cases in the United States and ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting this week when it is expected to confirm its commitment to rock-bottom interest rates.

A weaker dollar makes overseas sales more valuable when converted back into U.S. currency.

783,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 07:54AM ET</span>",Eskom CEO Enters Danger Zone in Bid to Fix Debt-Stricken Utility,"(Bloomberg) --
Andre de Ruyter, the chief executive officer of South Africa’s debt-stricken state power utility, is navigating a political minefield as he collects overdue debt, reduces electricity theft and bolsters revenue.
Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. this month seized the bank accounts of its biggest defaulter -- the Maluti-a-Phofung municipality that owes it 5.3 billion rand ($321 million) -- and scaled back supplies to areas where many residents have illegal connections to the grid. It previously clashed with the country’s energy regulator over tariff increases, and suspended contracts with coal and renewable-energy vendors after electricity demand plummeted amid a coronavirus lockdown.
The utility supplies about 95% of the power used in Africa’s most industrialized economy and isn’t generating enough cash to cover its operating expenses and interest payments on 454 billion rand of debt. Efforts to reorganize the loans and split the company into three units to make it more manageable have made slow progress, exacerbating the need to shore up its income.
“Inevitably tough decisions have now to be taken to implement debt recovery and to send a message to errant municipalities that they must now get their financial house in order,” said Raymond Parsons (NYSE:PSN), a professor at North-West University’s Business School in Potchefstroom, west of Johannesburg. “This will not be popular and there may be political fallout. We must assume that De Ruyter has the necessary backing to be doing what he is.”
Municipal Debts
Local authorities, most of which are controlled by the ruling African National Congress and have been dogged by mismanagement and a lack of funds, owed Eskom 30.9 billion rand at the end of June. The party hasn’t commented on Eskom’s seizure of the municipality’s accounts, but President Cyril Ramaphosa has said payment boycotts are unacceptable.
Previous attempts by Eskom to cut off some township customers who didn’t pay their bills have sparked violent street protests. The utility demonstrated it’s aware of the sensitivities of taking a hard line at the weekend, when it conceded to releasing 90 million rand to Maluti-a-Phofung to enable it to pay salaries and other costs. Calls to its mayor’s office weren’t answered.
Eskom seizes defaulting customers’ assets as a last resort when other legal options have been exhausted, and reduces supply to areas where there are illegal connections to protect its infrastructure and avoid explosions, De Ruyter, who took up his post in January, said in an emailed response to questions.
Asked if the company consulted with the government or sought its permission before embarking on such action, he said: “Eskom is an autonomous agency of the government, whose mandate is to ensure the reliable supply of electricity.”
Lengthy Process
Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, who oversees Eskom, and his spokesman, Sam Mkokeli, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Fixing Eskom will be a lengthy process and will have to go beyond collecting overdue debt and disconnecting customers, according to Jones Gondo, a credit analyst at Nedbank Group Ltd. He expects there will be more clarity on whether a turnaround is possible when Eskom is split into generation, distribution and transmission units that separately disclose their revenue and costs.
Investors appear increasingly confident that Eskom will secure sufficient state support to meet its commitments. The premium they demand to hold its 2026 rand bonds rather than government securities has narrowed 14 basis points since the beginning of January to 104 as of July 27.

784,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 07:41AM ET</span>",Hydrogen champion Hyundai races to electric as Tesla takes off,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) -  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380), an early backer of hydrogen cars, has watched the electric rise of Tesla, including on its home turf. Now's it's going on the offensive in the battery-powered market led by its U.S. rival.
The South Korean company plans to introduce two production lines dedicated to electrics vehicles (EVs), one next year and another in 2024, according to an internal union newsletter seen by Reuters. 
Euisun Chung, leader of the Hyundai Motor Group conglomerate that also includes Kia Motors, has also held a series of meetings since May with his counterparts at Samsung (KS:005930), LG and SK Group, which make batteries and electronic parts.
The purpose of the talks, which were publicly announced, was for Hyundai to try to secure batteries at a time of tight supply as the race for EVs intensifies, according to several industry sources. Those manufacturers also supply the likes of Tesla (O:TSLA), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and GM (N:GM). 
Hyundai told Reuters it was collaborating with Korean battery suppliers ""to scale up"" its electric car production efficiently. It declined to comment on any plans to introduce dedicated production lines.
Samsung, LG and SK declined to comment. 
The moves indicate the carmaker is moving aggressively to expand its electric capacity, days after Chung announced on July 14 that Hyundai Motor Group aimed to sell 1 million battery EVs a year and grab a global market share of over 10% by 2025. 
There's some way to go; Hyundai Motor Group sold 86,434 battery EVs last year, according to data from industry consultant LMC Automotive. That was above the 73,278 sold by Volkswagen Group but behind the 367,500 delivered by Tesla. 
Hyundai, the world's No.5 automaker together with Kia Motors (KS:000270), said its agility allowed it to lead the charge into EVs. ""We are certain Hyundai is never going to fall behind,"" it added.
NO KODAK MOMENT
A senior Hyundai insider, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the company had not been concerned about Tesla when the Silicon Valley company was producing high-end cars. 
But it became more worried when Tesla brought out a cheaper Model 3 in 2017, according to the insider who described it as a ""strategic victory"".
No traditional automaker has been successful yet in catching up with Tesla, which retains an edge in battery and software technology. 
Hyundai could also face a roadblock from its powerful union, which is worried about job security as EVs require fewer components and workers than gasoline vehicles; at Hyundai, this is partly because the automaker makes a number of key components for conventional cars in-house, while many EV parts are outsourced at present. 
The union is pushing for the company to assemble key EV components, like battery packs and motors, in-house to offset any reduction in workforce.
""We are not opposed to EV business. Kodak went bankrupt because it stuck to film even as the industry was shifting to digital photography,"" union spokesman Kwon Oh-kook told Reuters.
""We just want to protect the jobs of our members,"" he said. 
Hyundai said automakers and unions needed to accelerate change to remain viable in the long term.
HYDROGEN V ELECTRIC
Back in 2010, Hyundai Motor Co made 230 electric cars for the government, but they ended up being mothballed at a research center outside Seoul due to a lack of charging infrastructure, according to Lee Hyun-soon, R&D chief at the time. 
In a 2014 book Lee, who developed South Korea's first gasoline engines, said such electric vehicles were ""not realistic"", also citing high battery costs, and that hydrogen cars - a rival clean technology - offered a ""bright"" future. 
Along with Toyota (T:7203) and Nikola (O:NKLA), Hyundai was one of a few automakers to have backed hydrogen cars. It launched the industry's first mass-produced hydrogen car, Tucson Fuel Cell, in 2013 and the NEXO in 2018. 
However the technology has not taken off; 7,707 hydrogen fuel cell cars were sold globally last year, compared with 1.68 million battery EVs, according to LMC Automotive.
In Hyundai's home market, Tesla had its best month in June, with its Model 3 beating Hyundai's Kona EV, as well as premium models from BMW and Audi.
""Hyundai did not expect Tesla to dominate the EV market so quickly,"" another person familiar with the company's thinking told Reuters. 
Hyundai Motor Co has a market capitalization of about 25.3 trillion won ($21.2 billion) - less than a tenth of that of Tesla, now the world's most valuable automaker. 
While Hyundai promotes its hydrogen cars with K-pop boyband BTS, it only plans to introduce up to two hydrogen models by 2025, and 23 battery-powered models. 
Peter Hasenkamp, vice president at electric startup Lucid, who previously worked at Tesla and Ford, said established carmakers faced historical ""inertia"" to make the EV transition.
""Part of the reason we're based in Silicon Valley is to leverage both software and electrical engineering expertise,"" Hasenkamp told Reuters.

""You've got a couple of generations for the big car companies to learn really how to do this well. It is a lot harder than they thought it was.""

LONDON (Reuters) - More than half of sovereign wealth funds responding to a new survey expect a U-shaped recovery in the global economy from the COVID-19 crisis, with developed markets likely to be best placed to recover.
But while 58.3% of respondents to the poll by International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF) and Invesco expected a U-shaped rebound, most appeared to agree there would be a longer period of slower growth ahead, reflecting uncertainties about factors such as fresh waves of infections and government support packages. 
A total of 29.2% of respondents said they expected a W-shaped recovery. Only 8.3% foresaw a V-shaped one.
The survey of 24 IFSWF members was completed last month.
More than 60% of those responding believed that developed markets were best positioned to return to pre-COVID trend growth after the pandemic-induced recession. Fewer than half expected emerging markets to recover best.
Still, respondents backed China as the best-placed major economy to recover. That probably reflected an expectation that China was hit by the pandemic first and had generally handled it better, its economy may be more responsive to government stimulus efforts, IFSWF and Invesco said.
About a third of respondents expected the Chinese yuan to raise its share of global official foreign-exchange reserves, as well as its share in trade invoicing. 
A total of 86% of those surveyed felt China would continue to open its economy, enabling freer trade and investment opportunities.
But sovereign investors retained their faith in U.S. dollar assets -- 71% agreed the dollar would offer the most attractive investment destination for equity and 58% believed dollar-denominated bonds would be the best-performing debt securities.

788,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 07:01AM ET</span>",Jaguar Land Rover names ousted Renault boss as CEO,"By Costas Pitas
LONDON (Reuters) - Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) (NS:TAMO) has picked ousted  Renault  boss Thierry Bollore as its next chief executive, with a mission to return Britain's biggest carmaker to profit after a big hit from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Bollore took over at Renault (PA:RENA) in January 2019 after the fall of Carlos Ghosn, but was always viewed a close to the French carmaker's long-time boss and was pushed out in October when it looked for a fresh start.
Bollore will take over at JLR on Sept. 10, replacing Ralf Speth, whose tenure ends after more than 10 years. 
""It will be my privilege to lead this fantastic company through what continues to be the most testing time of our generation,"" Bollore said in a statement on Tuesday.
JLR was hit this year first by disruption to sales in China and then by lockdowns across Europe and North America as the COVID-19 outbreak spread around the globe. 
In 2019, it cut jobs to address tumbling diesel sales, which helped it return to profit. But as the pandemic struck, it slumped to a pretax loss of 422 million pounds ($543 million) for the year ended March 31, 2020.
The company has already taken steps to tackle the crisis, including agreeing a loan facility of around $700 million with lenders in China and further staff reductions.
It is also in talks with the British government over potential support, according to media reports. 
Bollore takes over a business that built just over 500,000 cars in 2019/20. He faces a number of tasks, including how to handle the Jaguar brand, which underperforms the Land Rover marque, how quickly to electrify its lineup and a potential hit from Brexit if trade barriers are imposed.
JLR has a partnership with BMW on electrification and parent company  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM) recently recommitted to the company.
""Tata Group recognises and values Jaguar Land Rover's future potential highly,"" said JLR Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran earlier this month. 

""That is why this company is central to our global automotive presence – a presence that we intend to develop for years to come.""

McDonald’s announced earnings per share of $0.65 on revenue of $3.76 billion, while analysts had expected EPS of $0.74 on revenue of $3.7 billion.
At 7:21 AM ET (1121 GMT), shares traded 2.1% lower premarket.
""Our strong drive-thru presence and the investments we've made in delivery and digital over the past few years have served us well through these uncertain times. We saw continued improvement in our results throughout the second quarter as markets reopened around the world,"" said McDonald's President and Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski.
As of June 30, 2020, nearly all McDonald's restaurants around the world were open to serve customers.That said, global comparable sales declined 23.9% in the quarter, with same-store sales outside of American dropping 41%. The U.S. reported a comparatively healthy drop of only 8.7% in same-store sales.
""McDonald’s business outlook remains uncertain due to the economic downturn and risk of a second wave of infections. In this environment, it’s unlikely that the management can offer much visibility. Traffic at stores will continue to suffer while the food-chain will have to adjust quickly to serve customers and improve profit,"" said Haris Anwar, an analyst at Investing.com.
""One area which can improve the sales outlook is the chain’s ability to bring back popular menu items which were discontinued due to the pandemic. Also, revival of the chain’s all-day breakfast is crucial to revive sales.""
McDonald’s shares are up 1% from the beginning of the year , still down 9.32% from its 52 week high of $221.93 set on August 9, 2019. They are outperforming the S&P 500 which is up 0.27% from the start of the year.

LONDON (Reuters) - European Union rules that punish failures to settle bond trades could be delayed again until February 2022 because of the pandemic, the bloc's securities watchdog said on Tuesday.
The so-called settlement discipline regime includes cash penalties for fails, and the start date had already been pushed back from November to February next year due to market disruption from COVID-19 hampering preparations.
Settlement is a core part of the market's plumbing, ensuring that cash is swapped for legal ownership and custody of the asset, usually within two or three days.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said it was working on a proposal to possibly delay the entry into force of the settlement discipline regime until February 1, 2022.
""This is due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the implementation of regulatory projects and IT deliveries by Central Securities Depositories and came as a request from the European Commission,"" ESMA said in a statement.
The new regime includes mandatory buy-ins, or the buyer of a security having the right to secure delivery of it from a third party like a settlement house at the going market price, when the original seller has failed to provide it.
It replaces a system when fails were dealt with in private between both sides of a trade.
The International Capital Market Association (ICMA), which represents the fixed income and repurchase agreements or repo sector, has warned that the new rules would mean millions of buy-ins a year, hitting market pricing and liquidity.

Britain's finance ministry said in June it would not be implementing the new settlement failure rules inherited from the EU, and that market participants should continue to apply an existing industry-led framework.

The gunmaker has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in U.S. Bankruptcy court for Northern District of Alabama, according to the court filing.
In the filing, the company listed its assets and liabilities both in the range of $100 million to $500 million.
The gunmaker has filed for bankruptcy before in 2018 after sales faltered and the company had trouble meeting requirements of its lenders. It exited bankruptcy protection the same year under the ownership of its creditors. 
U.S. retailers have placed restrictions on gun sales after school shootings, hurting manufacturers such as Remington. A Remington Bushmaster rifle was used in the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in Connecticut in 2012 that killed 20 children and six adults, making it central to debates over gun policy.

Remington has been trying to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the families of the victims related to the marketing of the company's guns. It is scheduled to go on trial next year.

Pfizer said adjusted earnings per share fell 2% to 78c on an 11% drop in revenue to $11.80 billion Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of 68c on revenue of $11.58 billion. The company now expects full-year earnings to be in a 10c range around $2.90 a share, some 3c higher than what it forecast in March.
The news comes a day after Pfizer and its German partner, Nasdaq-listed BioNTech, started a hybrid phase 2/3 trial for their candidate vaccine to treat the Covid-19 virus. Its unprecedentedly quick progress on developing this vaccine has grabbed most of the headlines in recent weeks, diverting attention away from the fact that the public health emergency across the U.S. and other markets has actually depressed demand for many of its other products. The company noted that its sales force had barely been able to meet with healthcare professionals throughout the whole of the quarter.
""Our researchers and scientists have made important progress toward developing an effective vaccine though significant additional work remains,"" chief executive Albert Bourla said in a statement.
Bourla also noted that the planned merger of its generics business Upjohn with Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) is now expected to close in the fourth quarter. In March, it had already pushed back the deadline to the second half of 2020, so the new guidance is at the later end of that range.
Pfizer shares are down 4% from the beginning of the year, and are down 12.7% from their 52-week high of $43.00 on July 29, 2019. They are outperforming the Dow Jones which is down 6.9% from the start of the year.
Pfizer's report follows an earnings beat by J&J on July 16, who reported earnings of $1.67 a share on revenue of $18.34 billion, ahead of forecasts for $1.49 in profit on revenue of $17.61 billion.
Roche Holding had beaten expectations on Thursday with second-quarter earnings per share of $1.45, some 2% ahead of forecasts, on revenue of $15.27 billion.

797,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>","In summer of turmoil, subdued 'fear' gauges make markets uneasy","By Olga Cotaga and April Joyner
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financial markets' fear gauges are not flashing red at a time of serious global turmoil, stirring investor doubts over whether the indexes are mispricing current and future turbulence.
Volatility gauges embedded in option markets are used by traders and investors to predict -- or guess -- market direction. They can also be useful barometers of the economic and political mood, hence the VIX equity volatility index is dubbed Wall Street's fear gauge.
These indicators have dropped dramatically since March after global central banks floored interest rates and doubled down on money-printing to combat the coronavirus-led downturn.
The VIX, which uses options on the S&P 500 to track volatility over the coming month, has drifted below 25, after spiking above 80 (VIX) in March.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s index of currency volatility <.DBCVIX> slipped below 6%, more than halving from March's record highs despite euro-dollar implied, or expected, volatility ticking higher on back of dollar weakness.
(Graphic - FX vol: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmypmkgxrpr/Pasted%20image%201595605398090.png) 
The drop on Treasury bond volatility is even more dramatic (MOVE).
(Graphic - FX Bonds Equity volatility go back to near pre-coronavirus levels: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjpqwenmpx/FX%20Bonds%20Equity%20volatility%20go%20back%20to%20near%20pre-coronavirus%20levels.png)
Good news surely: low volatility is usually a precursor to equity gains and a green light for investment into riskier currencies. 
Yet there are still major risks facing investors -- a raging pandemic that threatens U.S. and global economic recovery, November's U.S. presidential elections and China-U.S. tensions.
NatWest analyst James McCormick (NYSE:MKC) describes the calm as an unstable equilibrium, which may soon end if a plunging dollar triggers volatility across asset classes. 
""In a world that is experiencing an unstable equilibrium, policymakers can plug a few holes in the volatility dike, but ultimately volatility will show up somewhere else,"" McCormick said.
""Dollar weakness may be an example of volatility escaping from the leaky dike.""
Underlying investor unease also shows up in record-high gold prices, and hefty flows into cash and bonds.
Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management, highlights a discrepancy within option markets; while monetary stimulus has crushed bond volatility, the VIX is holding above historic averages. 
""Central banks can effectively control the level of bond yields, but they can't control the level of equities,"" Paolini said. 
That is significant because government bonds usually act as a safe-haven, rising when equities fall. But with the yields almost fixed, those returns from bonds are minimal, pushing investors to look for money-making opportunities elsewhere.
""The negative correlation between bond and equity volatility makes a huge difference on the risk you can take,"" he added.
Spiking volatility is not necessarily bad news; violent price moves can be profitable, especially for currency traders. 
March ructions helped big FX dealing banks JPMorgan (N:JPM) and Citi (N:C), report a 68% and 77% rise respectively in fixed income revenues, a category that includes currencies. 
Hedge funds made forex-linked returns of 5.1% in the first quarter of 2020, versus a 0.38% loss a year ago, the HFRI Macro Currency Index shows.
(Graphic - Dissipating volatility: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegpbaammvq/Pasted%20image%201595857031202.png)
WHY SO LOW?
The crisis has not created new worries for financial markets just intensified trends that have been around for the past decade; central bank liquidity, shrinking interest rate gaps and buoyant equities. As for U.S. election risks, strategists say equity options have long priced those.
And years of high and persistent uncertainty levels may be dampening market swings,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said.
The high-uncertainty backdrop is effectively like background noise, causing ""inertia and herding behaviour"" in markets. But a sudden shift can send volatility gauges soaring, putting investors to flight, the Barclays analysts said. 
The effect is ""lower average realised volatility with more spikes,"" they added.
This may be the calm before the storm but NatWest's McCormick points out FX and bond volatility has risen every August for the past seven years. 
Those who see VIX futures as a predictor of equity volatility point out the curve usually inverts shortly before risk events, as it did in February. The curve is currently flat but Matt Thompson, managing partner at Thompson Capital Management in Chicago, attributed that to a ""muddled"" picture. 
""Right now, the VIX is having a hard time placing the end of this (coronavirus) thing, and then having the election stuck right in the middle of that,"" he said.

In Germany, wasting corporate funds is legally a breach of fiduciary duty. 
A regional court in Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, where Volkswagen is based, said it had opened proceedings at the behest of local prosecutors in Braunschweig. 
Two former Volkswagen management board members as well as the current and former manager in charge of personnel are being probed for potential breach of their fiduciary duties, the Braunschweig court said in a statement.
Those being probed were responsible for setting pay and bonus payments for works council members, the court said, adding that prosecutors believed Volkswagen likely wasted more than 5 million euros ($5.86 million) in excessive pay for labour leaders between May 2011 and May 2016.
Volkswagen and the works council have said that payments were in line with legal guidelines. Volkswagen had no immediate comment on Tuesday.
In 2017 Volkswagen said it had cut the salaries and suspended the bonuses of 14 members of its works council, including the council's head Bernd Osterloh, as public prosecutors investigate alleged earlier overpayment.
At the time, Matthias Mueller, the former VW chief executive, said that the cuts in pay were a precautionary measure taken until the legality of pay levels were clarified. 

In November 2016, prosecutors and tax investigators raided the offices of senior VW officials probing overpayment and tax evasion.

799,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 05:34AM ET</span>",StockBeat: ECB Cuts the Banks More Slack - at a Price,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- If Europe can’t stop the coming wave of bankruptcies from infecting the financial system, it won’t be for lack of trying.
Bank stocks were mostly higher in Europe Tuesday after the European Central Bank cut them yet more slack as regards their accounting through the crisis, saying it will let them operate at below their individually-mandated levels of capital for at least another two and a half years.
The Stoxx 600 Banks index was up 0.6%, slightly outperforming a 0.3% rise in the Stoxx 600 index. Spanish banks in particular were lifted by the ruling, a reflection of the concern that they'll be needing the capital relief more than most if the second wave of Covid-19 infections really derails the summer tourist season.
The ECB is, however, exacting a price for its generosity. It extended its recommendation that banks pay no dividends by another six months to the end of the year (although it will review that decision at the end of the quarter).  That will annoy UniCredit's (MI:CRDI) Jean-Pierre Mustier in particular, who had big plans for capital returns until the crisis broke.
The central bank said it “commits to allow banks to operate below the P2G and the combined buffer requirement until at least end-2022…without automatically triggering supervisory actions.”
P2G, or Pillar II Guidance – is the capital ratio that the ECB tailors for each of the banks under its direct supervision. It reflects the degree of concern that the ECB has about a bank’s specific business model and balance sheet strength. Basically, the P2G capital ratio recommendation is the threshold at which the warning lights turn from amber to red.  
The ECB had already signalled in March that it wanted banks to avoid foreclosing on bad debts in a hurry. It feared that panicked attempts to ringfence the financial system would make the Covid-19 downturn worse and, in doing so, ultimately raise the risk of a new financial crisis.  
Given the historic deficit of trust shown by the market to Eurozone banks (their stocks have traded at a sharp discount to their book value for a decade), that was a brave decision: such guidance couldn’t help but raise further doubts among investors about the truthfulness of Eurozone bank balance sheets.
While it is far too early to say whether those doubts are justified, earnings season is already throwing up some interesting numbers. Spain’s  Bankia  (MC:BKIA) said on Tuesday its core tier 1 capital ratio – the key supervisory indicator of financial strength – rose by 32 basis points to 13.27% at the end of June, despite adding another 185 million euros to its loan loss provisions to the 125 million it posted in March.
Bankia’s bad loan ratio fell to 4.86% from 4.95%, as it shifted more of the bad loans left over from the last crisis just in time to accommodate a surge in Covid-driven non-performing loans. Bankia stock rose 2.4%.
Separately, Dutch-based ING (AS:INGA) said it will book an impairment of around 300 million euros in the second quarter against goodwill in respect of past acquisitions.  ING stock fell 0.7%."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201) forecast on Tuesday its biggest-ever annual operating loss and said it expects vehicle sales to tumble 16% as the coronavirus pandemic hampers the company's efforts to turn around its business.
Japan's No. 2 automaker forecast an operating loss of 470 billion yen ($4.5 billion), much larger than a Refinitiv consensus estimate of a 262.8 billion yen loss and its second straight year of losses.
It predicted revenue would plunge by a fifth to 7.8 trillion yen.
Years of aggressive expansion, particularly in emerging markets, has left Nissan with dismal margins, an ageing portfolio and a tarnished brand. Still reeling from the 2018 arrest and ouster of former CEO Carlos Ghosn, it unveiled a far-reaching restructuring plan in May that calls for a dramatic reduction in production lines and its vehicle model range. 
In the first quarter, Nissan posted an operating loss of 153.9 billion yen, its second consecutive quarterly loss after falling 94.8 billion yen into the red in January-March.
""The results for the first-quarter and the full year outlook look challenging, but are within our expectations,"" Chief Executive Makoto Uchida told a livestreamed media briefing while noting the company was facing a ""tough year"".
Global vehicle sales tumbled 48% to 643,000 units in the April-June quarter as sales halved in North America, a key market. Sales in China fell 40%.
Nissan's woes have highlighted the fragility of its automaking partnership with France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) which has also announced a major restructuring as it rows back on policies pursued by Ghosn, now a fugitive wanted on charges of financial misconduct in Tokyo. Ghosn denies the charges.

Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211), a junior partner in the three-way alliance, saw its shares tumble some 13% on Tuesday after sales in Southeast Asia plunged 70% during the April-June quarter.

Elsewhere, the luxury sector headed lower after LVMH (PA:LVMH) said its second-quarter sales were hit hard by store closures. LVMH stock fell 4.8%. Moncler (MI:MONC) also slid 3.6% after reporting a first-half operating loss for the first time in its history.
Additionally, the European banking sector was in focus after the European Central Bank extended until January 2021 its recommendation to Eurozone lenders not to pay dividends.
On Monday, U.S. Republicans unveiled their latest $1 trillion stimulus package. They now need to find a compromise between this plan and the Democrats' $3.5 trillion proposal before some of the earlier support measures expire at the end of the week.
At the same time, there are signs of improvement in the U.S.'s battle with the Covid-19 virus. New infections fell to their lower in nearly three weeks at the weekend, suggesting a slowdown beyond the normal weekend dip. That said, Hong Kong, Australia, Spain and Germany are some of the locations also dealing with a renewed spike in cases.
Fear about the virus' spread drove gold prices to a record high on Tuesday morning in Asia, closing in on the $2,000/oz level, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1706, down 0.4%.
It’s unusual for the price of gold to do so well at the same as stocks, but it remains one of few assets for which a simple and convincing bull case can be made in the post-Covid world.

Trade union Unite, which represents BA cabin crew, said that the airline is planning to fire and rehire thousands of its workers and that it planned to defend its members by immediately moving towards industrial action, the BBC reported.
British Airways, which is owned by IAG (L:ICAG) and Unite did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
BA said in April that it would need to cut up to 12,000 jobs to survive the coronavirus pandemic, which wiped out air travel for months and from which the aviation market will take years to recover. 
Unite has accused BA of seeking to fire and rehire some workers on less favourable contracts. For many weeks the Union refused to engage in consultations with BA.
BA, like all airlines, is struggling to recover from the pandemic due to consumer worries over the virus and new restrictions are making the recovery even tougher. 

A 14-day quarantine for travellers returning to Britain from Spain, a significant market for BA, came into force two days ago.

810,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 02:30AM ET</span>","Gold hits a high, more precious as dollar loses value","By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Gold hurtled to record peaks on Tuesday before the sheer scale of its gains drew a burst of profit taking, which in turn helped the dollar from two-year lows and curbed early equity gains.
The precious metal had stormed almost $40 higher at one point to reach $1,980 an ounce , only for a wave of selling to slap it back to $1,940 in wild trade.
Gold is still up over $125 in little more than a week as investors wager the Federal Reserve will reaffirm its super-easy policies at its meeting this week, and perhaps signal a tolerance for higher inflation in the long-run.
""Fed officials have made clear that they will be making their forward guidance more dovish and outcome-based soon,"" wrote analysts at TD Securities.
""The chairman is likely to continue the process of prepping markets for changes when he speaks at his press conference.""
One shift could be to average inflation targeting, which would see the Fed aim to push inflation above its 2% target to make up for years of under-shooting.
The pullback in gold took some steam out of stocks but MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) was still up 0.8%.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) went flat, while Chinese blue chips put on 0.7% (CSI300). E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) edged up 0.1%, while EUROSTOXX 50 futures (STXEc1) added 0.1% and FTSE futures (FFIc1) 0.3%.
The Dow (DJI) had ended Monday up 0.43%, while the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.74% and the Nasdaq (IXIC) 1.67%.
That rise was again led by technology stocks as investors wagered on upbeat earnings reports due this week. Analysts also noted the falling dollar was a positive given that more than 40% of S&P 500 earnings come from abroad.
DOLLAR IN DECLINE
There were hopes some sort of stimulus extension could be hammered out as U.S. Senate Republicans raced to complete details of a $1 trillion coronavirus aid proposal before enhanced unemployment benefits expire on Friday. 
The proposal could involve a cut in benefits to $200 from $600, which would be a big blow to household incomes and spending power.
Aid is desperately needed given 30 million Americans are out of work and states are tightening social restrictions again, a trend that has also dragged on the U.S. dollar.
Alan Ruskin, head of G10 strategy at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), noted currencies had been tracking the relative performance of their economies, so that high-ranked economic performance was associated with stronger currencies.
""One clear pattern is how economies linked most tightly to China - including commodity producers as diverse as Australia, Chile and Brazil - have tended to perform better than economies most directly linked to the U.S., notably its NAFTA trading partners,"" said Ruskin.
Indeed, the dollar has been falling almost across the board in recent days, reaching a two-year trough on a basket of currencies at 93.416 before steadying at 93.793 (=USD) (DXY).
The euro (EUR=) stood at $1.1732, having hit its highest in two years at $1.1781, while the dollar touched its lowest against the Swiss franc since mid-2015 .
The story was much the same against the Japanese yen, as the dollar touched a four-month trough at 105.10  before last trading at 105.60.
The trend reversal in the dollar combined with all the uncertainty over COVID-19 and the prevalence of negative real bond yields to light a fire under precious metals.
Silver  shot as far as $26.16 at one point, the highest since April 2013, and a gain of a third in seven sessions.
Oil prices also tend to benefit from a falling dollar but have been hampered by worries about demand as countries impose more travel restrictions.

Brent crude (LCOc1) futures edged up 4 cents to $43.45 a barrel, while U.S. crude (CLc1) eased 9 cents to $41.51.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB) (AD:ADCB) is letting go hundreds of employees, sources said, the latest in a round of lay-offs by regional banks as pressure mounts to cut costs amid lower oil prices and the coronavirus crisis.
The UAE's third-biggest lender is laying off 400 employees, two sources familiar with the matter said, after it had committed to not cutting staff because of the crisis.
In a statement, a spokesman said ADCB had pursued efficiency over the last decade by managing out its lowest underachievers after regular reviews, while ensuring talent was deployed in high-growth areas, such as digital banking.
""A certain number of redundancies are therefore expected every year in the normal course of business,"" the bank spokesman added.
The sources said the cuts would involve ADCB's consumer business and several in top management were among those being let go. One source said the bank was looking to close 20 branches.
In March, ADCB had declared, ""No employee will be made redundant during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.""
UAE banks have been hit by government measures to rein in the spread of the virus, forcing many businesses to shut temporarily.
Last week, Dubai's largest bank, Emirates NBD, reported a slump of 58% in profits. In June, sources told Reuters the bank started a new round of hundreds of lay-offs.
In May, ADCB reported a fall of 84% in first-quarter net profit as it took impairments of $292 million on debt exposure to troubled hospital operator NMC Health and payments group Finablr.
It was a major lender, with an exposure of about $981 million, to NMC Health, which went into administration this year after months of turmoil following questions over financial reporting.

MANILA (Reuters) - Shares in top Philippine telecom firms PLDT Inc (PS:TEL) and  Globe Telecom  Inc (PS:GLO) fell on Tuesday after a threat by President Rodrigo Duterte to shut them down, while firms run by a telecom newcomer with ties to the president soared. 
Duterte during his state of the nation address on Monday threatened closure or government takeover of duopoly Globe and PLDT for what he called ""lousy service"", which he did not elaborate on.
PLDT fell 3.6% and Globe dropped 3.4%. Both companies are controlled by businessmen whom Duterte has publicly lambasted.
Globe in a statement said it had heeded the president's call to invest in improving services, setting aside $1.2 billion for this year. PLDT declined to comment.
Shares in contrast rallied in two firms controlled by Dennis Uy, a rapidly rising tycoon from Duterte's hometown and his biggest election campaign donor.
His new holding firm Dito CME (PS:DITO), which will house a telecoms partnership with  China Telecom  (HK:0728) that plans to offer services next year, and his conglomerate  Chelsea Logistics  and Infrastructure Holdings (PS:C) jumped as much as 10.9% and 3.6%, respectively.
Roberto Marco Samson, head of business development at First Metro Securities, said the share moves showed what can happen when Duterte singles out companies in public remarks.
""As we all know, if the administration expresses their dissatisfaction, that could negatively affect the sentiments or the shares,"" he told ANC news channel.
Dito Telecommunity won a license to operate a third telecom company in 2018 and was the only qualified bidder in an auction that followed months of repeated statements by Duterte that he wanted a Chinese company to break the Globe-PLDT duopoly. 
The bid led by Uy was a team-up with state-run China Telecom holding a 40% stake, which some opposition lawmakers say presents a cyber security risk. Dito has rejected that. 

The Philippines, among the world's heaviest users of social media, has struggled with patchy coverage and dropped calls as demand soars among the country's 109 million population.

Like rival carmakers, PSA halted production as the outbreak spread from China to Europe and the United States, while dealerships also closed. 
But the group, which is in the middle of working through a merger agreement with Italy's  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), said it was aiming for a more positive second half. 
""June has been a very strong rebound in sales and July is seeing a similar trend,"" PSA's Financial Chief Philippe de Rovira told reporters. 
PSA's revenue fell 34.5% in the first six months of 2020 to 25.12 billion euros ($29.47 billion), while the automotive division's adjusted operating margins shrank to 3.7% from 8.5% at end-2019. 
PSA reiterated a goal for average margins of over 4.5% in the automotive unit for the 2019 to 2021 period, however. 
The group's share of net profit for the first half of 2020 also stayed in positive territory, at 595 million euros, down from 1.83 billion euros a year ago. 
The carmaker's profitability has eclipsed that of some rivals including France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) in recent quarters, helped by honing in on pricier models like SUVs. 
De Rovira said the merger with FCA - which is set to create the world's fourth largest carmaker, baptised ""Stellantis"" - was still on course to close in the first quarter of 2021. 
Earlier this month, European Union antitrust regulators suspended their investigation into the proposed merger while waiting for data.

Asked about possible concessions to get the deal over the line, De Rovira, who described exchanges with the EU as normal, said the carmakers would listen to regulators' observations ""with a very flexible mindset"".

The French manufacturer expects the European auto market to shrink by 25% this year, with contractions of 10% in China as well as 30% in Latin America and Russia. PSA has ramped up its European factories after closing them in mid-March.
PSA, which is working to gain European Union antitrust approval to merge with Italian-American peer Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU), kept its outlook for an average automotive adjusted operating margin of more than 4.5% for the 2019-2021 period. It came in at 3.7% in the first half.

Mitsubishi’s Tokyo shares plunged 11.90% to JPY237 ($2.2474) by 12:23 AM ET (5:23 AM GMT), their lowest point since the company's listing in 1988.
The company projected an operating loss of JPY140 billion ($1.32758 billion) for the year ending on March 31, 2021 on Monday, its biggest in almost two decades according to records that date back to 2002. Falling sales in key markets, such as China and South East Asia, were exacerbated by the COVID-19 virus. The South East Asian market accounts for a quarter of Mitsubishi’s sales.
Considering the heavy losses, the company announced a restructuring plan, which involves discontinuing the company’s Pajero SUV crossover model in 2021 and closing the plant that manufactures the model.

818,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 12:20AM ET</span>",United tells two regional airlines it will continue contract with just one: union letter,"By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines has told two regional airlines, ExpressJet and CommutAir, that it will drop its contract with one, according to a pilot union letter reviewed by Reuters, in a potentially mortal blow to the losing carrier as the coronavirus pandemic guts demand. 
ExpressJet and CommutAir each work exclusively for United and the plan would mean one would lose its major source of revenue.
Chicago-based United has minority stakes in both companies, which operate  Embraer SA  (NYSE:ERJ) E145 50-seat planes that bring passengers from smaller markets to destinations that United itself serves on larger jets.
United is among U.S. major airlines that, until early this year, were expanding their domestic networks through contracts with regional airlines, which have a cheaper workforce. Now the coronavirus pandemic is forcing carriers to scale back growth plans and flights.
United, in an emailed response, acknowledged that its relationship with regional airlines will change.
""We've been clear for months now that we expect to be a smaller airline in response to the historic impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our business. That means we've cut our schedules and our costs across the operation – and we do anticipate it will continue to impact the relationships we have with our regional partners,"" United said.
It declined to provide more details. 
In a letter to ExpressJet pilots last week, the union chairman warned of developments that could have a ""dramatic impact"" on the future of the airline following a call with management informing labor leaders that United had said it would only require one E145 carrier moving forward.
""While ExpressJet offers many attributes that make us an attractive long-term partner, cost has reared its ugly head once again and we have been asked by our management team to close the gap between our costs and those at CommutAir,"" the letter said.
ExpressJet has a more senior pilot group than CommutAir and a larger fleet of about 95 planes, versus around 37 at CommutAir.
Neither responded to requests for comment.
United had contracts with eight feeder carriers that flew under the banner of United Express, according to its 2019 annual report. One of them, Trans States Airlines, ceased operations in April.
In 2019, United and United Express operated more than 1.7 million flights carrying over 162 million customers.
United had partnered with ExpressJet and CommutAir for the Aviate pilot recruitment and development program it launched last year when the industry was bracing for a pilot shortage. Now it is facing a pilot surplus.
Meanwhile, two of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL)' wholly-owned regional subsidiaries, Envoy and PSA, have issued notices of potential furloughs to around 2,000 and 1,000 employees, respectively, spokeswomen for the two regional carriers said on Monday.

A day earlier, Mitsubishi Motors, a junior member of the auto alliance of Nissan Motor (T:7201) and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), reported that sales in Southeast Asian countries, which normally account for a quarter of its global sales, plunged nearly 70% to make up just 17% of total sales during April-June.
The automaker has bet on growth in Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam where it has dominated bigger rivals, and which have felt the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic later than China and other developed countries. 
As a result, some experts say that Mitsubishi's sales recovery may lag other automakers and complicate a restructuring plan that it detailed on Monday.
The automaker also projected an operating loss of 140 billion yen ($1.33 billion) for the year ending on March 31, 2021, its biggest loss in at least 18 years. 
Mitsubishi Motors' results were ""shocking"", said analyst Mio Kato of LightStream Research, noting that Southeast Asia was particularly concerning.
""ASEAN was meant to be its growth driver and was even positioned as its key attractive point to the Renault-Nissan Alliance. ASEAN sales have collapsed and it is now generating losses,"" Kato said in a note to clients, referring to Southeast Asia.
Globally it sold just 139,000 vehicles in the April-June quarter, a 53% tumble from a year ago.
Mitsubishi's shares fell 12% to 236 yen on Tuesday, marking a lifetime low since their 1988 listing. The shares have nearly halved this year.
Some analysts were sanguine about the company's longer term outlook and backed its recovery strategy.

""In the short term Southeast Asia is not going to work that well for them, but in the longer term it's the right thing for them to do,"" said Chris Richter, deputy head of Japan research at CLSA.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were up on Tuesday morning with an overnight boost in U.S. markets carrying over to Asia. But gains were capped by ongoing investor worries over the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19.
The ongoing fight could see U.S. Federal Chairman Jerome Powell extending near-zero rates for longer, and the Fed is widely expected to continue its dovish stance as it convenes on Wednesday.
But the U.S. is not the only country battling new outbreaks of COVID-19, with Hong Kong, Australia, Spain and Germany some of the locations dealing with a renewed spike in cases. Global COVID-19 deaths topped 650,000, with the number of cases topping 16.4 million as of July 28, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
“The reality is that the Fed has proclaimed that they are going to keep the printing presses rolling, they will print money and it has created this all-you-can eat buffet. The bottom may be in for the year, but we do expect volatility in the future,” Terri Spath, Sierra Investment Management’s chief investment officer, told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, Republicans unveiled their latest $1 trillion stimulus package on Monday, and investors are watching to see whether a compromise between the Republican plan and the Democrats $3.5 trillion plan can be reached before some earlier measures expire at the end of the week.
South Korea’s KOSPI rose 1.36% by 11:23 PM ET (4:23 AM GMT) and Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.02%.
Down Under, the ASX 200 gained 0.21%. But with COVID-19 sending the country into a recession for the first time in 30 years, the upcoming reporting session is expected to be one of the worst on record.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up by 0.32%, even after the government announced unprecedented social distancing measures to curb record numbers of COVID-19 cases in the city.
The measures will be enforceable from Wednesday and include limiting public gatherings to two people and an all-day ban in dine-in services at restaurants.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.46% and the Shenzhen Component jumped 1.54%. But U.S.-China tensions continue to simmer over issues such as Hong Kong’s national security law, Chinese claims in the South China Sea and trade. The latest Chinese Customs Administration data showed that China has only bought around 23% of the more than $170 billion goods purchase target for the year set in the phase one trade deal signed between the two nations in January."

The airline said it set that date for the restart to ""maintain some flexibility"" in the event the travel ban is extended and to minimize the impact on passengers if adjustments to itineraries are needed.
""If we resume operations in September, we project that we will do so with approximately 3% of all existing operations prior to the impact of COVID-19,"" the airline told Reuters.
Copa suspended all operations from March 22, making it the first Latin American carrier to take such a measure to weather the coronavirus crisis.
Initially, Copa expected to resume flights with 10% of capacity.
Copa, which has 102 aircraft, has said it will definitively retire all 28 of its Embraer 190 and Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-700 planes, accounting for nearly 30% of its fleet.
It will also retire a similar number of Boeing 737-800 planes, some temporarily and others that will be put up for sale.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. buyers of polluting Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) vehicles received more than $9.8 billion in settlements, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said on Monday .
Volkswagen agreed to offer to buy back or repair more than 550,000 polluting diesel U.S. vehicles after it admitted in 2015 that it used secret software to cheat emissions tests.
The FTC in its final report on the settlements said more than 86% of consumers completing claims chose to return their car through a buyback or early lease termination rather than get a repair. 
Volkswagen paid more than $9.5 billion to U.S. consumers, while VW diesel supplier Robert Bosch (ROBG.UL) paid more than $300 million to U.S. consumers.
Most of the vehicles covered were 2.0-liter diesel vehicles. VW agreed to offer owners and people who leased the 475,000 2.0-liter vehicles between $5,100 and $10,000 in compensation, in addition to the estimated value of the vehicle.
The scandal triggered a global backlash against diesel vehicles that so far has cost VW 30 billion euros ($33.3 billion) in fines, penalties, vehicle buyback costs and other settlements.
VW in 2017 pleaded guilty to fraud, obstruction of justice and falsifying statements as part of a $4.3 billion settlement reached with the U.S. Justice Department.

Last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled VW cannot escape potential financial penalties stemming from lawsuits filed by two counties that may amount to a ""staggering"" additional liability. Volkswagen vowed to seek further review by the 9th Circuit or the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary, saying the ruling conflicts with the findings of other courts.

823,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 09:27PM ET</span>","Gold Rips Up Record Book as $2,000 Test Looms in Hunt for Haven","(Bloomberg) -- Gold’s unrelenting march higher shows no signs of slowing after a plunge in the dollar swept prices past the previous high set in 2011 and put the metal on track for even bigger gains.
Bullion’s surge came as a gauge of the U.S. currency sank to the lowest in more than a year, the latest in a long line of bullish factors -- including negative real rates in the U.S. and bets the Federal Reserve will keep policy accommodative when it meets this week -- that are pushing prices ever higher.
With the world facing an extended period of unprecedented economic and political turmoil, gold’s now got $2,000 in its sights. Some in the market suggest the haven could rise even beyond that.
Nascent signs of gold’s record-breaking ascent began to show in mid-2019, when the Fed signaled a readiness to cut interest rates as uncertainty -- primarily about the impact of the U.S.’s trade battles -- clouded its outlook. The rally gathered pace in early 2020 as geopolitical tensions rose and the coronavirus outbreak hurt growth worldwide, pushing governments and central banks to unleash vast amounts of stimulus, and sending real rates slumping further into negative territory.
“Strong gains are inevitable as we enter a period much like the post-GFC environment, where gold prices soared to record levels as a result of copious amounts of Fed money being pumped into the financial system,” said Gavin Wendt, senior resource analyst at MineLife Pty. A weak dollar and negative real rates are providing further impetus. Gold may consolidate before setting its sights on $2,000 and above in coming weeks, he said.
The Message Behind Gold’s Rally: The World Economy Is in Trouble
Investment demand has been unrelenting. Holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded funds have beaten all-time highs nearly every month since late last year and inflows this year have topped the record annual total set in 2009. The additions make up roughly one-fifth of expected mine supply for the year, according to research group Metals Focus.
Gold’s been drawing investors even as equities climbed -- with the exception of a sharp selloff in March as traders liquidated bullion holdings to cover losses in other markets -- and it’s U.S. bonds that have been the key metric to watch. The metal is serving as an attractive hedge as yields on Treasuries that strip out the effects of inflation fall below zero.

The environment has even raised the specter of stagflation, a rare combination of sluggish growth and rising inflation that erodes the value of fixed-income investments. In the U.S., investor expectations for annual inflation over the next decade, as measured by a bond-market metric known as breakevens, have moved higher the past four months after plunging in March.
Inflation also plays an important role in looking at prices in an historical context. Spot gold traded as high as $1,945.72 on Monday before closing at $1,942.24, topping its previous record by more than $20. Gold futures for December delivery settled at $1,955.40, a record for a most-active contract. Spot silver jumped as much as 8.1% to $24.6031 an ounce, the highest since 2013.
When adjusted for inflation, bullion remains lower than its 2011 high and far below the historic peak in 1980, in the wake of the second oil price shock.
It’s not just price moves that are proving historic. The virus shined a spotlight on a traditionally overlooked corner of the market: logistics. A chaotic period in March saw extreme distortions between London and New York gold prices due to an unprecedented snarl in the movement of physical metal, with the grounding of flights and refinery shutdowns sparking concerns about a shortage of bullion available in New York in time to deliver against Comex futures.
That crisis eased -- there was enough gold -- but the dislocation prompted CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME), which owns Comex, to announce that it would offer a new futures contract with expanded delivery options that included 400-ounce bars, which is the size accepted in London. It later said traders will be able to deliver gold in London vaults against the new contract.
Fed Meets
Next up for investors and a possible fillip for gold, is this week’s Fed meeting July 28-29, where officials are expected to keep interest rates near zero and debate a possible shift in its strategy.
The Fed’s path forward will be closely watched. From December 2008 to June 2011, the Fed bought $2.3 trillion of debt and held borrowing costs near zero percent in a bid to shore up growth, helping send bullion to a record in September 2011.
On top of historic low rates, central banks and governments have passed trillions in stimulus packages to curb the economic toll of the pandemic, and if that continues, investors will continue to buy into gold, said Nitesh Shah, London-based director of research at WisdomTree.
“Some investors out there are a little uneasy or uncertain about what this means for the long-term future,” he said. “If these stimulus packages can’t be withdrawn at some point in time when the economy can handle it, are these things going to become quite inflationary?”
Read More: Fed to Debate Dimming Outlook as Virus Surges, Fiscal Help Hangs
Forecasts for further gains have been building even before gold’s most recent breakthrough. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). has stuck with its April forecast for $3,000 gold over the next 18 months. UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) sees prices reaching $2,000 by end-September, global chief investment officer Mark Haefele said in a note Monday. The group has added the metal to its “most preferred asset list.”
“You simply couldn’t pick a more perfect storm of events which would allow for gold to perform,” said Steve Dunn, head of ETFs at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “With low interest rate policies, negative real rates, super accommodative monetary policy, huge amounts of global fiscal spending, a weaker dollar, escalating U.S.-China tensions and no clear end in sight for the coronavirus pandemic, all of the parts of the equation are coming together.”

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) has launched a hiring spree in Shanghai with plans to bring on designers at its China studio and about 1,000 factory workers, job posts show, as the U.S. electric vehicle maker ramps up production in the world's biggest auto market.
The posts on the Tesla human resources department's official WeChat account mark the first time the California-based automaker has looked to hire designers in China. Tesla said in January it planned to open a design and research centre in China to make ""Chinese-style"" cars.
The posts did not reveal how many designers Tesla planned to hire.
The company also planned to hire 600 workers at stamping, bodywork, painting and assembly workshops in Shanghai, according to a separate job post by the Lingang local government. Another 150 workers were needed for quality checks, 200 for logistics work and 20 for security, it added.
Two sources familiar with the matter said the recruitment drive was partly for the preparation of Model Y sport-utility vehicles at the Shanghai plant. Tesla is building manufacturing facilities for Model Ys in Shanghai from next year.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company delivered over 30,000 units in China in the past quarter, most of them locally made Model 3 sedans. 

In March it advertised for solar and energy storage project managers in China, as it moves to expand its energy business into the country.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) is set to gain EU antitrust approval to buy Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Inc's rail business, people familiar with the matter said on Monday, a deal which will make the French rail maker the world's second largest behind Chinese leader CRRC Corp.
Alstom earlier this month offered to sell a French rail factory, its regional train unit Coradia Polyvalent, and a Bombardier commuter trains division and the related production facilities at its Hennigsdorf site in Germany.
The French TGV high-speed train maker also proposed providing access to some products within Bombardier's train control systems and signalling units to rivals.
The concessions came after the European Commission voiced concerns about Alstom's greater market clout after the deal.
Alstom subsequently improved the concession on access to the Canadian company's train control systems and signalling units but did not have to sell more assets following feedback to the Commission from rivals and customers, the people said.
The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by July 31, declined to comment. Alstom and Bombardier also declined to comment. 

Last year, EU regulators blocked Alstom's attempt to merge rail assets with Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) after they refused to offer more concessions.

830,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 04:40PM ET</span>",Italy's Intesa says UBI bid to succeed as deadline extended,"By Valentina Za
MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) said it expected its takeover bid for rival UBI Banca (MI:UBI) to fully succeed as market regulator Consob extended it by two days to give shareholders more time to make an informed decision.
Intesa and UBI have been facing off since mid-February over a 4.1 billion euro ($4.8 billion) unsolicited paper-and-cash offer to create the euro zone's seventh-biggest banking group.
The offer was due to end on Tuesday but Consob said it had extended it to Thursday to protect shareholders after asking UBI for clarifications on communications issued in relation to the bid, which UBI provided on Monday.
Intesa has so far secured 43.5% of UBI.
""Based on take-up so far ... and taking into account opinions emerged among UBI shareholders, Intesa considers the bid destined for full success,"" a spokesman for Italy's second biggest bank said in a note.
UBI declined to comment.
The bid is valid with a take-up of 50% of UBI's capital plus one share. Intesa is targeting 66.67% acceptance to ensure it controls extraordinary shareholder resolutions, so as to be able to absorb UBI and maximise projected savings.
A high-take up would also make it easier for Intesa to comply with an antitrust commitment to sell 532 branches of the combined group, mostly UBI's.
A person in the bid's camp said institutional investors, who always wait until the last day to tender their shares, would drive a significant increase in acceptance.
The person said take-up so far comprised mostly local investors, many of whom had initially opposed the offer but embraced it after Intesa this month raised the premium to 40% from 24% versus UBI's closing price on the day the deal was announced.
Intesa ruled out any further changes to the bid's terms following the extension.
UBI has rejected the sweetened bid saying it still fails to reflect the bank's value.
But Intesa expects take-up could top 80% in a best-case scenario, two sources in Intesa's camp have said.
Two of UBI's single largest investors holding in aggregate around 17% of the bank - British funds Silchester International Investors and Parvus Asset Management Europe - have not disclosed their stance on the bid.
Even without their backing, holdout investors are not expected to account for more than around 30% of UBI's capital, according to the two sources, likely handing Intesa the majority it needs to control extraordinary shareholder meetings.

Shares in UBI closed down 8.8% on Monday after a deadline expired on Friday for investors to buy shares on the market and exchange them in the bid.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes closed higher on Monday as investors bet on some of the market's most high-profile stocks ahead of earnings reports while they weighed progress in U.S. government stimulus efforts against rising U.S. COVID-19 cases.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL), all due to report earnings this week, were among the top boosters of the S&P 500. The technology-heavy Nasdaq posted a 1.7% gain, outperforming the S&P and the Dow.
Netflix (O:NFLX) and Microsoft (O:MSFT) also gained, noted John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio, who said investors were buying stocks in the group, which fell in recent sessions. 
""When all six of them are higher they'll take markets with them,"" said Augustine, adding that with the exception of Facebook the so-called FAANG plus M stocks due to report have ""a low bar to step over to beat earnings estimates."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 114.88 points, or 0.43%, to 26,584.77, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 23.78 points, or 0.74%, to 3,239.41 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 173.09 points, or 1.67%, to 10,536.27.
The biggest gainers among the S&P's 11 major sectors were technology (SPLRCT), up 1.6%, and materials (SPLRCM), up 1.4%, followed by real estate <.SPLRCR>, up 1.1%. Financials (SPSY), down 1.3%, and utilities (SPLRCU), down 0.8%, were the only sectors to end the day lower while energy (SPNY) eked out a small gain of 0.2%.
U.S. Senate Republicans raced to complete details of a $1 trillion coronavirus aid proposal before enhanced unemployment benefits expire on Friday. The aid proposal, which could involve a reduction in emergency federal weekly unemployment benefits from $600 to $200, would then need to be negotiated with Democrats.
After the market closed, senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said the package would address health, schools and include direct payments to Americans of $1,200 each.
Some investors have worried whether the package would provide sufficient support for the economy. These concerns were reflected in gains in assets viewed as safe havens such as the big growth companies and gold , according to Kristina Hooper, Chief Global Market Strategist at Invesco in New York.
""Today's story is about concerns that the economic recovery will be slow and halting. That's from a combination of an inability to bend the virus curve and what is shaping up to be a small stimulus package that may not address all the needs being created by this terrible crisis,"" said Hooper.
Trillions of dollars in fiscal and monetary stimulus have been pivotal pushing the S&P 500 closer to its February record high. It ended Monday's session 4.3% below the record. 
On Monday, as the world confronted the prospect of rising COVID-19 infections, countries in Asia and Europe imposed new restrictions. 
In the United States, where infection rates have climbed since June, two baseball games were canceled due to the virus while President Donald Trump's national security adviser Robert O'Brien was the most senior official to test positive. 
Investors kept their eye on earnings, with 189 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report results this week. About 80% of the 130 S&P 500 firms that have reported so far have beaten a low bar of earnings estimates, according to IBES Refinitiv data. 
Few expected any major announcement at a two-day Federal Reserve meeting, but analysts said policymakers were likely to lay the groundwork for more action later this year.
 Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) shares finished up 9% after U.S. and company officials said its COVID-19 vaccine may be ready for widespread use by year-end. The drugmaker announced it started a trial to demonstrate safety and effectiveness, which could be the final hurdle prior to regulatory approval.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.66-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.47-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 19 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 64 new highs and 27 new lows.

832,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 04:18PM ET</span>","Japan’s Biggest Banks May Stave Off Bad Loan Surge, for Now","(Bloomberg) -- Japanese banks face sharply higher bad loan costs due to the pandemic, but the damage is unlikely to show through in first-quarter earnings reports.
The three largest lenders have already forecast credit costs will swell to an 11-year high of $10 billion in the year ending March 2021. Yet analysts predict actual expenses booked in the April-June quarter were relatively low because companies have been tapping credit lines and Bank of Japan loan assistance that will give them room to ride out the storm, at least for now.
“Corporate borrowers have secured cash and they won’t go bust as long as they have it,” said Toyoki Sameshima, an analyst at SBI Securities Co.
Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Shin Tamura echoed that line, saying credit deterioration at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group Inc., Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group Inc. and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. may take time, thanks in part to government support. The Abe administration has unveiled 234 trillion yen ($2.2 trillion) in virus-related stimulus packages, while the Bank of Japan has introduced business lending programs worth as much as 90 trillion yen.
Such aid has helped to keep bankruptcies and joblessness low in Japan, even after a state of emergency caused economic activity to plummet last quarter. But it remains to be seen how long the banks can hold off joining their global peers in making large provisions. Wall Street’s biggest lenders set aside $35 billion last quarter alone.
“We expect bankruptcies to mirror the broader economic trajectory in the long term, and there is a risk of a sharp increase as government relief programs fade,” Fitch Ratings Inc. analyst Kaori Nishizawa wrote. That will hurt asset quality, pushing up credit costs through higher loan-loss provisioning, as well as eroding capital buffers, she said.
The lenders also face the persistent headwind of rock-bottom interest rates, thanks to central bank monetary easing that has no end in sight. The rate on new loans in Japan tumbled to an unprecedented 0.448% in May, BOJ figures show.
“Net interest income should continue to decline, with narrowing margins both in Japan and overseas,” Tamura said of Sumitomo Mitsui, which is first to report on Wednesday.
Mizuho is scheduled to post its results on Friday, followed by MUFG on Aug. 4.

Investing.com – The Dow closed higher on Monday, as several mega-cap tech companies resumed their trek higher following a stumble last week as investors eagerly awaited key earnings slated for later this week.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.43%, or 115 points. The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.67% and the S&P 500 added 0.74%
Mega-cap tech made a positive start to the week as investors awaited clues on the performance of (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), all of which are slated to report earnings on Thursday.
Ahead of the earnings reports, tech will come under scrutiny on Capitol Hill, where chief executives of Facebook, Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon are due to testify on Wednesday, before a Congressional hearing on antitrust in big tech.
Tech's climb higher was also helped by a jump in chip stocks, led by a 12.6% pop in Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) on reports that Intel had ordered 6nm chips from Taiwan Semiconductor for next year.
In health care,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) was up 9.1% after receiving $472 million in government funding to accelerate the development of its coronavirus vaccine.
On the earnings front, meanwhile, Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) reported second-quarter results that missed on the top line as shuttered stores and product shortages weighed on performance, sending its shares more than 7% lower.
In other news, Boeing (NYSE:BA), which fell 2.07%, reportedly plans to delay the launch of its new 777X jet by up to a year, CNBC reported, citing sources.
Financials, paced by a decline in bank stocks, also kept gains in the broader market in check.

Investing.com -- Big tech bounced back on Monday, lifting other sectors as the world awaits the Federal Reserve's next decision on interest rates and word from Capitol Hill on negotiations over a new round of stimulus.
Chip makers were also in the news after Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stoked concerns about production of its next-generation chip, pushing its shares down another 2% on Monday after a sell-off last week. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) rose more than 11%.
The week will feature a deluge of earnings reports from across the S&P 500, including Tuesday announcements from Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG), JetBlue Airways Corp (NASDAQ:JBLU), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) and  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), among others.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
Gold at a record high
Gold Futures reached a new record high on Monday even as stocks continue to gain, an apparent contradiction between the part of the market signaling risk off, and the part signaling risk on.
Investors flock to gold as a store of value when the economy looks uncertain. The new record, at $1,931 an ounce on Comex, is the highest since September 2011, and some analysts believe there is still room to rise above $2,000 an ounce before long.
Gold's rally in recent weeks has come on top of trillions of dollars of government stimulus and an ever-weakening dollar. The US Dollar Index Futures, which measures the dollar against a basket of six other currencies, touched a 17-year high in March at 103.96 and is below 94 most recently. That is the lowest in almost two years.
New stimulus hope as Fed meets
Republicans were set to unveil their own proposals for another round of economic stimulus as the U.S. struggled to get a grip on the coronavirus.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said over the weekend that the package would include $1 trillion of relief. That is expected to include another round of $1,200 checks to individual taxpayers who earn below a certain income. It is also expected to include an extension of emergency unemployment checks, though at a lower amount than the current $600 a week pandemic unemployment assistance. 
On Tuesday, the Federal Open Market Committee begins the latest of its regular two-day meetings. The expectation is for the central bank to maintain rates near zero as it did in its last meeting, held just as the economy started to reopen after Covid-induced business shutdowns. The Fed's main task this week is to examine its commitment to zero rates and to an ongoing asset purchase program as it tries to jump-start the economy.
FANG earnings: All bark and no bite? 
FANG stocks pushed the market higher on Monday after selling off last week for the first time in two months. This is a big week for the tech giants, with  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google's Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) set to report earnings, along with a slew of other companies.
Analysts will likely be listening to what executives say about the outlook for the second half of the year. But the tech sector rally this year has gone against fears that Covid-related shutdowns would wreak damage on company earnings. Still, investors have begun to worry that the frothiness in the tech sector is pointing to another bubble that could burst at a moment's notice."

Despite its name, Fluffy has no fur. But the bright yellow robot, leased by  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) from Boston Dynamics Inc, can fetch pictures and videos of a car factory with its five 'eyes' to help engineers design upgrades for workspaces.
With an accurate camera scan, ""we can build those pieces within the workstation, and we can see if there's any interferences or if everything new is going to fit,"" said Mark Goderis, Ford's advanced manufacturing center digital engineering manager.
Fluffy, controlled by an engineer with a handheld device, can travel up to 3 miles per hour (4.8 kph) for about two hours on its battery.
Fluffy can also ride 'Scouter,' a small round robot, through a factory to save power, while the two companions gather data. Wherever Scouter cannot glide into, Fluffy can fill in the gaps.
The automaker is testing the robots at its Van Dyke Transmission Plant in Michigan. The robots' scans cost a fraction of the $300,000 needed for engineers to walk over millions of square feet in a factory to set up cameras on a tripod, Ford said in a statement. 
But the new engineers are just helpers, Goderis said.
""Our goal isn't to displace any of the workforce,"" he said, but ""automating our processes and making the engineers and people that work for our company more efficient and effective in building quality products.""
Boston does not provide lease terms but Fluffy's robot model, named 'Spot,' can be purchased for $74,500.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - California's attorney general and state and local agencies are investigating whether Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) has taken adequate steps to protect its workers from the coronavirus pandemic, according to a court filing on Monday.
Attorney General Xavier Becerra's office, California's Division of Occupational Safety and Health and the San Francisco Department of Public Health ""have all opened investigations into Amazon's practices"" around the pandemic, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Ethan Schulman wrote in the filing.
Chiyomi Brent, described as a picker who fills orders at Amazon's San Francisco Fulfillment Center, filed a lawsuit on June 11 contending the world's largest online retailer has put workers at ""needless risk."" The lawsuit alleges unsafe practices such as having workers share equipment such as freezer suits and failing to allow extra time for safe social distancing.
The attorney general's office declined to comment, and Amazon and the other agencies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Schulman refused to issue a preliminary injunction that would have closed the warehouse until more precautions were taken. He said Brent had failed to show risk of imminent harm and her concerns would be better handled by government investigators.
SFDPH told Schulman that Amazon's practices at the San Francisco facility had improved between visits on July 7 and July 16, while Cal/OSHA told the judge its investigation is ongoing following a July 14 inspection. 
The attorney general’s office told the court last week that its statewide Amazon investigation, which dates back to at least May, also is ongoing.
Amazon faced criticism for working conditions in its warehouses even before the coronavirus hit, and in April was accused of firing three critics of its pandemic response.
U.S. consumers have come to rely on Amazon to shop online and avoid the coronavirus, which has killed more than 146,00 Americans.
Amazon has argued in court papers that it has taken many steps to protect workers at the San Francisco facility, including requiring masks and extensively disinfecting equipment such as freezer suits. Amazon and SFDPH told the court that no coronavirus cases had been linked to the facility.

New York Attorney General Letitia James's office sent a letter to Amazon in April saying the online retailer may have violated safety measures and labor practices during the pandemic. The letter came after Amazon terminated Christian Smalls, a critic of the company's warehouse conditions in the pandemic, for violating a paid quarantine.

838,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 03:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Italy working to create single broadband champion independent of TIM - source,"By Giuseppe Fonte
ROME (Reuters) - Italy's government is studying a plan to create a single ultra-fast broadband network that could initially be majority-owned by phone incumbent  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) but would grant equal access to all market players, a person close to the matter told Reuters.
Rome is trying to broker a deal between former phone monopoly TIM and Open Fiber, which is controlled by utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI) and state lender CDP, to merge their fibre assets and create a national champion.
But differences over issues such as governance and regulation have created a deadlock.
TIM, which has both a retail and a wholesale arm, has repeatedly said it wants to keep control of any merged entity with Open Fiber, while European regulations favour the adoption of a non-vertically integrated model outside TIM's control.
To end the stalemate, Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri asked TIM and Enel to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) by the end of July, Reuters exclusively reported on July 11.
Governance of the future single network should be structured to guarantee ""its independence from the incumbent"", said the source asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The source said Rome was drawing on the Openreach model used in the United Kingdom while at the same time keeping network ownership structure open to other operators. 
""The next few days will be crucial,"" the source said.
Openreach is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BT which runs Britain’s nationwide broadband network as a legally separate entity. BT and rivals such as Sky and TalkTalk use its lines to provide broadband to their customers.
Under the government's proposal, still to be finalised, other phone operators would be invited to invest in the single grid, the source said, adding TIM was ready to accept such a condition.
Rome stepped up pressure to create a single network after TIM started talks with U.S. private equity fund KKR about selling 40% of its secondary, or last-mile, copper and fibre network, which could become the embryo of a single network.
A second source, also asking not to be named, said a binding offer from KKR could come as early as this week.

The Treasury, TIM, Enel and KKR all declined to comment.

In February, a committee of plaintiffs attorneys requested that U.S. District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland order a 7% fee assessment against any settlement. 
The request could amount to $3.3 billion, based on a $48 billion settlement proposal that five companies including Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) have been negotiating with various state attorneys general. 
Polster said in Monday's order he expected any eventual resolution of the lawsuits to include a method for paying the attorneys, so a fee order was unnecessary at this time but he left open the possibility of revisiting the request.
Since the fee request was made, three distributors, McKesson Corp (N:MCK), AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC) and  Cardinal Health  Inc (N:CAH), have offered another $1.2 billion to the proposed settlement to cover attorneys fees.
The lawsuits consolidated before Polster accuse drugmakers, distributors and pharmacy chains of fueling an opioid crisis blamed for 400,000 U.S. overdose deaths since 1999.
The companies have denied the allegations, although the distributors and drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA) reached a settlement with two Ohio counties last year to avoid a trial.
The lawsuits were filed by cities, counties and other local and tribal governments.
The committee of plaintiffs lawyers had argued that a ""default levy"" on settlement proceeds was needed in case the parties failed to agree on a method for paying attorneys' fees.
The fee request was opposed by the defendants as well as state attorneys general, who brought their own opioid cases that are not before Polster. They also said the fee could disrupt settlement talks.

FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), said on Monday it would end business worldwide with the companies most exposed to coal mining by 2025 at the latest, as part of a revamp of its policies on financing the fossil fuel industry.
The German lender's policy will cover companies making more than half their revenues from coal mining or, where that data is not available, those that have more than half of their reserves in coal. Effective immediately, Deutsche Bank said it would also cease financing new projects in the Arctic or oil sand projects. 
The reforms follow announcements earlier this year of new sustainability targets and the issuance of the bank's first green bond.
Urgewald, a non-profit environmental and human rights organisation, said the announcement was a step forward but ""still too little, too late"" and left the bank lagging many of its rivals in terms of ambition.
""Compared to international competitors the bank is still lagging behind on climate,"" it said, pointing to  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and Natwest Group, formerly Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS), as front runners.
Crucially, the new policy would still allow Deutsche Bank to lend to some of the world's biggest coal miners, including BHP (L:BHPB) (AX:BHP),  Anglo American  (L:AAL) and  Glencore  (L:GLEN), Urgewald said.
Deutsche Bank said it would review all of its U.S. and European coal power activities by the end of this year with respect to clients' diversification plans. It will begin a similar review in Asia in 2022.

Deutsche Chief Executive Christian Sewing said the new policy ""sets us ambitious targets and enables us to help our long-standing clients with their own transformation.""

The EU is leaning toward shortening a list of 13 states -- Canada, China, Japan and South Korea among them -- whose residents have the green light to visit the bloc, the officials said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because deliberations on Monday among experts were confidential.
The EU’s travel “white” list also includes Algeria, Australia, Georgia, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay.
Algeria and Morocco may be removed when EU member-country diplomats take a decision scheduled for Wednesday, according to one of the officials. The verdict will amount to a non-binding recommendation to EU national governments.
The EU is conducting its second biweekly review of a July 1 move to loosen a pandemic-induced curb on non-essential travel to the bloc. In the first review completed on July 17, the EU shortened the list from an original 15 states by removing Serbia and Montenegro as a result of new infections there.
A resurgence in virus cases around the world is hampering European efforts to emerge from national lockdowns and revive domestic economies during the summer tourist season.
The external-border recommendation covers 30 European countries: all EU member states except Ireland plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland because they are part of the bloc’s passport-free travel area.

Jean Castex said the ""fresh food train"" linking the main wholesale market in Paris to the southern city of Perpignan would reopen after that line was closed last year.
The line would eventually be connected to a broader European line between Antwerp (Belgium) and Barcelona (Spain), he said, and two new national North-South lines would be launched.
""This is a very strong signal the government is giving and it's a first step in the comeback of railway freight,"" Castex told reporters just outside Paris.
Freight trains will be able to use the country's railway infrastructure for free until the end of the year and the fee they normally pay will be halved in 2021, he added.
The Transport ministry later said those fee measures would cost 63 million euros ($74.02 million) a year.
Railways have steadily lost ground to lorries in France over recent decades and account for just 9% of the freight market, compared with 45% in 1974 and a European average of 18%.

(Reuters) -  Hasbro Inc  (O:HAS) missed analysts' estimates for quarterly earnings and revenue on Monday, as production shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to shortages of the company's board games.
Shares fell 6%, taking losses for the year to about 31% as the toymaker has struggled with store closures, movie and TV production delays that have hit its Entertainment One unit, and a drought of big-budget releases linked to its action figures. 
A surge in demand for ""Scrabble"", ""Jenga"" and ""Twister"" board games from stuck-at-home families looking for entertainment and ways to keep kids engaged has been a bright spot for Hasbro.
In the second quarter, however, factory closures in the United States, Ireland and India due to lockdowns disrupted supply just as toy stores reopened, triggering a 30% slump in net revenue in the United States and Canada.
In contrast, rival  Mattel Inc  (O:MAT) reported a 2% rise in North American net sales on resurgent demand for its Barbie dolls. 
Hasbro expects production to catch up by the end of the current quarter for a ""good"" holiday season, but industry experts were not enthused.
""Sales of games and puzzles are up 46% this year, as a lot of families loaded up on those. So, retailers are being cautious about not being overstocked as they know they won't be able to meet those sales numbers in 2021,"" said James Zahn, senior editor at trade magazine ""The Toy Book"". 
Hasbro expects strong ""Star Wars"" toy sales toward the end of the year from the second season of ""The Mandalorian"" on Disney+ and a planned animatronic ""Baby Yoda"" figure.
Net revenue fell 12.6% to $860.3 million and missed estimate of $992.2 million, according to Refinitiv data.
Revenue for Entertainment One, the company behind ""Peppa Pig"", fell 30%.
Excluding items, Hasbro earned 2 cents per share, falling short of estimates of 23 cents.

(Reuters) - Several major U.S. drugmakers will report second-quarter results this week, with investors eager for fresh details from  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE),  Merck & Co  (N:MRK) and others on their efforts to develop vaccines and therapies against the novel coronavirus.
The earnings reports, including from  Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD) - maker of one of the only treatments that has shown a benefit for hospitalized COVID-19 patients - will be closely watched for any developments that could help contain the pandemic, which has claimed some 650,000 lives worldwide and upended economies. 
The supply, pricing and profitability for these potential products also will be hot topics for companies reporting this week, including Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY), which is developing an antibody treatment for the still rapidly-spreading disease.
Earnings reports are also due from British drugmakers GlaxoSmithKline Plc (L:GSK) and AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN) and France's Sanofi (PA:SASY), which are working on vaccines in various stages of development.
Wall Street also will be looking for any signs of weakness in the companies' big-selling products as the virus runs rampant in many U.S. states, which may stop patients with other conditions from going to hospitals or doctors due to infection fears, as was seen earlier in the U.S. outbreak.
While shares of small vaccine developers have skyrocketed this year over optimism that their success could help end the pandemic, the picture has been more mixed for large U.S. drugmakers. The S&P 500 pharmaceuticals industry index <.SPLRCCARG> is down about 1% so far this year, against little change for the overall benchmark S&P 500 (SPX). (https://tmsnrt.rs/39xxPC7)
Globally, drugmakers are expected to increase second-quarter earnings per share by 2%, after they rose 17% in the first quarter, according to Cowen & Co.
""We are expecting a fairly solid set of results with most core products either not impacted by COVID-19 or recovering faster than expected,"" JP Morgan analysts said in note. 
Pfizer, which has released early data on its vaccine candidate being developed with German biotech BioNTech SE (F:22UAy), will kick off the week of drugmaker earnings on Tuesday morning. 
Investors will be looking for more details on the timing of the vaccine's development after the U.S. government agreed last week to pay nearly $2 billion to buy enough of it to inoculate 50 million people if it proves to be safe and effective.
Gilead's antiviral treatment, remdesivir, has become a key weapon for many countries after the intravenously administered medicine helped shorten hospital recovery times in a U.S. trial.
But the drug's supply has been an issue with cases spiking in much of the United States and elsewhere. Some other countries have voiced concerns over its availability after the U.S. government said in June it had secured nearly all supplies over the next three months.
""We expect they will sell as much as they can make for the next 6-plus months and it will be needed in 2021 as well,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Michael Yee said in a note ahead of Gilead's results on Thursday.

With Merck's experimental COVID-19 vaccine trailing others in development, its top-selling cancer drug Keytruda will be under scrutiny when the drugmaker reports results on Friday. Brokerages expect the blockbuster immunotherapy to recover after disappointing first-quarter sales.

850,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Goldman revamps employee reviews, opening door to greater job cuts","By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) is adopting a performance review system that will grade up to 10% of its 39,000 employees as under-performers this year, according to an internal memo sent on Monday, potentially leading to more job cuts in 2021 than the bank has made in recent years.
Goldman Sachs' new head of human resources, Bentley de Beyer, who joined the bank in January, is revamping its opaque performance review process to make it more transparent and determine what proportion of staff is put in each grouping, said bank spokeswoman Leslie Shribman.
The bank's main goal is to let staff know where they stand as roughly 90% of the bank's workforce works from home due to COVID-19 restrictions, said Shribman, who verified the contents of the memo seen by Reuters. 
Goldman Sachs' review changes are another sign that COVID-19 working restrictions are prompting some large corporations to overhaul their human resources policies.
""The dynamics of today’s challenges underscore the need for more transparency in feedback and even stronger communication between our people and their managers,"" Goldman Sachs Chief Executive David Solomon wrote in the memo to all staff. 
Under the new system, 25% of staff will be graded ""exceeds expectations,"" 65% will get ""fully meets expectations,"" and 10% will be marked as ""partially meets expectations"" in their annual reviews in December. 
Employees will also have more frequent formal performance check-ins with their managers - at least three times a year starting in 2021, according to the memo. Previously, they met to discuss performance only a couple of times annually.
The Wall Street bank has not disclosed the percentage of employees in each performance group previously and Shribman declined to say how the new percentages compare with the prior system.
Goldman Sachs is notorious for its tough annual review, which typically paves the way for a cull of roughly 5% of staff, often for missing performance targets. The bank has said the cuts allow it to hire a steady stream of new, diverse talent, which has become a priority over the past year.
It has not made major job cuts this year, and its headcount as of June 30 was actually up 10% from the year-ago period.
Shribman declined to say whether the changes would result in increased 2021 job cuts and said performance grades are just one factor in those considerations. 
Despite a tough economic environment caused by pandemic shutdowns, Goldman Sachs reported a 41% jump in quarterly revenue earlier this month on strong trading and investment banking income. 
Goldman Sachs' annual cull has long set it apart from Wall Street rivals, which tend to make mass layoffs periodically.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), for example, terminated 1,500 of its roughly 60,0000 staff last December. Its largest prior cut was 1,200 staff in 2015. 

Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, like leaders at several U.S. and European banks, has vowed no terminations in 2020 as the U.S. economy struggles with mass unemployment.

LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA) (HK:0005) aims to double the number of Black staff in senior roles by 2025, Chief Executive Noel Quinn said in an internal memo, as the bank attempts to take action against discrimination and create opportunities for advancement in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Black employees at the bank have said in internal meetings that they have felt overlooked for career opportunities and ""uninspired by the lack of senior role models"", Quinn said in a memo to all staff seen by Reuters on Monday.
A spokeswoman for HSBC confirmed the contents of the memo.
HSBC held meetings with Black staff following the spotlight put on systemic racism in the United States and worldwide after the killing of George Floyd in May.
Black employees in those meetings said ""HSBC has not been strong or vocal enough as an organisation on matters that concern them,"" Quinn told staff in the memo.
In response Quinn said the bank would aim to double by 2025 the number of Black staff at ""GCB3"" or higher level, a senior rank in the firm's hierarchy equivalent to director.
The bank did not say what proportion of its current senior employees are Black.
""The Black Lives Matter movement has rightly created more urgent demand for action,"" Quinn said.
""I want us to be judged by the concrete, sustainable actions we take to be a more diverse and inclusive bank.""
The move by HSBC to promote and hire more senior Black employees follows similar moves by other banks around the world including Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY).

HSBC has also hired a recruiting firm to help it engage Black and ethnically diverse talent for leadership roles, Quinn said.

857,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 11:40AM ET</span>",Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina to step down,"By Trisha Roy
(Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA) said on Monday its biggest shareholder, Stefano Pessina, will step down as the chief executive officer after five years at the helm, during which the pharmacy group's value more than halved. 
Pessina, 79, appointed as the CEO in 2015 following the merger between Walgreens and Alliance Boots, would assume the role of executive chairman once a new CEO is appointed, the company said.
Walgreens has been struggling with disappointing performance in its Boots UK unit, stiff retail competition, especially from Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), and reimbursement pressures, largely due to low generic drug prices.
The COVID-19 pandemic has further added to the woes of the company, which had to resort to store closures, job cuts and suspension of share repurchases at Boots.
Bringing in a new CEO makes sense as Walgreen's stock price has lagged over the last five years due to changes in the pharmacy landscape and vertical consolidation in U.S. healthcare services squeezing both growth and margins at the company, Evercore ISI analyst Elizabeth Anderson said.
""We would have preferred this announcement to be accompanied by an update on a chosen new CEO, but believe the company should cast a wide net to bring in fresh perspectives."" 
Shares of the Deerfield, Illinois company were down 3% at $39.28 in early trade. 
""I look forward to continuing to serve the company as executive chairman, and to helping to ensure the success of the new chief executive officer in every way possible,"" said Pessina, who owns 16% stake in Walgreens, according to Refinitiv data. 
Under Pessina, the company has https://reut.rs/332EmmT explored several strategic partnerships and acquisitions including whether to go private following private equity interest.

Executive chairman James Skinner will step down, but will remain on the board, Walgreens added.

859,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 11:36AM ET</span>","Exclusive: EU talks with Pfizer, Sanofi, J&J on COVID vaccines hit snags - sources","By Francesco Guarascio and Elvira Pollina
BRUSSELS/MILAN (Reuters) - European efforts to secure potential COVID-19 vaccines from  Pfizer  (N:PFE), Sanofi (PA:SASY) and Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) are mired in wrangles over price, payment method and potential liability costs, three EU officials told Reuters.
The bloc is in talks with at least six vaccine makers to acquire up front doses of potential shots against the novel coronavirus, officials told Reuters earlier in July, in a strategy meant to increase the chances of having COVID-19 vaccines for its population.
Despite the urgency to seal deals amid a global race to secure the most promising shots, the EU is struggling to reach swift agreements, said the officials, who are involved in the talks, and declined to be named because the negotiations are confidential.
The United States, meanwhile, has already inked two supply agreements with AstraZeneca (L:AZN) and Pfizer among other major funding deals.
The EU's negotiations with Johnson & Johnson are among the most advanced but have yet to conclude amid a back-and-forth over how to share liability costs if the potential vaccine showed unexpected side-effects, two of the officials told Reuters. 
Johnson & Johnson had no immediate comment.
France's Sanofi is negotiating to supply 300 million doses of the potential vaccine it is developing with British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc (L:GSK) to the EU and wants an immediate upfront payment for the entire stock, two officials said.
But the EU wants to pay in tranches and delay some payments until the vaccine has passed large clinical trials, the officials said.
This has caused ""some hurdles,"" one of the officials said. 
A spokesman for Sanofi declined to comment.
A spokesman for the Commission, which is leading EU talks with drugmakers, declined to comment.
Aside from the Pfizer, Sanofi and Johnson & Johnson discussions, the EU is also in talks with biotech companies  Moderna  (O:MRNA) and Germany's CureVac, officials told Reuters earlier in July.
Moderna and CureVac were not immediately available to comment. 
A deal with AstraZeneca (L:AZN) for its vaccine under development with Oxford University was struck by four large EU countries in June and is now about to be completed for the whole 27-nation bloc, officials said.
One official said the EU was seeking to seal three or four advance purchase deals. 
""OVER BUDGET""
The most complex talks appear to be with Pfizer and BioNtech which are developing a vaccine using an experimental technology known as messenger RNA, or mRNA, which has not been approved for commercial use by medical authorities. 
The two firms want the EU to pay them for 500 million doses only if their COVID-19 vaccine is authorised, one official told Reuters.
This might eliminate the EU's risk of losing money should the shot prove unsuccessful. But the bloc fears that if it waits for the vaccine to be proved effective, the bill could be much higher and they risk going ""over budget,"" one of the officials said.
In a further potential complication, some EU negotiators have raised doubts about mRNA, which is also used in the potential COVID vaccines developed by Moderna and CureVac.
Pfizer and BioNtech are also discussing liability issues with EU negotiators, a fourth person familiar with the talks told Reuters.
Pfizer and BioNTech declined to comment.
The U.S. government last week agreed to pay nearly $2 billion to buy enough of the vaccine being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech to inoculate 50 million people, but with payments conditional on their vaccine being successful in large clinical trials.
The price agreed under that deal of nearly $40 per course of treatment is considered too high by the EU, officials told Reuters last week.
The EU is relying on about 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) from an emergency fund to finance its possible deals with vaccine makers, which could be topped up with payments from EU governments.
For instance, the agreement with AstraZeneca initially negotiated by Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands cost the four countries 750 million euros for 300 million doses of the potential shot, an Italian official said, with an option to buy a further 100 million doses.
That works out at 2.5 euros per dose.
It is not clear whether under ongoing talks that money will now be provided by the EU emergency fund.

861,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>","Bitcoin Jumps Above $10,000 for the First Time in Six Weeks","(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin rose above $10,000 for the first time in more than six weeks amid the global rally in risk assets.
The digital token spiked around 6 a.m. New York time on Sunday, rising as high as $10,169, according to pricing compiled by Bloomberg. The gains quickly fizzled, initially, then the coin rallied again later, climbing 4.7% to $10,357 as of 10:11 a.m. in New York.
Bitcoin, which crypto fans have often touted as “digital gold,” is in favor as the yellow metal nears record levels, concerns rise about the health of the world economy and the dollar falls. Also, last week, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said American banks can provide custody services for customers’ crypto assets, which could help boost the asset class’s appeal with some investors.
The cryptocurrency had been hovering near its 50-day moving average for weeks before pulling above it in the past couple of days.
“We remain positive on the overall precise structure for Bitcoin and do expect it push through $10,000-$10,500 as part of its longer term bullish technical profile,” said Rob Sluymer, technical strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors LLC. Even so, that range “remains a resistance band that Bitcoin will need to break above to signal its next move to resistance at $13,800.”
If the largest cryptocurrency can take out the $10,500 level, it could catapult much higher and test this year’s high, technical indicators suggest. At the same time, another technical gauge is indicating Bitcoin might see a pullback as its 14 Day RSI is nearing 80, far above the 70 level that indicates overbought and is near the level that killed Bitcoin’s last run in early May.
Bitcoin has enjoyed above-average flows this year, and those flows are relatively high versus their five-year average when compared with those of exchange traded funds in other asset classes, according to a report from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. strategist John Normand on Friday.

U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla said on Friday she intended to hold a hearing on the matter, with the strong possibility of witness testimony. Saying the two men had asked her to “make some very very serious factual conclusions about the conduct of the government,” she gave federal prosecutors a month to make a full review of their handling of the case.
“I need to understand what happened,” the judge said.
The allegations raise the prospect of another major black eye for Manhattan federal prosecutors, who handle some of the nation’s most politically charged investigations. Barely a week ago, a judge dismissed the conviction of businessman Ali Sadr Hashemi Nejad for Iran-sanctions violations after the government admitted failing to turn over exculpatory evidence to the defense.
A second setback would be a blow to an office that has long prided itself on its independence and thoroughness.
A spokesman for Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss, who assumed office last month after Attorney General William Barr ousted her predecessor, Geoffrey Berman, declined to comment.

The case before Failla was touted by the government as “one of the largest mismarking schemes ever prosecuted.” Anilesh “Neil” Ahuja, the co-founder of the defunct hedge fund Premium Point Investments, and one of its traders, Jeremy Shor, were convicted last July of scheming to overstate the value of the company’s holdings by more than $100 million to attract new investors and prevent withdrawals.
Ahuja was sentenced to spend 50 months in prison and Shor received nearly 3 1/2 years.
But earlier this month, defense attorneys for the two men said documents they recently uncovered through a Freedom of Information Act request show that one of the government’s key cooperating witnesses read an allocution, or sworn statement of facts, when he pleaded guilty to a role in the scheme that was virtually identical to one drafted by prosecutors.
Ahuja and Shor say this shows the cooperating witnesses were willing to say whatever prosecutors wanted. They asked the judge to let them seek more evidence, including records of oral communications with lawyers for the witnesses, and hold a hearing to ensure that the government has met its obligation to turn over anything that might potentially clear them.
“We are entitled to know what else is out there,” Richard Tarlowe, an attorney for Ahuja, told the judge during a conference on Friday. “The emails do quite clearly in our view show that there was a deliberate effort taken to avoid putting things in emails to avoid disclosing them.”
Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrea Griswold on Friday acknowledged that prosecutors didn’t hand over to the defense all of the evidence that they should have, but said what they did produce reflected a “careful review” of its file in the case.
Griswold also said there was nothing improper about prosecutors providing input to defense lawyers on cooperating witness’ allocutions. She said Ahuja and Shor’s lawyers were simply trying to find anything they could to attack the government.
The case is U.S. v. Ahuja, 18-cr-00328, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Monday, losing premarket gains amid ongoing uncertainty about the latest stimulus bill to be prepared by Congress.
Expectations that the Federal Reserve will signal a shift to an even looser monetary policy stance at its meeting this week offered some support, as did a modest decline in infection rates at the weekend of some the states hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as a continued rebound in durable goods orders in June.
Despite losing a week to internal divisions, Republican Senators are also likely to present their latest stimulus proposals on Monday, according to weekend reports quoting White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.  Reports have suggested that the Senate will propose extending the crucial weekly checks that have supported the millions of Americans who lost their jobs since April. However, they appear not to include any money specifically for state and city governments, putting the Senate on a collision course with the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives. The two chambers have little time to hammer out a compromise, but one is still likely given the reluctance of either party, only four months from the election, to be blamed for the consequences. 
Even so, few seemed in the mood to add to risk positions, with Gold Futures and Silver Futures seeing the bulk of speculative flows rather than equities. Gold hit a new all-time high while silver surged to its highest level in seven years.
By 9:40 AM ET (1330 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 14 points, or less than 0.1%, at 26,456 points. The S&P 500 was up by 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was up by 1.1%, thanks largely to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) gaining over 2% on the back of broker recommendations. 
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) stock also gained another 10% on expectations that it will profit from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)'s inability to start production of the latest generation of chip technology until late 2022 at the earliest. TSM's biggest business is making the chips that other firms design.
Gold mining stocks thrived in line with the price for the underlying asset. Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) gained 5.4% to a seven-year high, while Newmont Goldcorp (NYSE:NEM) rose 4.0% to a new record high.
Earlier, Commerce Department data showed that durable goods orders continued to recover in June, rising another 7.3%. However, the data are little more than a warm-up act for the first reading of second-quarter gross domestic product, which is due on Thursday."

Last year, the company said it was cooperating with federal investigators in connection with a probe about whether it shifted sales from quarter to quarter to meet objectives.
While a Wells notice does not necessarily mean the recipients have violated any law, the SEC issues the letter to firms when it is planning to bring an enforcement action against them.

867,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 08:15AM ET</span>",AstraZeneca bets up to $6 billion on new Daiichi cancer drug,"By Pushkala Aripaka
(Reuters) - AstraZeneca (L:AZN) will pay up to $6 billion to Japan's Daiichi Sankyo (T:4568) under the drugmakers' second multi-billion dollar oncology collaboration to develop and market a new type of targeted cancer treatment.
The British drugmaker has been bolstering its portfolio of cancer therapies, particularly ADCs, a major area of focus for the company as it also ploughs on with its coronavirus vaccine candidate.
AstraZeneca said on Monday it would make staggered upfront payments totalling $1 billion to Daiichi for an experimental drug called DS-1062, which belongs to a promising class of therapies called antibody drug conjugates (ADC).
Further payments would depend on certain regulatory and sales achievements. The deal will not affect 2020 earnings forecast, AstraZeneca said.
""We see significant potential in this antibody drug conjugate in lung as well as in breast and other cancers that commonly express TROP2,"" AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said, referring to a protein found on some cancer cell surfaces. 
Astra said the drug could bring $1 billion or more in annual sales, taking to six the number of its cancer drug hopefuls with so-called blockbuster revenue potential.
JP Morgan analysts said since AstraZeneca's upfront commitments were spread over three years it could still keep previous dividend commitments. 
Analysts have previously said the group needed to be mindful of indebtedness and ability to pay dividends after a similar deal last year with financial commitments to Daiichi of as much as $6.9 billion.
That deal also involved an ADC, targeting the HER2 protein seen in many breast cancers. It is now sold as Enhertu.
Astra's shares were 0.6% lower at 1118 GMT, while Daiichi stock closed 3% higher.
Preliminary data in May on DS-1062 from a Phase 1 lung cancer trial played a large role in convincing the British drugmaker of the compound, Jose Baselga Astra's head of oncology research said.
""From there we are going straight to Phase 3 studies that will launch this year,"" which may lead to a request for marketing approval, he added.
Use for breast cancer would be pursued next, Baselga said. 
DS-1062, which targets the TROP2 protein, belongs to the ADC category of drugs, which link powerful cell toxins to antibodies that cling to cancer cells and spare healthy cells that are damaged during conventional chemotherapy treatments. 
An anti-TROP2 ADC called Trodelvy developed by  Immunomedics  (O:IMMU) won U.S. regulatory approval in April to treat an aggressive type of breast cancer, while Chinese firms Kelun Group and Bio-Thera Solutions (SS:688177) are also working on TROP2-based biotech drugs.
In a further boost to AstraZeneca's oncology unit, two of its on-market therapies, one for lung cancer and another for blood cancer, won regulatory endorsements for expanded use in Europe. 

The drugmakers have also been in talks over supply of the British company's coronavirus vaccine in Japan.

The company's shares, which were listed on the New York Stock Exchange in June, were up about 2% in premarket trading.
Albertsons, one of the largest food and drug retailers in the country, has benefited from a shift toward shopping for groceries online during the virus outbreak, as consumers stay indoors and cook more meals at home.
""We have accelerated our digital and e-commerce strategy to adapt to market conditions,"" Chief Executive Officer Vivek Sankaran said.
The company's stores, including Albertsons, Safeway, Vons and others, together saw e-commerce sales more than triple during the quarter.
Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons said gross margins rose to 29.8% from 28% a year earlier, due to reduced inventory shrinkage and lower promotional activity.
Net sales and other revenue rose about 21% to $22.75 billion for the first quarter ended June 20.
Net income rose to $586.2 million, or $1 per share, in the reported quarter, from $49 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier, when it recorded impairment losses.

On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.35 per share, 5 cents above analysts' estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Monday, buoyed by hope of prompt delivery of new fiscal stimulus during a busy week of corporate earnings and ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting.
At 07:00 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 24 points, or 0.8%, higher, Nasdaq Futures up 183 points, or 1.7%. The Dow Futures contract rose 166 points, or 0.6%. 
Senate Republicans are set to release their proposal for the next coronavirus relief bill, after some disagreements with the White House, and GOP lawmakers, potentially as early as Monday.
Still, this doesn’t leave much negotiating time, with millions of Americans on the verge of losing expanded unemployment benefits. Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, want the enhanced benefits of $600 per week to be extended and are likely to look for more stimulus than the Republicans' $1 trillion plan.
Adding to the positive tone was the news that reported cases and fatalities fell in many states hit hard by the virus, including Florida, Arizona, California and Texas. The daily death toll also dipped under 1,000 on Sunday for the first time in four days.
That said, more than 146,000 Americans have died of Covid-19, nearly a quarter of the global total, and there are nearly 4.2 million confirmed cases in the country, 
The Federal Reserve meets this week, with its two-day get together scheduled to conclude on Wednesday, although new moves are unlikely.
The focus at the “FOMC meeting will once again be on forward guidance and how to best underpin the recovery. Any formal decisions will though still be too premature,” said Morten Lund, an analyst at Nordea, in a research note.
Meanwhile, the earnings season continues, with this week set to see around a third of the S&P 500 companies reporting, including 12 Dow components. In total, 128 S&P 500 members have already reported, with earnings down 40% year to date.
Of the major companies, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is due on Wednesday, while tech bellwether Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), along with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are set to report on Thursday.
U.S. economic data Monday centers around June’s durable goods, at 8:30 AM ET, which are expected to rise 7.2%, down from a gain of 15.7% in May.
Oil prices were a little lower Monday, with U.S. crude futures trading 0.5% lower at $41.10 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.5% to $43.58.
“Market participants appear to be nervous in taking a strong view either way on the market, with plenty of uncertainty still clouding the outlook when it comes to demand,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1.7% to $1,929.50/oz, not far off the record high of $1,937.60 per ounce hit earlier Monday, surpassing a peak touched in September 2011, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1698, up 0.4%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (N:MCD),  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX), Yum Brands Inc (N:YUM) and other big restaurant chains could show improving sales, based on early results from rivals such as  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG) that improved despite dining rooms shuttered for months.
Large brands have been able to shift quickly to simplified menus, mobile ordering, pick-up, drive-thru and delivery to get food to customers quickly and with less face-to-face contact.
Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (N:CMG) sales have risen 6.4% so far in July, the company reported on Wednesday.
After surveying McDonald's franchisees, Kalinowski Equity Research last week raised its projection for comparable McDonald's sales for the current quarter to 2.4% from flat.
Restaurants and bar receipts started 2020 at a record $65.55 billion in January, plunged to $30 billion in April - the lowest since December 2003 - and came back to $47.425 billion in June, according to the Commerce Department's monthly retail sales report.
Soaring coronavirus cases in Florida and Texas - where Bloomin' Brands Inc (O:BLMN) has 286 company-owned locations - have not dampened sales there despite restrictions on how many people can dine in at once, the company said on Friday.
Bloomin Chief Executive Officer David Deno told Reuters that ""people want to go out... and you're seeing that in our trends.""
Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (O:DNKN), Cheesecake Factory Inc (O:CAKE) and  Shake Shack Inc  (N:SHAK) also report financial results this week.
To be sure, with coronavirus cases hitting record highs, better sales are far from confirmed.
Total transactions at major U.S. restaurant chains fell by 14% in the week ended July 12 versus a year ago – compared to a smaller 11% drop the prior week, according to data analytics firm The NPD Group Inc.
Separately, U.S. dining food and supply orders in the United States had been recovering but dropped 15.4% during the week ending July 11 from the week before, as tracked by Buyers Edge Platform, a restaurant group purchasing organization and supply chain company.
Changes to enhanced unemployment insurance could also dampen consumer spending at some restaurants. Congress expected to consider legislation next week that may extend the benefits.
Nonetheless, Del Taco Restaurants Inc (O:TACO) sales improved during the first five weeks of the current quarter, it reported on Thursday.
""Absent a major setback from the pandemic, we believe that the worst of it may be behind us,"" Chief Executive Officer John Cappasola said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Gold soared to an all-time high on worsening ties between China and the United States, a weakening dollar and ultra-low interest rates on Monday, while stock markets looked uncertain before a corporate earnings deluge.
Europe's equity markets saw a subdued start, perhaps still hurting after their first weekly drop in four and as the euro's fastest gains since early 2016 took it through $1.17 [/FRX], but it was the precious metals surge that dominated.
Gold rose another 1.6% to a record high of $1,943 per ounce, surpassing its gains in September 2011. Silver climbed another 5.5% to take its July streak past 30%, which would be its best month on record. 
A lot of factors were in play for markets, said Shafali Sachdev, the head of FX Asia at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Wealth Management in Singapore, from U.S.-China tensions to a second wave of coronavirus outbreaks.
""If you look at the fact that the dollar's been higher yielding than many other currencies for quite a while, and with some of the benefits of that being eroded ... and also the continued demand for a safe haven, it all plays into gold's strengthening,"" she said.
""And at this point there doesn't seem any obvious factor that could help the trend to draw to a close.""
European stocks cut some of their early losses after data from Germany showed an improvement in business morale, but it was going to be an effort to get out of the red.
Travel and leisure stocks were down 3%, with UK-based airlines and tour operators such as TUI AG,, Easyjet, British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) falling 8% and to 13.5% after Britain imposed a 14-day quarantine on travellers returning from Spain, where coronavirus cases are rising again. 
Asia was also choppy. A 10% rally in Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC helped some other tech shares across the region, after U.S. rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) saw its shares plunge more than 16% on Friday.
""Chipmaking machine makers may see reduced demand from Intel for now, but as the jump in TSMC shows, markets are not pessimistic about the semiconductor industry,"" said Yasuo Imanaka, chief analyst at Rakuten Securities.
Elsewhere, mainland Chinese shares gave up most of their early gains, with the CSI300 index closing up just 0.2%, after steep losses on Friday. 
Japan's Nikkei fell 0.2%, though S&P500 futures steadied and were last up 0.4% in Europe. (N)
Global shares had lost steam late last week after Washington ordered China's consulate in Houston to close, prompting Beijing to close the U.S. consulate in Chengdu.

One key for markets this week will be earnings releases from the world's main tech companies. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reports on Wednesday, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are all due. 
Hopes for a quick U.S. economic recovery are fading as coronavirus infections showed few signs of slowing. That means the economy could capitulate without fresh support from the government, with some of the earlier steps such as enhanced jobless benefits due to expire this month.
Investors hope U.S. Congress will agree on a deal before its summer recess. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the package will contain extended unemployment benefits with 70% ""wage replacement"" -- but there are some sticking points. 
Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, want enhanced unemployment benefits of $600 per week to be extended and look to much bigger stimulus compared with the Republicans' $1 trillion plan.
Concerns about the U.S. economic outlook have also started to weigh on the dollar. The dollar index dropped 0.5% to its lowest level in nearly two years.
The euro gained 0.5% to $1.1711, hitting a 22-month high, after a European agreement on a recovery fund last week supported sentiment toward the common currency.
Against the yen, the dollar slipped 0.5% to 105.605 yen, a four-month low while the British pound hit a 4 1/2-month high of $1.2832.
Oil prices were capped on worries about the worsening Sino-U.S. relations.
Brent futures slipped 0.05% to $43.32 per barrel. U.S. crude futures were flat at $41.29.

875,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 05:33AM ET</span>",StockBeat: U.K.'s Spanish Quarantine Hits Fragile Confidence,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The U.K.’s decision to impose a two-week quarantine on travelers returning from Spain has put a chill on European stock markets Monday, puncturing assumptions that Europe would avoid a second wave of the coronavirus and casting doubt over their ability to outperform U.S. stocks for once.
Predictably, travel stocks have been the worst affected, with tour operator Tui (DE:TUIGn) stock falling 12.8%, U.K. rival  Dart Group Plc  (LON:DTG) (owner of Jet2) falling 11.3% and EasyJet PLC (LON:EZJ) stock falling 10.5%.  
Spanish hotel operator Melia Hotels (MC:MEL) stock fell 7.4%, while Swiss-listed Dufry AG (SIX:DUFN) stock fell 6.0% as the market digested the risk of another hit to business at its duty-free shops.
Beyond the sectors directly affected by travel, Spanish bank stocks also retreated sharply, with Sabadell (MC:SABE) stock and  Bankia  SA (MC:BKIA) stock falling 4.6% and 3.7%, respectively. Caixabank, BBVA (MC:BBVA) and Santander (MC:SAN) were also down by more than 2% each.
The moves, which pushed the IBEX 35 index down 1.5% and contributed to a 0.4% drop in the Stoxx 600, underline how closely market performance is tied to the actual state of the medical emergency, which - until a fully effective vaccine is widely distributed - is the overriding factor determining the health of the economy.
Spain was one of the countries worst hit by the first wave of the virus, imposing one of the tightest lockdown regimes in all of Europe with - eventually - clear success. However, the importance of the tourism sector to the economy left officials with little choice but to reopen before the summer, and that has allowed the virus to regain momentum. The rate of new infections has tripled since June, with several new hotspots linked to bars and other places of social gatherings. The economically vital region of Catalonia closed all bars, clubs and indoor restaurants on Friday.
The surge isn’t limited to Spain. Countries as diverse as Belgium and Poland have also been registering increases in new infections in recent days. Across the continent, localized flare-ups in meat processing plants and other workplaces where social distancing is difficult are appearing with increased frequency, raising regular challenges to virus containment at national level.
Last week’s purchasing managers’ indices from IHS Markit suggested that there had been no visible impact on business confidence from the emerging signs of a second wave. The Eurozone composite PMI showed the economy returning to growth, with its highest reading since July 2018.
That pattern was – sort of - reinforced on Monday by Germany’s most accurate confidence survey, published by the research institute Ifo. Ifo’s business climate index rose to 90.3 in July from 86.3 in June, a little more than expected. However, while it’s relatively easier to check a box that says things will be better in six months’ time, it was notable that the ‘current conditions’ sub-index improved by less than expected and was still at a level near the worst of the 2008/2009 crisis. Things may be getting better, but they are doing so slowly, and taking one step back for every two steps forward.

""Improve services lest we be forced to take drastic steps,"" he said during his state of the nation address. ""Might just as well close all of you.""
The country at present has two major telecoms firms PLDT (PS:TEL) and  Globe Telecom  (PS:GLO) and Duterte had previously threatened their closure while campaigning for office in 2016. 

Those companies have repeatedly defended their services and investment in improvements and said excessive government bureaucracy has prevented faster network upgrades.

The announcement sent its shares up over 11% on Monday. 
The more than 50-year-old retailer has faced stream of lawsuits after revealing holes in its accounts in December 2017, the first sign of the fraud estimated to total $7 billion, and is still battling to recover. 
Chief Executive Louis du Preez said the company had been working for 12 months to put together the settlement, which will cover cases from the Netherlands to South Africa, and urged all claimants to support it. 
""Although there is no certainty yet that we will be able to conclude this settlement, in our view these terms are firmly in the best interests of all stakeholders,"" he said in a statement.
While creditors, regulators and claimants still need to approve the proposal, if accepted the settlement would remove a huge question mark over the struggling company's survival. 
Steinhoff would have to liquidate if required to pay more than 90 separate legal claims against it in full, it said, damaging the prospects of claimants getting paid and marking the end of what was once a prize South African company. 
Dutch shareholder group VEB said it will publish its response to the proposal after trading hours close in the Netherlands. 
Other claimants, including South African businessman Christo Wiese, did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while some could not be reached.
Totalling around $1 billion altogether with separate sums offered for different groups of claimants, the settlement covers only a fraction of the value of the claims following the scandal. 
These stood at over 9 billion euros in 2019, according to Steinhoff's annual report. Some claims would not be covered by the settlement, Steinhoff said. 

The value would be paid in cash and shares in retailer South African retailer Pepkor (J:PPHJ), a Steinhoff subsidiary.

Investing.com - European stock markets sold off Monday, with sharp losses in the travel sector amid fears of a second Covid-19 wave in Europe.
At 3:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.5% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.5%. 
The decision by the United Kingdom over the weekend to quarantine visitors from popular holiday destination Spain due to rising coronavirus cases there has hit the travel sector hard.

Worries about a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Europe, and the damage this could cause not only to the Spanish tourist season, have overshadowed positive corporate news from China earlier Monday.
Earnings at China's large industrial companies in June rose at the strongest pace since March last year, surging 11.5% from a year earlier in June, nearly doubling the 6.0% increase in May, the National Bureau of Statistics said Monday.
China is a vital export market for many European companies, and signs of a recovery there will boost optimism about the way forward for the region’s corporate sector, which returned to growth in July according to preliminary PMIs released on Friday.
Elsewhere, the German Ifo index complemented last week's upbeat PMI message, rising slightly more than expected in July. .
Elsewhere, SAP (DE:SAPG) stock rose 2.7% after the German software company increased its operating profit and revenue in the second quarter, extending a run of improved performance since ditching its co-CEO model last year. 
Royal KPN NV (AS:KPN) dropped 3.3% despite net profit rising 6.3% in the second quarter, with the Dutch telecommunications company citing lower restructuring costs and the sale of unit KPN Consulting.
Oil prices were a little lower Monday, with U.S. crude futures trading 0.5% lower at $41.10 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.5% to $43.58.

882,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 03:09AM ET</span>",Shutdown of America’s Chengdu Consulate Caps Week of China Tensions,"(Bloomberg) -- The lowering of the American flag from the consulate in Chengdu caps a week in which U.S.-China relations spiraled to new lows, engulfing global markets and businesses.
For months now, ties between the world’s two biggest economies have been marred by allegations of espionage and intellectual-property theft, a blame game over the coronavirus pandemic, criticism of China’s tightening grip over Hong Kong and its treatment of Muslims in Xinjiang along with sanctions and restrictions on the flow of goods, technology and people.
Chinese authorities took over the American mission in the southwestern Chinese city Monday, less than three days after the U.S. government forced their Chinese counterparts out of their consulate in Houston. The evictions follow a provocative speech from Secretary of State Michael Pompeo in which he said “securing our freedoms from the Chinese Communist Party is the mission of our time.”
The tensions have helped snap a bullish run for markets on both sides of the Pacific, with the dollar dropping, gold rising and stocks falling Friday -- and starting the new week mixed.
Arthur Kroeber, a veteran watcher of China’s economy and a founding partner at research firm Gavekal Dragonomics, summed up Pompeo’s speech like this: “If this barrage of rhetoric does not qualify as a declaration of intent to wage cold war, it is hard to know what would.”
Global businesses -- which have been navigating the U.S.-China trade war for two years now -- are being swept up in the latest escalation. U.S. Attorney General William Barr said this month that companies including Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). have become pawns of China, while President Donald Trump said he was considering banning ByteDance Ltd.’s short video app TikTok as retaliation over China’s handling of the coronavirus.
Chinese President Xi Jinping’s government has retaliated with measures that include unspecified sanctions on defense contractor  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT). after the U.S. approved a possible $620 million deal to supply missile parts to Taiwan. And it has threatened to blacklist companies over other issues too.
British based  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) was forced to respond to media reports over its dealings with Huawei Technologies Co. by denying it “framed” the Chinese telecom giant that is subject to a U.S. probe. That came just weeks after the London based lender had to pledge approval of tough new security laws imposed by Beijing on Hong Kong.
Creeping decoupling that began with trade barriers is moving into the technological, financial and diplomatic spheres, according to Joerg Wuttke, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. “The implications for European companies are considerable, and overwhelmingly negative,” he said.
Indeed, the U.S.-China rivalry is increasingly going global. Japan’s government plans to subsidize some companies to invest in factories at home and in Southeast Asia as part of efforts to reduce reliance on manufacturing in China. Tensions have also flared between China and key trading partners including Australia, India and the U.K.
While political pressure on foreign companies in China has long been a downside to winning access to one of the world’s biggest markets, the recent spiral is risks making real former U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson’s warning that China and the U.S. could raise an “economic Iron Curtain.”
Only a “phase one” trade deal signed in January remains as a linchpin to the relationship. But talks on phase two look increasingly remote and even Trump says the first deal means less to him now.
“The rules of the game for business have changed profoundly in the past year,” said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “We have moved in a very short time from a period in which U.S. and other companies were encouraged to invest and expand in China to a situation where the U.S. government, and to some extent the Japanese and European governments, are actively discouraging such engagement.”
Skeptics say it won’t be easy to square the hawkish rhetoric with the deep economic linkages between the U.S. and China, a stark difference to the circumstances of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Few are predicting an immediate exodus of either companies or investment from China.
“Decoupling is not physically possible if the pursuit of profit is the main motive,” Charles Liu, a former Chinese diplomat and founder of Hao Capital told Bloomberg Television.
Other contradictions include the continued expansion of U.S. financial firms into China, the ongoing listing of Chinese firms in New York and the flood of foreign money, including American, into China’s stock and bond markets. Neither is it clear there’s a global alliance following the U.S. hawkish lead as both the EU and others negotiate with China on better access.
Still, the forced closures of the diplomatic consulates made clear there’s no floor under where those strains are headed, right at a time when the world economy is fighting its worst slump since the Great Depression due to the pandemic. Beijing has accused the Trump administration of stirring up hysteria and has warned it to think “carefully.”
If the zero-sum game takes hold in Washington “businesses will have to make some very hard choices about how much exposure to China they can afford to have,” according to Kroeber.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
Even as the trade war raged, businesses could console themselves with the knowledge that the ultimate aim of the Trump administration was fairer conditions for commerce between the two countries. The darker vision painted in recent speeches by Pompeo, Barr, and O’Brien is one of existential conflict between two fundamentally opposed systems. If that is the new policy in D.C., consolation for businesses attempting to work across the divide will be harder to find.
--Tom Orlik
The specter of a bipolar economic system is evident in rival systems of technology and the internet. Some big Chinese tech firms are choosing to go public closer to home with billionaire Jack Ma’s Ant Group seeking a valuation north of $200 billion for a listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai, rather than New York.
Avoiding the political tensions won’t be easy, whether it’s a garment company that has sourced cotton from Xinjiang or a bank that falls foul of sanctions covering Hong Kong, according to Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist with Natixis SA.
In the meantime, China is powering ahead with its own industrial strategy and continues to promise foreign competitors better access. In a recent symposium attended by executives from  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)., Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp. and others, Xi said China would stand on the “correct side of history.”
“Chinese leaders have been emphasizing strengthening a self sustaining economy lately and are digging trenches as the U.S. is digging in its heels,” said Hao Hong, chief strategist at Bocom International.

LONDON (Reuters) - Returning to the office will bring new challenges for banks and brokerages seeking to enforce good conduct by staff, after the bulk of their employees worked from home during the coronavirus pandemic, a financial markets industry body said on Monday.
During lockdowns to stem the outbreak in big financial centres like London, dealers have faced compliance challenges as they trade currencies, stocks, bonds and commodities from kitchens and bedrooms. Many firms did not allow working from home before the pandemic.
Regulators have worried about financial firms' ability to maintain good trading standards while compliance teams were out of sight, but even with employees now drifting back to the office, new types of risks are emerging.
""People will feel under certain pressures to return, particularly if you see half of your team back in the office in close proximity to the leadership,"" said Martin Pluves, chief executive of the FICC Markets Standards Board (FMSB).
""Then there will be pressures on people who feel there is an A Team and a B Team and that could drive certain behaviours. That is something firms are and need to look at as we move more into a hybrid model.""
In order to maintain social distancing in offices, many firms have split their workforce into groups, with only some on site at any time.
The FMSB was set up to help improve behaviour in markets after banks were fined for trying to rig currency benchmarks and the Libor interest rate. 
On Monday the FMSB, whose members include Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), HSBC,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), published a best practice guide to handling conduct risks from working remotely.
Regulators will be looking for a clear audit trail of how risks have been dealt with.
""That will be an exercise that will run on for quite some time,"" Pluves said.
One of the newer risks is that people working from home could be less willing to own up to mistakes given it is easier for the error to go undetected, Pluves said. It's also harder to detect domestic violence or substance and alcohol abuse among people still working at home.

""It's safe to say that remote working is going to be a significant part of financial services at least for the next year and maybe forever,"" Pluves said.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening higher Monday, helped by signs of recovery in China as the corporate earnings season continues. However, gains will be tempered by negative headlines from the pandemic, including a serious threat to Spain's tourist season, and by ongoing U.S.-China tensions.

“In a change of fortunes, Europe's economy seems on course for a swifter recovery from the corona crisis than the U.S.,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note. 
With this in mind, the  German Ifo index, due at 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), will be studied keenly to see whether it complements last week's upbeat PMI message and confirms any acceleration by the German recovery in July.
There remain clouds on the horizon, nonetheless. Second waves of Covid-19 in Spain and Hong Kong prompted fresh containment measures over the weekend, while the U.S. posted another 64,500 new cases on Saturday, according to Johns Hopkins data, despite the usual weekend dip.

886,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 01:35AM ET</span>",Fed meeting expected to leave U.S. bond-stock relationship out of whack,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Karen Pierog
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's whatever-it-takes approach to stave off economic calamity has kept interest rates near zero and helped drive U.S. stocks back to pre-pandemic record levels, while weakening the usual dynamic between safe-haven U.S. Treasuries and riskier equities.
Stocks and bonds' moving in parallel is one of the distortions Fed policy makers may ponder when they meet next week, although they are expected to let the emergency measures already implemented in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak work through the financial system. 
The recent rise in Treasury prices, which typically climb when investors seek safe harbors during uncertain times, appears at odds with the exuberance seen on Wall Street, where the S&P 500 last week came within 3.5% of its February all-time high, set before it was clear the spread of COVID-19 would wreak havoc around the world. 
The S&P 500 500 (SPX) and U.S. 10-year Treasury notes (US10YT=RR) typically move in opposite directions, such that when equities rise during periods of confidence and risk-taking, bond prices fall, pushing yields, which move inversely to prices, higher.
Analysts have said the traditionally negative correlation between stocks and bonds reflects the extent to which bonds will effectively hedge against a stocks sell-off, such as what happened during the global financial crisis in 2008.
That relationship has broken down at times during the pandemic. For instance, since mid-June, U.S. benchmark 10-year yields have fallen more than 20 basis points, while the S&P 500 has gained roughly 5%.
(GRAPHIC: Treasuries vs stocks: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/rlgpdnlxjpo/Pasted%20image%201595601040892.png)
Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist at TD Securities in New York, said the irregularity between the two markets can be explained by the stimulus measures undertaken by Congress and quantitative easing on the part of the Federal Reserve. 
""The Fed and the government have pledged ongoing support for the economy, which has pushed risky assets higher,"" he said. ""At the same time, the Fed wants to keep rates low in order to keep stimulus in place and to prevent a tightening in financial conditions."" 
The Fed slashed the fed funds rates to near zero in March and launched lending and unprecedented debt purchasing programs to boost liquidity and stabilize financial markets. 
""The fact that the Fed has been able to purchase so many bonds and also kind of commit to keeping rates so low is obviously going to be a positive for stocks, but meanwhile remove volatility from the rates market,"" said Ben Jeffery, rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York.
The Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets Tuesday and Wednesday, with no major announcements expected. But it may lay the groundwork for more action in September or in the fourth quarter, analysts said.
With U.S. central bank officials resisting negative interest rates, Fed officials have talked about yield curve control as a way to target rates at specific maturities, which should keep borrowing costs ultra-low to spur spending and bolster the economy.
The yield curve refers to the line created by plotting the rates of different maturities. A steepening curve, when longer-dated yields rise faster than shorter-dated ones, generally signals a bright economic outlook.
Under yield curve control, the Fed would cap yields at a specific point on the curve, by buying 2- or 3-year maturities, for example, to reinforce guidance that rates are not going up anytime soon. 
""We think in September (the Fed) might come out with a little bit more discussion on the impact of potential additional forward guidance measures of which yield curve control is one of those,"" said Tony Rodriguez, head of fixed income strategy at Nuveen.
Fed policymakers are likely close to a policy framework about future measures. 
""In March, the Federal Reserve was buying $75 billion in Treasuries and that was to help stabilize the economy,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York. ""But now they may consider measures to help stimulate the economy and that would be the new quantitative easing.""

That should compress U.S. bond yields even more and boost stocks further, unraveling once again their supposedly time-tested correlation, analysts said.

887,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 01:15AM ET</span>",Pandemic turns Europe's retail sector on its head as shoppers stay close to home,"By Victoria Waldersee
LISBON (Reuters) - City centre shops and malls may have lost their lustre during the COVID-19 pandemic, but as lockdowns ease across Europe many stores in and around residential areas stand to benefit as consumers remain reluctant to venture far from home. 
While retail sales appear to be rebounding - surging 17.8% in the euro zone in May and approaching pre-lockdown levels in Britain in June - shoppers are increasingly staying local, leaving Europe's most renowned shopping districts from London's West End to Berlin's Kurfürstendamm struggling in the absence of office workers and tourists.
On Germany's main shopping streets in Hamburg, Cologne and Berlin, footfall in June was as much as 50% lower than a year earlier, according to the German Retail Federation, while in London's West End it was down 75%, according to the New West End Company, an association of retailers and landlords in the area.
Many consumers have shifted to buying goods online, but they are also heading out to shops in residential areas and 46% of consumers across Europe aim to shop more locally in the long term than they did before the pandemic, data from Ernst & Young shows.
The trend could mean a significant shift in earnings patterns for major European retail landlords such as Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (AS:URW),  Klepierre  (PA:LOIM), and Carmila (PA:CARM) with their mix of city centre and suburban shopping malls.
Germany's ECE operates nearly 200 shopping centres across Europe and told Reuters that centres in areas with a local customer base are approaching pre-lockdown footfall levels - whereas city-centre locations were serving just two thirds of their usual customer base.
In Britain, shoppers are buying local not just for convenience goods, but other items such as clothes which they would usually buy on a day out in the centre of town, said Jonathan de Mello of retail consultancy Harper Dennis Hobbes. ""People are being very careful about where and how many times they shop,"" he said.
Half of Britons in a YouGov survey of 1,032 people said they would now feel uncomfortable visiting an enclosed retail space like a shopping mall.
""What was once a fabulous shopping experience at a central location is now actually just a place full of risk,"" said Andrew Cosgrove, global consumer lead analyst at Ernst & Young.
At retail locations in central London and bigger UK cities footfall between 14 June and 12 July was between 69.2% and 75% lower than the same period last year, according to analytics firm Springboard.
Local high streets in smaller towns saw a 42.1% drop and suburban outer London a drop of 40% - around a third better than central London fared, if still a substantial loss on last year.
ONLINE/LOCAL SHIFT NOT AN OFFSET
The loss of city centre business has already prompted big retailers to retrench, notably in Britain where Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) and John Lewis  among others have announced store closures and hefty lay-offs. 
Some smaller retail chains that were struggling before the pandemic have collapsed, while mall operator Intu Properties , owner of Manchester's Trafford Centre and already battling high debt, was forced to bring in administrators.
In France, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Norway, Sweden and the UK at least 40% of people are visiting physical stores less, according to Ernst & Young - and only 20-35% are ordering more online, not enough to make up the shortfall.
A recent rebound in sales as lockdowns have eased has also not been as robust as retailers might have hoped for.
Springboard estimates that in the week beginning July 6, overall footfall at retailers across continental Europe remained around a fifth below the same week a year ago, and 40% lower in the UK, according to data shared with Reuters.
Fashion and footwear are the hardest-hit retailers, with spring and, in some countries, summer collections gone to waste in lockdown. Clothing and footwear sales surged 70% in Britain in June from May but remained 35% below pre-pandemic levels, data released on Friday showed. 
In countries like Spain and Portugal still facing partial or regional lockdowns, due to localised coronavirus outbreaks, movement around retail and recreation spaces such as shopping centres as well as restaurants and cafes remains 20% below pre-lockdown levels, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) mobility data shows. 
For retailers across the board that suggests there is more pain to come.In Germany, Europe's biggest economy, a third of 400 brick and mortar shops surveyed feel their existence is under threat, according to June research by the German Retail Federation. 

""If we consider that Germany is a comparatively strong economy in Europe, it's a worrying indicator for the region,"" said Neil McMillan, director of political affairs & trade at Eurocommerce, a retail lobby group.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly up on Monday morning, reversing some earlier losses despite the mounting tensions between the U.S. and China over their latest tit-for-tat souring investment sentiment.
China ordered the closure of the U.S. consulate in Chengdu on Friday, in a retaliatory move after the U.S. ordered the closure of China’s consulate in Houston during the previous week. The U.S.’ mission was given a Monday deadline to close, while China’s mission was given a Friday deadline.
U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo suggested last week that Washington and its allies must use “more creative and assertive ways” to change China’s ways. Disagreements over other issues such as Hong Kong’s national security law, Xinjiang, and Chinese claims in the South China sea have also ratcheted tensions between the two countries.
“U.S. President (Donald) Trump used to say China’s President Xi Jinping is a great leader. But now Pompeo’s wording is becoming so aggressive that markets are starting to worry about further escalation,” Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi Securities, told Reuters.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.13% by 10:26 PM ET (3:26 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component jumped 1.04%. Chinese industrial profit jumped 11.50% year-on-year in June, against May’s 6% increase.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.51% as markets re-opened after the previous week’s holiday.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 1.04 % and Down Under, the ASX 200 rose 0.06%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.27%.
Meanwhile, top aides to U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that they reportedly agreed in principal to a $1 trillion COVID-19 relief package proposed by Senate Republicans, cheering investor sentiment. But Democrats and Republicans have yet to come to an agreement over further stimulus measures before some previous measures expire at the end of the week, with investors monitoring the negotiations to gauge the prospects of economic recovery in the world’s largest economy.
Although some U.S. COVID-19 hot spots such as Florida, Arizona, California, Texas and New York reported decreasing numbers of cases and deaths on Sunday, the global number of COVID-19 cases continues a relentless march upwards. There are over 16.1 million cases worldwide as of July 27, according to Johns Hopkins University data."
889,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 26, 2020 10:00PM ET</span>","HSBC Denies ‘Framing’ Huawei, Didn’t Prompt U.S. Legal Probe","(Bloomberg) --  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), responding to media reports over its dealings with Huawei Technologies Co., denied that it “framed” the Chinese telecom giant, and said it didn’t spark a U.S. probe of the company.
In its first public comments about Huawei’s legal battle in North America, the U.K. bank said it has no “hostility” toward Huawei and didn’t “ensnare” the company. The bank said it only provided information to the U.S. Department of Justice when it was compelled to do so.
“In response to the U.S. DOJ’s requests for information, HSBC simply presented the objective facts,” the bank said in a statement Saturday. “HSBC did not ‘fabricate’ evidence or ‘hide’ facts. And HSBC would never distort the facts or seek to harm any of our clients for our own gain.”
HSBC has become embroiled in Huawei’s legal fight to block a U.S. request to extradite Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou from Canada to face trial over allegedly violating U.S. sanctions on Iran. Meng has been under house arrest in Vancouver since she was detained at the request of U.S. authorities in 2018.
HSBC’s statement came after China’s People’s Daily newspaper published an opinion piece on Friday saying that the bank is an accomplice of the U.S. and fabricated evidence on Huawei, resulting in the arrest of Meng.
On the same day, China’s banking regulator approved HSBC’s application to close a sub-branch in Shenzhen, where Huawei is located. The U.K. bank said the move is part of its routine work of reviewing and optimizing its service channels. After the closure, HSBC still operates 11 outlets in the city.
Shares of HSBC fell 1.9% in Hong Kong as of 9:48 a.m., extending this year’s decline to 42%.
HSBC was thrust further into the spotlight with new evidence presented last week. In a filing to a Canadian court Thursday, Meng’s lawyers argued that the U.S. misled Canadian authorities by omitting key elements of a PowerPoint presentation that Meng showed to HSBC bankers at a 2013 meeting in Hong Kong, the Globe and Mail reported.
The omissions leave the impression that Meng didn’t fully explain Huawei’s dealings in Iran, according to the report. The U.S. argues that Meng deceived banks including HSBC, and that this prompted lenders to clear millions of dollars in transactions in violation of the sanctions.
Slides Omitted
In fact, Meng’s lawyers argued, she was transparent about the Iran dealings, citing two slides in the presentation made to HSBC that had been omitted from the U.S. filing, the Globe reported.
HSBC is walking a tight-rope amid growing U.S.-China tensions. The London-based bank has come out in support of a controversial new security law imposed by China on Hong Kong, one of its biggest markets. The U.K. government meanwhile, has joined the U.S. and other countries in banning Huawei from developing its 5G networks.
“We will continue investing in our business, services, talents and technology in China and contributing to the sustainable development of the country,” the bank said.

Reliance, which manages the biggest refinery complex, gained 4.3% in Mumbai on Friday adding $8 billion to take its market value to $189 billion, while  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) erased about $1 billion. Reliance’s shares have jumped 43% this year compared with a 39% drop in Exxon’s shares as refiners across the globe struggled with a plunge in fuel demand. Aramco with a market capitalization of $1.76 trillion is the world’s biggest energy company.
While the energy business accounted for about 80% of Reliance’s revenue in the year ended March 31, Chairman Mukesh Ambani’s plan to expand the company’s digital and retail arms has helped him attract $20 billion into the Jio Platforms Ltd. unit. That in turn helped add $22.3 billion to Ambani’s wealth this year, propelling him to the fifth spot in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
Ambani’s dealmaking has lured investments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). into his digital platform in recent months. The 63-year-old tycoon has identified technology and retail as future growth areas in a pivot away from the energy businesses he inherited from his father who died in 2002.
Meanwhile, large scale global oil demand destruction — some 30 million barrels a day, or a third of regular usage, in April — sent energy markets into a second-quarter tailspin, from which they’ve only recently started to recover. Worst-in-a-generation oil prices combined with OPEC production cuts, collapsing refining margins and millions of barrels of unsold crude have hurt big oil companies including Exxon and  Chevron  Corp.

Shares of U.S. firms with high revenue exposure to Western Europe and the BRIC countries -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- also fare well in weaker-dollar environments, wrote strategists including David Kostin in a note Friday. Goldman’s FX strategists see the trade-weighted dollar depreciating by more than 5% over the next 12 months, they said.
“During months when the trade-weighted dollar fell by at least 1.25%, the international-facing information technology and energy sectors have performed best while the more domestic-facing consumer discretionary sector has performed worst,” they wrote. “When the dollar weakens, investors should favor firms with a larger share of revenues generated abroad.”
The dollar fell to its lowest since January on Friday as investors bet the Federal Reserve will remain accommodative in its policy when it meets this week, and the economic health of the rest of the world would pick up relative to the U.S., as coronavirus cases continued to climb there. Investors are now lining up to short the greenback.
The Goldman strategists also found that purchases of U.S. equities by foreign investors increase when the dollar weakens, in an analysis of data going back to 1980. Goldman expects foreign investors to buy $300 billion of American stocks this year.
“A weakening U.S. dollar has historically been the biggest catalyst for foreign investor demand for U.S. stocks,” they said.

The move to float Qualtrics in the United States would partly unwind the final major acquisition of former Chief Executive Bill McDermott's tenure and rebalance SAP back towards its German roots under successor Christian Klein.
""SAP's primary objective for the IPO is to fortify Qualtrics' ability to capture its full market potential within Experience Management,"" SAP said in a statement issued on Sunday night, referring to the Qualtrics product.
""This will help to increase Qualtrics' autonomy and enable it to expand its footprint both within SAP's customer base and beyond.""
McDermott was criticised by investors for overpaying for Qualtrics, which under founder Ryan Smith had been close to floating when SAP trumped the valuation it had hoped to achieve on the stock market.
A year after the deal, Klein and former marketing chief Jennifer Morgan succeeded McDermott as co-CEOs. The arrangement proved to be short-lived, however, and Morgan - a vocal advocate of the Qualtrics deal - left earlier this year.
Klein called the takeover a success on Sunday, highlighting the 40% sales growth achieved by Qualtrics last year as it took advantage of SAP's global sales channels to reach new markets.
He added he had agreed with Smith that an IPO would offer the best chances for Qualtrics to grow, explore acquisitions and attract talent.
Under the proposed initial public offering, SAP would retain a majority stake in Qualtrics and Smith would be the second-largest shareholder.
A final decision on the IPO and its conditions and timing is pending and subject to market conditions, SAP said.
   SAP said that as it would remain majority shareholder, it would continue to consolidate Qualtrics' results. The transaction is thus not expected to have an impact on SAP's 2020 or longer-term financial targets.

SAP publishes second-quarter results on Monday.

The U.S.-based drug maker said the additional funding will support its late-stage clinical development including the expanded Phase 3 study of Moderna's vaccine candidate.
In April, Moderna had received $483 million from the U.S. federal agency that funds disease-fighting technology, when the experimental vaccine was in an early-stage trial conducted by the U.S. National Institutes of Health. 
""Encouraged by the Phase 1 data, we believe that our mRNA vaccine may aid in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and preventing future outbreaks,"" Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel said in a press release. 
BARDA's total funding for the experimental vaccine of Moderna, the first in the United States to begin human trials of a coronavirus vaccine, is now about $955 million.
The vaccine uses synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) to inoculate against the coronavirus. Such treatments help the body immunize against a virus and can potentially be developed and manufactured more quickly than traditional vaccines.
A Phase 3 study, conducted in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, will begin on July 27 and involve about 30,000 participants, according to the company. 
Moderna said it remains on track to be able to deliver about 500 million doses per year, and possibly up to 1 billion doses per year, beginning in 2021. 
The announcement about further funding came two days after the drug developer said its formula used in developing the vaccine was not covered under patents owned by Arbutus Biopharma (NASDAQ:ABUS)

 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE),  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc, Britian's AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) Plc are other few drug makers that received funding from BARDA for coronavirus vaccine development.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - A pick-up in leisure trips and easing European travel restrictions are driving demand for business jet flights this summer, fueling cautious hopes for a rebound in an industry hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, executives and forecasters said.
Commercial and business aviation are both seeing improved domestic traffic this summer. But private flights, which carry smaller groups and promise wealthy passengers less risk of exposure to the coronavirus, have generally fared better than commercial airlines since the start of the pandemic. 
U.S. business aviation traffic is down around 20% year to date through July 19 on an annual basis, compared to a decline in U.S. commercial airline traffic of 48% over the same period, according to FlightAware data.
Adam Twidell, chief executive at Private Fly, a global booking service for charter flights, said his company's booking levels are around 80% of last year's mark in Europe, and over 100% in the U.S., helped by inquiries from new passengers.
New customers, including those who normally fly first class on airlines, now make up around 60% of the company's flight bookings compared with around a quarter normally.
""We know that a considerable number of them have not flown privately before,"" Twidell said.
Private jet charter VistaJet said it recorded a 153% increase for European departures between May and June and expects a similar increase for July.
GREEN SHOOTS
Business aviation flights in Europe could be down just 10% this summer compared with the same period a year earlier, helped by pent-up leisure travel demand and limited selection of commercial flights, said Richard Koe, managing director of data research and consulting company WINGX Advance GmbH. By comparison, European flights were down 15% in July and 30% in June on an annual basis, Koe said.
But industry executives cautioned that the green shoots of demand for private aviation will only continue into the fall if there is a pick-up in company travel.
""Personal travel is the driving force on both continents at the moment as business travel continues to be down significantly,"" said Patrick Gallagher, a marketing executive for Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc’s NetJets, which is seeing improved European demand following the easing of travel restrictions last month.
""Relaxation in travel restrictions certainly played a part in that, but the seasonality of demand in Europe also led to the later, steeper recovery,"" he said.
Business jet makers are waiting to see if the revival in flights could eventually lead to new orders. For now, charters are using existing fleets to meet demand. 
While jet makers are seeing little appetite for new plane sales, firm orders are not being canceled, which points to some stability, two industry sources said.

Business jet makers, like General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD)'s Gulfstream Aerospace, Textron (NYSE:TXT) Aviation and Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF), have cut jobs and some forecasters expect a 30% decline in deliveries this year.

The dead include employees, contractors and suppliers to the plant, said Carlos Solorio, secretary general of the local branch of the national mining and metallurgical workers' union.
""Everyone was working for the company,"" Solorio told Reuters. Nine of the deceased were union members, he added.
ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel producer, was not immediately available for comment on the report of the deaths, which were initially made public in a video posted on social media by the union's president, Senator Napoleon Gomez.
Solorio said the 21 deaths had occurred since April, and that the workers likely contracted the virus outside the plant, given the strict sanitary protocols adopted by the firm. The plant employs more than 7,000 people, according to the union.
ArcelorMittal has said it has made substantial donations to help tackle the virus in Lazaro Cardenas, a major port on the Pacific coast.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian court has summoned  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and its founder Jack Ma in a case in which a former employee in India says he was wrongfully fired after objecting to what he saw as censorship and fake news on company apps, documents seen by Reuters showed.
The case comes weeks after India cited security concerns in banning Alibaba's UC News, UC Browser and 57 other Chinese apps after a clash between the two countries' forces on their border.
Following the ban, which China has criticized, India sought written answers from all affected companies, including whether they censored content or acted for any foreign government.
In court filings dated July 20 and previously not reported, the former employee of Alibaba's UC Web, Pushpandra Singh Parmar, alleges the company used to censor content seen as unfavourable to China and its apps UC Browser and UC News showcased false news ""to cause social and political turmoil"".
Civil Judge Sonia Sheokand of a district court in Gurugram, a satellite city of India's capital, New Delhi, has issued summons for Alibaba, Jack Ma and about a dozen individuals or company units, asking them to appear in court or through a lawyer on July 29, court documents showed.
The judge has also sought written responses from the company and its executives within 30 days, according to the summons.
UC India said in a statement it had been ""unwavering in its commitment to the India market and the welfare of its local employees, and its policies are in compliance with local laws. We are unable to comment on ongoing litigation"".
Alibaba representatives did not respond to requests for comment from the Chinese company or on behalf of Jack Ma.
Parmar, who worked as an associate director at the UC Web office in Gurugram until October 2017 and is seeking $268,000 in damages, referred Reuters queries to his lawyer, Atul Ahlawat, who declined to comment saying the matter was sub judice. 
The court case is the latest hurdle for Alibaba in India after the Indian government's app ban, following which UC Web has started laying off some staff in India.
Before the apps were banned, the UC Browser had been downloaded at least 689 million times in India, while UC News had 79.8 million downloads, most during 2017 and 2018, data from analytics firm Sensor Tower showed. 
ALLEGATIONS IN COURT
India has said it banned the 59 apps after it received ""credible inputs"" that such apps posed a threat to India's sovereignty. Its IT minister said the decision was taken to safeguard citizens' data and public order.
In more than 200 pages of court filings, reviewed by Reuters, former employee Parmar included clippings of some posts showcased on the UC News app that he alleged were false.
One post from 2017 was headlined in Hindi: ""2,000-rupee notes to be banned from midnight today"". Another headline of a 2018 post said: ""Just now: War broke out between India and Pakistan"" and contained description of firing across the disputed border between the countries.
Reuters could not independently verify the veracity of the claims in the court filing. India did not ban its 2,000-rupee currency note and no war occurred between India and Pakistan in 2018.
The lawsuit also contains a ""sensitive words list"" with key words in Hindi and English like ""India-China border"" and ""Sino-India war"" that the court filing alleges were used by UC Web to censor content on its platforms in India.
""In order to control any news related content to be published against China was automatically/manually rejected by an audit system evolved for this purpose,"" the filing said.

The Chinese Embassy in New Delhi and China's foreign ministry in Beijing, as well as India's IT ministry in New Delhi, did not respond to requests for comment.

900,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 25, 2020 06:03AM ET</span>",CEO Exclusive: K12 Set to Boom Amid Virtual Schooling as Covid Keeps Us Home,"By Christiana SciaudoneInvesting.com -- K12 (NYSE:LRN) Inc. runs online public schools and, accordingly, business is booming.
“The growth in enrollments that we’re seeing is shocking even to us,” Chief Executive Officer Nathaniel Davis said in a Zoom interview with Investing.com this week. 
Covid-19 stay-at-home mandates and school closures have forced parents to seek out alternatives to traditional in-person school, boosting K12’s fortunes. The company gets the lion’s share of its revenue from operating virtual public schools, with the first quarter bringing in $228,335 for the segment out of a total $257,154. Investors are seeing the same opportunity, tripling K12’s share price this year. 
“They are in the right place at the right time,” said Jeff Silber, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets who has a buy rating on K12. “This is likely to be the best year in company history.”
K12 is a 20-year-old venture, and operates more than 70 schools in 35 states, with an enrollment of 122,800 as of fall 2019. It also provides the curriculum and services necessary for public and private schools to set up their own customized full-time and part-time online programs, and for supplemental online and blended education. In total, K12 works with 6,000 teachers, of which approximately 2,000 are K12 employees. That will grow this year, with plans to hire as many as 1,300 teachers.
Visits to the website are up 90% from February through now, and applications are up 60%, Davis said. The company is poised to announce a major deal with one of the country’s largest school districts, for which it will provide software and services. Local teachers will remain.
K12 is targeting expansion in big markets like New York and New Jersey, and will continue opening schools in states where it already operates. 
“Based on the kinda applications we are seeing, the estimates in the marketplace are modest,” Davis said. 
Online school is still a limited market, however, Silber said. While there are more than 50 million students in U.S. public schools, not everyone can adjust well to the virtual environment. In 2017-18, 298,000 students were enrolled in full-time virtual schools, Silber said, citing the most recent information available from the National Education Policy Center. It’s a tiny niche, he said. Even if it doubled, 99% of students would still be enrolled in regular schools.  
Pearson’s Connections Academy is K12’s biggest peer, and it also reported strong revenue growth, with applications up 61% in the first half compared to 2019. Pearson said in its half-year results statement on July 24 that it is increasing capacity in existing schools and seeing interest from states that haven’t yet initiated virtual schooling. In the upcoming school year, Connections will have 32 partner schools in 29 states.           
While the short-term looks positive, long-term growth will come from K12's career readiness segment, Davis said. While K-12 education is a market estimated to be worth $11 billion, the potential market for career readiness totals almost $100 billion, according to a K12 presentation.
In January, K12 bought career readiness company Galvanize Inc. for $165 million in a cash deal. The acquisition of Galvanize positions K12 as a provider of career readiness education services, including skills training, technology staffing and developing talent and capabilities for Fortune 500 companies.
Davis recounted a recent management meeting with four big corporations, and their frustration at finding qualified talent. 
“Half the jobs they are going to fill don’t require college education, but they do need skills,” Davis said. “The corporations are all telling us ‘I care more about skills than I do about degrees.’”
Companies want employees who can get to work on time, be organized, handle spreadsheets, and perform other tasks. Those things aren’t being taught in college, though some are adapting, Davis said. With the coronavirus sending kids home, families are starting to question the tens of thousands of dollars they are spending on traditional college experiences.
“A liberal arts education may not help you get a job,” Davis said.  
Among the strategies in building a successful company is, evidently, finding the right people. While diversity is on everyone’s mind of late, Davis has made it a priority since he took charge in 2013. White men are outnumbered on K12’s management team and the board of directors, which includes African-Americans, Asians and Hispanics.
“I am a person who has benefited from people giving me a chance. I want to give others a chance,” Davis said. Candidates, including for the board of directors, have to be qualified, but Davis keeps an open mind in terms of experience and exact skills. Even if they have never served on a board, they will have something else to contribute. “You have to be committed to it and you open your mind up to the other skills of individuals.”
A recent example of the difference diversity brings to the board came after a look at the mix of students showed a dearth of Latinos. Two Hispanic board members were consulted, and they reached out through their contacts to help the company reach Latino families. As a result, K12 saw a jump in the number of Latino students enrolled.
“It comes from the top,” Davis said. “It’s how you set the tone.”"
901,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2020 04:15AM ET</span>",Boeing to delay 777X as demand drops for big jets - sources,"By Eric M. Johnson and Tim Hepher
SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is preparing to delay its all-new 777X jet by several months or up to a year, three people familiar with the matter said, as the COVID-19 crisis exacerbates a drop in demand for the industry's largest jetliners.
Boeing hopes to bring the jet to market as passenger travel rebounds after a downturn caused by the pandemic. It would also hope for a detente in a trade war between Washington and Beijing, which has sidelined crucial Chinese aircraft buyers.
But stretching out the development opens up fresh risks for Boeing, such as losing engineering attention and momentum, and tougher scrutiny from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration during the years-long certification process.
Delay could also cause problems in Boeing's supply chain.
An announcement of the delay could come as early as next week when Boeing announces earnings, one of the people said.
Boeing declined to comment on the 777X timeline. It said it was continuing flight tests and ""working closely with our customers around the world as they continue to adapt to the evolving COVID-19 situation.”
Boeing has been working to get the 777X, a larger version of the 777 mini-jumbo, into the hands of customers in 2021. That's already a year later than originally scheduled after snags with its  General Electric  (N:GE) GE9X engines among other issues.
Now Boeing is preparing to delay the timeline by perhaps a year, two of the people said. A third said a delay was likely but that Boeing wanted to get production ""going hard"" to put planes in the air by 2022-2023. 
""There are so many widebody aircraft being retired, mothballed,"" the third person said. ""If air travel comes back to 2019 levels, many new planes will be needed."" 
The 777X will be the first major jet to be certified since the role of software flaws in two fatal 737 MAX crashes prompted accusations of cozy relations between Boeing and the FAA. 
The 777X - composed of two models, the 777-8 and the larger and more closely watched 777-9 which seats 406 passengers and is due to be delivered first - competes with the Airbus (PA:AIR) A350-1000, which seats about 360 passengers. 
Modern twinjets are displacing older four-engined Boeing 747s and soon-to-be-axed Airbus A380s. Boeing has told suppliers the last 747-8 will roll off assembly lines in around two years.
Experts had expressed worries about demand for large jets due to overcapacity and economic weakness, even before COVID.

While Boeing says it has sold 309 777X planes - worth $442 million each at list prices – many in the industry have questioned its dependence on Middle East carriers which are scaling back orders.

902,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2020 09:45PM ET</span>","Wall Street Week Ahead: Investors hedging, worry about exuberance, as U.S. risks rise","By David Randall and Megan Davies
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Signs of trepidation over the lasting impact of the U.S. coronavirus pandemic are growing on Wall Street, fanned by resurgent case numbers, the prospect of a slower rebound in growth and rising political uncertainty. 
As a U.S. equity rally stalled this week, investors poured a net $24.5 billion into bonds, the third largest weekly inflows ever recorded, while pulling $3.8 billion out of stocks, according to BoFA Global Research. Gold drew its second largest inflows on record, while investors socked nearly $41 billion away in cash. 
Meanwhile, the dollar hit its lowest level in nearly two years, weighed down in part by growth-chasing investors cutting positions in U.S. assets in favor of allocations to Europe. In the bond market, yields on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), which adjust for inflation - are near all-time lows.
""We are definitely concerned,"" said Nick Maroutsos, Head of Global Bonds at Janus Henderson Investors. ""I don't think you can blindly buy assets. A lot of the value has been squeezed."" 
Maroutsos said there was some ""fear of missing out"" in the market with the expectation that actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve can continue to keep risk assets elevated, and that investors were ""looking to hedge some of their portfolio given the move in risk assets"". 
He added that behavior ""can certainly continue."" 
The U.S. central bank has pledged unlimited financial asset purchases. While the vast majority of these purchases have been limited to U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, the Fed's pledge to bolster the corporate bond market has spurred a frenzy for bonds and stocks.
The Fed's July 28-29 meeting could describe the turn the economy seems to be approaching. The U.S. economic outlook has darkened in the past month, according a Reuters poll.
Investors are weighing coronavirus cases escalating in southern and western U.S. states, rising tensions between the U.S. and China, potential volatility stemming from the Nov. 3 presidential election and the level of debt being built up to fight the effects of the virus.
Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive officer of Doubleline Capital, which oversees $138 billion invested primarily in fixed income, said he was concerned about the level of debt being built up in the economy via multiple stimulus programs over the years.
He believes that will weigh on the dollar as the U.S. deficits grow. While the dollar may benefit short term if there is equity weakness, ""ultimately it weakens as the debt situation is really remarkably bad for a developed country."" 
There are also concerns that the blistering rally in the S&P 500 from its March lows has been led by a small group of technology-related names. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the five largest U.S. stocks, now account for 22% of the S&P 500's market capitalization, analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a recent report. 
The equity market's leadership and frenzied buying by retail investors ""is classic bear market rally activity,"" said Gundlach, and feels similar to 1999 - which was prior to the dotcom bubble bursting. 
However, it is ""way worse because we don't have the ability to cut interest rates"" and have ""used all the tools that are typically reserved for fighting economic problems,"" he said. 
Some are looking more positively abroad. 
Gross domestic product growth in both the United States and Europe should take hits next year, according to Société Générale. Yet the firm projects a 5.2% rebound for EU growth in 2022, compared with a 2.5% bounce in the United States. 
""Next year will be the year of recovery for Europe and East Asia, where in the U.S. a vaccine won't have the same impact because the virus is not contained,"" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JP Morgan Funds. 
U.S. cases of the virus continue to increase at the fastest rate in the world. 

""In the U.S. right now we are seeing a bit of 'what does this mean?'"" said Jim Schaeffer, head of leveraged finance at Aegon (NYSE:AEG) Asset Management. ""We sold on the complete unknown and rallied on hope.""

903,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2020 09:20PM ET</span>",'Spread out? Where?' Smithfield says not all plant workers can be socially distanced,"By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Smithfield Foods, the world's biggest pork processor, said workers cannot be socially distant in all areas of its plants, in response to U.S. senators who pressed meatpackers on coronavirus outbreaks in slaughterhouses.
Meatpackers are under mounting pressure to protect workers after more than 16,000 employees in 23 states were infected with COVID-19 and 86 workers died in circumstances related to the respiratory disease, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. 
Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker last month said Smithfield,  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN), JBS USA [JBS.UL] and Cargill Inc (CARG.UL) had put workers in harm's way to maintain production. The senators asked the companies how much meat they shipped to China while warning of domestic shortages due to slaughterhouse outbreaks.
Smithfield, in a June 30 response made public on Friday, said it erected physical barriers and took other steps to protect workers in areas where social distancing is impossible.
The company, owned by China's WH Group Ltd (HK:0288), balked at slowing processing line speeds to increase space between employees. It said slowdowns would back up hogs on farms, leading to animal euthanizations and higher food prices.
""For better or worse, our plants are what they are,"" Smithfield Chief Executive Kenneth Sullivan said. ""Four walls, engineered design, efficient use of space, etc. Spread out? Okay. Where?""
Tyson told the senators it decreased the number of employees on production lines and created barriers or required face shields in areas where employees cannot be distanced.
""These companies clearly cannot be trusted to do what is right,"" said Booker. He and Warren called for new legislation to protect workers.

Smithfield, Tyson and JBS did not disclose how much meat they have exported. JBS, a unit of Brazil's JBS SA (SA:JBSS3), said it accounted for less than 10% of U.S. pork exports to China. Cargill said it has not exported U.S. beef or turkey to China this year.

904,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2020 09:10PM ET</span>",Hedge fund Bridgewater Associates sued by former co-CEO Murray,"By Bhargav Acharya and Kanishka Singh
(Reuters) - Bridgewater Associates former co-Chief Executive Officer Eileen Murray filed a lawsuit against the hedge fund on Friday, saying it is withholding up to $100 million in deferred compensation because she publicly disclosed her gender discrimination dispute with the firm.
Murray, who stepped down as co-CEO earlier this year, said in the suit that the circumstances surrounding her departure had given rise to substantial claims by her against Bridgewater based on gender discrimination, unequal pay and breach of contract.
Murray had informed the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a self-regulatory agency that she now chairs, of the dispute with Bridgewater, which is the world's largest hedge fund. In response, Bridgewater told Murray on July 14 in writing that her public disclosures of her dispute with the firm would result in a forfeiture of her deferred compensation, according to the complaint.
According to the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Connecticut, the withheld compensation is estimated to be in the range of $20 million to $100 million, due over the course of the next decade. 
In the suit, Murray, who was one of the highest-ranking female executives in the industry as co-CEO of the hedge fund, called Bridgewater's attempt to withhold the deferred pay an ""improper gambit to silence her voice"" and ""part of a cynical plan to intimidate and silence her.""
The hedge fund said it had no immediate comment on the lawsuit.

Murray, 62, joined the hedge fund, founded by billionaire Ray Dalio, in 2009 and became co-CEO in 2011.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street retreated on Friday, heading into the weekend with a broad sell-off due to weak earnings, surging coronavirus cases and geopolitical uncertainties. 
For the second day in a row, the tech sector weighed heaviest on all three major U.S. stock averages.  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) led the decline, its shares plunging after the chipmaker reported a delay in production of a smaller, faster 7-nonometer chip.
""There's a skittishness ahead of the weekend after yesterday's tech and growth sell-off,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""It's been an unbelievable ride for the Nasdaq and tech over the last two moths,"" Detrick added. ""A well-deserved correction makes a lot of sense in our view."" 
Each index posted a weekly loss, with the S&P 500 and the Dow snapping three-week winning streaks. Nasdaq had its weakest week of the last four.
The retreat followed a rally that brought the S&P 500 to nearly 5% below its record high reached in February. The bellwether index is now near break-even for the year, while the Nasdaq has gained more than 15% year-to-date.
""With the rally we've seen so far in July, it makes sense to see anxiety ahead of a huge earnings week, the Fed decision and what's likely to be the worst GDP in our lifetimes,"" Detrick added.
Momentum stocks Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and Amazon.com (O:AMZN) are scheduled to post results on July 30, the day the U.S. Commerce Department is due to give its first take on second-quarter GDP. Analysts projected the economy dropped by a bruising 35% during the three-month period. 
More than 1,000 Americans died from COVID-19 on Thursday, the third straight day for that grim milestone as total cases surged past 4 million. 
Beijing fired back at Washington shuttering China's Houston consulate by closing the U.S. consulate in the city of Chengdu. 
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 182.99 points, or 0.69%, to 26,469.34, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 20.04 points, or 0.62%, to 3,215.62 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 98.24 points, or 0.94%, to 10,363.18.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but consumer discretionary (SPLRCD) were in the red.
Healthcare (SPXHC) lost ground ahead of executive orders by President Donald Trump aimed at lowering drug prices.
Second-quarter earnings season charges ahead, with 128 constituents of the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 80.5% have cleared a very low bar of analyst expectations. 
 American Express  Co (N:AXP) fell after reporting an 85% slump in quarterly profit after setting aside nearly $628 million to cover potential defaults.
 Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) beat analyst profit and revenue estimates as the telecom saw strong demand due to stay-at-home mandates, sending its shares higher.

The company will “continue to invest heavily in the Truly brand and work to improve our position in the hard seltzer category as competition continues to increase,” Burwick said. Sales of Twisted Tea, a hard ice tea drink, are also growing.
The company's full-year gross margin target is between 46% and 48% and full-year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share is estimated at between $11.70 and $12.70.

At the start of July, McDonald's had planned to pause the reopening of its dine-in service by 21 days, according to a letter seen by Reuters. 
Using face masks is the top recommendation from health experts and government officials looking to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has infected more than 4 million people in the United States.
Other companies, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc,  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX), have also made masks compulsory, even as Americans stay divided over their imposition, with some seeing it as a violation of their constitutional rights.

McDonald's said it would train its employees to address customers who decline to wear a face covering in a ""friendly, expedited way"". (https://

Investing.com -  Books are not flying off the shelves. 
Scholastic (NASDAQ:SCHL) Corporation shares fell 11% on Friday after revenue slid without in-person book clubs and book fairs to drive sales. Fourth quarter revenue plummeted 40%, to $187 million, after schools around the world closed down in an attempt to halt the spread of the coronavirus. 
The decline was partially offset by a $25 million increase in domestic trade sales largely thanks to Suzanne Collins’s fourth title in the Hunger Games series.    
More than 90% of U.S. schools use Scholastic's products. As schools reopen in whatever form, Scholastic expects strong demand for children's books delivered through book clubs and book fairs to schools and direct-to-home, as well as strong sales for digital education programs, including classroom magazines, as schools look for digital learning tools to bridge the gap between home and school.
The company expects revenue in fiscal 2021 to be slightly below 2020 sales, offset by a $100 million cost reduction plan.

The ECB, Monte dei Paschi and the Italian Treasury, which controls the bank, all declined to comment. The news was first reported by daily newspaper La Repubblica.
Monte dei Paschi last month approved a plan to offload more than 8 billion euros in bad and unlikely-to-pay loans to state-owned bad loan manager AMCO, in a move that could make it more attractive for a possible re-privatisation..

The plan also included more than 1 billion euros in equity and 3.2 billion euros in debt from bridge loans granted by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and UBS.

(Reuters) - Shares of Intel (O:INTC) slumped and its rivals surged on Friday after the U.S. chipmaker signaled it may give up manufacturing its own components after falling far behind schedule developing its newest technology.
Intel plunged 15% after CEO Bob Swan told investors on a conference call late on Thursday that Intel's new 7 nanometer chip technology was six months behind schedule and that Intel may pay other manufacturers to produce its chip designs.
Designing and manufacturing its own personal computer and server chips has given Intel a lead over rivals for decades, and a move away from that model would strengthen smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices (O:AMD), which surged 15%. 
""This, our 45th Intel earnings call, was the worst we have seen in our career covering the company,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a client note, cutting his Intel rating to ""underperform"". 
""Frankly, none of the numbers matter. In fact investors could have stopped reading the press release after the fourth line on the first page, which indicated Intel delaying their 7nm trajectory with yields running a year behind internal targets,"" Rasgon wrote.
U.S. shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TW:2330), the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, jumped 12%. Intel's potential surrender in manufacturing means one less competitor for TSMC, and a potential new customer. 
Semiconductor manufacturing equipment makers KLA Corp (O:KLAC), Applied Materials (O:AMAT) and U.S. shares of ASML Holding (AS:ASML) fell between 2% and 6% on expectations that Intel may build and upgrade fewer factories.

Nvidia (O:NVDA) climbed 1.1%, bringing its market capitalization to $252 billion and extending its lead as the most valuable U.S. chipmaker after eclipsing Intel earlier this month. Following Friday's plunge, Intel's stock market value was $217 billion.

(Reuters) - Oil major  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) expects to reduce the dominance of white males in company management during cost-cutting this year, upping the share of senior level jobs held by women and ethnic minorities to 44% from 38% last year, the company said in a statement.
Like most of its peers in an industry struggling with the collapse of oil prices this year, Chevron is cutting spending, consolidating business units, and has asked some managers to reapply for their jobs.
Figures from the end of last year show that less than a quarter of Chevron's U.S. executives and senior managers were female, and only 22% were from ethnic minorities.
In an email sent to employees this week and seen by Reuters, Chief Human Resources Officer Rhonda Morris said the company selected 26% women for global roles in a second round of appointments and, in the United States, 29% of candidates selected were from ethnically diverse candidates.
A spokeswoman for the company confirmed the details and said those selections were permanent and that the diversity ratio was expected to remain at around 44% at the end of all appointment rounds.
Long owned and run predominantly by white males, the oil industry has drawn criticism along with other parts of corporate America for failing to do enough to promote diversity.
Women and people from non-white ethnic backgrounds represented 46% of the oil industry's workforce in 2019 and are expected to fill 54% of total job opportunities through 2040, an IHS Markit analysis for the American Petroleum Institute shows.
However, they remain a minority in senior management.

Chevron executives were among those at big corporations to speak in support of the ""black lives matter"" campaign, which has become a global movement against racial injustice following the killing of George Floyd by police officers in Minneapolis.

After some interruption, due to political disputes, Congress will cut the extra weekly payment to $300 from $600, Hatzius said in a phone interview Thursday. On top of that, Hatzius and his team anticipate $200 billion in fresh support for cities and states.
“If that doesn’t show up, state governments are going to be in very serious financial trouble, and you’re going to see serious cutbacks,” said Hatzius, who was one of the first sell-side economists to recognize how powerful the CARES Act would be, having written in early May that households would actually see their disposable personal income rise in 2020 despite the historic surge in the unemployment rate.
If Congress delivers something along those lines, the economy will continue to grow, but he warned that “you’re still going to see some negative impacts, because the unemployment insurance is less generous than it was before.”
There’s also a possibility that nothing gets passed, and in that case Hatzius sees a return to outright economic contraction.
Regardless of the near term, Goldman’s long-term outlook remains bleak, with unemployment remaining elevated for years to come, despite the fact that “this is a much more rapid recovery than what we’ve seen in the past,” he said.
“We’re still above 4% for the next four years,” Hatzius said of the U.S. jobless rate, which was 11.1% in June after reaching a half-century low of 3.5% before the pandemic.
The long duration of elevated unemployment also means the Fed will be on hold for years to come.
Hatzius and his team don’t expect a Fed hike until 2025, and that in the meantime Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues will establish some kind of “outcome-based guidance,” whereby they commit to not hiking rates until a sustained period of 2% inflation as well as the unemployment rate falling below some benchmark.
Given the wide degree of uncertainty when making Fed predictions this far out, Hatzius acknowledges that while 2025 is his base case, it’s easy to imagine a hike happening in 2023 or 2027.

922,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2020 12:00PM ET</span>",Spain considering guaranteeing credit lines to renewables firm Abengoa: source,"By Jesús Aguado
MADRID (Reuters) - The Spanish government is considering granting guarantees and credit lines to renewable energy and engineering firm  Abengoa  (MC:ABG) in a bid to keep the company afloat, a source with knowledge of the negotiations said.
Spanish state agency ICO will guarantee up to 70% of the 180 million euros that bank creditors including  Bankia  (MC:BKIA) and Santander (MC:SAN) are considering lending to the company, the source said.
ICO may also directly lend Abengoa 50 million euros, while an extra 20 million loan is being negotiated with the regional government of Andalusia. Abengoa declined to comment. 
In mid-July, troubled Abengoa postponed until July 27 a final decision on a debt restructuring deal with creditors.
It warned that a lack of liquidity and guarantees was ""severely"" affecting its business, making its viability ""very difficult"" if the transaction is not closed in the short term.
A more than 50% jump in its share price to 0.161 euros on July 14 led Spain's financial regulator CNMV to suspend trading, awaiting the outcome of Abengoa's negotiations with lenders.
A banking source involved in the talks confirmed that ICO was discussing guaranteeing part of bank's credit lines but did not say how much would be backed up by the state. 
Bankia, Santander, the Economy Ministry and the Andalusian government all declined to comment.
The debt restructuring deal is focused on 250 million euros in short-term funding needs and 3.2 billion euros that Abengoa has owed to creditors and providers since 2016, another source familiar with the matter said. 
In 2016, Abengoa avoided becoming Spain's largest ever corporate bankruptcy after striking a deal to refinance 9 billion euros of debt, handing creditors control of the company.
By end-2019, Abengoa's total debt was 5.95 billion euros, of which around 1.2 billion is debt considered up for sale and around 560 million belongs to project finance, according to company data. 
That left corporate debt at 4.2 billion euros, it showed.

With a re-election race underway and the coronavirus pandemic raging in the country, the White House is looking to bring down drug prices by reportedly considering tying them to what consumers outside the United States pay. 
The S&P 500 was down 1.3%, with drugmakers such as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) inc weighing on the index. The declines were in line with a fall in broader markets. 
Given that the speculation of an executive order on drug pricing surfaced roughly a month ago, stocks in the healthcare sector are unlikely to take a hit in the near term, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Jared Holz said.
The administration's move would likely be viewed more as political posturing than a critical moment for the pharmaceutical industry, Holz added. 
Trump, who had previously urged lawmakers to rein in drug costs, will deliver remarks and sign the executive orders at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT) on Friday, according to the president's schedule issued by the White House on Thursday.
Drugmakers often negotiate rebates or discounts on their list prices in exchange for favorable treatment from insurers and other healthcare payers. As a result, insurers and covered patients rarely pay the full list price of a drug.
Elimination of rebates is likely not included in the orders, Politico reported on Thursday. (https://politi.co/3huHoV0)
Such an order would be positive for health insurers UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH),  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) and CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), said Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes. 
Cigna and CVS were among the handful of healthcare movers in the black. 

Drugmakers Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Co Inc were trading down in morning trading.

KUALA LUMPUR/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) will pay $3.9 billion to settle Malaysia's criminal probe over the U.S. investment bank's role in the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal, closing a key front in the multi-jurisdictional investigation that has hung over Goldman. 
Goldman Sachs shares rose 0.68% in New York morning trading on the Malaysia news and signals the U.S. Department of Justice could be near closing a similar probe. 
A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment.
""We view this as positive as GS is closer to removing a key overhang for investors, and this provides added comfort that the total settlement amount should be manageable,"" wrote Steven Chubak, an analyst at New York-based Wolfe Research.
""We still do not know how this will impact negotiations with the US regulators, but we expect some relief to be extended to Goldman given DOJ guidance to avoid 'piling on',"" Chubak wrote. 
The deal includes a $2.5 billion cash payout by Goldman and its guarantee to return at least $1.4 billion in proceeds from assets linked to sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), the two sides said. 
In return, Malaysia will drop all criminal charges against the bank, which had pleaded not guilty and consistently denied wrongdoing.
""We are pleased to have reached an agreement in principle with the Government of Malaysia to resolve outstanding charges and claims against Goldman Sachs,"" the bank said in a statement. ""Today's settlement is an important step towards putting the 1MDB matter behind us.""
Malaysian and U.S. authorities estimate $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB in an elaborate scheme that spanned the globe and implicated high-level officials in the fund, former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, Goldman staff and others.
Goldman had socked away around $3 billion in reserves for legal matters, more than covering the settlement with Malaysia.
It remained unclear whether the bank has put aside enough cash to cover a potential settlement with the Justice Department, which is reportedly looking at whether the bank violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The FCPA bars U.S. companies from paying foreign government officials for help in getting or keeping business. 
In recent years, the Justice Department has pledged to take into account parallel settlements when calculating corporate penalties. A source told Reuters in December that Goldman was in talks with the U.S. government and a state regulator to possibly pay up to $2 billion to resolve the investigation.
""If past major foreign corrupt practice cases are a good indicator (which we think they are), the DOJ settlement could wipe out most of the great second quarter they just put up,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr on Friday.
MALAYSIA VICTORY
The settlement is the biggest Malaysia has reached so far in its efforts to recover funds allegedly stolen from 1MDB, and is a big victory for the four-month old administration of Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin. 
""We are confident that we are securing more money from Goldman Sachs compared to previous attempts, which were far below expectations,"" Finance Minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz said in a statement. 
U.S. prosecutors said the money was used to buy artwork, including paintings by Vincent Van Gogh and Claude Monet, luxury properties and to fund the ""Wolf of Wall Street"" movie. 
Goldman helped the fund raise $6.5 billion in two bond offerings, earning itself $600 million in fees, according to the U.S. Justice Department. 
Malaysian prosecutors filed charges in December 2018 against three of the bank's units alleging it misled investors. 

Goldman has said that certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to it about how proceeds from the bond sales would be used.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz on Friday proposed to toughen financial oversight of companies, seeking to pre-empt an expected parliamentary backlash over the failure of regulators to spot the huge fraud that obliterated Wirecard (DE:WDIG).
Scholz rushed out a reform agenda that would give financial watchdog BaFin greater investigative and enforcement powers, broaden its mandate to cover non-banking financial institutions and toughen penalties against lax auditors.
""We need to trust balance sheets,"" Scholz said. ""That's why we're working on an action plan to put a stop to this kind of balance sheet trickery.""
Payment services company Wirecard filed for insolvency a month ago after admitting that 1.9 billion euros ($2.2 billion) supposedly held in trustee accounts by overseas partners probably did not exist.
Prosecutors this week arrested former Wirecard Chief Executive Markus Braun and two other former executives on suspicion of orchestrating a years-long criminal racket to inflate revenue and balances to hide losses dating back to 2015.
This enabled the company to borrow 3.2 billion euros by deception, prosecutors allege. That money is now almost certainly lost, making the collapse of Wirecard Germany's biggest accounting scandal.
The Scholz plan was released ahead of a closed-door hearing of parliament's finance committee next Wednesday. 
Opposition lawmakers are expected to grill Scholz and Economy Minister Peter Altmaier over the German establishment's failure for years to heed warnings from journalists and market sceptics that Wirecard was cooking the books.
'TOTAL DISASTER'
Some are demanding a full-blown parliamentary inquiry.
Katja Hessel, the finance committee chair who represents the opposition Free Democrats, called for BaFin chief Felix Hufeld to resign. She told Wirtschaftswoche magazine that Hufeld had failed to make full use of BaFin's powers.
Hufeld has described Wirecard's collapse as a ""total disaster"" but rejected accusations of bungling, saying BaFin lacked the power to intervene because it could only do so if called on by a separate accounting oversight board.
The Finance Ministry, which oversees BaFin, wants to empower the regulator to intervene directly if it suspects wrongdoing, as well as to undertake or commission forensic audits. 
In Wirecard's case, in-house auditor EY gave Wirecard a clean bill of health for more than a decade. Evidence of fraud was only uncovered by a separate forensic audit by KPMG that was commissioned by the company itself.
The Justice Ministry backs proposals to increase penalties - now capped at a paltry 4 million euros - if auditors fail to fulfil their duty of care and also supports plans that would prevent auditors from handling a company's books for more than 10 years running.
But not all ministries are on board with the plan championed by Scholz, who is also vice chancellor and a senior figure in the Social Democrats, the junior coalition partner to Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU).
""There is absolutely no need for a government action plan,"" said a source from a CDU-led department. ""What the Finance Ministry needs to do is clean up this mess and get its house in order.""

926,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2020 11:05AM ET</span>",Airbus offers subsidy concession to end U.S. tariffs,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Europe's Airbus said on Friday it would increase loan repayments to France and Spain in a ""final"" bid to reverse U.S. tariffs and jog the United States into settling a 16-year-old dispute over billions of dollars of aircraft subsidies.
The European Union, France and Spain said the move to raise interest rates paid by Airbus on A350 aircraft development loans should settle the row at the World Trade Organization and urged Washington to withdraw tariffs on EU goods.
""In the absence of a settlement, the EU will be ready to fully avail itself of its own sanction rights,"" EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan said.
The loans are part of a system targeted by the United States in the world's largest corporate trade dispute, which has also aired condemnation of U.S. support for Boeing (NYSE:BA).
The United States last year won WTO authorization to impose tariffs on up to $7.5 billion of EU goods from wine to whisky.
Trade groups are bracing for an escalation of the row in the autumn when the EU is expected to win WTO approval to hit back with its own tariffs over subsidies for Boeing.
The WTO has faulted both Europe and the United States for doling out illegal support to their respective jetmakers. But for the last eight years, the argument has been chiefly about whether each side obeyed those rulings amid multiple appeals.
""With this final move, Airbus considers itself in complete compliance with all WTO rulings,"" Airbus said. 
In May, the United States declared itself in full compliance with WTO findings after Washington state abolished aerospace industry tax breaks that largely benefited Boeing.
INDUSTRY PRESSURE
Although Airbus is not officially a party to the case - which pits the United States against the EU as well as Britain, France, Germany and Spain - Friday's statement opens the door for negotiations to settle the dispute, a European source said.
Both sides have repeatedly urged negotiations while accusing the other of failing to respond seriously to the invitation.
Boeing had no immediate comment. The United States Trade Representative did not immediately reply to request for comment. 
""This is an interesting development but there is a lack of detail and no reference to remedying illegal subsidies for the A380,"" a U.S. source said.
Airbus says A380 funding is no longer relevant after it decided to axe the world's largest jetliner over weak sales.
The latest move comes amid increasing pressure on Airbus and European governments from industries hit by U.S. tariffs.
They are angry at being penalised for illegal support for planemakers just when their own industries are reeling from the coronavirus epidemic. The Scotch Whisky Association called for a settlement before tariffs caused ""irreparable damage"".
The fallout is not limited to Europe. 
Airbus said U.S. airlines had been hurt by tariffs on European jets. The U.S. Distilled Spirits Council said drinks firms on both sides of the Atlantic ""have suffered enough"". 
European officials are trying to quash the U.S. tariffs on legal grounds but say they have been thwarted by a procedural row after Washington blocked appointments to the WTO's appeals body. U.S. President Donald Trump has been critical of the WTO.
At the same time, the timetable for EU retaliatory sanctions has slipped by several months, to September or October.

""We are in an impasse and need to get out of it. It is a way to show good faith and open the door to find a solution,"" a European industry source said, referring to the rejigged loans.

(Reuters) - Oilfield services giant Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) on Friday outlined plans for deeper spending cuts after recording a $3.7 billion charge and a second straight quarterly loss on thousands of job cuts and a pipeline outage in Ecuador.
The large loss capped second-quarter reports from U.S. oilfield services providers that laid bare the damage wreaked by the coronavirus crisis. Producers cut spending about 40% this year as energy prices and demand sank on pandemic-related shutdowns. 
Schlumberger has cut some 21,000 jobs, a fifth of its workforce, amid the steep drop in activity. Second quarter charges included $1.02 billion for severance costs, $977 million for asset impairments, and $730 million on Latin America projects, where a landslide disrupted a major customer. 
Although crude prices have recovered from the historic declines in March and April, they are down around 33% for the year. Schlumberger plans to cut another $300 million from this year's spending, bringing total cuts to a 45% decrease from last year. 
A COVID-19 resurgence could upset the company's outlook for a near-term normalization of oil prices, Chief Executive Olivier Le Peuch said in a statement. He did not offer an earnings outlook for the rest of the year. 
Schlumberger, which is continuing to restructure to adjust to the price crash, said North American revenue fell to $1.18 billion in the second quarter, less than half of what it was a year earlier, with only slightly better conditions expected in the current quarter.
Conditions are set ""for a modest frac completion activity increase in North America, though from a very low base,"" Le Peuch said, referring to work to complete shale oil wells. 
Schlumberger stock was down slightly at $19.23 per share in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Wall Street praised the spending cuts. 
""Hefty cost reduction efforts drove much healthier than anticipated (adjusted) earnings results,"" wrote Tudor Pickering Holt & Co analysts in a note. 
The world's largest oilfield services provider reported a net loss of $3.43 billion, or $2.47 per share, for the second quarter, compared with a profit of $492 million, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding charges, the company earned 5 cents per share.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower again on Friday as selling continued amid concerns that the U.S. economy is stalling and that the country is gearing up for a long confrontation with China. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT). the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 171 points, or 0.6% at 26,482 points. The S&P 500 fell 1% but bounced to be down only 0.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.0%.
The market was unsettled not only by weak jobless data and fresh figures showing the Covid-19 virus still rampant throughout the country, but also by comments from President Donald Trump at his newly-resumed press briefing on Thursday that appeared to prepare the ground for ripping up the phased trade deal with China. 
Trump said that the deal ""means less"" to him now than it did at the start of the year, due to China's role in spreading the virus. His comments came on the back of a witheringly critical speech of China by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, which called an end to 50 years of what he styled as naive engagement with the country.  China on Friday ordered the U.S. to close its consulate in Chengdu, in retaliation for the U.S. ordering the closure of China's in Houston earlier in the week. 
Domestic policy concerns also weighed on the market in addition to foreign policy ones, as Senate Republicans failed to agree a common line with the administration and with each other on how to shape the next round of economic support measures. The proposals from Senate Leader Mitch McConnell are now unlikely to be presented before Monday, losing a valuable couple of days' negotiating time as the clock runs down on the current, temporary, support for over 16 million unemployed.
The most brutal moves in individual stocks were in tech, which had been the recipient of the hottest money in previous sessions. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock fell 17% after it announced another delay to the start of production of its next-generation chips, the 7-nanometer standard in which rival AMD is already established. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock rose 10.4%, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) rose 10.2%. 
Verizon (NYSE:VZ) stock outperformed with a 2.8% rise after it posted surprisingly strong results for the second quarter, adding nearly three times as many new users as expected.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, which is vulnerable to profit-taking after rising over 40% in the last month, slipped 6.8% amid ongoing suspicion that the company's financial health is less robust than its quarterly figures suggested. In addition to its dependence on the sale of emissions credits for keeping the bottom line positive, analysts also pointed to two straight quarters of lower average selling prices, an unsustainable lockdown-driven drop in operating costs and its reliance on a Chinese market which may be vulnerable to political shenanigans.
Elsewhere, Gold Futures finally cracked the $1,900 mark for the first time in nine years as bond yields plumbed new depths. U.S. Crude Oil Futures also edged lower amid mounting evidence that the tightening of restrictive public health measures is choking off the rebound in U.S. fuel demand."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Friday issued an emergency airworthiness directive for 2,000 U.S.-registered Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 NG and Classic aircraft that have been in storage, warning they could have corrosion that could lead to a dual-engine failure.
The directive covers planes not operated for seven or more consecutive days. The FAA issued the directive after inspectors found compromised air check valves when bringing aircraft out of storage. 
If corrosion is found, the valve must be replaced prior to the aircraft's return to service, the FAA said. 
Boeing said on Friday it had advised operators to inspect the planes and added ""with airplanes being stored or used infrequently due to lower demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, the valve can be more susceptible to corrosion.""
U.S. airlines stored thousands of airplanes after the coronavirus pandemic sharply reduced travel demand and some have been bringing some aircraft back into service as demand rises.
The directive covering the 737 NG (600 to 900 series) and 737 Classic (737-300 to 737-500 series) was prompted by four recent reports of single-engine shutdowns caused by engine bleed air 5th stage check valves stuck in the open position.
The FAA said the AD is to address corrosion of the engine bleed air 5th stage check valves for both engines. The FAA said that could result in compressor stalls and dual-engine power loss without the ability to restart.
Boeing said it is providing inspection and replacement information to fleet owners if they find an issue.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways owner IAG  (L:ICAG) is set to issue shares at the end of the summer in a bid to raise up to 2.5 billion euros ($2.88 billion) to keep the business afloat and avoid a government bailout, several sources said.
International Consolidated Airlines Group (L:ICAG) is most likely to raise capital with a rights issue, where new shares are offered to existing shareholders at a discount, by the beginning of September, two of the sources added.
Other options, such as an equity placing and a concurrent issuance of convertible bonds are also being considered, the sources said. 
""Being a rescue deal, investors will undoubtedly prefer to have more visibility on air traffic during the summer months,"" one said.
IAG's share price has lost 66% of its value since the start of the year, as global air travel came to a halt during the coronavirus crisis.
The Anglo-Spanish group, which also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus, renewed a 750 million pound ($955 million) partnership multi-year deal with  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) on Friday.
IAG declined to comment. 
With passenger numbers decimated this year and experts forecasting it will be years before they recover, global airlines began sweeping restructuring processes and in many cases sought state assistance.
Air France (PA:AIRF) secured a 7 billion euro aid package from the French government and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) agreed a 9 billion euro government bailout.
IAG, which is also reviewing a planned 1 billion euro acquisition of Spanish carrier Air Europa because of the harsh economic climate, has not asked for a specific government bail-out but has taken advantage of state-backed loan schemes in Britain and Spain. British Airways has warned it needs to cut 12,000 jobs.
Spanish airlines Iberia and Vueling have secured 1 billion euros of government-backed loans in May. BA has also accessed the UK coronavirus corporate finance facility and used the government's furlough schemes.
The company is working with U.S. investment banks Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and its corporate brokers  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) on the plan, the sources said, expecting an announcement could coincide with results on July 31.
DB and Barclays declined to comment. GS and MS did not respond to a request for comment. 
IAG reported a first-quarter operating loss before exceptional items of 535 million euros and expects significantly worse losses in the second quarter, reflecting the full extent of travel lockdowns during the pandemic.

Although stay-at-home orders cut down store visits, limiting new sign-ups in a quarter that was almost entirely spent under lockdown rules, a pick up in demand for internet services helped the company add more phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill.
In the second quarter, Verizon added 173,000 postpaid phone customers, well above analysts' average estimate of 61,200, according to research firm FactSet.
Total operating revenue fell 5.1% to $30.4 billion but beat the analysts' average estimate of $29.93 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The company attributed the fall in revenue to a decline in device sales in the quarter, hurt by lockdown-led store closures.
It has been gradually repopening stores and at the end of the quarter more than 60% of company-operated retail stores were open, Verizon said in a statement.
In the previous quarter, Verizon bled 68,000 monthly paying phone subscribers as it had to quickly close 70% of its stores.
Revenue in Verizon's media unit, which includes Yahoo, HuffPost and TechCrunch, declined 24.5% in the second quarter to $1.4 billion from a year earlier as companies cut down on advertising to rein in expenses.
Net income rose to $4.84 billion, or $1.13 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30 from $4.07 billion, or $0.95 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, Verizon earned $1.18 per share, above analysts' average estimate of $1.15.

LONDON/ROME (Reuters) - Activist hedge fund TCI Fund Management said it has submitted a complaint to the European Commission over ""illegitimate expropriation"" by the Italian government of Atlantia's motorways unit Autostrade per l’Italia.
TCI, an investor in Atlantia, said in its complaint that Italy's order that Atlantia sell down its stake in Autostrade ""seriously threatened the fundamental principles of the EU Capital Market Union"". 
The move adds a new dimension to the battle over Autostrade, whose future has been in question ever since a motorway bridge it operated in the northern city of Genoa collapsed in mid-2018, killing 43 people.
The disaster exposed a record of management failure and fuelled heavy political pressure to strip the motorway concession from the powerful Benetton family that controls Atlantia through its 30% stake.
After months of dispute, the government reached a compromise that left Autostrade with the concession but forced Atlantia to hand over control to state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti and allied investors.
However, TCI said the deal disregarded the rights of other investors in Atlantia. ""If the government want to punish the Benetton family with a low price, it is punishing international investors, and this is illegal,"" Jonathan Amouyal, a partner at TCI Advisory Services, told Reuters.
""What we want is a fair process and a fair price. What we don't want is that Italy not respect the rule of law,"" he said, adding that he believed Autostrade's valuation was between 11-12 billion euros at pre-money equity value.
In a separate letter sent to the Italian Treasury on Wednesday, TCI said the government's actions had caused ""significant losses"" to international investors.
""The Italian government has repeatedly violated the principles of legal certainty, legitimate expectations and proportionality which are all key pillars of the Italian Constitution and the European Union,"" said the letter seen by Reuters.

TCI said in an earlier letter to the Treasury on Monday that the government had violated the principles of legal certainty and proportionality in its handling of Atlantia.

939,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2020 08:15AM ET</span>",U.S. insurers explore officer coverage as police reform debate rages,"By Suzanne Barlyn and Alwyn Scott
(Reuters) - U.S. insurers and brokers are starting to craft professional liability coverage for police officers, spurred on by signs that policymakers in some cities and states want to use a financial stick to curb police misconduct.
They see a potential market opening up after a New York state lawmaker this month introduced legislation, which would require individual officers to carry liability coverage for lawsuits alleging excessive force, abuse or other misconduct.
""I think we're in a new world,"" said New York-based Mark Turkalo at the insurance brokerage unit of Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc, about the trend. Turkalo said the firm is exploring whether it could develop the coverage.
The bill authored by Democratic Senator Alessandra Biaggi follows a number of police reforms in New York and other U.S. states and cities, which were prompted by a wave of protests against police brutality and racial injustice since May.
Biaggi's bill would require local governments to pay for the individual policies, but officers would pay any premium increases arising from their misconduct. 
As premiums rise, ""it would force an officer to either change their behavior or leave the field of law enforcement,"" Biaggi told Reuters.
Insurers could build on the handful of policies that already exist for police officers who become embroiled in police work while off duty, said Anne Marie Towle, an executive at broker Hylant Group Inc in Ohio, adding she believes the idea will become more mainstream.
She is working with an actuary to analyze potential losses and with Prymus Insurance Co, a private North Carolina insurer specializing in unusual risks, to try and develop a product, she said.
Prymus Chief Executive Jeff Harrison confirmed the company is working on police liability coverage. It has to be affordable for police, he said. ""But officers that break the law need to be held accountable."" 
Currently, most police officers rely on municipalities to cover legal costs and payouts to victims, either from public funds or blanket insurance. Critics say that provides no incentive for officers to check their behavior, often leaving taxpayers on the hook. New York City paid $220 million last year for police department settlements of civil lawsuits, far more than any other of the city's agencies, public data show. [https://tmsnrt.rs/2CZmrT1] 
The bill faces stiff opposition from powerful police unions who say it would be costly for already-underpaid officers and make recruitment more difficult, but it underscores that the broader concept is starting to gain ground amid the raging debate on police reform.
GROWING POLICY MOVEMENT
The idea of using liability coverage to sanction police who use excessive force has been championed by some criminal justice experts since 2014, when police fatally shot Black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. A similar policy qualified as a Minneapolis ballot measure in 2016, but a court ruling blocked it from being voted on. 
Colorado last month passed a law that holds police officers personally liable for 5% or $25,000 of damages if their employer determines they did not act in good faith.
Policymakers in California and Florida have also expressed interest in the idea, according to Clark Neily, vice president for criminal justice at Washington, D.C., think tank Cato Institute, who has been studying the issue for the past two years. He said he had spoken with a handful of insurers in the last few months about the nuts and bolts of police liability insurance. 
Some insurers contacted by Reuters privately raised concerns about wading into a political quagmire. They also face a hurdle accessing police disciplinary records, which are confidential in many states, according to legal experts. 
""A lot of our clients are asking"" about the policies and carriers are working on coverage, said a senior executive at a U.S. insurance broker who was not authorized to speak publicly.
Neily's discussions with insurers have focused on how much to charge and where to cap payouts. Based on those discussions, he said he believes $500,000 or $1 million would cover most claims and that cities could use broader policies to cover amounts beyond that.
""The real challenge is assessing the exposure and pricing policies accordingly,"" said Neily. ""Some insurance companies feel that is too challenging. Others feel like this is absolutely something they will be able to work with.""

The Nur-Sultan government aims to hold emerging markets investor Daniel Chapman and his companies liable for all damages it has suffered as a result of lawsuits filed against it by Moldovan tycoon Anatolie Stati, his son and their companies, who are seeking to foreclose on a stake in a giant Kazakh oilfield.
Stati has won an arbitration award against Kazakhstan and has filed enforcement lawsuits in Britain, the European Union and the United States, briefly freezing $22 billion in assets owned by Kazakhstan's rainy-day National Fund.
Although that freeze has been lifted, over $6 billion in other Kazakh sovereign fund assets remain frozen, mostly in the Netherlands, due to lawsuits by Stati and partners who accuse Kazakhstan of illegally nationalising their energy business.
Kazakhstan has in turn accused Stati of defrauding both the former Soviet republic and the Swedish arbitrators who ruled in his favour, charges he and his companies deny.
Further upping the stakes, in a lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, the Nur-Sultan government accused Chapman and his companies of ""conspiring with, and aiding and abetting, a fraudulent scheme"" led by Stati.
Kazakhstan is seeking a jury trial and pursuing relief permitted by law, including compensatory and punitive damages.
""This includes any damages arising from the legal proceedings initiated by or involving the Statis in which the fraudulent scheme was perpetuated,"" Justice Minister Marat Beketayev said in a statement.
A spokeswoman for Chapman and Argentem Creek Partners, a company where he serves as chief executive and which is also targeted in the lawsuit, said he and the company had no comment on the matter. A spokesman for Stati also had no comment.
The Stati camp said this month they would press ahead with legal proceedings, expected to conclude next year, to foreclose Kazakh sovereign fund Samruk-Kazyna's stake in the giant Kashagan oilfield, after a Dutch court of appeal ruled in favour of recognising the arbitral award.

(Reuters) - Shares in cinema operators Cineworld (L:CINE) and AMC (N:AMC) fell on Friday after  Disney  (N:DIS) delayed the release of ""Mulan"", the latest Hollywood tentpole to be pushed back as theatres remain largely shut because of the coronavirus crisis.
Chinese-controlled AMC (N:AMC), the United States' largest chain, said on Thursday it was postponing reopenings across the country as COVID-19 cases grow at an alarming rate in some states.
Britain's Cineworld, which has also delayed the reopening of its U.S. theatres to mid-August, has reopened in Europe and plans to restart main UK operations at the end of July, but analysts worry that could be delayed and predict limited ticket sales.
Shares in Cineworld, already headed for their worst-ever yearly fall with an 80% plunge, were down 9% at 48.3 pence by 1103 GMT.
""Until the total relaxation of social distancing rules, the pressure on finances will be quite significant, which suggests more job losses and cinema closures in the months ahead,"" CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said.
J.P.Morgan analyst Alexander Mees estimated Cineworld would burn around $50 million per month while cinemas remain shut.
Rating agency Fitch last week said the company's abandoning of its purchase of Canadian chain Cineplex and increased debt facilities could help it withstand another 9 to 10 months of cash-burn.
The delay of ""Mulan"" follows the cancellation of the release of Christopher Nolan's thriller ""Tenet"" this week. Paramount Pictures also delayed ""Top Gun: Maverick"" until Dec. 23, 2020, while several other big-budget releases have been pushed back.
""Cinema-going will not be back in full swing until there is new content to show,"" Mees said.
""The risks are high ... as we do not know at this stage whether customers will come back in the same numbers. It will also take a few years to work off (Cineworld's) debt balance.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open lower Friday, continuing Thursday’s weak tone, weighed by concerns over the economic recovery, the deteriorating relationship between the U.S. and China and concerns about the timing of the new coronavirus relief bill.
At 7:30 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 11 points, or 0.3%, lower, Nasdaq Futures down 93 points, or 0.9%. The Dow Futures contract fell 78 points, or 0.3%. 
On Thursday, the S&P 500 cash index lost 1.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.3%, its worst day in nearly one month. All three indexes are likely to record a losing week at the close.
Senate Republicans delayed rolling out their roughly $1 trillion coronavirus relief bill until next week, amid differences with the White House, to say nothing of the necessary negotiations with the opposition Democrats who control the House.
This has raised doubts that this relief bill, which includes plans on unemployment insurance and direct cash payments, will be passed before Congress goes on recess in August.
The need for more stimulus was illustrated with Thursday’s rise in unemployment claims, the first time this figure has moved higher since March, suggesting the jobs recovery is stalling.
Meanwhile, Sino-U.S. relations continue to deteriorate after China ordered the United States to close its consulate in the city of Chengdu on Friday, responding to being told to shut its consulate in Houston earlier this week.
At his press briefing on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to prepare the ground for further trade measures against China, saying the spread of Covid-19 meant that the deal ""means less"" to him than at the start of the year.
The number of Covid-19 cases in the U.S. has now topped 4 million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, doubling in just six weeks.
Contributing to the negative tone Friday was disappointing news from Dow-component Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which announced a delay in the rollout of its next generation of semiconductor technology.
The earnings season will continue Friday, with Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) both beating expectations but unable to avoid sharp drops in profit.
U.S. economic data Friday includes new home sales, at 10 AM ET, which are expected to come in at 700,000 in June, compared with 676,000 in May. 
The IHS Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index also publishes Friday, and is estimated at 51.5 versus the previous 49.8, that is, back in expansion territory.
Oil prices pushed higher Friday, helped by weakness in the U.S. dollar, although demand concerns stemming from rising coronavirus cases and a faltering economic recovery in the U.S., the biggest consumer of crude, have tempered the gains.
At 7:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% higher at $41.52 a barrel, while Brent rose 0.3% to $43.45.
Elsewhere, gold futures was flat at 1,890.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1590, down 0.1%, having earlier reached a 22-month high."

LONDON (Reuters) - The collapse of German payments firm Wirecard has become a focal point for an overhaul of how the European Union regulates the finance industry as it evolves away from traditional banks towards fintech companies, its financial services chief said.
Wirecard's implosion to leave a $2.1 billion hole in its books came more than a decade after the first allegations of fraud by some investors and journalists.
As a financial technology company, albeit one that owned a bank, Wirecard was long considered as being in a grey area when it came to traditional bank supervision.
""We will assess how to improve the relevant EU rules so these kinds of cases can be detected,"" Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters, adding that the review is set to end after the summer.
It will look at whether changes are needed to the bloc's rules on transparency requirements for listed companies, accounting norms and existing regulation aimed at stamping out market abuses, he said.
Wirecard seems not to have provided reliable and trustful information to investors and therefore was in breach of current rules, Dombrovskis said.
But there was also a need to examine supervision by regulators, and not just the rules themselves, he said.
Germany's financial supervisor BaFin and the accounting watchdog - the privately-owned Financial Reporting Enforcement Panel (FREP) have come under scrutiny in the wake of Wirecard's collapse. BaFin and FREP supervised Wirecard.
Wirecard was a hybrid company that processed electronic payments and also owned a bank, leaving regulators at odds over how it should be supervised.
Lessons from Wirecard could also be applied to the bloc's work on how to supervise ""critical third party"" providers such as tech related companies, Dombrovskis said.
The Commission had launched a public consultation on its digital finance strategy, though it was unclear if the German company would have come under this criteria. 

The strategy looks at how the same risks, whether from a technology or a financial company, should be regulated and supervised in the same way.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A much-anticipated deep dive into antitrust allegations against four of America's largest tech companies and recommendations on how to tame their market power could be released by late summer or early fall from the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, senior committee aides said.
The committee has received 1.3 million documents from the companies so far, they said in a call with reporters on Thursday. 
The panel will question the CEOs of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as part of its investigation into whether the companies' business practices hurt smaller rivals. The hearing was supposed to be held on July 27 but has been delayed.
On Thursday, Reuters reported that the chief executives will defend themselves by saying their companies face intense competition and by pushing back against claims they are dominant.
All four companies will testify voluntarily and no subpoenas have been issued, the committee aides said. 
In May, Representative David Cicilline, chair of the Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, had demanded Jeff Bezos testify and threatened Amazon with a subpoena, after reports surfaced Amazon employees tapped data from small sellers in the company’s marketplace to make decisions about the online retailer launching its own competing products, despite telling lawmakers it did not engage in such practices.
Addressing questions about the format of the high-profile hearing, the aides said, there will be a single panel with all four CEOs attending virtually. Members of the subcommittee led by Cicilline, however, will attend either in person or online. 
""The number of rounds of questioning is up to the discretion of the chair,"" said one committee aide.
Asked if the hearing would uncover new information, a senior aide said that despite the risk of companies not always answering questions fully it was important to hear from decision makers.

""This is not like a normal oversight hearing, where we hear from the CEO's and move on.""

The company's net income fell to $257 million, or 29 cents per share, in the second-quarter ended June 30, from $1.76 billion, or $2.07 per share, a year earlier. 
The health crisis has hammered economies worldwide and triggered mass layoffs, which in turn made more people default on their bills, hurting credit card issuers.
AmEx said its consolidated loss provisions stood at $1.6 billion, up from $861 million a year ago, with the increase driven primarily by new reserves created to account for the effects of the pandemic.
Total revenue, excluding interest expense, fell 29.2% to $7.67 billion. 

Rivals Visa (N:V) and Mastercard (N:MA) are expected to report their quarterly results next week.

952,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 24, 2020 06:54AM ET</span>","Goldman, Malaysia Reach $3.9 Billion Settlement Over 1MDB","(Bloomberg) --  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). has reached a deal that would see Malaysia drop all criminal charges against the bank in exchange for $3.9 billion of reparations for its role in raising money for the troubled sovereign wealth fund 1MDB.
The deal includes a cash settlement of $2.5 billion paid to Malaysia, the ministry of finance said on Friday. At least another $1.4 billion will come from seized 1MDB assets being returned with the help of the U.S. Department of Justice and Goldman Sachs, it said in a statement.
The deal amount along with monies Malaysia has received from the Justice Department would amount to more than $4.5 billion, the finance ministry said. It’s unclear how the settlement with Malaysia will impact discussions between Goldman Sachs and the Justice Department. The bank is close to an agreement in the U.S. after tussling over a potential guilty plea, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month.
The deal moves Goldman closer to ending its biggest legal threat since the darkest days of the 2008 financial crisis. Goldman helped the Malaysian government raise $6.5 billion for the 1MDB fund, collecting some $600 million in fees from bond sales in 2012 and 2013, according to court filings. Prosecutors allege that part of that money was diverted to 1MDB officials and their associates.
Malaysian prosecutors brought charges against three units of the bank in 2018, then followed with additional accusations against Goldman’s 17 current and former executives last year. The bank has consistently denied wrongdoing, saying that former Malaysian officials lied about how proceeds from the bond sales would be used.
The deal won’t affect charges against fugitive financier Low Taek Jho or other parties, Malaysia’s finance ministry said.
Goldman’s former Southeast Asia Chairman Tim Leissner has pleaded guilty to U.S. charges including conspiracy to launder money and has admitted to bribing officials in Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates to get bond deals for the bank. Former Goldman banker Roger Ng has been extradited from Malaysia to the U.S. to face similar charges.
“This settlement represents Goldman’s acknowledgment of the misconduct of two of its former employees in the broader 1MDB fraudulent and corruption scheme,” Malaysia’s finance ministry said.
The settlement is a major milestone for Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, a step toward ending the nation’s years-long effort to recover billions of dollars lost through the scandal. In 2018, the affair led to the country’s first change of government since its independence, when Mahathir Mohamad took over as prime minister from Najib Razak, who now faces multiple charges related to 1MDB. The Mahathir government demanded as much as $7.5 billion from Goldman Sachs, while its negotiators had touted figures of around $2 billion to $3 billion in private discussions.
The state fund remains a sore political point even after another power shift this February, as Malaysia’s current government under Muhyiddin counts on the backing of United Malays National Organisation, the former ruling party once led by Najib."

""As a bank with a history going back 300 years, ABN Amro too is aware that there may be some episodes in our past of which we cannot be proud,"" the bank said.
A spokesman for the bank said it was unclear how long the study would take and what consequences it might have.
The Dutch central bank this month also said it would examine its role in the slave trade.
The Dutch played a major role in the global slave trade from the 17th century until the Netherlands abolished slavery in 1863. The Dutch West India Company operated ships estimated to have traded 500,000 slaves in the 17th and 18th centuries.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors pumped money into cash, investment grade bonds and gold, but pulled money out of equities, BofA's weekly fund flow statistics showed on Friday, signalling a move away from high-risk assets.
Money managers have allocated $40.9 billion to cash, the largest inflow since May 6, and $24.5 billion into bond funds, third largest inflow ever, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said.
Investors pumped $3.8 billion into gold, the second largest inflow into the commodity ever. But there were $3.8 billion in redemptions from equities.
The investment bank noted two big themes emerging in the financial markets - a great repression in interest rates and a great debasement of the U.S. dollar, which it said should incite rotation from deflation to inflation.
The bank said $8 trillion of monetary stimulus via central bank asset purchases in 2020 had crushed interest rates, corporate bond spreads and volatility.
Central banks' bond-buying programmes across developed markets have pushed the ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA MOVE index that tracks expected volatility in the U.S. Treasury market to 43, close to a record low, after the index rose above 160, its highest level in more than a decade, four months ago. (MOVE)

LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Global shares skidded further from five-month peaks on Friday as a bounce back in European business activity did little to ease the jitters surrounding Sino-U.S. tensions, while gold approached a record high.
The mood darkened after Beijing ordered the United States to close its consulate in Chengdu, in retaliation for being told to shut its consulate in Houston earlier this week.
""An escalation in U.S.-China tensions that could have hugely negative consequences on stock market leadership, particularly around the US tech giants, is worrying,"" said International markets analysis and insights from Stephen Innes, Chief Global Market Strategist at AxiCorp.
""Even more so, if President Trump pulls the free pass into China, and things could turn quite ugly into the weekend as traders will have no option but pare risk.""
Unsurprisingly, Chinese blue chips led the declines, retreating 4.4%, wiping out a week of gains.
European shares were on course for their worst day in a month, with the pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 down 1.9%.
Technology stocks led losses, following their U.S. peers overnight, while the China-sensitive basic materials sector lost 2.4%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 1.9%. Tokyo was closed for a holiday, but Nikkei futures were trading 1% lower.
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 edged down 0.8%.
(GRAPHIC: U.S.-China tensions - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmopaljkxva/Pasted%20image%201595576726782.png)
Investors took little comfort from purchasing managers' index (PMI) data which showed euro zone business activity bounced back to growth in July as more parts of the economy that were locked down to curtail the spread of the coronavirus reopened.
British businesses experienced the fastest upturn in five years during July and data for the United States follow later in the day.
The market's dogged optimism on economic recovery had been challenged on Thursday by data showing the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week for the first time in nearly four months.
The euro was at $1.16020, close to its highest level since October 2018, having enjoyed a winning streak for all of July, as the European Union's passing of a 750 billion-euro recovery fund restored confidence.
The yen was up 0.6% at 106.25, its highest since June 23.
The Chinese yuan, a barometer of Sino-U.S. tensions, looks set for its worst week in three months. It was down 0.2% at 7.0276 per dollar in the offshore market.
Italy's 10-year bond yield was steady at around 1.05%, holding near Thursday's 4-1/2 month low at 1.04%. Germany's Bund yield was a touch lower on Friday at -0.49%.
The combination of super-loose money and negative real bond yields has burnished the attractiveness of gold, which pays no yield but is supply constrained. 
The precious metal was last at $1,894.23 an ounce for its biggest weekly gain in more than three months as it held firm near a nine-year high.
Analysts at RBC Capital Markets noted gold-backed exchange traded product holdings had already reached record peaks.
""The level of COVID-19 uncertainty, low and negative real and nominal rates, politics and geopolitics have driven gold prices sharply higher, and pushed allocations among investors ever higher,"" they said in a note.
Oil prices were ending the week on a flat note, having failed to hold a five-month high as worries about global demand offset a weaker U.S. dollar. 

Brent crude was down 1 cent at $43.30 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude up 1 cent at $41.08.

The ""stalking horse"" agreement would imply that any other bids that come in must be higher than the offer made by SPARC.
The agreement is subject to court approval. A court hearing to approve the bid has been set for Aug. 3, while competing offers are due Aug. 5. 
Brooks Brothers said the hearing for the final sale of its assets is set to take place on Aug. 11. 
Owned by Italian billionaire Claudio Del Vecchio, privately held Brooks Brothers was the first to tailor the button-down Polo shirt in 1896 and boasts of having dressed 40 former U.S. presidents including John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama.

Investing.com --  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) CEO Nick Read will be cursing his luck.
The world’s second-biggest mobile network operator had probably hoped for a quiet news day to announce the IPO of its masts unit, Vantage Towers, allowing media and investors to give due attention to Read’s latest big idea for unlocking value for shareholders.
Instead, the screens are awash with red as concerns about the U.S. recovery stalling, the risk of a delay to the latest U.S. stimulus package and the latest diplomatic spat between the U.S. and China.
The benchmark Stoxx 600 fell 1.7% by mid-morning in London, putting it on course to break a streak of three straight weekly gains.
To add insult to injury, Vodafone even underperformed both the broader market and the telecom sector, its stock falling 4.8% to a two-month low, after reporting underwhelming numbers for the first quarter of its fiscal year. The company’s reiteration of an expected 5 billion euros in free cash flow this year – at a time when few are able to give guidance that far ahead – went unrewarded. The market was more concerned about that a 2.8% drop in revenue could become the new normal in the current weak macro environment.
Spinning off the masts business has been a goal for Vodafone for years. The high proportion of fixed costs in the infrastructure puts a premium on their being fully used. Opening up the masts to third-party use makes that easier (as well as helping to keep ever-watchful antitrust regulators off its back). While Vodafone will account for 90% of Vantage's revenue to start with, that share is expected to fall over time. The company expects to keep a majority stake in Vantage all the same.
The attractions of a separate listing have only increased as Read and his team have watched the market attach ever higher multiples to rival mast businesses: Spain’s Cellnex SA has been the standout performer of the year with a rise of 49%, while Italian-based Inwit (in which Vantage Towers will hold a 32% stake) has also outperformed the sector even with a more modest rise of 5.5%. Vodafone stock, by contrast, is down 17% year-to-date.
In addition to the Inwit stake, Vantage Towers will have 68,000 sites across nine European markets. It claims a number 1 or 2 market position in almost all of them. It will be the biggest business of its kind in Europe.
Vodafone may also decide to include its 50% stake in the venture that holds its U.K. masts, CTIL.  Until it does so, however, Vantage Towers looks a very continental European beast, which, together with Vodafone’s own increasing focus on the German market. goes some way to explaining the choice of Frankfurt over London for the listing, which is tentatively set for the first quarter of 2021."

Since lockdowns have eased, flying has restarted, but pressure remains on airline companies like IAG because travel is still at less than half of pre-pandemic levels due to ongoing restrictions for some destinations and consumer worries. 
IAG's finances have been strained by the pandemic, leading to media speculation that it could need to raise new equity. It said at the end of April that it had 10 billion euros ($11.6 billion) of liquidity and it was burning through 200 million euros a week.
The 750 million pound boost from the partnership deal announced on Friday could give it more breathing space. 
Goodbody analysts said in a note that the news was positive, giving the company, whose liquidity could have fallen to around 4 billion euros since its last update, another month's worth of cash burn.
Shares in IAG were down 1.7% at 205 pence, in line with the FTSE 100 index. IAG's shares have lost 67% of their value so far in 2020. 
IAG said that the multi-year renewal agreement with American Express would extend the commercial partnership with the payments company, and that American Express was paying IAG to pre-purchase Avios points, which members of rewards programmes can use to buy flights. 

The airline group, which also owns Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus, is due to report second quarter results on July 31.

""What ultimately matters for growth assets is whether a geopolitical escalation morphs into economic beatdowns,"" Innes added.
A 750-billion euro EU recovery fund and hopes of an eventual COVID-19 vaccine had put European stocks on course to end the week higher, until a U.S. order to shut the Chinese consulate in Houston over accusations of spying drew ire from Beijing.

Still, Germany's DAX (DAX) slumped 2% as tech stocks weighed. London blue-chips (FTSE) hit two-week lows, with investors looking past data that showed UK retail sales jumped back in June to almost pre-coronavirus lockdown levels as non-essential stores in England reopened.
British Gas owner  Centrica  (L:CNA) surged 21.5% to top the STOXX 600, despite posting lower first-half earnings as it announced plans to sell its North American business Direct Energy to NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG) for $3.63 billion.
In earnings, German chemicals distributor  Brenntag AG  (DE:BNRGn) jumped 2.1% after preliminary results showed core earnings beat estimates, while plumbing supplier Ferguson (L:FERG) rose after a fall in sales at it main U.S. operations recovered in the May to July period.

963,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2020 04:25AM ET</span>",Britain's COVID lending schemes risk widening regional divides,"By Sinead Cruise and Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) - In the northern English seaside resort of Blackpool, the family-run Elgin Hotel is preparing to reopen in August after four months' enforced closure. 
The Elgin had a profitable 2019, but bookings so far suggest that the 89-room hotel yards from the seafront will be less than half full this summer, as coronavirus concerns deter older holidaymakers and social distancing reduces capacity.
To help cover lost revenue, the hotel tried to secure an 800,000 pound ($1.02 million) loan under the UK's taxpayer-backed Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS). 
Owner Nigel Seddon said he had applied to five different banks offering loans under the government scheme but he's still waiting to secure the cash he needs, after some lenders said they could not take on new customers or quoted costly terms he would struggle to afford.
Seddon fears that if businesses like his cannot tap sufficient support then deprived towns like Blackpool could fall further behind London and the comparatively wealthy South East of England.
""People feel that all the money is being spent down in London,"" he said.
Blackpool has struggled since its pre-war heyday when families flocked to see its glittering night-time ""Illuminations"" lightshow and relax on its long, sandy beach.
Several deprived areas of England - some of which voted for Brexit and switched from supporting the Labour Party to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives in last December's national election - are now being disproportionately hit economically by the coronavirus. 
Johnson has promised to ""level up"" regional towns and cities. Yet a report published this month by The CityUK, a lobby group, forecast 30% of total lending by UK banks by next March would be in the capital, followed by 15% in the South East, and 10% in the East of England, with all other regions below 10%.
Industry groups say Seddon's experience is common in some of Britain's less well-off regions.
Under CBILS launched in March and its sister initiative, the Bounce-Back Loan Scheme (BBLS), which followed in May, 45 billion pounds of loans have been granted to more than 1 million small and micro companies to help them survive the pandemic.
But unlike in the United States, where the destination of around three quarters of the $521 billion lent under its Paycheck Protection Program has been disclosed, neither the UK government nor finance industry has divulged exactly where the money has been lent.
""We're kind of flying blind at the moment ... we are concerned about regions potentially falling down,"" said Chris Wilford, the Confederation of British Industry's head of financial services policy, pointing to some regions' heavy dependence on ailing sectors like hospitality and manufacturing.
""If one big business reduces its footprint or goes under in some of these towns, then that's devastating,"" he said.
LACK OF TRANSPARENCY
The UK Treasury, which collates data on relief lending, declined a Freedom of Information request from Reuters for a regional breakdown on lending under the CBIL and BBL schemes. 
It said it recognised a need for transparency regarding use of public funds but the regional data was supplied by the banks ""in confidence"" and disclosure of information ""likely to prejudice the commercial interests of lenders would not be in the public interest.""
Trade body UK Finance also declined to provide the breakdown. 
Only one major lender, NatWest Group , shared a regional picture of relief lending, defining regions broadly.
NatWest's data as of early June showed 27% of loans in the North, 24% in the Midlands & Eastern region and 22% in London & South East. The South West & Wales region and Scotland secured 18% and 8% respectively. 
HSBC (L:HSBC), Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) and  Barclays  (L:BARC) said regional data was either unavailable or problematic as each lender defined each region differently.
The CBI's Wilford said the group had begun its own research into how the regions were faring through the COVID crisis, which would likely examine potential regional or sectoral disparities in lending and wider cash flow issues.
Business groups from the North East, South West and North West told Reuters they felt banks were running shy of lending in their areas, where economists predict far deeper economic slumps as a result of the pandemic.
Forecasts published by Oxford Economics show economic output is expected to fall furthest in the West Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber, the North East, and Wales in a range of -6.6% and -5.7% in 2020 compared with 2019 projections.
London's output is seen falling by 4.1%.
Even before the crisis, lending to small businesses in the North West, where the Elgin Hotel is based, fell 11% over the three years to December, compared to a 3% fall in London, according to the latest available data from UK Finance. 
Economic growth in the region was also outstripped by London by three to one, at 10% to 3%, over the three years to September, latest Office for National Statistics' data shows.
Britain has struggled for decades to find ways of fuelling regional growth outside London. The government already spends more than it generates in taxes in every part of Britain apart from London, the South East and the East, according to a Reuters analysis of public spending data.
CAN'T BORROW, WON'T BORROW
Naresh Aggarwal, associate director, policy & technical at the Association of British Treasurers, said any regional lending bias was unlikely to be deliberate but a consequence of banks' reluctance to lend to certain businesses, perhaps due to excessive exposure, which could in turn have a geographic bias.
Others cited poorer banking relationships and a lack of trust felt by borrowers towards banks, particularly since lenders had slashed regional branch networks as part of cost cutting measures since the 2008/09 financial crisis.
""It still feels like there's an institutional bias against places like Cornwall when it comes to CBILS,"" said Kim Conchie, chief executive of the chamber of commerce in Cornwall, one of the poorest counties in England.
Flagging the battle faced by many businesses to secure relief loans above 50,000 pounds, many cash-strapped firms had opted to apply for more modest BBL support instead, he said. 
BBL losses are covered 100% by the taxpayer and applications involve fewer affordability checks than CBILS loans, where banks remain 20% exposed to defaults.
But some of these borrowers would likely need fresh aid soon, as other government relief measures such as the Job Retention Scheme - known as 'furlough' - taper off and deferred rents and other taxes fall due this autumn.
A survey by the North East Chamber of Commerce (NECC) found 65% of its members had accessed the government's furlough scheme, yet more than two thirds had not sought a state-backed loan.
""For the banks, it feels like they want businesses – many of whom are in a short-term crisis – to prove their ability to survive over the next five years before they will help,"" said Jonathan Walker, the NECC's assistant director of Policy.

""That is of course impossible.""

964,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 24, 2020 04:18AM ET</span>",McConnell’s Stimulus Waiting Game Turns Into Race Against Clock,"(Bloomberg) -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell waited until a key component of U.S. coronavirus aid was about to expire before drafting the Republican version of the next major relief bill, a decision that is increasingly looking like a significant miscalculation.
Soaring numbers of virus cases, rising jobless claims and President Donald Trump’s slumping poll numbers have left McConnell in the rare position of struggling to unite Republicans behind a $1 trillion plan as the $600-a-week federal boost to unemployment insurance expires.
It’s a time crunch of their own making. Republicans and Trump squabbled all week over the details of the plan, forcing McConnell to delay the release of the GOP proposal until Monday. That gives Congress little time to avoid a lapse in the unemployment aid.
The expiration is now less of an inducement to get Democrats to the negotiating table than a potential albatross they will try to drape around the necks of endangered Senate Republicans.
There were signs of frustration among some of McConnell’s colleagues.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin touted a “fundamental agreement” among Republicans on a package of spending and tax cuts, and some Republican senators said they were expecting to see bills released as soon as Thursday. When it was clear that wasn’t going to happen, they waited for details at lunch.
Instead, they got alligator sausages courtesy of Louisiana Senator John Kennedy and little more.
“We talked about Louisiana and alligators,” South Dakota Republican Senator Mike Rounds said. “Honestly. We say, ‘Mitch what do you got?’ And he said, ‘We’re working on it. Not much to report yet, but we’re working on it.’”
Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican who opposes the stimulus plan, said after the lunch that “We just found out that we weren’t going to find anything out.”
Senators left Washington for the weekend with no bill text and plenty of details still to iron out. Even once that’s done, McConnell still needs agreement from Democrats, who’ve proposed spending $2.5 trillion more than the GOP on a broader swath of initiatives.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, meanwhile, were playing hardball, rejecting the idea of a stopgap unemployment bill that had been floated by some in the GOP, and blaming Republicans for waiting two months to come up with their own bill.
“One of the reasons we are up against this cliff is that Republicans have dithered,” Schumer said.
It’s not clear at this point the delay will substantially shift the end product, given Republicans were going to have to negotiate with Democrats at some point anyway.
For McConnell, the ground shifted dramatically from a few months ago, when he said Republicans wanted to press “pause” on more stimulus. Congress had already passed nearly $3 trillion in relief, and Republicans hoped that the virus would start to fade in the summer and the economy would rebound, allowing either a narrowly crafted Republican bill or none at all.
But talk of “if” they needed another bill became “when” in recent weeks as virus cases, hospitalizations and deaths rocketed, particularly in red states in the South and West, including key presidential election battlegrounds Florida and Arizona. That’s caused a tentative economic recovery from the business shutdowns in March to stall.
The growing political peril for Republicans has been apparent for weeks. Trump’s approval in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls has dropped from 47% at the end of March to 42% as of Thursday.
Democrats lead Republicans by 9 percentage points on a generic ballot question in polls and Democratic challengers have been topping fundraising numbers for incumbent Republicans in key states. On Thursday, the non-partisan Cook Political Report for the first time this year said that Democrats are now favored to take back the Senate and warned of a potential “tsunami” against the GOP.
While McConnell said this week the economy needed another shot of “adrenaline” and backed a further round of direct payments to taxpayers, aid to schools and health care, his flock has been divided over everything from the details of an unemployment extension to the price tag.
‘Bernie Bros’?
Johnson said he simply doesn’t want to spend any more money and plans to oppose the bill he hasn’t seen. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas told CNN he’s a “hell no” on a $1 trillion package, while Rand Paul of Kentucky told another reporter that Republicans were acting like “Bernie Bros” behind closed doors as they discuss among themselves how many hundreds of billions to spend, a reference to ardent supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist.
Trump himself has made it harder to reach a deal.
He complicated the GOP talks for days by demanding a payroll tax cut that has few fans in Congress before dropping it. And the administration resisted Republican plans to step up testing and other health efforts. The president even reiterated at a press conference Thursday his plan to rebuild the FBI headquarters in downtown Washington — not exactly a pandemic priority.
Worries among Republicans that they would catch the blame for checks stopping for millions of workers across the country had them briefly discussing another temporary patch in the middle of the week before dropping the idea. Senators like Cruz and Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) of South Carolina warned against what they consider to be excessive aid, arguing they were hurting the economy by paying people an extra $600-a-week unemployment bonus.
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows outlined one possible fallback position to reporters Thursday, suggesting separately passing a supplemental unemployment insurance and aid for schools while negotiators continue to look for a bigger deal.
Democrats were largely on the outside looking in on the Republican scrum. Schumer declared Democrats united behind the $3.5 trillion plan passed by the House with far larger checks doing out to individuals and workers and aid to states than Republicans are willing to contemplate.
“Here we are, still waiting for the Republicans to put together a partisan bill that will never become law just so they can muster up the courage to negotiate,” Schumer said Thursday.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply lower Friday, despite positive data from the region, amid concerns that the U.S. economic recovery is stalling due to the coronavirus.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 2.2% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 2.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 1.8%. 
Economic data from Europe painted a healthy picture Friday, as U.K. retail sales rebounded in June, climbing 13.9% on the month, while PMI data from the region suggested the post-lockdown recovery has shifted up a gear.
However, this had little impact as investors are now questioning the strength of the economic recovery in the U.S., the world’s largest economy and main driver, after Thursday saw the first rise in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits since the last week in March. Worries were compounded as Senate Leader Mitch McConnell warned that Republicans won't be able to present their proposals for an extended package of stimulus measures until next week.
“This is especially worrying as negotiations on the extension of temporarily higher unemployment benefits seem unlikely to result in a breakthrough before the program expires at the end of July,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note.
Congress enters a summer recess in August, leaving the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and the Republican-controlled Senate little time to bridge their differences over how to proceed.
Meanwhile, COVID-19 continues to gnaw away at the U.S. economy, killing over 1,100 Americans on Wednesday and pushing the total U.S. case count above 4,000. Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) postponed the release of its new Mulan movie and the next movie off the Star Wars production line Thursday, amid concerns that cinemas will struggle to attract visitors for the foreseeable future. 
In corporate news,  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) stock dropped 3.6% after the world's second-biggest mobile operator said it would list its towers infrastructure business in Frankfurt next year.  Its fiscal first-quarter earnings were better than expected.
Additionally, Infineon (DE:IFXGn) and ASML Holding NV (AS:ASML) both fell nearly 5%, mirroring the underperformance by U.S. tech stocks on Thursday after Intel 's (NASDAQ:INTC)'s production warning prompted profit-taking.
Oil prices were lower Friday, although demand concerns stemming from rising coronavirus cases and a faltering economic recovery in the U.S., the biggest consumer of crude, has tempered the gains. In Norway, major Equinor posted a surprising profit for the three months through June.

The latest Purchasing Managers Index rose 57.6 from 51.7, beating economists forecast for a reading of 53.5. Demand also improved, led by domestic sales, with exports continuing to decline.
“The economy has entered its recovery phase following the Covid-19 lockdown,” said Eliot Kerr, an economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the report.
While the economy is improving, the labor market remains a key risk. The Markit report highlighted the unemployment threat, showing that private-sector firms cut jobs for a fifth straight month in July. As government support programs are scaled back, many companies may have to reduce costs to keep operating, which could mean more job losses down the line.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Casinos in the world's biggest gambling hub Macau are staring at heavy losses for the second quarter, with ""not much hope"" for a near-term recovery as a resurgence in coronavirus cases muddies the outlook for when China will reinstate travel visas.
Visitors from greater China make up for over 90% of Macau's tourists, but given travel has dried up amid the health crisis,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) warns casinos in the special administrative region could rack up losses of $1 billion over April to June.
The  Las Vegas Sands  (N:LVS) unit, Sands China (HK:1928), said it flipped into the red with a $549 million loss, setting the stage for a dire quarter for Macau casinos that have been operating with almost no income and no visitors since February.
Even after easing curbs for some travellers, Macau saw only 2,000 visitors per day in July, a tiny fraction of the 108,000 daily average in 2019, as the individual travel scheme through which visitors from the mainland gain entry remains suspended.
""Without the individual visitation scheme being resurrected, there's not much hope for the casinos to come back,"" said Rob Goldstein, president of Las Vegas Sands, which operates properties including the Venetian and Parisian in Macau.
Sands China's revenue was almost wiped out in the second quarter. Other operators, Melco Resorts (O:MLCO),  Wynn Macau  (HK:1128), Galaxy Entertainment (HK:0027),  MGM China  (HK:2282) and SJM Holdings (HK:0880), will report in the coming weeks. 
A Reuters calculation shows Macau casino operators came into 2020 with a cumulative cash position of just over $12 billion, providing a solid buffer to survive the coming months.
But anything longer could spell trouble as they continue to bleed millions of dollars in daily operating costs.
Macau has not had a new local coronavirus case for over 100 days, while Hong Kong and some parts of the mainland have seen a sharp spike in infections. Ferry services between Hong Kong and Macau remain halted, further hurting the casino business. 
'NOT GOING TO BE A GOOD YEAR'
Four casino operators have issued or said they plan to issue new debt, worth a total $4.2 billion, in the past two months, highlighting the challenges they face even as they cut costs and streamline operations. 
Operational expenses in the second quarter dipped 5% from the prior three months, noted Praveen Choudhary, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, Hong Kong. This could help the industry's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization break even in the third quarter, he added.
Macau's gambling industry is crucial for the Chinese-ruled territory where the sector employs about three quarters of its 600,000 population, either directly or indirectly.
The government has mandated casinos to safeguard employment for local staff, prompting operators to find ways other than job cuts to reduce costs such as offering staff unpaid leave.

""There is nothing else we can do at this point,"" a senior casino executive said. ""We thought it (restrictions) would be done by April, then May, then June, then July. Now this year we say is not going to be a good year,"" he added on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to media.

(Reuters) - Lawyers for Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies, have applied to a Canadian court seeking stays in the proceedings for her extradition to the United States, documents released on Thursday showed.
The applications are based in part on what Meng's lawyers allege was a destruction of the integrity of the judicial process by United States President Donald Trump and other senior members of the administration by their intention to use Meng ""as a bargaining chip in a trade dispute.""
Meng was arrested in December 2018 at the Vancouver International Airport on a warrant from the United States. 
She is accused by U.S. authorities of bank fraud for misleading HSBC about Huawei's relationship with a company operating in Iran, putting HSBC at risk of fines and penalties for breaking U.S. sanctions on Tehran.
Soon after Meng's arrest, Trump told Reuters: ""If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made - which is a very important thing - what's good for national security, I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary.""
The lawyers called Trump's comments ""offensive and ominous"" and ""made all the more intimidating due to his history of interference in other recent high-profile criminal prosecutions,"" citing Trump's commutation of the sentence of longtime friend and associate Roger Stone, among others.
Meng's lawyers alleged that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also politicized the extradition, by linking Meng's potential release to two Canadians - businessman Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat - who were detained in China just days after her arrest and who were recently charged with suspected espionage..
The White House, the State Department and Trudeau's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Meng's lawyers also allege that the United States misled Canada about the evidence in the case against her, by ""selectively summariz(ing) information ... and omit(ting) highly relevant information"" about the knowledge that Huawei shared with HSBC about its operations in Iran.
The omissions are ""far below the expected standard of diligence, candour and accuracy,"" the lawyers wrote.
Meng is the daughter of billionaire Ren Zhengfei, the founder of Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the company at the center of next generation 5G wireless technology and a long-running dispute with the Trump administration.
Meng is fighting extradition to the United States and has said she is innocent. She has been in house arrest in Vancouver since her detainment.
The extradition hearings are scheduled to wrap up in late April 2021, although both sides will be able to appeal the final decision.

In May a judge in British Columbia's Supreme Court ruled that the standard of double criminality had been met, meaning that the Canadian attorney general's case to extradite her cleared the first hurdle.

SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Australians' deepening raid on their pension funds is driving a surge in debt repayments, which analysts say makes for a double-whammy on the domestic stock market and its dominant big banks as the country sinks into its first recession in a generation.
The rush to withdraw retirement savings, under an emergency scheme to provide financial relief from the coronavirus crisis, is already running much harder than government estimates.
This has weighed on equities, especially shares of widely-held banks which  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) found lag the broader market by 9%, as funds sell assets to pay customers.
A simultaneous jump in debt repayment has analysts worried the money is mostly headed for creditors, without reaching the real economy, and that the repayments dent the loan books of the country's largest lenders when they need it least.
""People are using the proceeds from early withdrawals to pay back debt, and debt is money,"" said Credit Suisse's Australian strategist Damien Boey.
""So debt repayment is destroying money supply at the margin, while the government and (central bank) are trying to create it...all of this looks bad for the banks, already dealing with high unemployment ... and weakness in the housing market.""
In the three months since authorities allowed access to pension accounts, some 2.8 million applications have been made to withdraw A$25.3 billion ($18.1 billion) in savings.
A second lockdown in Melbourne, where COVID-19 cases are rising, will likely accelerate withdrawals. The scheme, initially expected to run until September, has nearly reached the original A$27 billion drawdown estimate and was extended on Thursday.
Sydney journalist Sebastian van der Zwan, a New Zealander, turned to his superannuation early after finding himself unable to access welfare payments available only to citizens.
""I was stood down without pay indefinitely and my landlord refused to give me rental relief,"" he told Reuters. ""I had no idea where I was going to get money from to pay rent or feed myself.""
(GRAPHIC: Australian banks drag stocks behind global benchmark - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgpdnknbpo/Pasted%20image%201595486002575.png)
DOESN'T GET EASIER
At the same time as money has begun to flow, personal debts dipped. Central bank payments data showed a record 7% or A$1.9 billion drop in interest attracting credit card balances in May.
The value of mortgage refinancing also hit the highest on record that month, while total credit fell for the first time in a year.
To be sure, such repayments likely head off some defaults, and not all the money is going into debt relief. Total withdrawals so far are less than 1% of Australia's A$3 trillion pension pool.
In a country where four banks comprise a fifth of the benchmark equities index (AXJO) and they run the biggest mortgage books in the world, relative to other income streams, their fate rests very much with retail customers.
""It's a good thing if people are paying their debts - but it's a bad thing in that it does mean your loan book starts to shrink,"" said Omkar Joshi, portfolio manager at Opal Capital Management in Sydney, who is steering clear of the big banks.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian investigators who brought criminal cartel charges against  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) ""pre-populated"" a witness statement with incriminating claims before interviewing the person who ultimately signed off on them, a court heard on Friday.
Investigators wrote a statement which appeared to show a rival banker's concern about ""inappropriate"" co-ordination between the companies while they were working on a stock issue, then interviewed the witness and the passages re-appeared the witness's final signed statement, the court heard.
The disclosure shows another strand of the defence against Australia's biggest white collar criminal lawsuit: lawyers for the investment banks have been trying to show investigators departed from due process to build a case against them.
The banks and their former staffers are charged with colluding during a A$2.5 billion ($1.8 billion) 2015 stock issue to withhold unsold shares and keep the stock from falling. Their client, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ), is also defending the case.
The matter is being closely watched by financial market participants around the world because it could influence how capital raisings are conducted.
Leah Won, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's general manager of financial services competition, was asked about a draft witness statement the regulator wrote for an employee of JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), which also worked on the share issue but cooperated with prosecutors for immunity.
""You hadn't spoken to (JPMorgan's then head of equities Mark) Leung at the time?"" ANZ's lawyer, Simon Buchen, asked Won.
""No, I don't think that we had,"" Won replied.
""Before you had spoken to Mr Leung, you or one of your investigators was pre-populating the statement with his concerns,"" Buchen said. ""It's a fundamental aspect of a criminal investigation that an investigator has to have an open mind, correct?""
""Yes,"" Won said.
All pre-written parts of Leung's statement ""assist the prosecution in one way or another"", said Buchen. ""Can you accept that?""
""I think that's probably right,"" Won replied.
""That doesn't evidence an open state of mind (about) what he was thinking at the time, does it?""
""These were propositions ... that were put to him. I'm not sure that is inconsistent with an open state of mind.""
JPMorgan and the ACCC have declined to comment outside the court proceedings.

The hearing continues.

Investing.com – Asian stocks continued a downward trend on Friday, with concerns over the U.S. economic recovery from the virus growing as initial jobless claims data released on Thursday showed its first uptick since March.
A total of 1.416 million Americans filed for unemployment claims over the last week, higher than analyst forecasts for 1.3 million claims, as well as the previous week’s 1.307 million claims.

(Reuters) - Shares of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc fell nearly 10% after it lost a bid to invalidate a U.S. patent owned by Arbutus Biopharma (NASDAQ:ABUS) that poses a potential obstacle to Moderna's efforts to develop next-generation vaccines, including a coronavirus vaccine.
An administrative court run by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office rejected arguments by Moderna that an Arbutus patent known as the '069 patent should be revoked because it described obvious concepts.
The '069 patent relates to lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology that allows the human body to make its own therapeutic proteins.
LNP technology is crucial to Moderna's vaccine development efforts, and the patent ruling could increase pressure on the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based firm to pay for a license to Arbutus' patent portfolio, said Zachary Silbersher, a patent lawyer in New York not involved the case.
Silbersher said it was unclear if vaccines being developed by Moderna, including its coronavirus vaccine, infringe the '069 patent and related ones owned by Arbutus. But Moderna's effort to invalidate the patent suggests the company sees it as a potential obstacle, he said.
""At the end of the day, Arbutus might be able to claim a royalty in the [coronavirus] vaccine,"" Silbersher said.
The ruling was a ""disappointing turn"" for Moderna but is not likely to have any immediate financial impact on the company, analysts at SVB Leerink said in a note.
Moderna can still appeal the patent office ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. That court, however, often upholds the patent office's determinations.
Moderna has received funding from the U.S. government to develop a coronavirus vaccine. 
Arbutus shares more than doubled after the patent board posted its opinion on its electronic docket, to $6.20 on Nasdaq. Moderna shares lost 9.5% to end at $75.33, also on Nasdaq.

Moderna did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

976,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 07:00PM ET</span>",Chevron Is Installing Solar Panels — To Produce Oil More Cheaply,"(Bloomberg) -- In California’s sun-drenched Kern Valley,  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) has found a way to use one of the state’s clean-energy programs to cut the cost of pumping oil, to the chagrin of some environmentalists.
Since April, solar panels have been powering oil pumps at Chevron’s Lost Hills 7,981 barrel-a-day oil field, according to the company. The 29-megawatt site, owned by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Renewable Power Llc.-controlled Solar Star Lost Hills Llc., is designed to provide the field with 80% of its electricity, equal to taking more than 4,000 cars off the road. In exchange, Chevron will earn so-called low-carbon fuel standard credits worth about $4 million a year at current prices.
“Electricity is one of Lost Hills field’s largest operating expenses, so having solar will be an important factor to help keep those costs down and maintain the planned oil field life,” Veronica Flores-Paniagua, a Chevron spokeswoman, said in an email.
Renewable energy costs have fallen “substantially” over time, making its application to oil fields more economic, Telisa Toliver, Chevron Pipeline & Power’s general manager for renewable power, said in an interview. “We see this business model for us as something we hope to replicate,” she said.
The Lost Hills project, Chevron’s largest solar-powered oil field, marks an unusual twist in the fate of the state’s decade-old Low Carbon Fuel Standard Program. The carbon-trading plan, designed to cut emissions 20% by 2030, has mostly been used to supplant gasoline and diesel with ethanol and biodiesel in vehicles. But it’s starting to benefit local oil companies as well, a development that environmentalists say may subvert the program’s intent of ushering in more renewable fuels.
“Instead of putting solar panels alongside oil rigs, we should be putting solar panels next to more solar panels,” Brian Nowicki, California Climate Policy Director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said by email. “That’s how we start truly transitioning to cleaner energy.”
For more than a decade, California has struggled to reconcile a leadership role in the fight against climate change with the reality of being among the biggest oil-producing states in the U.S. Fossil fuels still dominate California’s energy mix, with most of the oil that’s used imported in tankers from as far away as Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
The Chevron project is one of three oil-field solar projects approved for LCFS credits by the California Air Resources Board since early June. The companies, including Grade Water and Power LLC., E&B Natural Resources Management Corp. and Rotterdam Ventures Inc., are benefiting from a provision that was added to the program in its early years allowing oil drillers to qualify for credits through so-called “innovative crude oil production methods” such as solar or carbon-capture-and-storage.
Before June, just two other projects -- by Seneca Resources Co. and Holmes Western Oil Corp. -- were approved for LCFS credits since 2016, both involving the use of solar power at oil fields.

977,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 06:55PM ET</span>","Intel chip delay forces shift to using more outside factories, shares drop","By Stephen Nellis and Munsif Vengattil
(Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) said on Thursday its new 7-nanometer chip technology was six months behind schedule and it would consider farming out more work to outside semiconductor foundries, eroding a founding principle that manufacturing is key to its success.
Intel shares fell 9%.
The setbacks will have little effect in the next few quarters, but will cause a years-long domino effect, delaying chips meant to counter the rise of rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc (O:AMD) and  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) until late 2021 or even 2023.
Intel's 7nm delays extend the lead in the smaller, faster chip technology held by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TW:2330), which is now expected to remain at least one generation of technology ahead for years to come. They will likely benefit rivals AMD and Nvidia, which outsource their manufacturing to TSMC.
""We're going to be pretty pragmatic about if and when we should be making stuff inside or making outside, and making sure that we have optionality to build internally, mix and match inside and outside, or go outside in its entirety if we need to,"" Chief Executive Bob Swan said on a call with investors.
Shares of AMD rose 6%.
Intel is the top supplier for processors for PCs and data centers, but Nvidia and TSMC are challenging the logic of Intel's business model as a both a designer and manufacturer of its own chips.
Swan told investors that Intel's ""Ponte Vecchio,"" a data center graphics chip meant to compete with Nvidia, will not be released until late 2021 or early 2022 and could use outside chip factories. He said Intel's first 7nm chip, meant for personal computers, will not arrive until late 2022 or early 2023. Its first 7nm data center processor will not ship until the first half of 2023.
In recent years, Intel has relied on booming growth in data centers that power cloud computing as PC sales declined, though both segments have expanded as the pandemic forced increased technology spending to facilitate working from home.
The company estimated third-quarter revenue of about $18.2 billion on adjusted earnings of $1.10 per share, compared with analysts' average forecast of $17.9 billion and $1.14 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
It updated its full-year 2020 revenue guidance to $75 billion versus analysts' consensus estimate of $73.86 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
For the second quarter ended in June, Intel said overall revenue and adjusted profits were $19.73 billion and $1.23 per share, compared with analysts' estimates of $18.55 billion and $1.11 per share, according to Refinitiv. 
Revenue for its data center segment was $7.1 billion compared to estimates of $6.61 billion, according to data from FactSet. Sales for PC chips were $9.5 billion, compared to analyst estimates of $9.10 billion, according to FactSet data.
Nvidia, which designs but does not make its own chips, earlier this month overtook Intel as the most valuable U.S. chip supplier, thanks to strong sales to data centers using Nvidia chips for artificial intelligence work.
In the PC market, longtime Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices (O:AMD) this week announced new PC chips that analysts expect to be powered by TSMC's manufacturing processes. Last month, Apple Inc (O:AAPL) said it would end its reliance on Intel chips for Mac computers after nearly 15 years. Apple uses chip technology from SoftBank Group Corp-owed (T:9984) Arm Ltd. 

""The delay of its 7nm roadmap timing will create even more headwinds for Intel as its risk increased probability of further share loss to AMD and to other architecture like Arm in both its client and data center markets in the next two to three years,"" said Kinngai Chan, an analyst at Summit Insights Group.

The White House has also informed several lawmakers about a presidential signing event Friday
The slate of policies will also include a plan for Americans to buy lower-cost prescription medication imported from Canada. Canadian drug importation and the international pricing index have both been on the White House agenda for over a year. The index will match Medicare payments for drugs administered in a doctor’s office more closely with the lower prices other countries pay.
The order is also expected to include a policy to reduce the cost of insulin and Epi-Pens at hospitals through an existing drug discount program, the sources said. That 340B program is funded in part by drugmakers.
“With his strong record of wins to reduce the high cost of prescription drugs, including record generic approvals, lower cost insulin in Medicare, passage of the CREATES Act, and an end to pharmacy gag clauses, President Trump is determined to do even more. The President continues to explore any and all options that will deliver lower cost drugs, while ensuring we have access to the most innovative vaccines and therapeutics in the world,” White House spokesman Judd Deere (NYSE:DE) said in a statement.
The administration plans to officially publish the international pricing index proposed rule, which has been under review at the Office of Management and Budget since June 2019. The White House and the Department of Health and Human Services have toyed with releasing that rule with several times over the last year but then put it on hold.
The administration was considering reviving a rule that would have ended the rebates that drug manufacturers pay to pharmacy liaisons, but Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma pointed out that the rule could raise premiums, according to one of the sources.

Data released Thursday by the Fed showed the loan balance under its Main Street Lending Program rose to $14 million on Wednesday from $12 million a week before, when the central bank acquired the first loan originated under a facility that has taken months to roll out.
The program, designed to assist small and medium-sized companies hurt by the coronavirus crisis, has had a sluggish start, and the Fed has faced criticism from U.S. lawmakers for the weak uptake so far. The Fed recently adjusted the terms to allow nonprofit organizations to qualify.
The Fed's total balance sheet size rose by $6.1 billion to just over $7.01 trillion as of July 22. 
It was largely due to continued purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities aimed at keeping financial market conditions easy. These were nearly offset by a drop in foreign currency swaps with other central banks, which fell to their lowest since mid-March at just under $122 billion.
Meanwhile, other facilities aimed at steadying credit and other financial markets continued their recent pattern of limited demand following an initial explosion in their use in March when the Fed cut interest rates to effectively zero and launched a range of emergency credit programs. That powered a $3 trillion increase in the Fed's total balance sheet between the beginning of March and early June.

Despite the recent lull, analysts at TD Securities said in a note they still expect the total balance sheet to hit $9.4 trillion by year end and $11 trillion by the end of next year.

The toymaker said it was expecting its sales to improve in the coming months, compared with the first half of the year, as concerns grow that schools in many parts of the United States would remain shut, with new virus cases spiking across the country.
Mattel's shares rose about 4% in extended trading. 
The reopening of toy stores is also helping sales, with Chief Executive Officer Ynon Kreiz telling Reuters that only 4% of retail outlets, which normally account for about 8% of the company's sales, were closed at the end of June. About 30% of Mattel's retail stores were shut at the end of March.
Mattel's gross sales in North America rose 3% in the second quarter, mainly driven by an increase in demand for the various avatars of the company's iconic Barbie dolls and playsets, Uno playing cards, as well as ""Baby Yoda"" plush toys.
Overall gross Barbie sales increased 7% to $199.3 million in the second quarter.
However, Mattel's net sales fell nearly 15% to $732.1 million, as the economic fallout of the health crisis hammered demand in overseas markets.

Investing.com -- The real world appears to have caught up with the market as stocks tumbled.
The U.S. Labor Department reported that 1.4 million people filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended July 18, up 109,000 from the prior week and above economists' estimates of 1.3 million. Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) blamed coronavirus surges in the Sun Belt.
The number of confirmed U.S. coronavirus cases neared 4 million, according to Johns Hopkins data, leading the world.
Investors were also disappointed as Republicans confirmed the payroll tax cut would not form part of the coronavirus fiscal package.
The weakness in the broader market was led by tech as some on Wall Street expressed concerns whether the rally in the sector has been too much, too fast. The surprising exception to that was  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), where worse-than-expected results were overshadowed by a 34% jump in daily active users.
And if you’re thinking of betting on Vegas, think again.  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) CEO Rob Goldstein said it looks gloomy, and no one knows when the sun will shine again upon that city in the desert.
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1. New home sales
New home sales are expected to come in at 640,000, compared to 676,000 in May, and 580,000 in May. Home builders have been reporting strong results for the month, with PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) among the latest to report earnings that beat forecasts.
The U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) also publishes tomorrow, estimated at 49.6 versus the previous 49.8. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector; below 50 indicates contraction.
2. Show me the money
Verizon (NYSE:VZ) reports earnings on Friday. The telco is expected to report earnings per share of $1.12 on $29.8 billion in revenue, analysts tracked by Investing.com say. Shares of Verizon are little changed.
Honeywell (NYSE:HON) also publishes results, and earnings per share of $1.21 are expected on an estimated $7.29 billion of revenue, according to analysts surveyed by Investing.com. The company has 10 buy ratings, 4 holds and no sells.
Finally,  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) will let us know how people have been spending in quarantine (we would think a significant amount, but analysts tend to disagree). Analysts tracked by Investing.com see a loss per share of 5 cents on $8.24 billion in revenue. That compares to earnings per share of $2.07 on $10.8 billion in revenue for the same period a year earlier.
3. Because Covid-19 isn’t enough
Watch for tropical storms and hurricanes to hit the U.S. over the weekend, especially Texas and Hawaii. Some offshore oil and natural gas platforms of Port O’Connor, Texas, have been evacuated already, Bloomberg reported. Hurricane Douglas has its eye on Hawaii, though most storms tend to peter out before hitting land there, CNN said."

In a letter to Attorney General William Barr, the seven Democratic senators expressed skepticism that the purchase was solely a bid to enter the wearables market since Google's revenues are largely based on advertising driven by consumer data. 
""Adding Fitbit's consumer data to Google's could further diminish the ability of companies to compete with Google in ... ad technology markets and could raise barriers for potential competitors to enter these markets,"" the lawmakers wrote.
Warren and Klobuchar, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, have both been outspoken on antitrust issues. They were joined on the letter by Senators Richard Blumenthal, Cory Booker, Mazie Hirono, Sherrod Brown and Mark Warner.
The lawmakers also noted that Google had formally told European antitrust enforcers that it would not use Fitbit's health data to help it target ads. The senators called the offer ""modest, short-term concessions.""
Fitbit's fitness trackers and other devices monitor users' daily steps, calories burned and distance traveled. They also measure floors climbed, sleep duration and quality, and heart rate.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc-owned Google said in November that it would buy  Fitbit Inc  for $2.1 billion to compete in the crowded market for fitness trackers and smart watches.
The senators also noted that Fitbit had a reputation for safeguarding user privacy while Google was known for its ability to monetize consumer data.

Google along with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) face a slew of antitrust probes. Its chief executive, Sundar Pichai, will appear along with the CEOs of the other tech giants on Monday on Capitol Hill before the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel.

Investing.com – The Nasdaq suffered its worst day in nearly one month on Thursday as a sea of red swept through mega-cap tech stocks and a jump in jobless claims renewed concerns about the pace of the recovery as the relentless spread of the virus continues.
The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.29% and S&P 500 lost 1.23%, while the the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.31%.
Mega-cap tech, which has done most of heavy-lifting to support the broader market rally since March, came under pressure as concerns about frothy valuations resurfaced.   
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL),  Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the so-called Fab 5, making up about 40% of the Nasdaq, fell more than 3%. 
Apple led the sell off after Goldman urged investors to avoid the stock, citing expectations for slowing growth in 2021.  ""We continue to forecast calendar 2021 earnings per share for Apple that is 16% below consensus as product unit sales and average selling prices falter and services growth slows,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said.
Microsoft ended 4% after its guidance fell short of consensus estimates and overshadowed better-than-expected quarterly results.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, reversed gains to end lower despite rolling blowout earnings for the second-quarter and retaining initial guidance to deliver over 500,000 vehicles for the year.
Twitter sidestepped the selloff to end up 4% as the social media company reported a 34% jump in daily active users. Its shares closed 4% higher.
Investor sentiment was further soured by signs of cracks in the labor market.  
The U.S. Labor Department reported that 1.4 million people filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended July 18, up 109,000 from the prior week and above economists' estimates of 1.3 million.
'The surge of Covid cases in the Sun Belt and the stalling out of reopening activities in other states has seemingly caused another round of layoffs that has stymied the nascent labor market recovery,' Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
The number of confirmed U.S. coronavirus cases neared 4 million, according to Johns Hopkins data, the most in the world.
Despite growing doubt over the prospect of a robust recovery, stocks tied to the performance proved more somewhat resilient. Financials, energy, and industrials ended the day with losses of less than 1%.      "

Investing.com - Las Vegas is a losing bet.
“In all the years I've been here in Las Vegas, I've never felt more gloomy, I do say, about what's happening in Las Vegas short term,” said  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) Chief Executive Officer Rob Goldstein in a call Wednesday with analysts. “I hope long term, we can see a better day.”
Goldstein has been with Las Vegas Sands since 1995.
Shares are down 4.4% after the casino company reported a loss per share of $1.02 on $98 million in revenue, compared to the estimated loss per share of 73 cents and sales of $586 million, analysts surveyed by Investing.com said.
“We're still strong believers that our business will come back quite well. The problem is I can't nor can anyone else give you a date certain,” said Goldstein. The biggest concern in Vegas is that the city is dependent upon groups, conventions and banquets, and there is no sign of a return in 2020.
Shares of rivals Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) and MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) dropped 1% and 2%, respectively.
“It cannot make money with limited hotel occupancy -- or a negligible occupancy midweek, maybe a 50% capacity weekend,” Goldstein said. “So we're in a world of hurt here in terms of Las Vegas.”
Macao is the city that has the best potential for the company to recover quickly, in part thanks to the fact that it’s not dependent on airplanes to deliver customers, Goldstein said."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Two of  Boeing Co 's (N:BA) biggest commercial airline customers said on Thursday they are still committed to the 737 MAX despite delays in its return to flight and the coronavirus pandemic, though the head of Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) said contracts need to be ""completely reset.""
Boeing is behind on hundreds of 737 MAX deliveries since regulators grounded the jet worldwide last year in the aftermath of two crashes that together killed 346 people.
Since then, airlines' financing on jet orders has expired, forcing a scramble by Boeing to arrange new financing as it awaits regulatory approval for design changes.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Chief Financial Officer Derek Kerr said the carrier is in ""good discussions"" with Boeing to finalize financing terms on 17 737 MAX jets that were to be delivered this year, adding that the airline still wants its full order for 100 MAX planes, over time.
""We totally plan on taking those aircraft,"" Kerr said on a quarterly conference call. ""Just when we take them is the discussion that we're having.""
When the MAX was grounded in March 2019, U.S. airlines were growing their networks and eager to add the fuel-efficient MAX jets to their fleets. But they have been parking planes as the pandemic has sapped demand.
American and Southwest each posted a quarterly loss on Thursday and American has said it will not take delivery of any aircraft that are not financed. 
Southwest said it had agreed with Boeing to take no more than 48 aircraft through the end of 2021, although Boeing had projected the plane to return to service sooner.
Southwest executives said they probably need fewer than those 48, and had not finalized any specifics with Boeing, giving them flexibility to continue monitoring demand for the next 18 months.
CEO Gary Kelly added: ""I think the way to visualize the situation with Boeing is that basically, where we go from here needs to be negotiated, period.""
The Federal Aviation Administration is unlikely to certify the 737 MAX for flight before October, an official briefed on the matter told Reuters, and Southwest said on Thursday it will take at least a couple of months after approval before it flies the jets with passengers.
A mid-December return to its schedule is a ""best-case scenario,"" Southwest CFO Tammy Romo said.
American was the launch customer of the MAX and Southwest was the world's largest operator of the aircraft before its grounding.

Separately,  Spirit Airlines  (N:SAVE) said it has reached an agreement with Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) to defer aircraft deliveries during 2020 and 2021.

(Reuters) - Multiple U.S. states are investigating Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) for potentially deceiving consumers, according to a March document obtained by a tech watchdog group.
The Texas attorney general may sue Apple for violating the state's deceptive trade practices law in connection with the multi-state investigation, according to the document, which was obtained by the Tech Transparency Project.
The document did not provide additional details. 

The office of the Texas attorney general declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
Apple has faced class-action lawsuits from consumers alleging that it deceived them about slowing the performance of iPhones with aging batteries. The company agreed to pay up to $500 million to settle one such lawsuit earlier this year.
Apple is also facing lawsuits alleging that it knew and concealed how the “butterfly” keyboards on its MacBook laptops were prone to failure.

Citrix said that customers are focusing on immediate business critical needs rather than prioritizing larger, broader, longer-term digital transformation projects. “As a result, the uptake of transitioning and trading customers up to our cloud offering is not progressing at the rate we had anticipated coming into the year,” the company said.  “This lag in the transition and trade-up motion will have an impact on revenue in the medium term.”
Earnings per share for the second quarter beat the estimate, coming in at $1.53 versus $1.23. Revenue came in at $799 million compared to the $769 million estimated by analysts surveyed by Investing.com.

994,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 02:09PM ET</span>",SPACs Show Signs of Froth as Demand For Good-Story Stocks Grows,"(Bloomberg) -- Even in this market, where speculative zeal has never been in short supply, the blind faith being bestowed on companies that go public by merging with blank-check companies stands out.
It started with big rallies in companies like Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc., and DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) Inc., which listed on exchanges not via initial public offerings but through mergers with special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. They promptly doubled, paving the way for gains in lesser-known firms like Hall of Fame Resort & Entertainment Co., BurgerFi International, Tattooed Chef and UCommune. They are, respectively, an owner of a resort in development near the Pro Football Hall of Fame, a fast-casual burger chain, a plant-based food upstart and the We Co. of China.
This year, more than 45 SPACs have gone public in the U.S. and more are on the way. The debuts have raised more than $13.5 billion, topping last year’s haul and marking an all-time high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. As others come, attracting retail investors with their growth potential, market observers wonder if the enthusiasm will end in tears.
“If SPACs are the new IPOs and direct-listings, eventually the market and the people behind them will put out enough supply to swamp demand -- seems a bit frothy,” says StockTwits co-founder Howard Lindzon, who briefly tweeted under the moniker “Frothy” and “SPAC SPAC SPAC.”
Unfamiliar names, including a SPAC with the ticker SPAQ, started popping onto Lindzon’s radar over the last few weeks as they surfaced on Reddit, Stocktwits and Robinhood Financial. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. were the more typical fodder on those platforms, according to Lindzon, but along came DraftKings, Nikola Corp. and Spartan Energy Acquisition Corp. -- the company behind the SPAQ ticker. There was “massive speculation” in terms of sentiment, he said.
After Virgin Galactic gained as much as 255%, and DraftKings added 149%, more SPACs, companies and investors wanted in. Deals on the horizon have pushed shares of SPACs higher, with Graf Industrial Corp. gaining 85% and Spartan Energy adding 45% before reaching peaks, as respective deals with Ford Motor-backed Velodyne Lidar Inc. and Fisker Inc. came to light. In the past week, Fortress Value Acquisition Corp. rose 35% on its intent to merge with rare-metals miner MP Materials, which touted its adjacency to electric vehicle production. In the health-care space, Immunovant (NASDAQ:IMVT) Inc. jumped 105% and AdaptHealth (NASDAQ:AHCO) Corp. surged 126% following deals last year before hitting their peaks in June.
Since the SPAC model embraces big and small businesses in disparate industries, it’s tough to generalize about them, and each should be judged individually, industry professionals say. “We are seeing SPAC deals of all sizes and shapes being announced and discussed. These range from earlier stage high-growth concept stocks to very large and mature companies with market values in excess of $10 billion,”  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) SPAC expert Niron Stabinsky said.
Meanwhile, the number of SPAC shells looking for an existing company to merge with keeps growing. They are sponsored by a who’s who of investment industry names, including Chamath Palihapitiya, Bill Foley, Barry Sternlicht, Bill Ackman, and most recently, Ron Burkle. Some speculative bidding tends to show up in SPACs even before they pick a target. Ackman’s Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd. is the latest example, rising nearly 9% as shares started trading Wednesday, presumably on the hopes it will find something big to buy -- a mature unicorn, in Ackman’s parlance. As of now, no such deal has been detailed.
Behavioral Shift
The penchant for electric- and autonomous-vehicle companies has become a microcosm of the larger trend: Risk capital rushing to meet the demand of new investors who have left a mark on thinly traded small-company shares.
Investors are rewarding flexibility and bypassing what they perceive as the establishment, New York University Stern School of Business professor Aswath Damodaran said of the “delirium” in EV valuations amid a hunt for the next Tesla. The idea that upstarts will overtake more mature businesses is a persuasive one with today’s retail investor, many of whom believe the Covid-19 pandemic will accelerate the decline of old-line companies, he said.
Lindzon describes a similar behavioral shift: “Kids don’t give a rat’s ass about the S&P, they want to know what’s in the bag. They don’t want hospitality-, or land-based. They want the cloud. They don’t want conglomerates, they want simple businesses they can understand.”
SPAC-Rich
For companies seeking a public debut, SPACs present a less costly, less scrutinized and speedier path to public markets than IPOs. As venture-capitalist Bill Gurley tweeted earlier this month, the rise of the SPAC has much to do with the relative cost of capital.
A SPAC is essentially a shell company that raises money on public exchanges on the promise it can locate an attractive private company and merge with it. It often takes as long as two years to pull off -- to find, evaluate, negotiate and consummate a merger -- although at least one inked a deal just months after going public. The set-up also offers a fixed price for entry to the public market, a compelling alternative to the IPO process that could result in a range of outcomes, including being underpriced.
A company can also tell a story about its future after a deal is announced, forecasting growth one to four years out. And the big brand names often involved in SPAC mergers are catching attention from the retail set, which thanks to platforms like Robinhood, includes novice, often young, investors.
“I’m super bullish on kids learning, but there are hard lessons to be learned ahead,” Lindzon said.

The proposals, contained in a draft seen by the newspaper on Thursday, involve a relaxation of rules preventing the body that regulates auditors from informing the Finance Ministry if they find any irregularities.
Wirecard (DE:WDIG) collapsed in June after EY, its auditor for more than a decade, refused to sign off on its 2019 accounts. Three former top executives at the payments company were arrested on Wednesday. Prosecutors suspect them of faking the company's accounts.
In future, under the proposals, companies will be obliged to change their auditor every 10 years and stricter divisions will be imposed between auditors' consulting and auditing businesses.
The proposals also envisage new powers for financial regulator Bafin to intervene when it suspects irregularities at banks, insurers or payment services companies.
The proposals are a reaction to suggestions that regulators were slow to act despite having received reports from whistleblowers as long ago as 2015 about irregularities at Wirecard.
Scholz, who is the leading candidate to lead his Social Democrat Party (SPD) into next year's national election, is facing criticism from other parties after it emerged that he had been told of irregularities at the company 18 months ago.
The minister plans to review the matter of auditors' civil liability for their failings and is also considering potential changes to criminal law, the newspaper said.
""I want to strengthen the rules so cases like this can never happen again,"" he was quoted as saying.

(Reuters) - American Airlines (O:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) are rethinking the number of flights they had planned to add to their schedules for August and September as COVID-19 cases accelerated in the United States, passing 4 million on Thursday.
Both airlines had added capacity more aggressively than competitors Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) when demand started to pick up in May and June, but now optimism has waned as some states scale back reopening plans and expand quarantines. Demand is not forecast to fully recover before a vaccine.
American, the world's largest carrier, expects third-quarter capacity to be down about 60% from a year ago, lower than previously forecast, and is reviewing plans for the fourth quarter.
""We'll add back only what makes sense,"" American Chief Executive said on an investor call. 
Shares in American rose 3% while Southwest stock was flat.
Southwest, which analysts have forecast to weather the coronavirus pandemic better than larger U.S. carriers thanks to its domestic focus and lower-cost structure, said weakening revenues was increasing its daily cash burn rate to $18 million in July from $16 million in June. 
Its average daily cash burn is seen stalling at $23 million per day over the third quarter. 
American, Delta and United each expect an improvement in their burn rates over the rest of the year, but say halting the cash bleed entirely will depend on demand.
American burned about $55 million a day in the second quarter, which it ended with $10.2 billion in liquidity.
Southwest had $15.5 billion liquidity at the end of June.
Both airlines had warned of job reductions in the fall, though Southwest said it does not plan to pursue furloughs or layoffs this year thanks to strong employee take-up for extended leaves or early retirements that will generate $400 million in cost savings in the fourth quarter.
U.S. airlines received a $25 billion government bailout to cover payroll through September, and unions are lobbying for a second package to help keep workers employed through March.
To reassure passengers on the safety of air travel during the pandemic, large U.S. airlines have recently toughened their policies on face masks, with Southwest telling customers on Wednesday that if they can't wear a mask for any reason, they should not fly. Only children under the age of two are exempt.
Southwest swung to a $1.5 billion net loss, or $2.67 per share, in the second quarter, as total operating revenue fell 82.9% to $1.01 billion.
At American, the net loss excluding items was $3.4 billion, or $7.82 per share, while operating revenue plunged 86.4% to $1.62 billion.
 Alaska Air  Group (N:ALK), which reported a second-quarter net loss of $214 million on Thursday, said it expected its capacity to be down about 35% in the fourth quarter, forcing it to cut about 7,000 of its 23,000 employees.

Meanwhile, budget carrier  Spirit Airlines  (N:SAVE) is scheduling big capacity adds in August and September, stoking analyst concerns of a price war given weakening demand and bookings.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The son of former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co chairman Carlos Ghosn made about $500,000 in cryptocurrency payments to one of the two Massachusetts men who helped him escape from Japan, U.S. prosecutors said in a court filing.
Federal prosecutors in filing late on Wednesday said the payments went to Peter Taylor after he and his father, U.S. Army Special Forces veteran Michael Taylor, helped Ghosn flee in a box and private jet to avoid facing financial charges.
The cryptocurrency, or digital currency, payments from Ghosn's son, Anthony Ghosn, were on top of $862,500 Ghosn himself had wired to a company Peter Taylor managed in October, two months before his Dec. 29, 2019 escape, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors detailed the payments in a filing arguing against the Taylors' latest bid to be released on bail. They have been in jail since their arrests in May at the request of Japan, which is seeking their extradition.
U.S. prosecutors cited the money in arguing that both the elder Taylor, a private security specialist, and his son pose a severe flight risk, saying they ""now have access to Ghosn's vast resources with which to flee.""
Prosecutors cited a recent TV interview Ghosn gave in which he said he was helping everyone who stood with him.
The Taylors' lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Ghosn declined to comment.
Ghosn fled to Lebanon, his childhood home, after being charged with engaging in financial wrongdoing, including by understating his compensation in Nissan's financial statements. He denies wrongdoing.
The Taylors argue the charges against them are fatally flawed as the Japanese penal code does not make it a criminal offense to help someone ""bail jump"" unless that person is in custody.

A federal judge will hear arguments on their latest bid for bail on Tuesday.

(Reuters) - Consumers sticking close to home as COVID-19 cases spike around the world are reaching for more pantry staples like mayonnaise and peanut butter and are buying Roomba robot vacuum cleaners and computers.
As companies report quarterly earnings and look to the second half of the year, pandemic winners and losers are becoming more apparent. Companies that sell electronics, comfort food and other products for the home continue to benefit from quarantines and lockdowns. 
""Being at home – or at least out of their normal routines – the majority of the day, consumers are embracing technologies that enhance their at-home lifestyle, whether through entertainment, or assistance with chores around the house,"" said Daniel Binder, partner at Columbus Consulting, a firm that advises on the retail sector.
This week, electronics retailer  Best Buy  Co Inc (N:BBY) said its online sales jumped more than three-fold in the current quarter through July 18, while overall sales rose about 15%. And Roomba maker  iRobot Corp  (O:IRBT) flagged meaningful growth in demand for its robotic vacuums that can cost $800.
Roombas, which can speak more than a dozen languages including Chinese, automatically zip around carpets and floors sucking up crumbs, dirt and pet hair. Keeping a clean home has taken on greater prominence in the pandemic, Colin Angle, chief executive of iRobot, said in the company's earnings release on Tuesday. 
Shares of Best Buy, the Minneapolis-based retailer, rose to a record high of $99.42 on Wednesday, after the company reported robust sales of computers, tablets and appliances to homebound consumers and students. Almost all its stores had reopened to shoppers as of Wednesday.
""People see getting a Roomba to get their houses cleaner or upgrading to the latest iPhone as a means of getting back some sense of control in their lives,"" said Dave Marcotte, senior vice president, Insights, at retail consulting and analytics company, Kantar.
UK-based home improvement retailer  Kingfisher  Plc (L:KGF) on Wednesday reported exceptionally strong demand for DIY and gardening products. Lockdowns drove a 21.6% jump in second-quarter same-store sales.
FEEL-GOOD FOODS
JM Smucker Co (N:SJM), which makes Smucker's jams, Jif peanut butter and pet food, raised its dividend in a time when many companies are slashing payouts to conserve cash. In June, Smucker said it continued to expect shoppers to eat more meals at home.
Global consumer products company  Unilever  Plc (L:ULVR) on Thursday noted strong sales of Breyers, Magnum and Klondike ice-cream, along with Hellmann's mayonnaise and Knorr soups.
""We see no signs of North America slowing down,"" the company's chief executive officer, Alan Jope, told analysts.
A new wave of amateur bakers has led to a surge of more than 40% in sales of  Hershey Co 's (N:HSY) chocolate chips and cocoa powder that are used in cakes, cookies and other desserts.
The chocolate maker said on Thursday it expects sales to accelerate in the coming months.
By contrast, jeans maker  Levi Strauss & Co  (N:LEVI) said on Tuesday its executives would continue to work with reduced salaries through the end of August, citing the economic hit from COVID-19.

Levis, hurt by store closures, said on July 7 that sales tumbled 62% in the second quarter.

1004,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 12:20PM ET</span>","New York Times CEO sees risk in regulating Google, Facebook to help news media","By Helen Coster
(Reuters) - Regulation intended to address the news industry’s problems with Google and Facebook could have adverse consequences, said outgoing  New York Times  Co (N:NYT) Chief Executive Officer Mark Thompson in an interview this week.
The news industry has seen its business model upended by tech giants like Alphabet Inc’s Google (O:GOOGL) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), which have siphoned online advertising dollars from publishers and which distribute news articles without paying the outlets that produce them. 
Thompson, who has helped lead the Times’ transformation to a “subscription-first business model” said this week that if a news organization is too dependent on digital advertising, it is a “straightforward competitor” with the major platforms that are also selling advertising - a war most news organizations that don't have distinctive brands and content will find hard to win because the platforms are so much bigger. 
Outside the United States, some regulators are making the tech giants pay for news: France’s competition authority has ordered Google to pay French publishers for their content, while Australian regulators are forcing the company and Facebook to share advertising revenue with local media groups.
But while Thompson believes regulatory scrutiny of the platforms is reasonable, he sees risk in giving regulators and politicians more control of media. 
“My own view is, the more we can get the major platforms to work bilaterally and voluntarily to help support journalism at every level, the better it will be,” said Thompson. “The more it becomes part of a long extended, regulatory, and political process, the less likely it is to help in time, and the more likely you are to get different kinds of adverse consequences.”
Facebook pays The Times and other publishers to feature their content on the Facebook News section of the social media company’s app. 
In June the Times ended its partnership with Apple Inc’s (O:AAPL) news aggregator Apple News, saying that publishers should be fairly compensated for their content.

Thompson is stepping down in September, when Chief Operating Officer Meredith (NYSE:MDP) Kopit Levien becomes the company’s new CEO.

Investing.com - More Americans are taking a dip as they stick close to home. That’s good news for Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) Corporation, which is up 4% Thursday to a record after boosting guidance and beating second quarter estimates.
Pool, the world's largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products, reported earnings per share of $3.72 on record net sales of $1.28 billion, compared to EPS of $3.17 and revenue of $1.16 billion estimated by analysts tracked by Investing.com.
Annual earnings guidance was bumped to a range of $6.90 to $7.30 per diluted share, compared to $5.30 to $5.90 previously.
""We believe that industry demand remains healthy, which is reflected through reports of significantly more leads and a larger than normal backlog from pool construction and remodel companies,” Chief Executive Officer Peter D. Arvan said in a statement.
Shares have almost doubled since March. Pool has five buy ratings and three holds, with no sells, according to data compiled by Investing.com."

""The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated changes in consumer behaviour and therefore requires changes in how we engage with our customers and how we sell our products,"" a company spokesman said.

It has not used public money nor the British government's job retention scheme during the crisis.

Most of the staff impacted by Thursday's announcement are in retail or customer service roles, and the company said employees will be redeployed to different jobs where possible.

Second quarter earnings per share of $1.15 on revenue of $2.59 billion bested analyst estimates for EPS of $0.86 on revenue of $2.52 billion.
Peer home builders Taylor Morrison (NYSE:TMHC), DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) and  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) are all trading higher.
“Following a period of demand weakness beginning in late March and into April as COVID-19 first impacted the country, new home sales experienced a material acceleration as the second quarter progressed,” said Chief Executive Officer Ryan Marshall. “The recovery in demand reflects a number of factors, including: low interest rates, a restricted supply of existing-home inventory, pent-up demand following the economic shutdown, the appeal of single-family living in a new home and a desire among some buyers to exit more densely populated urban centers.”
All communities have been reopened to walk-in traffic, Marshall said. The company is also increasing its land acquisition and development spending.
“Given the strength of second quarter sales, we are encouraged about the back half of 2020,” Marshall said.
PulteGroup shares are down 38% from the beginning of the year."
1008,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 11:18AM ET</span>",Betting Against Fear on Wall Street Has Rarely Looked This Good,"(Bloomberg) -- Traders who have been waiting for the right moment to bet against stock volatility have rarely seen the stars align like this.
After soaring some 500% in the pandemic crisis, a popular strategy tracking the Wall Street fear gauge, formally known as the Cboe Volatility Index, looks ripe for a fresh plunge that would deliver gains for short sellers.
The iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN -- a $900 million long-volatility product with the ticker VXX -- could soon get hit by a rare bout of bearish momentum, according to Dean Curnutt, CEO of Macro Risk Advisors. Thank technical forces in the VIX derivatives landscape and easing price swings powered by the latest stock rally.
“VXX could have a real target on its back,” Curnutt wrote in an email. “Unless realized volatility picks up considerably.”
As U.S. stocks surge back toward records on improving economic data, policy support and vaccine hopes, the VIX has remained elevated, frustrating volatility shorts. But with historical volatility dropping, the implied measure looks ready to fall anew. That would provide a direct boost to those investors betting against the VXX since it tracks the level at which the near-term futures contracts trade.
“Realized vol explains 75% of the level of the VIX,” Curnutt said Wednesday. “With 2 week realized at 13 now, the VIX cannot remain at 25 if this low trend continues.”
Another reason why bears have a spring in their step is the shape of the futures curve, or the relative prices of the volatility contracts. When the front of this term structure is upward-sloping, as is the case now, VXX loses money just by rolling the contracts.
The curve looks likely to stay that way. Investors have dramatically bid up the price of October futures, whose value is linked to options that expire after the U.S. general election, amid expectations of a volatility surge around the November vote
“Typically, when vol is this high, the curve is flat to inverted, so you don’t get the roll down,” according to the MRA chief. “Conversely, when the curve is steep, vol is low, so you can’t really win on implied vol coming in -- now the setup may be for both to occur.”
Of course, the elevated VIX suggests there may be fireworks in the near-term horizon, if extraordinary U.S. fiscal support eases. To account for the riskiness of the trade, the advisory firm suggests a “put tree” structure, or a combination of buying and selling the contracts at different strikes.

(Reuters) - AT&T Inc said on Thursday it lost monthly phone subscribers and suffered a $2.8 billion revenue decline due to delayed movie releases and advertising shortfalls in the second quarter as the novel coronavirus pandemic ravaged its business.
Shares of the company were down almost 2% in morning trading.
AT&T, which has invested heavily to transform itself into a media and telecommunications conglomerate, reported 36 million subscribers for both its premium TV channel HBO and the new streaming service HBO Max, which launched in May. In the first quarter, HBO had about 33 million customers.
As the health crisis led to widespread stay-at-home orders to curb the spread of the virus and upended the economy, it has particularly hurt AT&T's media business due to the loss of live sports broadcasts and delayed productions. 
""I don't expect we're going to see much change in the third quarter around those challenges that are in front of us,"" AT&T Chief Executive John Stankey said during an earnings call with analysts. 
Revenue for the WarnerMedia segment, which includes HBO, fell 22.7% to $6.8 billion. It has thrice postponed the release of Christopher Nolan's highly anticipated movie ""Tenet"" as theater chains remained largely shut. 
The pandemic had a $1.5 billion impact on WarnerMedia revenue, AT&T said during the call with analysts.
In the second quarter, AT&T lost 151,000 mobile phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, which included the loss of 338,000 customers who stopped paying their bills, but were kept on the network as part of a federal program to ensure Americans remain connected on their cell phones during the pandemic.
Analysts had expected the company to add 6,800 subscribers, according to research firm FactSet.
AT&T said it had started to see foot traffic return as retail stores begin to reopen with the loosening of lockdown restrictions, and that new phone launches later this year could help improve retail sales. 
The company lost 886,000 so called ""premium TV"" subscribers, which includes satellite TV provider DirecTV and a smaller number of U-Verse customers, as viewers switch to cheaper online video services.
Excluding items, AT&T earned 83 cents per share, above analysts' estimates of 79 cents per share. 

Total quarterly revenue fell nearly 9% to $41 billion. Analysts on average had expected $41.10 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose last week for the first time in nearly four months against the backdrop of a resurgence in coronavirus cases, the Labor Department's data showed.
""The monetary taps are on and are likely to remain so while unemployment is so high, and this should continue to support markets,"" said Geir Lode, head of global equities, International at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI) in London.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the White House was interested in getting a trillion-dollar coronavirus relief bill out quickly and was working with Senate Republicans to hammer out language on extending enhanced unemployment benefits.
Optimism about a potential vaccine, fiscal stimulus and improving economic data has helped the benchmark S&P 500 recoup most of its virus-induced losses and rise 1.4% this year. The blue-chip Dow is still down about 5% year-to-date, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (IXIC) has climbed about 19%.
Of the 75 S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results, 77.3% of them have beaten dramatically lowered profit estimates, according to IBES Refinitiv data.
 Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) fell 1.2%, weighing the most on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, as its flagship cloud computing business Azure reported quarterly sales growth of under 50% for the first time ever.
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) rose 1.5% after posting a fourth consecutive quarterly profit, clearing a hurdle that could lead to the electric carmaker's inclusion in the S&P 500 index (SPX).
 Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) jumped 5.7% as it reported a record yearly growth in daily users even as its ad sales sank.
""Many continue to believe there will be a V-shaped recovery, although it remains too early to say whether the earnings season will add weight to that view or not,"" Lode added.
At 10:03 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was down 51.44 points, or 0.19%, at 26,954.40, the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 1.32 points, or 0.04%, at 3,277.34. The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was up 6.20 points, or 0.06%, at 10,712.33.
Travelers Cos Inc's (N:TRV) 2.9% decline weighed the most on the Dow after the property and casualty insurer reported a second-quarter loss.
Home builder PulteGroup Inc (N:PHM) jumped 11.5% after posting a higher quarterly profit.
Shares of American Airlines (O:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) slipped after the carriers said they were rethinking the number of flights they had planned to add to their schedules for August and September, as COVID-19 cases spike in some parts of the United States.

Investing.com - Covid-19 be damned. Hershey is convinced it’ll be all treats this Halloween.
The chocolate bar maker is forecasting its biggest season will outperform expectations thanks to “iconic brands, strong innovation and merchandising, and great execution"" despite the pandemic.
Shares are up 4.3% after the company reported that it expects “accelerated sales growth in the second half of the year based on momentum exiting the second quarter, assuming no significant disruption to current consumer trends.”
That includes Halloween, which represents about 10% of annual sales. While Hershey says celebrations will be different this year, it notes that almost 50% of candy purchases are based on “treat for me” and “candy bowl” occasions, which start early. The annual Halloween tradition of trick or treating represents the other 50% of the season’s sales.
The pandemic may force parents to change plans this year and prevent their children from trick or treating, which involves traveling door to door and collecting candy. Parent Jordan River told The Mercury News in April that he was worried about there being “too many hands in the (candy) pot — with the likelihood of asymptomatic spreaders all around.” As things currently stand, the newspaper reported, he says there will be no trick-or-treating for the family in 2020.
Hershey admits there will be fewer trick or treaters out there, but it might not be as bad as feared as “the expectation of this holiday tradition has been consistently improving over the past several weeks,” Hershey Chief Executive Officer Michele Buck said in an earnings call July 22."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday said he is worried about the risks to retail investors who are increasingly making short-term bets via low-cost trading platforms rather than sticking to long-term investments.
""We're seeing significant inflows from retail investors who conduct more trading than investing,"" Jay Clayton said in a Thursday interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""
The rise of new, low-cost, easy-to-use trading apps combined with ultra-low interest rates has unleashed a flood of retail money into stocks from investors looking to cash in on the market rally. That money has often flowed into highly risky trades, including stocks that have filed for bankruptcy. 
Robinhood Markets Inc came under https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-robinhood-options/robinhood-details-possible-changes-to-options-offering-after-suicide-by-customer-idUKKBN23Q38Q criticism in June when a 20-year-old customer took his own life after believing he incurred a large loss using the free trading app. The firm has since expanded its educational content for options trading.
""I encourage people to educate themselves, but short-term trading is more risky than long-term investing and I do worry about this risk investors take,"" Clayton told CNBC. 
He also defended a recent agency proposal to significantly raise the reporting threshold for large institutional investment managers after critics said it would reduce market transparency.
Last month, the SEC proposed adjusting Form 13F, a quarterly report hedge funds submit about their investment activities and holdings. The measure would capture activity of hedge funds that hold $3.5 billion in assets, up from the current $100 million threshold drawn up four decades ago.

""The purpose of the form is for regulators to manage large positions in the marketplace and the current threshold is clearly not the right number,"" said Clayton.

Spirit warned last month it was at risk of breaching its financial covenants after its largest customer  Boeing Co  (N:BA) asked the aero parts maker to substantially reduce 737 production this year due to the coronavirus crisis.
Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit, which makes fuselages for the 737 MAX, has shared a forecast with lenders that showed deliveries for 737 MAX in 2020 to be around 70, much lower than its previous forecast of a little more than 200, according to the report.
Spirit expects 2021 deliveries of the narrow-body plane to come in at less than half of its earlier forecast of 400 planes, according to the CNBC report.
For 2022, the fresh estimates for Boeing's 737 deliveries were projected at fewer than 400 planes, a decline from a previous forecast of almost 500.
Spirit's profits have come under pressure after Boeing halted production of the once best-selling 737 MAX in January. The jet was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after two fatal crashes killed 346 people.
As a result, Spirit has been forced to cut thousands of jobs and reduce its quarterly dividend by 90% to just 1 cent per share.

Both Spirit and Boeing were unavailable for comment.

1017,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 10:04AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Opens Lower as Jobless Claims Rise for 1st Time Since April,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower on Thursday after fresh data suggesting that the surge in coronavirus cases across the U.S. is derailing the economic recovery.
By 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 47 points, or 0.2% at 26,959 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both down less than 0.1%.
Labor Department numbers released earlier showed that initial jobless claims rose for the first time since April to 1.416 million, suggesting that the pace of layoffs is picking up again after slowing gradually over the previous three months. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the numbers were distorted higher by seasonal quirks which could last another week before unwinding. 
""The underlying trend in claims since mid-June, before these distortions, seems to have been about flat,"" Shepherdson said. ""But claims are still running at more than twice the worst single week after the crash of 2008.""
The data followed others showing a sustained increase in deaths across the U.S. from the Covid-19 virus. The death toll hit 1,100 again on Wednesday and more people have now died of the virus in the U.S. than in the European Union, which has a considerably larger population.
The market was further unsettled by the spread of violence across various cities in the U.S., and the deployment of federal agents to quell the unrest, as well as by lawmakers' apparent difficulties in crafting the latest package of economic stimulus measures. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed on Thursday that there will be no payroll tax cut in the package, signalling the first of what is likely to be many compromises on the way to reaching a deal.
The numbers overshadowed better-than-expected earnings released after the bell on Wednesday by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).  Tesla stock fell 3.0%, paring overnight and premarket gains on concerns that the company's results were flattered by the sale of emissions credits. Microsoft stock fell 1.5%, on a slowdown in growth at its lucrative Cloud-hosting business Azure.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was another stock in the spotlight, falling 0.5% after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) recommended investors avoid the stock on valuation grounds. Analyst Rod Hall's price target of $299 is more than 20% below Wednesday's closing price.
Elsewhere, Danaher (NYSE:DHR) stock rose 2.5% and Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) stock rose 2.8% after both companies posted stronger-than-expected earnings, but AT&T (NYSE:T) stock fell 1.5% after the Covid-19 pandemic wiped over half a billion dollars from its basic operating earnings, mainly through a hit to advertising revenue.

1018,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 09:55AM ET</span>",Twitter shares rise on record yearly growth in daily users,"By Katie Paul and Elizabeth Culliford
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) on Thursday reported its highest-ever yearly growth of daily users who can view ads, beating analysts' estimates on usage and sending its shares up 4%.
Twitter's average monetizable daily active users (mDAU) increased 34% year over year to 186 million, above analysts' estimate of 176 million, in a rise it said was primarily driven by external factors such as shelter-in-place requirements and increased conversation around the COVID-19 pandemic.
But the company missed Wall Street's lowered expectations for quarterly revenue, as the coronavirus-spurred economic slowdown battered the company's largely events-oriented digital ads business.
Ad sales, which make up 82% of Twitter's revenue, sank 23% to $562 million, a drop the company attributed to brand spending pauses tied to the pandemic and U.S. civil unrest. Analysts had expected $585 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Chief Executive Jack Dorsey opened a conference call with analysts by apologizing for the hack that compromised the accounts of high-profile users last week, saying ""we feel terrible."" In a statement, Dorsey said Twitter had taken steps to improve its security and ""resiliency against targeted social engineering attempts.""
Total revenue came in at $683 million, down 19% year-over-year, helped by steadier sales growth from the licensing of users' posts to researchers and marketers.
Twitter has struggled to build out its ad offerings, leaving it reliant on a suite of promotional tools geared toward advertising around big events and product launches, which have all but vanished during the pandemic.
The company said it finished rebuilding its ad management technology in the second quarter, which would support faster development of new formats going forward, and was rolling out measurement tools for ""direct response"" ads used by app developers.
On the conference call, Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal declined to give details about the impact of a July social media advertising boycott that was intially focused on Facebook (O:FB) but spread to other platforms. Dorsey said Twitter's actions to protect conversations on the platform were being noted by advertisers. 
Twitter also said it was exploring ""subscriptions and other approaches to complement our advertising business,"" such as commerce, though it was not expecting any revenue to result this year Dorsey said on the call that the company would have a ""really high bar for when we would ask consumers to pay for aspects of Twitter.""
The company reported a second-quarter loss of $1.2 billion, largely driven by the reversal of a tax benefit established last year, when the company transferred intellectual property to Ireland. Because of the second quarter's steep coronavirus-related losses, Twitter did not make enough money to take advantage of the tax benefit.
Adjusted to exclude the tax considerations, the company incurred a loss of $127 million, or 16 cents per share, roughly in line with analyst expectations of a $125 million loss. It had an adjusted profit last year of $37 million.
Echoing earlier guidance, Twitter said it expects data licensing revenue to ""moderate"" for the rest of the year.
Costs and expenses grew 5% to $807 million, below the increase in the low teens that Twitter had forecast. The company said it anticipated expense growth of 10% or more in the third quarter.

Social media rival  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP) missed user growth estimates earlier this week, as its usage bump from coronavirus lockdowns petered out sooner than expected, but it beat targets for revenue gains.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets rose on Thursday as better-than-expected corporate earnings in Europe offset worries about rising cases of COVID-19 and a sharp escalation in tensions between the United States and China.
Shares have rallied to their strongest levels since February this week - in many countries erasing their entire slump in March when the coronavirus pandemic sent markets into freefall - as investors bet that massive stimulus has carried economies through the worst of it.
The pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 climbed 0.57% while the German DAX gained 0.64% and the FTSE 100 by 0.58%.
S&P mini-futures added 0.34%, pointing to a stronger open on Wall Street.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, rose 0.13%, close to Tuesday's level, which was its highest since late February. It has surged around 45% since the lows of late March.
Graphic: The MSCI world equity index - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjvqwjoxvx/world%20stocks.PNG 
The gains this week are despite Washington's order to Beijing to close its consulate in Houston, Texas amid accusations against China of spying, which initially pulled shares lower in Asia before stocks rebounded.
China called the order an ""unprecedented escalation"" by Washington and warned it would be forced to respond. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said that other consulate closures were ""always possible"". 
""You almost have a tug of war in markets between positives and negatives and it's finally balanced. It looks like markets are pricing a V-shaped recovery so you can expect small negatives to have an outsize impact on markets,"" said Justin Onuekwusi, portfolio manager at Legal & General Investment Management. 
""But the pullback is likely to be shortlived as there are people waiting for a dip.""
Positive corporate earnings surprises in Europe helped the mood, including from Unilever (NYSE:UL), French-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics and automaker Daimler (OTC:DDAIF).
Investors will be keeping a close watch on U.S. weekly jobless claims figures due at 1230 GMT for the latest indications of how the novel coronavirus pandemic has affected the American economy. The U.S. recorded more than 1,100 new coronavirus deaths for a second straight day on Wednesday. 
Despite the virus being far from under control, analysts say unprecedented stimulus measures to boost battered economies continue to provide structural support for riskier assets.
""The forces of liquidity are just unparalleled ... we're seeing what happened post the GFC (global financial crisis), but we're seeing it on steroids,"" said Kay Van-Petersen, global macro strategist at Saxo Capital Markets in Singapore.
""It's rare that you see both monetary and fiscal policy turned on, and then when they are they only turn on for a little bit.""
GOLD GLITTERS
In currency markets the euro was up 0.1% to $1.1583, close to the 21-month high of $1.1601 it touched on Wednesday as agreement between European Union members on a large economic recovery fund continued to provide lift.
Traders pleased with the deal have also pushed Italian borrowing costs lower, and yields on 10-year government debt dropped to a new 4-1/2 month low, moving closer to 1%. 
The dollar was down marginally against a basket of currencies and unchanged versus the Japanese yen.
Gold prices rose 0.6% to $1,888 per ounce, a new nine-year peak, with prices up 24% on the year. 
Investors have flocked to the safe-haven metal as they seek shelter from a potential reversal in pumped-up stock prices and a possible rise in inflation following so much monetary and fiscal stimulus.

At the time of the grounding, U.S. airlines including Southwest were growing their networks and eager to bring more of the fuel-efficient MAX jets into their fleets.
Now airlines are parking planes as the coronavirus saps demand.
Southwest still has 100 aircraft in storage, including 34 MAX aircraft, it said in its quarterly results release, after it parked 400 planes in April as the pandemic brought the industry to a near halt.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Tuesday it plans to issue a proposed airworthiness directive for the Boeing 737 MAX in the ""near future"" to address changes made following the two crashes, which killed 346 people.
The FAA is unlikely to certify the 737 MAX for flight before some time in October, an official briefed on the matter told Reuters. 

Southwest has said it will need between 30 and 60 days following certification to prepare its MAX aircraft and pilots to fly commercially again.

1023,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 07:56AM ET</span>","U.S. derivatives rule completes Dodd Frank, clarifies regulator's role","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - A new derivatives rule should clear up any uncertainty about U.S. regulators' role in transactions involving foreign banks and foreign counterparties and so avoid clashes with other watchdogs, a senior U.S. regulatory official said on Thursday. 
The rule is due to be formally adopted later on Thursday and reflects seven-year old guidance on regulating cross-border derivatives transactions.
It also marks completion of implementing fundamental reforms set out in the U.S. Dodd Frank Act passed in the aftermath of the 2007-09 global financial crisis that was fuelled by opacity in the multitrillion-dollar derivatives market.
""This week is a big bullet for us to fire in the sense we will have closed the book on Dodd Frank,"" said Joshua Sterling, director of swap dealer and intermediary oversight at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). 
""I am optimistic that we will have a period of less rule writing and more oversight,"" he told Reuters.
The new rule will clear up any confusion over to what extent the CFTC will regulate a transaction involving traders at a foreign bank in New York in a swap that has both its counterparties outside the United States.
""We are now very clear that the involvement of those folks in New York will not result in that trade triggering more of our swap dealer requirements,"" Sterling said.
""I am optimistic that will provide great certainty to non-U.S. financial services companies that have a real presence in New York.""
It is a sign of how the U.S. regulator is willing to defer to regulators outside the United States, such as in Europe and Japan.
It follows a decision by the European Union to avoid trapping U.S. clearing houses in the crosshairs of new rules on EU derivatives investors using foreign clearers. The original rules had provoked a threat of retaliation by the CFTC.

""We are optimistic that all international issues are being handled appropriately and with good intentions on all sides, and we believe that will continue,"" Sterling said.

1026,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 07:54AM ET</span>",Tesla’s ‘Home-Run Quarter’ Leaves Even the Bears Praising Elon Musk,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. shares extended their meteoric gains in U.S. pre-market trading as even the most pessimistic analysts struggled to find faults in the electric carmaker’s quarterly earnings report.
It was a “home-run quarter” for Elon Musk’s firm, according to Wedbush’s Dan Ives, as the company reinstated its original delivery target of 500,000 units in fiscal 2020 and reported its fourth consecutive profit. Cowen’s Jeffrey Osborne upgraded his rating to market perform, removing the underperform recommendation he has held since initiating coverage of the stock in 2016.
The quarter was marked by a “step change” in China, where Shanghai accounted for a sharply higher proportion of Tesla’s global production and deliveries, according to Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas. Cash flow was also impressive, he said.
“Bears really would have to nit pick at the release to construct a materially negative narrative,” Jonas wrote in a note.
Tesla shares rose 5.2% in pre-market trading. The stock has almost quadrupled this year and is up more than sixfold in the past 12 months.
Here’s a summary of what analysts have to say:
Cowen, Jeffrey Osborne
Execution on margins, cost control, lower capital spending and a faster ramp-up of factories and new vehicles have exceeded expectations. New factories, vehicle platforms and in-house batteries seen driving sentiment toward the stock.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Mark Delaney
Tesla has met the most important criteria investors were looking for: profit for the second quarter and commentary that 500,000 deliveries are achievable for the year.
The positive free cash flow result for the second quarter was an “upside surprise.”
Compared with Goldman estimates, the primary driver of profit upside was from regulatory credit sales and the release of deferred revenue.
Loup Ventures, Gene Munster
The most important takeaway from the earnings report is that Tesla is “following Amazon’s playbook” by building a cycle of reinvesting profit to drive growth, scale and innovation.
It will be difficult for peers to build a vehicle that is feature and price competitive with Tesla, as the company has around 80% of the electric vehicle share in the U.S.
Sees Tesla adding energy as a central theme and this is where the long-term value will lie.
Wedbush, Daniel Ives
Second-quarter results were much better than expected and Elon Musk delivered a “home-run quarter” that defied skeptics.
Electric vehicle demand in China is accelerating and Tesla is competing with domestic and international competitors for market share.
China growth was a major source of strength in the second quarter and the growth story in the country is “worth $400 in a bull case” to Tesla, with electric vehicle penetration set to rise.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Adam Jonas
Bears would have to “nitpick” at the results to find negatives.
Highlights include China production being positive for margins and outstanding free cash flow management.
Positive results show that comparisons between high scale electric vehicle companies and established internal combustion engines are becoming less meaningful.

(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) said on Thursday it is rethinking the number of flights it had planned to add in August and September as weakening revenue pushes its daily cash burn up.
Dallas-based Southwest, which analysts have forecast to weather the coronavirus pandemic better than larger U.S. carriers thanks to its domestic focus and lower-cost structure, warned that travel demand would remain depressed until a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 becomes available.
Over the second quarter, Southwest said its average core cash burn had nearly halved to $16 million a day from $30 million in April as revenue improved, but it estimated the burn rate to be $18 million in July, rising to an average of $23 million per day in the third quarter. 
Optimism about a post-pandemic rebound in travel has waned as U.S. states scale back reopening plans to tackle another surge of infections in the country.
""Improving trends in revenue and bookings have recently stalled in July with the rise in COVID-19 cases,"" Southwest Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said in a statement.
Southwest posted a net loss of $915 million, or $1.63 per share for the quarter ended June 30, compared with a profit of $741 million, or $1.37 per share a year earlier.
Excluding items, the loss was $1.5 billion, or $2.67 per share.

New York-based Travelers, often seen as a bellwether for the insurance sector as it typically reports before other peers, said net written premiums fell 1% to $7.35 billion for the quarter. 
Chief Executive Officer Alan Schnitzer said the net impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and related economic conditions on the company's underlying results was modest.
Travelers reported pre-tax catastrophe losses of $854 million in the quarter, compared to losses of $367 million a year earlier, mainly from severe storms in several regions of the United States, as well as incidents related to civil unrest.
It said last week that pre-tax insurance losses directly related to the pandemic amounted to $114 million.
Net investment income fell 380% to $268 million due to lower returns from its fixed income portfolio business, dented by low interest rates.
Insurers' investments are coming under pressure and the investments they rely on to pay claims are facing major hurdles.
They manage more than $20 trillion in assets globally, but their big government bond holdings are becoming problematic as the threat of recession grows and central banks' interest rate cuts have sent yields plunging.

The company reported a combined ratio of 103.7%, compared with 98.4% a year earlier. A ratio below 100 percent means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims.

The company, which is still carrying $152 billion of net debt after its acquisition of Time Warner, said revenue fell over 10% from a year earlier to $41.0 billion while underlying earnings per share fell 6.8% to 83 cents a share, from 89c a year ago.
Earnings were around 5% higher than expected, while revenue was broadly in line with street forecasts.
AT&T company said that almost all of the profit decline - 6c a share – was due to pandemic-related impacts that it expected to be transitory. It estimated that Covid-19 had reduced revenue by $2.81 billion, largely through lower advertising revenue, and had depressed EBITDA by $510 million. Despite this, net debt stayed largely stable at 2.63 times EBITDA.
The pattern of recent quarters continued, with the loss of another 886,000 premium TV customers in the quarter. However, this was partially offset by the launch of HBO MAX at the end of May.
In contrast to the previous quarter, when it suspended its guidance completely, AT&T said it intends to pay out just over 60% of net profit, and expects gross capital investment of around $20 billion.
The earnings beat and reassurance on dividends pushed AT&T stock up by 1.1% in premarket trading by 7:40 AM ET (1140 GMT).
""AT&T looks quite vulnerable when the pandemic is still raging,"" said Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar. ""The company is in the middle of a massive overhaul of its business, focusing on 5G wireless and its streaming platform HBO Max. These goals might not be easy to achieve when its old business model is under pressure and the economy is in a recession.""
AT&T shares are down 22% from the beginning of the year and down 24% from their 52-week high of $39.70 set on November 18, 2019. They are underperforming the S&P 500 which is up 1.4% from the start of the year.
AT&T's report follows an earnings miss by Netflix on July 16, which reported EPS of $1.59 on revenue of $6.15 billion, compared to forecasts EPS of $1.82 on revenue of $6.08 billion.
Prologis had beaten expectations on Tuesday with second quarter EPS of $0.56 on revenue of $944 million, compared to forecasts for EPS of $0.47 on revenue of $893 million.

1035,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 07:07AM ET</span>",Thousands of Spanish Airbus workers protest layoff plan,"By Guillermo Martinez and Sergio Perez
GETAFE, Spain (Reuters) - Thousands of Spanish Airbus (PA:AIR) employees gathered outside a factory near Madrid on Thursday, waving banners and chanting through face-masks, to protest against a restructuring plan that will see hundreds of jobs lost.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought air travel to a screeching halt, hammering demand for the planes and systems that Airbus produces. The company, which is 4% owned by the Spanish government, has said it will lay off about 900 workers in Spain as part of cuts of 15,000 jobs worldwide.
""We're protesting because the company, taking advantage of this temporary situation of COVID-19, wants to get rid of 900 workers,"" said Jose Luis Collado, who has worked at the company for 41 years.
""This is a temporary situation. It's going to pass and we don't understand why we're being thrown out on the street.""
From the factory, the protesters marched 2 km to Getafe's town hall where the mayor gave a speech in support of the workers. 
""For us it's about defending our rights, defending Spain's aerospace sector. It needs to be supported,"" said Lorena Fernandez, another protester with 11 years at the company. 
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said at the beginning of this month that the government was working with Airbus to find ways to keep jobs in the country, but so far no details on any rescue plan have been released.
France and Germany will bear the brunt of the layoffs, with around 5,000 apiece. But the loss of 900 manufacturing jobs in Spain is nonetheless a blow for an economy that has been among the worst hit in Europe by the fallout from the pandemic. 
Before the coronavirus crisis, Airbus was already planning to cut around 700 jobs in Spain.

In recent months Japanese automaker Nissan (T:7201) has said it will close three plants in Catalonia, while  Alcoa  (N:AA) is in the process of shutting an aluminium factory in the northwestern region of Galicia.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Thursday, helped by some strong corporate earnings and optimism over the next fiscal stimulus even as tensions with China rise.
At 07:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 12 points, or 0.4%, higher, Nasdaq Futures up 93 points, or 0.9%. The Dow Futures contract rose 105 points, or 0.4%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 cash indexes are on course for their fourth positive week in a row, for the first time since November 2019 in Dow’s case and December 2019 for the S&P.
Senate Republicans late on Wednesday said they had come to agreement in principle over the majority of a potential aid package, which may be presented to their political opponents this week in an attempt to rush legislation through before the end of the month.
With some relief policies due to expire at the end of this month and Congress set for a recess in August, there have been fears that the policymakers won’t be able to resolve their differences in time.
Adding to the positive tone has been some strong earnings from investors’ darling Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) late Wednesday, which posted its fourth straight quarter with a profit. Tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after hours, with overall revenue growing 13% in the quarter.
The earnings season will continue Thursday, with Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL). Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and AT&T (NYSE:T) before the bell and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) due later. 
Still, tensions remain fraught between the U.S. and China after the U.S. administration ordered Beijing to close its consulate in Houston.
Additionally, the number of U.S. deaths from Covid-19 rose by more than 1,100 for a second day in a row on Wednesday, including a record one-day rise in fatalities in Alabama, California, Nevada and Texas, according to a Reuters tally.
With those coronavirus numbers in mind, eyes will turn to the release of initial jobless claims data, at 08:30 AM ET (1230 GMT) to see if the new outbreak has halted the fall in claims. 
Oil prices edged lower Thursday, with the jump in U.S. crude inventories, reported late Wednesday, having only a limited impact given the overall positive tone.
That said, these prices could see a correction in the near-term if a recovery in fuel demand slows further, especially in the United States, according to analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), in a research note.
At 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $41.88 a barrel, while Brent fell 0.2% to $44.19.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.8% to $1,879.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1581, up 0.1%."

1040,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 06:55AM ET</span>",Surge in eating at home cushions virus hit for Unilever,"By Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - Second-quarter sales at  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNA) fell much less than expected as a pick up in eating at home during coronavirus lockdowns boosted demand for products such as Hellmann's mayonnaise and Breyers ice cream. 
Shares in the consumer goods giant rose as much as 8.7% in early Thursday trading, as the Anglo-Dutch group surprised analysts who had expected a much bigger hit to sales from the closure of restaurants, schools, cinemas and outside venues.
""Overall, Unilever's strong performance in the period and an increasingly focused strategy has led to a sigh of overdue relief from investors,"" said Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investors. 
Underlying sales fell 0.3% in the three months ended June 30, compared with analysts' mean forecast for a 4.3% drop.
That was still the first decline in quarterly sales since the third quarter of 2004, according to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts.
Underlying sales in North America jumped 7.3% in the first half, with volumes up as much as 20% in some categories, Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly told a media call. The United States is Unilever's biggest market by revenue.
Breyers, Magnum and Klondike ice-cream, along with Hellmann's mayonnaise and Knorr soups, were strong performers in food, while Suave beauty products did well in hygiene, he said. 
""We see no signs of North America slowing down,"" Chief Executive Officer Alan Jope told analysts, despite coronavirus-cases spiking in the United States.
Other virus hot-spots were more of a concern, however. 
""Things are starting to get into the toughest phase in Latin America and Africa,"" Pitkethly said, adding a surge in gang-related violence in Mexico was making business difficult there. 
Highlighting the huge disruptions caused by the pandemic, Unilever said food service sales declined by nearly 40% and out-of-home ice cream by nearly 30% in the first half. However, e-commerce sales were up 49%, with North America leaping 177%. 
Pitkethly said the firm's food solutions business, which caters to canteens, schools and cafeterias and makes about 5% of group sales, was starting to recover as lockdowns are lifted. 
While sales were down 70% in March, the decline has eased to 38%, with the improvement accelerating, he said.
TEA REVIEW
Unilever also said that after exploring options for its 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion) a year tea business, it had decided to keep its operations in India and Indonesia and its ready-to-drink joint venture with PepsiCo (O:PEP). 
The rest of the tea business, which sells Pukka Herb and PG Tips and made 2 billion euros of revenues in 2019, will be separated into an independent entity, a process the company expects to conclude by the end of 2021.
Some analysts think Unilever could ultimately be more exposed to the pandemic than rivals such as Procter & Gamble (N:PG) and Nestle (S:NESN) due to its greater reliance on emerging markets, where it makes about 60% of annual sales.
Graphic: Unilever shares versus peers - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmopalnayva/Unilever%20shares%20vs%20peers.PNG
Analysts expect Nestle to report flat quarterly sales next week. Its shares were up more than 1% after Unilever's forecast-beating performance, but Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo cautioned against reading too much into Unilever's results for Nestle. 
In North America, for example, he noted that while Unilever had benefited from its strength in foods, Nestle was more exposed to pet care, where there are signs consumers are running down stocks after building them up in March. 
Unilever's underlying sales in developed markets rose 2.4% in the first half, while they declined 1.9% in emerging markets. 
In China - where the virus first emerged and was first brought under control - sales returned to mid-single digit growth in the second quarter, although food service remained challenging, the company said.

1045,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 05:44AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Diversity Is Strength for Unilever,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Sellers of consumer staples are supposed to be resilient, and so it has proved with  Unilever  PLC (LON:ULVR).
Underlying sales fell 0.3% in the three months through June, Unilever said on Thursday, their first quarterly decline in 15 years but far less than the 4.3% drop that analysts had forecast.
Given the high proportion of Unilever’s sales in emerging markets, where currency depreciation also hurt in the quarter, the figures are almost startling: underlying operating profit, adjusted for currency factors, rose 3.8%, and margins improved by 50 basis points.
Unilever shares reacted with one of their biggest one-day jumps in years, rising 7.7% by mid-morning in London, accounting for a decent chunk of the 0.6% gain in the FTSE 100. The benchmark Stoxx 600 rose 0.4%, after healthy updates from other corners such as auto giant  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and chipmaker STMicroelectronics (MI:STM).
Unilever’s diversity has proved to be its strength in the last three months, helping it – largely – to absorb alarmingly large and quick shifts in demand for specific products.
Covid has made the global consumer more hygiene-conscious, driving a gain in sales of its Cif surface cleaners of nearly 20%, while sales of its Domestic bleach chalked up a gain of over 10% (even without any spike in oral or intravenous use by those following the medical advice of the U.S. President).
But what the coronavirus gave Unilever with one hand, it took away with the other: sales of beauty and grooming products slumped as locked-down workers - let’s be honest - just stopped trying.  
Even within single product lines, there were sharp fluctuations to deal with: sales of ice cream for home consumption rose 26%, but the division that distributes to cafes, restaurants and ice cream vans suffered a 30% drop.
Expect the unevenness to continue, not least because of the geographical sales mix: China, where sales fell by a mid-teen percentage before rebounding, is clearly on an upward path after largely containing the virus. The same can’t be said for either India or the U.S., two other key markets.  Chief financial officer Graham Pitkethly unsurprisingly played down the prospects of a quick recovery on a call with analysts, according to newswire reports.
The stock is unlikely to ever grab the attention of the Robinhood bros, but at only 22 times trailing earnings, it is still affordable. Likewise, the dividend yield of some 3.30% at Wednesday’s closing price is more than decent and appears sustainable, helped by the judicious release of capital through transactions such as the partial spin-off of the tea business.
Unilever lagged its arch-rival Nestle (SIX:NESN) in improving shareholder returns and still has a performance gap to make up: over the last two years, Nestle shares have risen some 43% while Unilever’s have risen less than 11%. Thursday’s results, however, are pretty clear evidence that it is moving in the right direction, and at some speed."

1047,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 04:30AM ET</span>","'Please mine more nickel,' Musk urges as Tesla boosts production","By Yilei Sun and Melanie Burton
BEIJING/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) boss Elon Musk urged miners to produce more nickel, a key ingredient in the batteries that power the company's electric cars, warning the current cost of batteries remained a big hurdle to the company's growth.
""Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way,"" Musk said on a post-earnings call on Wednesday.
Nickel makes batteries energy dense so cars can run further on a single charge, and Tesla needs the metal more than ever as it looks to ramp up production of trucks and solar projects that use a lot of nickel.
Musk's call for greater nickel mining comes even as prices for battery materials wallow around rock bottom.
However, traders and analysts say the kinds of volumes Tesla would need are unlikely to make a compelling business case for miners to invest in increased production, nor are they likely to boost prices in the medium term.
Tesla currently sources nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) batteries from South Korea's LG Chem Ltd (KS:051910) and nickel-cobalt-aluminium (NCA) batteries from Japan's Panasonic Corp (T:6752).
These companies indirectly buy nickel from mining companies in a long auto supply chain. Tesla doesn't disclose which nickel miners are in its supply chain.
Given Tesla's focus on sustainability, the company is likely to prefer to buy from miners of higher-grade nickel sulphide, which requires less power to process than laterite ore, said Lachlan Shaw of National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY).
There are three key suppliers - Brazil's Vale (SA:VALE3), which operates in Canada using some hydropower, Russia's Norilsk Nickel (MM:GMKN) and BHP Group (NYSE:BHP)'s operations (AX:BHP) in Western Australia. ""Vale is in the box seat,"" he said.
While electric vehicles consume a much smaller amount of nickel than traditional industries such as stainless steel makers, EVs are expected to be the quickest growth market for nickel miners.
Nickel consumption in EV battery materials is expected to soar 64% between 2019 and 2025, research firm Wood Mackensie said, although it added that satisfying this demand could be challenging for an industry that has been slow to add capacity in a timely and cost-effective manner.
""He needs nickel, so he hopes nickel prices will go lower and lower,"" said a China-based nickel trader. ""Prices will not be impacted in the short-term because the market is in surplus.""
Nickel hit a 14-month low of $10,865 a tonne  in March but has since recovered to $13,180, still down by some 30% from five-year peaks seen in September. Prices rallied 2.6 percent partly on Tesla's bullish outlook, a trader said. 
Tesla on Wednesday posted a second-quarter profit, but Musk said he would prioritise growth over profit going forward, and focus on making Tesla vehicles more affordable.
""The real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at affordable price. That's the real limit,"" Musk said, adding the company would expand its business with Panasonic (T:6752) and CATL (SZ:300750) and ""possibly with others"".

Tesla is expected to reveal technological advances at its ""Battery Day"" event in September.

1048,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 04:00AM ET</span>","Upbeat Unilever, Daimler earnings support European shares","(Reuters) - European shares rose in early trading on Thursday, as investors brushed off simmering U.S.-China tensions and focused on better-than-expected earnings updates from  Unilever  (NYSE:UL) and  Daimler  (OTC:DDAIF).
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 0.3% by 0718 GMT, with personal & household goods stocks (SXQP) and automakers (SXAP) leading sectoral gains. 
Unilever NV (L:ULVR) (AS:UNA) surged 6.4% as the consumer giant reported second-quarter sales that fell much less than feared due to a strong performance in North America.
Germany's Daimler AG (DE:DAIGn) jumped 5.4% after saying EBIT at its core Mercedes-Benz Cars & Vans division in 2020 is expected to be above prior-year levels.
 Publicis Groupe  SA (PA:PUBP), the world's third-biggest advertising company, surged 14.8% after it beat market expectations for underlying sales in the second quarter with a less severe activity dive than most analysts feared. 
Meanwhile, data showed German consumer morale improved more than expected heading into August, helped by a temporary cut in value-added tax as part of the government's stimulus package to fight the coronavirus shock.

The slew of upbeat news helped investors brush aside concerns after the United States asked China to close its consulate in Houston amid accusations of spying, that had triggered a market selloff in the previous session.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Thursday, helped by signs of increased confidence and strong earnings from  Unilever  (NYSE:UL), but held back by more negative news on U.S.-China relations.
At 3:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 0.4%. 
German consumer sentiment improved by more than expected heading into August, helped by a temporary tax cut, suggesting that Europe's largest economy is slowly recovering from the coronavirus pandemic. The GfK consumer climate index rose to -0.3 in August from -9.6 in July. It bottomed at -23.1 points in May.
Additionally, French business confidence gained further ground in July, with the  INSEE official statistics agency saying its business climate index rose to 85, from 78 in June. This is still far from 105 it recorded in February before the outbreak but much better than the record low of 53 reached in April.
In corporate news,  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) stock rose 4.7% after the German automaker said it still expects an operating profit this year despite a large Covid-related second-quarter loss.
Unilever (LON:ULVR) soared 7.6% after its second-quarter sales fell much less than expected as a strong performance in North America helped to offset the hit from coronavirus lockdowns. The company also decided on a partial spin-off of its tea business.
Chipmaker STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) stock rose 3.4% after the company raised its guidance for the full year, despite ongoing weakness in the key automotive segment.
Roche (SIX:RO) stock dropped 1.9% after the Swiss healthcare company said it saw a “significant” impact on its business from the Covid-19 outbreak. It upheld its outlook for the full year.
Broad market gains may be limited later by rising tension between Washington and Beijing after China retaliated to the closure of its consulate in Houston by ordering the U.S. to close its representation in Chengdu. 
At the same time, the coronavirus continues to generate negative headlines, despite evidence that some local infection curves are flattening. California has now overtaken New York as the worst-hit state for cases.
Oil prices edged higher, with the jump in U.S. crude inventories, reported late Wednesday, having only a limited impact.
The Energy Information Administration said crude inventories rose by 4.9 million barrels in the week to July 17, despite this being peak driving season, as a sharp rise in coronavirus cases started to hit U.S. consumption.
At 3:55 AM, U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $42.12 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.5% to $44.52.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,875.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1590, up 0.2% on the day, having earlier hit its highest level in nearly two years.

Unilever shares gained as much as 8.1% after surprising the market with flat sales. Analysts expected a decline.
The maker of Magnum bars and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream has still been looking for purchases over the past six months, Chief Executive Officer Alan Jope said in a Bloomberg TV interview Thursday.
“If good opportunities emerge, we’re certainly in a strong position, especially with our healthy balance sheet, to take advantage of that,” Jope said.
The Anglo-Dutch company is in the process of abandoning its dual-headed legal structure.
“Further down the road, that could give us opportunities to look at more transformational acquisitions,” Jope said. “But I want to stress there’s nothing of that nature on the imminent radar.”
Underlying sales fell 0.3% in the second quarter. Analysts expected a 3.9% decline.
To respond to the changes in demand, Unilever increased its capacity to make hand sanitizer by about 600 times and expanding its Lifebuoy hygiene brand to more than 50 markets.
Unilever also said it plans to keep its tea business in India and Indonesia as well as stakes in ready-to-drink beverages even as it tries to sell the rest of the unit, confirming a previous Bloomberg report. The assets being sold have annual revenue of 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion).

The deal will allow Flipkart to launch a digital marketplace called Flipkart Wholesale next month, the Bengaluru-headquartered firm said, without disclosing any financial details of the deal.
Walmart, which has been running Best Price wholesale cash-and-carry stores in India since 2009, bought a controlling stake in Flipkart in 2018 for $16 billion.
The brand has 28 wholesale stores, two fulfilment centers and more than 1.5 million members, largely comprising mom-and-pop stores, but Walmart has not been able to make money from this business.
The Flipkart deal, which local daily Economic Times had said https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/internet/walmarts-cash-and-carry-biz-may-go-to-flipkart/73570755 was in the offing in January, comes as e-commerce players including Amazon look to woo India's mom-and-pop stores that are considered the backbone of the economy.
Flipkart also faces competition from local online grocery upstart JioMart, backed by billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led  Reliance Industries  (NS:RELI), whose digital arm has raised around $20 billion.
India does not allow foreign investors to control and market their own inventory on their e-commerce platforms, which is seen as giving JioMart and other local players an edge in a key growth market for e-commerce.

Walmart India employees will join the Flipkart Group as part of the deal, Flipkart said.

Sinopharm Chairman Liu Jingzhen told state broadcaster CCTV the company expects to finish late-stage human testing within about three months. 
Sinopharm's unit China National Biotec Group (CNBG), which is responsible for two coronavirus vaccine projects, said in June the shot may not be ready until at least 2021 as a lack of new infections in China made it difficult to find people to test it on.
But China has since found alternative trial sites abroad, overcoming some of the obstacles it faces in the global race to produce a vaccine to fight a pandemic that has killed over 600,000 people globally.
Sinopharm's experimental shot has entered a Phase III trial involving around 15,000 participants and two vaccine strains in the United Arab Emirates. 
Another potential vaccine, developed by Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech using a similar technology, has also been given to participants in a Phase III trial in Brazil. 

A vaccine candidate developed by CanSino Biologics Inc and China's military research unit, which appears to be safe and induced immune responses in most subjects in a closely-watched mid-stage study, is also looking for opportunities to run a Phase III trial outside China.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian investigator who helped bring criminal cartel charges against  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) departed from correct process by sending sensitive documents to his personal email address, a colleague told a court on Thursday.
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) enforcement director Michael Taylor should not have sent draft witness statements to his personal email account and saved sensitive documents on USB sticks so he could work on the investigation at home, said Leah Won, a senior staffer at the regulator.
The disclosure in a pre-trial hearing underscores a key line of defence against the country's biggest white collar criminal case: the investment banks want to show the evidence used to charge them was tainted by departure from due process.
The banks and their former staffers are charged with colluding during a A$2.5 billion ($1.8 billion) 2015 stock issue to withhold unsold shares and keep the stock from falling. Their client, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ), is also defending the case.
The matter is being closely watched by financial markets participants around the world because it could influence how capital raisings are conducted.
Won, the ACCC's general manager of financial services competition, was asked if Taylor had acted within the regulator's own guidelines when he sent draft witness statements to his personal email address to review at home.
""No, I don't think that should have occurred,"" Won told the court. ""It's a secure network and your home internet is not secure.""
Accessing investigation documents stored on a USB stick through a home computer would also be a departure from ACCC guidelines, Won said.
The ACCC declined to comment. In previous hearings, Taylor has denied departing from due process.

The hearing continues.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening cautiously higher Thursday, helped by an increase in German consumer confidence but held back by fraught Sino-U.S. tensions while coronavirus cases continue to mount.
At 2:15 AM ET (0615 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.3%, while CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.7%.
Germany's Gfk consumer confidence survey came in better than expected earlier Thursday, suggesting that Europe's largest economy is slowly recovering from the coronavirus pandemic.
The forward-looking consumer sentiment index rose to -0.3 in August, better than the -5 expected and the -9.6 seen in July. It has gained almost 23 points since its low of minus 23.1 points in May.
""There is no doubt that the reduction in value-added tax has contributed to the extremely positive progress,"" said Rolf Buerkl, consumer expert at GfK, explaining that consumers are looking to make major purchases earlier than planned, which will help boost spending this year.
However, stock market gains may be limited by rising tensions between Washington and Beijing after the United States ordered the closure of China's consulate in Houston amid accusations of spying.
The two largest economies in the world have been at loggerheads for months now, over such matters as the origin of the Covid-19 outbreak, the legal clampdown on Hong Kong and China’s ambitions in the South China sea.
At the same time, the coronavirus continues to ravage its way across the U.S., the globe’s economic driver. 
California has now overtaken New York, the original epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., as the worst-hit state for cases, according to a Reuters tally. Total cases in the most populous U.S. state rose by 12,112 on Wednesday, the biggest single-day increase since the pandemic started.

Some investors warn that the tensions will continue to worsen between the two countries over other issues such as trade and Hong Kong’s national security law.
“The escalation in U.S.-China tensions is a reminder of the headline risk faced by investors during the upcoming U.S. election campaign,” Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at AxiCorp, told Bloomberg.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - More than half of U.S. companies surveyed by benefits company Mercer are starting COVID-19 contact tracing programs in their workplace with employees venturing back to offices even as new cases soar nationally.
Countries such as South Korea have managed to contain the disease in part by tracking down and isolating everyone who has been in contact with an infected person.
But the premature reopening of many states' economies that led to huge spikes in COVID-19 cases, testing delays, and a shortage of trained contact tracers have stymied tracking efforts in the United States.
The lack of a coordinated federal effort that has left U.S. states to manage all aspects of contact tracing has also contributed to the need for large companies to take matters into their own hands.
Of the more than 300 companies that took part in the survey, 54% are planning to implement a contact tracing program or had already started one, Mercer said.
Among those who responded, the survey found that 42% of companies said they are using existing employees to do contact tracing and 9% are training employees now. In addition, about 4% said they will be hiring more staff and/or a vendor for their contact-tracing efforts, and about 3% plan to use a smart phone app or wearable device to track employee contacts.
""Time is really, really important here given how this virus spreads exponentially,"" Mercer health practice co-leader David Zieg said.
Employers are stepping up as U.S. public health agencies struggle to keep up with new cases.
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TRACERS NEEDED
COVID-19 has claimed the lives of more than 142,000 Americans, and infections rates, hospitalizations and deaths are all on the rise again in many U.S. states, forcing President Donald Trump on Tuesday to finally acknowledge the crisis could get worse before it improves.
It has been estimated that hundreds of thousands of contact tracers would be needed in the United States to track down those exposed to the virus and garner the kind of results seen in South Korea and elsewhere. NPR surveyed all 50 states in June and found that about 37,000 contact tracers had been hired. 
Many states reopened without reaching benchmarks for doing so safely, such as two weeks of declining COVID-19 cases and having adequate contact tracing in place. Long delays in getting back test results has added to the problems.
California, the most populous U.S. state, is averaging more than 9,000 new cases per day and has had to reclose some businesses. It has trained about 3,600 state workers to do contact tracing, about one-third of whom have been deployed with another 300 to be added this week, a California Department of Health spokeswoman said on Wednesday.
In workplace tracing programs, Zieg said, employers should move quickly to interview the potentially infected employee by phone to determine close contacts in the office, notify the other employees about their exposure, and ask them to self-quarantine, even if the employee does not yet have test results.
The employer should also reach out to local public health authorities for more guidance as needed, he said.
U.S. companies closed their workplaces to all but essential staff in March due to the global pandemic.
While most states have since begun reopening businesses, many workers have not yet returned to their offices. For those who have, workplace safety measures include a combination of temperature checks, face covering and social distancing. 
Contact tracing combined with other safe workplace practices can reduce workplace transmission by 85%, according to Neal Mills, chief medical officer at healthcare benefits group Aon (NYSE:AON).
Having contact tracers in place can help bring workers back into the office by reassuring them that all possible safety precautions have been put in place, Mills said. 

""They have to have these contact tracing pieces ready to go right now since the public health agencies might not be ready,"" Mills said.

Nvidia and SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Arm declined to comment on the report.
SoftBank, which acquired Arm for $32 billion in 2016, is exploring options including a full or partial sale or a public offering of the British chip designer, the Wall Street Journal reported last week.
The Japanese conglomerate had recently approached Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to gauge its interest but the latter is not planning to pursue a bid, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. 
Arm's licensing operation would fit poorly with Apple's hardware and software focused business model and there may also be regulatory concerns about Apple owning a key licensee that supplies so many rivals, according to the report. Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
SoftBank last month unveiled a series of transactions to divest more than $21 billion worth of stock in U.S. wireless carrier T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc, as it seeks funding for a $41 billion share buyback and debt reduction plan.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) on Wednesday posted a second-quarter profit as cost cuts and strong deliveries helped offset coronavirus-related factory shutdowns, sending its stock up 4.4% in after-hours trading and clearing a hurdle that could lead to the electric carmaker's inclusion in the S&P 500 index (SPX).
Tesla said it earned net income of $104 million from April to June, or $0.50 per share, marking the first time the company has posted a profit for four straight quarters, a condition for it to be considered for the stock index of the largest U.S. companies. (See graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/3hw2RwV)
The performance is a major accomplishment for Chief Executive Elon Musk, whose mission of leading the global auto industry into an electric future has frequently been questioned by investors who doubted Tesla's viability.
Its shares have gained more than 500% over the past year. Many analysts believe the rally has been fueled in part by expectations of Tesla's imminent inclusion in the stock index, which would unleash a flood of demand for shares.
Musk on a conference call on Wednesday said Tesla would prioritize growth over profit going forward and focus on making its vehicles more affordable.
""The thing that bugs me most right now is that our cars are not affordable enough, we need to fix that,"" Musk said on the call. ""I think we just want to be like slightly profitable and maximize growth and make the cars as affordable as possible.""
The price of a Model 3 sedan, its most popular vehicle, starts at $37,990 in the United States.
Musk also announced that Travis County, Texas, which includes Austin, would be the site of Tesla's new factory. The area had been competing with Tulsa, Oklahoma, for the new plant, which promises to create at least 5,000 jobs.
Musk said the factory would produce Model 3 and Model Y vehicles for the Eastern United States, as well as a new semi-truck called the Tesla Semi and the carmaker's futuristic Cybertruck.
Tesla on Wednesday affirmed its goal to deliver at least half a million vehicles by the end of 2020 despite production interruptions, including the shutting of its California factory for nearly six weeks of the quarter on orders of local authorities. The company delivered more than 90,000 vehicles in the second quarter, surpassing analyst expectations.
""While achieving this goal has become more difficult, delivering half a million vehicles in 2020 remains our target,"" the company said.
Musk said on Wednesday's call that the real limitation to Tesla's growth is battery cell production at an affordable price, and said the company would expand its business with Panasonic Corp (T:6752) and China's Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) (SZ:300750).
Tesla will introduce new low-cost, long-life batteries in its Model 3 sedan in China later this year or early next, Reuters reported previously.
Tesla's second-quarter revenue fell to $6.04 billion from $6.35 billion a year earlier, but surpassed analyst expectations for revenue of $5.37 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Tesla reported $5.18 billion in second-quarter automotive revenue, but its share of income from regulatory credits - payments the company receives from other carmakers to offset emissions - increased to $428 million from $354 million in the first quarter.
That revenue could dry up as more manufacturers develop and sell electric cars, but many rivals are still focused on reaping the high profit margins from fuel-guzzling trucks and SUVs.
""Right now in the EV market, it's Tesla's world and everyone else is paying rent, a dynamic shown front and center this quarter,"" Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst, said in a note.
Tesla's rapid rise to become the world's most valuable carmaker could mark the start of a new era for the global auto industry, defined by a Silicon Valley approach to software that is overtaking old-school manufacturing know-how.
The company said higher income from those regulatory credits in combination with temporary employee salary cuts during the pandemic and $48 million in deferred revenue from its yet-to-be-released self-driving feature offset the cost of factory shutdowns.

Musk on Tuesday qualified for a payout worth an unprecedented $2.1 billion, his second jackpot since May from the electric car maker following its massive stock surge.

The 2,000-acre site on the Colorado River is about 13 minutes from downtown Austin, Musk said during Tesla's second-quarter earnings call.
""It's going to be an ecological paradise ... open to the public,"" he said.
Musk said Tesla would consider site runner-up Tulsa, Oklahoma, for future production.
Musk and his team met earlier this month with officials in both states, which were competing to land the plant.
Tesla's new Cybertruck and its heavy-duty Semi truck, as well as the Model 3 and Model Y cars for eastern North America, will be built at the Texas plant, Musk said Wednesday.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott welcomed the news. ""Tesla is one of the most exciting and innovative companies in the world, and we are proud to welcome its team to the State of Texas,"" he said in a statement.
Oklahoma's secretary of commerce, Sean Kouplen, in a statement said the state would actively pursue Tesla's supplier base to persuade them to locate in Oklahoma.
Both states offered hefty incentive packages, including tens of millions of dollars in tax breaks, in efforts to woo what is now the world's most valuable automaker, as measured by stock market capitalization. 

Tesla told Texas officials the plant would create at least 5,000 jobs, while Oklahoma officials were told about the creation of at least 7,000 jobs in the near term and up to 20,000 positions down the line.

(Reuters) - Home rental startup Airbnb has been approached about going public through a merger with a blank-check acquisition company, a novel way of listing on the stock market that is gaining traction, co-founder and chief executive Brian Chesky said on Wednesday.
“We've been approached by some people that have presented us some opportunities,” Chesky said in an interview at a Reuters Newsmaker event when asked about whether he considered using a so-called special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). “We're looking at everything. So I probably shouldn't speculate too much on it.”
A SPAC is a shell company that uses IPO proceeds and debt to acquire another company, typically within two years. Investors are not notified in advance what the SPAC will buy. SPACs have emerged as a quick route to the stock market for companies concerned about the lengthy IPO process.
Airbnb had been preparing to file to go public as the coronavirus pandemic hit, causing business to plummet by 80% in six weeks, Chesky said. “We had to put it on the shelf a little bit because we had a bit of fire-fighting to do. We've now kind of dusted that off. And we're back to working and being prepared.”
Chesky declined to talk about the IPO timing or valuation. Airbnb has also considered going public via direct listing, a process whereby no new shares are sold but existing investors can sell stock.

In April Airbnb raised $2 billion in two rounds of debt from investors. One of the deals included warrants that can be exercised at an $18 billion valuation. That is below the $26 billion Airbnb cited as an internal valuation in early March and much less than the $31 billion valuation from its 2017 fundraising round.

1068,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 05:18PM ET</span>",Jack Ma Is Telling China’s Startup Founders It’s Time to Go Public,"(Bloomberg) -- Jack Ma’s timing is frequently spot-on. Now, he’s signaling to a host of Chinese startups it’s time to race ahead with multi-billion-dollar stock sales before the coronavirus pandemic or trade war does more damage to the global economy.
Ant Group, Ma’s financial services juggernaut, is seeking to raise about $10 billion in Hong Kong and potentially more in Shanghai for its initial public offering. That decision is likely to encourage smaller brethren to accelerate their own public debuts, catching markets at multi-year peaks and avoiding longer-term uncertainty. China has birthed more than a hundred startups valued at $1 billion or more in recent years, led by TikTok-parent ByteDance Ltd. and ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing.
“The economy has its own timeline. Right now liquidity is available, but the Chinese and global economies are fraught with risk,” argues Brock Silvers, chief investment officer for Adamas Asset Management Ltd. in Hong Kong. “Everyone thus wants to strike now, while the iron is hot.”
Chinese companies have raised $36 billion of share sales this year in Hong Kong alone and Ant’s IPO is almost certain to push that total past $45 billion. That raises questions over whether the greater China market is deep enough to sustain a flood of listings. Like a summer Hollywood blockbuster steamrolling smaller films, Ant’s enormous undertaking threatens to overshadow even the largest would-be debutantes.
Bankers and investors say there’s no lack of eager buyers, at least for now. Ant is riding a swell of interest in the world’s No. 2 economy, which has sprung back faster than anticipated from the pandemic. A series of spectacular summer debuts -- chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. tripled on opening day -- demonstrate there’s ample money chasing outsized returns in an era of highly volatile markets.
At least a dozen corporations are seeking to tap the well: Chinese search leader Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). and Ctrip are said to be exploring secondary listings in Hong Kong. ByteDance, owner of viral video sensation TikTok, is a possible contender. Local media report Didi is about to kickstart its own IPO process in Hong Kong, though a spokeswoman denied that Wednesday. UBS estimates 42 U.S.-traded Chinese firms are qualified to list in Hong Kong over the next 12 months and could raise an estimated $27 billion assuming a 5% float.
Ant will be the largest of that cohort, a potentially $200 billion-plus first-timer that’s likely to dwarf all peers apart from major backer  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and arch-foe Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. Depending on when Ant floats -- it could be a matter of months if everything goes smoothly -- some may seek to get in ahead of the financial services titan or make sure they debut well after liquidity loosens again.
“With China being the only major economy to offer clear growth prospects, the appetite for China related securities will only increase,” said Andy Mok, senior research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization. “Despite the large size of the Ant IPO, the pool of liquidity seeking acceptable returns is even larger.”
Hong Kong and Shanghai have become red-hot IPO destinations in 2020, hosting household names from JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. to SMIC in a span of months. China’s biggest corporations are selling stock closer to home after a proposed U.S. bill threatened to force its companies to delist from New York by imposing stricter disclosure requirements -- - a prospect that looks increasingly plausible as the Trump administration amps up action against its geopolitical rival. That will only contribute to the impending deluge.
Ant’s float will create other unwelcome ripple effects. Share sales from Meituan, JD.com and Netease Inc. have all strained available capital and triggered consequent spikes in the Hong Kong dollar. Demand for the currency had already begun to swell Tuesday -- before Ant has even had a chance to pin down a timeframe.
“There could be liquidity pressure in the short term,” said Julia Pan, a Shanghai-based analyst with UOB Kay Hian. “It’s likely for example that people will sell some of their shares in Alibaba to buy Ant.”
There’re signs the city may not be fully equipped to handle the deluge. Since last year’s $13 billion secondary listing, Alibaba’s Hong Kong stock has drawn just a fraction of the trading activity it typically generates in New York, partly due to a local stamp duty that curbs high frequency trading. While the city led the world in listings last year, volume on the exchange is just about a quarter of its U.S. peers in dollar terms.
Longer term, a growing roster of bona fide tech giants can only benefit the city’s exchange, diversifying its investment base while finally helping it fulfill its ambition of becoming the go-to destination for a new generation of technology enterprises. The Hong Kong exchange is now pushing out a series of efforts to increase liquidity and turnover.
“While there might be liquidity pressure in the short term when Ant lists, it’s a good thing for Hong Kong in the longer run,” said Hong Kong-based Bernstein analyst David Dai.

Investing.com - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on Wednesday reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that markedly beat analysts' forecasts and the electric automaker said it was on target to exceed 500,000 annual deliveries despite recent production interruptions.
Tesla shares gained 5% in after-hours trade following the report.
Tesla announced earnings per share of $2.18 on revenue of $6.04B. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $-0.19 on revenue of $5B.
""Our profit improved sequentially due to fundamental operational improvements. Additionally, we experienced costs associated with factory shutdowns, which were offset by actions taken during the quarter to reduce expenses,"" Tesla said.
The company, however, saw revenue decline in its core automotive business, though a 21% rise in regulatory credit kept downside momentum in check.
Automotive revenue fell 4% to $5.2bn for the quarter year-on-year as deliveries fell 5% for the quarter from a year earlier.
Model 3/Y deliveries rose 3% to 80,277 3% and Model S/X deliveries fell 40% for the quarter from a year earlier.
Looking ahead, the company said it had the capacity installed to exceed 500,000 vehicle deliveries this year, despite recent production interruptions. ""While achieving this goal has become more difficult, delivering half a million vehicles in 2020 remains our target,"" it added. ""We should have sufficient liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long-term capacity expansion plans and other expenses.""
Tesla also said it remained on track to roll out deliveries of its Model Y at its Gigafactories in Berlin and China in the new year.
""We are continuing to build capacity for Model Y at Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Shanghai, and we remain on track to start deliveries of these vehicles from both locations in 2021. The next US Gigafactory site has been selected and preparations are underway. Tesla Semi deliveries will also begin in 2021. We continue to significantly invest in our product roadmap.""
Tesla has notched four consecutive quarters of profit, paving the way for its inclusion in the S&P 500. 
""Tesla has come up with a strong set of numbers, far exceeding analysts’ expectations for the second-quarter. Going forward, Tesla continues to remain optimistic about its targets, including the start of Model Y deliveries at both Shanghai and its Berlin Gigafactory which is under construction,"" Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said. ""These are quite bullish signals and provide justification for the stock's powerful rally this this year.""
Tesla shares are up 280% from the beginning of the year, still down 11.32% from its 52 week high of $1,793.02 set on July 13. They are outperforming the Nasdaq which is up 19.32% from the start of the year.

1071,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 04:31PM ET</span>","U.S. to pay Pfizer, BioNTech $1.95 billion for COVID-19 vaccine","By Michael Erman and Ankur Banerjee
(Reuters) - The U.S. government will pay nearly $2 billion to buy enough of a COVID-19 vaccine being developed by  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) and German biotech BioNTech SE (F:22UAy) to innoculate 50 million people if it proves to be safe and effective, the companies said on Wednesday.
The contract for 100 million doses of the vaccine amounts to a $39 price tag for what is likely to be a two-dose course of treatment. 
The contract is the most the United States has agreed to spend on a vaccine, although previous deals with other vaccine makers were intended to also help pay for development costs.
Pfizer and BioNTech will not receive any money from the government unless their vaccine succeeds in large clinical trials and can be successfully manufactured, according to a Pfizer spokeswoman.
Under the agreement, the government would also have an option to procure an additional 500 million doses. Pfizer said the price for the additional doses would be negotiated separately if the U.S. orders them. 
The vaccine, if successful, will be made available to Americans at no cost, although their health insurance may be charged, the U.S. department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said.
Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla has said the company intends to make a profit on the vaccine. He has also said that spending its own money, rather than government money to develop the vaccine should help speed the process.
Pfizer hopes to start its pivotal late-stage trial of the vaccine as early as next week, pending regulatory approvals, Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten said in an interview.
""We're already starting to the process of allocating vaccine vials to a variety of different clinical sites in the U.S. and elsewhere,"" Dolsten said. ""We're looking at the map and getting good advice from the CDC. Where do we have the greatest incidence of COVID-19 disease?""
Vaccine trials are more efficient if conducted in areas where high rates of active infection are prevelant.
The vaccine has already shown promise in early-stage small studies in humans, producing the type of neutralizing antibodies needed to fight the virus. In those trials, subjects received two doses of the vaccine.
The Pfizer/BioNTech candidate is one of the most advanced of over 150 vaccines being developed against COVID-19, which has claimed more than 600,000 lives globally and crippled economies.
The vaccine utilizes the chemical messenger RNA to instruct cells to make proteins that mimic the surface of the coronavirus, which the immune system sees as a foreign invader and mounts an attack. Although the technology has been around for years, there has never been an approved messenger RNA (mRNA)vaccine. 
The Trump administration has agreed to spend billions of dollars for the development and procurement of potential vaccines under its Operation Warp Speed program.
The aim is to produce vaccines that can end the pandemic by protecting billions of people from infection or severe illness, and governments have signed deals with drugmakers to secure supplies of various candidates. Whether any will succeed remains far from clear. 
Other vaccine makers that have signed deals to receive U.S. government funding for their efforts include  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA), AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN) and  Novavax  Inc (O:NVAX). 
Pfizer said it will deliver the doses if the product receives emergency use authorization or U.S. approval as early as October after demonstrating safety and efficacy in a large Phase III clinical trial involving up to 30,000 subjects.
Pfizer and BioNTech currently expect to manufacture up to 100 million doses globally by the end of 2020, and potentially more than 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021, subject to final dose selection from their clinical trial.
On Monday, the companies agreed to supply the United Kingdom with 30 million doses of the vaccine candidate, but did not disclose a price.

Pfizer shares were up nearly 5%, while BioNTech's U.S.-listed shares were up 13%.

1075,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 04:10PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: 3 Things to Watch for July 23,"By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Tensions between the United States and China kept added a more sober tone to Wednesday's trading session, with the Dow rising modestly.
On Tuesday, the U.S. ordered the Chinese consulate in Houston closed, citing national security concerns and prompting retaliation as China said it was considering shuttering the U.S. consulate in Wuhan.
GOP leaders in the Senate on Wednesday were considering extending pandemic unemployment assistance to December at a reduced $400 a week. Politicians have argued against the payments, which are in addition to unemployment for many, as a disincentive to return to work.
A spate of earnings due after the close on Wednesday and before the open on Thursday include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). Thursday features the weekly new unemployment claim numbers.
Here are some things that could affect the market tomorrow:
1. Will Tesla continue to rally?
Tesla shares closed up 1.5% on Wednesday, and rose 6% in after-hours trading, but will they continue their remarkable rise? 
The company reported its fourth consecutive quarterly profit on Wednesday after the closing bell. Analysts tracked by Investing.com had expected a loss of 19 cents a share on revenue of $5 billion.
Shares of the electric car maker have been on an incredible rally, climbing 280% this year.  Short-sellers, who would profit from a decline in the stock, have been circling overhead convinced Tesla is ready for a correction. But now that it has notched its cumulative four quarter profit, it is eligible to join the S&P 500index, an event that tends to boost stocks.
2. Airline earnings highlight travel woes
Southwest Airlines Company (NYSE:LUV) shares fell slightly on Wednesday ahead of earnings in the morning. Analysts have been revising their forecasts amid the overall grim outlook for the airline sector.
Covid-related shutdowns have limited travel, and airlines don't expect that to normalize for several more months. Earlier this week, United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) reported a $1.62 billion loss attributed to the slowdown in air travel because of the coronavirus.
The U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSE:JETS) is down 48.7% this year.
Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect Southwest to report a loss of $2.61 a share on revenue of $920 million.
3. Jobs numbers come out as Senate considers extending unemployment assistance.
Initial unemployment claims for last week and continuing claims will be reported at 8:30AM ET (1230 GMT). The trend has been weekly improvement since the worst of the pandemic produced job losses in March, but tens of millions of Americans are still out of work, with unemployment at a post-World War II high.
On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that the administration and certain GOP Senators were considering an extension to the extra pandemic unemployment benefits they instituted in March to help support the economy amid widespread joblessness.
The timing is crucial because the $600 weekly payments, which often come on top of regular unemployment checks, are due to expire next week. Congress is working to push out another stimulus plan, but it was not clear whether it would be able to push a package through by the end of the month."
1076,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 04:06PM ET</span>",Who still needs the office? U.S. companies start cutting space,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Corporate America is downsizing its real estate footprint as companies allow more employees to work from home, a growing threat to the bottom line of owners of traditional office buildings and a sign that companies are looking for ways to cut costs as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. 
A Reuters analysis of quarterly earnings calls over the past week revealed more than 25 large companies plan to reduce their office space in the year ahead, a move designed to reduce the second-largest expense after payrolls at corporations.
Energy company Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co said it intends to close more than 100 facilities. Financial services company  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT) said it is going to nearly double the workers assigned to one office before adding additional space, based on the assumption that a significant portion of its workforce will continue to work from home even after a vaccine for COVID-19 emerges. Bedding company  Sleep Number  (NASDAQ:SNBR) Corp plans to slow the growth of its total square footage as more consumers shop online. 
""You should expect and hold us to a much lower footprint really starting quite soon,"" State Street Corp's CEO, Ronald Philip O'Hanley, said on the company's July 17 earnings call. 
Regions Financial Corp (NYSE:RF), meanwhile, told analysts: ""Whether through increased use of hoteling, work from home or modified scheduling, we are confident overall office square footage will continue to decline,"" as some workers share desks or stop coming into the building. 
Analysts say the plans to cut back on real estate are likely the first wave of cost-cutting measures to hit office workers as companies try to maintain margins going into what may be a long recession. So far, the majority of the 14.7 million U.S. jobs lost during the pandemic have been in hard-hit areas such as restaurants, travel and retailers. 
Reductions in office spending could likely be followed by layoffs and investments in technology that should help improve productivity with a reduced workforce, said Bill McMahon, chief investment officer of active equity strategies at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW).
""Clearly, we're seeing businesses starting to rationalize their physical plants and at some point they will turn to labor too,"" he said. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in June forecast that work-from-home policies will increase vacancy rates in office buildings. Vacancy rates in New York will reach 10%-12% in the next two to five years from 8.7% now, while San Francisco will reach 7-9% from 5.8%, it predicted. 
So far, concerns about declining office space use have not hurt commercial mortgaged-backed securities, with the iShares CMBS ETF up 4.4% for the year to date.
While companies tend to cut back on their real estate needs during typical recessions, the last four months of economic lockdown have shown that many workers can remain productive at home, said Danny Ismail, an analyst at independent research firm Green Street Advisors. As a result, the cutbacks that companies are making are more likely to be permanent, he said. 
""Every company just went through a mass work-from-home experience and for the majority it was mostly positive,"" he said. 
Green Street Advisors expects that office demand will be reduced by up to 15% as a result of work from home policies once the coronavirus pandemic is contained. 
That reduction in necessary space will most likely hurt real estate investment firms with large exposures in cities such as San Francisco and New York as workers are expected to be given more freedom by employers to live in lower-cost areas away from the coasts, Ismail said.
""Even before COVID-19, you'd seen a migration from majority coastal cities along the Northeast and West Coast to Sun Belt markets,"" he said, referring to the region stretching from Florida to Southern California, collectively known as the Sun Belt. ""We think that will accelerate in the future as the cost of living, quality of life and ability to keep your job is much better in a post-COVID-19 world than before.""

(Corrects to say that office demand will be reduced by up to 15%, instead of that up to 15% of U.S. office workers will likely remain remote, paragraph 13.)

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Digital Colony, a private equity firm backed by U.S. real estate investor Thomas Barrack and Digital Bridge Holdings, has delivered a bid for the mobile unit of bankrupt Brazilian carrier Oi SA (SA:OIBR4), two sources familiar with the matter said.
Focused on investing in digital infrastructure in Canada, Latin America and Europe, Digital Colony is interested in Oi's mobile fixed assets, not necessarily in providing telecom services directly to consumers, the sources said.
Digital Colony could seek partnerships with other telecoms players to provide them with services using its infrastructure if it proceeds with the deal, which could also involve further asset sales down the road, one of the sources said.
The private equity firm, which has some $20 billion in assets under management, is already talking to one such potential partner, Brazil's fifth largest carrier Algar Telecom, about a potential deal, they said.
Digital Colony, which earlier this year was seeking to raise a new multbillion-dollar fund, already owns a Brazilian wireless communications infrastructure provider, named Highline do Brasil.
It is unclear whether Digital Colony delivered a bid for Oi's mobile assets directly or via its Brazilian subsidiary, which the fund acquired in 2019 from Patria Investimentos.
Highline also delivered a binding proposal to acquire Oi's cellular tower unit for 1.08 billion reais ($211.61 million) on Friday. 
Oi received two binding offers for its mobile assets that same day. Besides Digital Colony, existing operators TIM Participacoes (SA:TIMP3), Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) Brasil (SA:VIVT4) and  America Movil  (NYSE:AMX) SAB de CV (MX:AMXL) delivered a joint bid.

The Brazilian carrier set a minimum price of 15 billion reais ($2.94 billion) for its mobile assets. The company intends to use the asset sale proceeds to fund its growing broadband fiber unit and pay off debt as part of its effort to emerge from bankruptcy protection.

Investing.com – Wall Street closed higher on Wednesday as late-buying in tech stocks and strength in defensive stocks boosted investor sentiment and offset rising U.S.-China tensions.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.62%, or 165 points. The S&P 500 gained 0.58 while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.24%.
Tech rebounded from session lows, led by the so-called Fab 5, with the exception Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Bond-proxies such as utilities and real estate were also demand as the hunt for yield intensified amid falling interest rates.
The gains in stocks come even as investors contend with rising U.S.-China trade tensions at a time when the rapid spread of the coronavirus showed little sign of abating.  
The U.S. government ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston citing natural security concerns. In response, China reportedly said it was mulling closing U.S. consulate in Wuhan.
The simmering U.S.-China tensions added a semblance of caution on Wall Street. The number of confirmed U.S. coronavirus cases climbed topped 3.9 million, according to Johns Hopkins data, the most in the world.
The rise in cases has been led by ongoing spread of infection across Texas, Arizona, Florida, and California, which surpassed New York for the most confirmed cases in the country.  
The pace of infections has led some states to reverse recent reopening measures, sparking concerns that the U.S. economic recovery could be somewhat timid.
The latest weekly U.S. petroleum data served to highlight cracks in the economic recovery as crude stockpiles unexpectedly rose, renewing worries about the strength of oil demand.
Oil prices steadied, however, to end the day roughly flat, though did little to spark a turnaround in energy stocks.
Health care was underpinned by rising shares of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Biontech (NASDAQ:BNTX) - which are jointly developing a potential coronavirus vaccine - having secured a $1.95 billion deal from the U.S. government for 100 million doses of their potential coronavirus drug.
The earnings front offered a mixed picture as a few notable names such as  Best Buy  and Snap reported contrasting quarterly results.
Snap (NYSE:SNAP) fell 6.4% after its quarterly earnings and revenue beat were overshadowed by signs of slowing user.
Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) jumped 7.8% after the retailer said sales in the second quarter jumped 255% year-over-year, as the company’s strategy to reposition its business paid off. Still, some on Wall Street warned there could be pain ahead for the electronics retailer.
""Best Buy mitigated the negative impact of the pandemic by making rapid adjustments, but trends will be hard to sustain with high unemployment,"" Wedbush said.
In economic news, the housing market showed little signs of weakness in the wake of rising cases, which have caused some states to roll back reopening measures.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines' chief executive said on Wednesday that lessons learned about preventing the spread of COVID-19, including wearing masks, will underpin a recovery in travel demand and called airplanes ""a uniquely safe environment.""
Chicago-based United (O:UAL) expects revenues, which fell 87% in the second quarter from a year ago, to recover over time to around 50% of 2019 levels and plateau there until a vaccine is widely distributed.
""To get back to that 50% level, I think we're going to have to get people understanding that flying somewhere instead of getting in a car and driving for 13 hours, you're safer actually flying. And I very, very much believe that to be the case,"" CEO Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) told investors.
Airlines say hospital-grade air filtration systems coupled with face masks and better cleaning make air travel safe, despite the coronavirus pandemic that has crushed demand.
United is expanding its mask policy to all of its airport areas across the world starting on July 24 and will ban passengers from flying if they do not comply. 
Kirby believes the airline can reduce its daily cash burn, which reached $40 million in the second quarter, to between $15 million and $20 million in the fourth quarter, but halting it all together will depend on demand -- which he said saw its deepest drop in history in the June quarter -- slowing to a 50% decline.
He said optimism about a recovery near the end of the quarter faded as U.S. COVID-19 cases began surging again, forcing some states to scale back reopening plans.
United flew only a fraction of its normal capacity in the second quarter and expects to fly about 35% of its normal schedule through September.
It sees passenger revenues down by about 83% in the third quarter, versus a 93.5% decline in the second. Before the COVID resurgence, it expected third-quarter revenues to fall less than 80%.
In terms of international passenger revenue, which analyst expect to rebound more slowly and to which United is more exposed than large U.S. peers, the airline believes the worst decline has passed and sees the potential for a quick recovery of its international routes, noting pockets of demand.

United President Brett Hart said there are ""productive discussions"" on U.S. and European airlines' request for a joint U.S.-EU COVID-19 testing program to again allow people to travel between the United States and Europe.

(Reuters) - Canadian convenience store operator  Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc  (TO:ATDb), Japanese peer Seven & i Holdings Co (T:3382) and private equity firm TDR Capital are preparing to submit rival bids this week for Marathon Petroleum Corp's (N:MPC) gas station network Speedway, according to people familiar with the matter. 
It is Marathon's second attempt this year to divest Speedway after negotiations with Seven & i, parent of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, over a $20 billion-plus deal collapsed in March as the novel coronavirus spread in the United States. Speedway could now fetch between $15 billion and $17 billion, amid lower road traffic during the pandemic, the sources said.
Couche-Tard, which has more than 9,400 stores in North America, does not want to pay for the entire deal on its own, according to the sources. It is also seeking a partner that would take on some of the Speedway gas stations and address potential antitrust concerns about a deal, the sources said. 
The Laval, Quebec-based company is in talks to team up with private equity firms, including Cerberus Capital Management LP, the sources added. It is seeking a partner that will take on at least 850 Speedway locations, according to one of the sources.
Couche-Tard has also explored partnering with TDR Capital, owner of the British petrol station operator EG Group, the sources said. But Couche-Tard and TDR could not agree on how to split the Speedway assets, and TDR has now raised financing for an all-cash bid of its own, the sources said. TDR will not attach any antitrust contingencies on its bid, the sources said. 
7‑Eleven operates and franchises more than 70,000 stores in 17 countries, including 11,800 in North America. It is not clear whether its Japanese parent is lining up transactions to address potential antitrust concerns. 
Other smaller companies and buyout firms are in talks about partnering with a larger player on a bid. Murphy USA Inc (N:MUSA), which operates more than 1,400 convenience stores in 26 U.S. states, is considering participating in the auction for Speedway, two of the sources said.
The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Marathon Petroleum, Couche-Tard, TDR Capital and Cerberus declined to comment. Seven & i and Murphy USA did not respond to requests for comment.

If Marathon does not secure a sale of Speedway, it will seek to spin it off to its shareholders. Under pressure from hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, the Findlay, Ohio-based company has said the spin-off would happen by the first quarter of 2021. Speedway comprises more than 3,900 convenience stores.

The Mercedes-Benz maker has boosted its labor-cost savings target to 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) from 1.4 billion euros, said the people, who asked not to be identified because talks with union representatives are still ongoing. The final number of job cuts will be determined by different factors, including acceptance rates of voluntary buyouts and efforts to outsource some IT services.
A Daimler spokesman declined to comment on speculation. Manager Magazin reported earlier Wednesday that Daimler might cut as many as 30,000 jobs. The Stuttgart, Germany-based company has almost 300,000 employees worldwide.
Daimler will give a clearer picture of its earnings performance Thursday, a week after reporting a preliminary second-quarter loss of 1.68 billion euros before interest and taxes. A recovery in vehicle demand late in the second quarter spared the company from losing as much money as analysts were expecting, sending shares climbing to the highest in more than a month.
“The outlook and depth of restructuring will be of equal interest to investors,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Michael Dean and Gillian Davis wrote in a July 17 report looking ahead to Daimler’s full results.
Chief Executive Officer Ola Kallenius said during Daimler’s annual general meeting earlier this month the carmaker must sharpen its expense-cutting efforts to shore up returns. The company is reviewing its global manufacturing network to get rid of excess capacity, which may lead to the sale of a factory in France. It has already halted plans to expand a site in Hungary.

1087,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 02:09PM ET</span>",U.S. Jobs Picture Worsens With Census Survey Showing July Drop,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. labor market’s rebound is increasingly at risk of being cut short after a survey showed employment dropping sharply this month.
The number of employed Americans declined by about 6.7 million from mid-June through mid-July, including a 4.1 million plunge from the first to the second week of July, according to the Census Bureau’s weekly Household Pulse Survey published Wednesday.
While that figure isn’t seasonally adjusted like the main figure in the monthly jobs report, the increase of 5.5 million from mid-May through mid-June -- roughly coinciding with the monthly survey for the Labor Department’s jobs report -- was in line with the reported rise in unadjusted payrolls from June.
The figures add to signs of a worsening employment picture as a coronavirus surge across the South and West forces officials to pause or reverse reopenings, while business closings multiply and lawmakers clash over how to extend aid programs on the verge of expiring. Analysts were already expecting July’s job gains would -- at a minimum -- slow significantly from June’s 4.8 million seasonally adjusted increase.
The Census survey suggests that “the July jobs report could be not only weakened, but even possibly negative,” said Ernie Tedeschi, an Evercore ISI economist who highlighted the data Wednesday on Twitter. “That should give us pause, because it implies that the recovery hasn’t taken hold, and in fact may be reversing right now.”
While the Household Pulse Survey is a relatively new poll, it “did quite well” in predicting the June jobs report, Tedeschi said.
The data also precede Thursday’s release on initial jobless claims, which analysts forecast to be unchanged from the prior week at 1.3 million -- potentially snapping a 15-week streak of declines dating back to early April. Estimates range from 1 million to 1.55 million.
Meanwhile, Kronos, a software and services company that tracks time-clock punches -- and whose data were in line with labor-market pickups in May and June -- said growth in worker shifts has slowed in July. Shifts have risen an average 0.7% so far in July, compared with 1.9% in June, a sign the recovery is plateauing, the firm said in a report.

Former Chief Executive Markus Braun, already a suspect, was re-arrested along with Wirecard's former chief financial officer and chief accounting officer on the strength of testimony from a cooperating witness.
The collapse of the high-flying financial technology company last month exposed a breakdown in oversight. Regulators for years ignored warnings from investigative journalists and market sceptics that Wirecard was inflating revenues and profit.
The political fallout reached Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday as her office said she raised Wirecard's proposed takeover of a Chinese company during a visit last September. Merkel was completely unaware of any serious irregularities at Wirecard at the time, her office said.
The three former executives are suspected of having conspired with others to inflate revenues and its balance sheet by faking business with third-party partners, said Anne Leiding, spokeswoman for the Munich State Prosecutor's Office.
This created a false impression of financial strength that enabled Wirecard subsequently to borrow 3.2 billion euros ($3.7 billion) from banks and investors.
""In reality it was clear, at the latest by the end of 2015, that Wirecard's real business was losing money,"" Leiding told reporters in Munich.
The executives are also suspected of harming investors by overpaying for acquisitions, she said. Interrogations had revealed the existence of a strict hierarchy at Wirecard ""characterised by an esprit de corps and oaths of loyalty"" to Braun as their leader.
Braun, who quit after auditor EY said it could not verify 1.9 billion euros supposedly held in escrow on behalf of the third-party partners, was earlier arrested and released on 5 million euros bail. He has denied wrongdoing.
QUESTIONS IN PARLIAMENT
Prosecutors are now investigating Braun and his suspected accomplices - who were not named - for organised commercial criminal fraud, breach of trust, false accounting and market manipulation.
Burkhard Ley was chief financial officer at the time. His lawyer said Ley was cooperating with the investigation and rejected the allegations against him.
A warrant is out for the arrest of Jan Marsalek, Wirecard's former chief operating officer, reported by investigative website Bellingcat and news magazine Der Spiegel to have fled either to Belarus or Russia.
Wirecard, which was worth $28 billion just two years ago, now has a stock market value of 220 million euros. The 3.2 billion euros it borrowed are now ""in all probability lost"", Leiding said.
Parliament's financial committee will hold an extraordinary hearing next Wednesday to try and find out more about why the German financial and political establishment was so slow to act on reports of financial problems at Wirecard.
The Financial Times published the first of a series of reports alleging accounting fraud at Wirecard in January 2019 yet the German finance ministry has told parliament that it reached out to Beijing in June of that year to inform them about Wirecard's interest in entering the Chinese market.
A senior aide lobbied for the deal to take over Chinese payments company Allscore after Merkel's visit, her office said, but she had no further involvement. Wirecard announced the deal in November.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who oversees financial regulator BaFin, and Economy Minister Peter Altmaier have been called to testify at the closed-door hearing. 

Opposition lawmakers are pressing for a detailed explanation of why officials failed to act earlier on the reports of suspected accounting issues at Wirecard and what political support the company may have received.

1092,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 01:15PM ET</span>",EU to ease market rules to help COVID hit companies: documents,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union will propose ""quick fixes"" to liberalise its capital markets rules in coming days, which it says are aimed at encouraging investment in companies hurt by the coronavirus crisis, EU documents showed on Wednesday.
The package will include looser rules on the funding of broker research into small and medium sized companies and the lifting of restrictions on trading energy derivatives.
Though the immediate impetus is the coronavirus crisis, many of the changes are expected to be permanent, with more changes expected as the EU aims to build a Capital Markets Union and compete with post-Brexit London as a finance hub.
The changes also mirror a string of quick fixes in banking rules to ensure the continued flow of credit to companies and households hit by lockdowns.
""EU member states have been severely affected by the economic crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the draft documents seen by Reuters say. ""This calls for a quick reaction to support capital markets participants.""
One fix to the EU's securities law known as MiFID II seeks to reverse the decline in broker research on small and medium sized companies used by investors such as asset managers.
The cost of such research must be ""unbundled"" or set out separately from other fees brokers charge investors, a requirement that has been blamed for the decline in coverage.
""The Commission therefore expects that an exemption from the unbundling rule for small and mid-cap companies should result in an increase of research coverage for those companies,"" the document said, adding this would cover companies with a market capitalisation of under 1 billion euros.
The EU executive will also propose ""unbundling"" for fixed income instruments, the documents said. Disclosure and documentation requirements will also be eased in some cases.
Widespread curbs or position limits on trading commodities will be largely restricted to agricultural derivatives, to foster ""nascent euro-denominated markets"" in energy derivatives, a sector largely denominated in dollars at present.

There are also proposals to suspend ""best execution"" reports, which show investors if they are getting value for money from brokers, as these are not being read, the EU document said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  First American Financial Corp  (N:FAF), the second largest U.S. title insurer, was charged on Wednesday by New York's top financial regulator with exposing millions of documents with sensitive consumer information, in the regulator's first cybersecurity enforcement case.
The New York State Department of Financial Services said Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, drivers' licenses and other records were exposed from October 2014 to May 2019 because of a known vulnerability in First American's website.
It said First American's cyber defense team discovered the vulnerability in December 2018 by conducting a simulated cyberattack known as a ""penetration test,"" but the company ignored the team's urging that it follow up.
Penalties could be significant, because the regulator considers each instance of exposed personal information a separate violation, with a maximum $1,000 penalty.
First American said on May 24, 2019, that it had fixed the vulnerability, after cybersecurity specialist Brian Krebs wrote that 885 million records dating to 2003 had been exposed. The company's stock price fell 6.3% on the next trading day.
In a statement on Wednesday, First American said it ""strongly disagrees"" with the charges.
The Santa Ana, California-based company said its own probe found only a ""very limited number"" of consumers, none from New York, had personal information accessed without permission, and otherwise found no evidence of misuse.
""We intend to vigorously defend ourselves against the department's unreasonable charges,"" it said.
The financial services department said First American's own review found more than 350,000 documents had been accessed improperly from June 2018 to May 2019 by automated ""bots"" or ""scraper"" programs.
First American was charged with violating six provisions of the department's cybersecurity regulation, which took effect in March 2017.
It requires that banks and insurers licensed to operate in New York have ""robust"" cybersecurity programs, and monitor them regularly.
A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 26.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft (O:MSFT) may find itself in EU antitrust regulators' crosshairs yet again after U.S. workspace messaging app  Slack Technologies Inc  (N:WORK) complained about the company embedding its workplace chat and video app Teams in its Office product.
Slack said the issue was Microsoft's Teams productivity software, which was introduced in early 2017 to compete with Slack's chat app and others in the fast-growing and lucrative workplace collaboration market.
Slack said on Wednesday that it has filed a complaint against Microsoft with the European Commission.
""What we asking for is Teams be separated from the Office Suite and sold separately with a fair commercial price tag, so it competes on the merits with our products,"" its general counsel David Schellhase told reporters.
The company accused Microsoft of illegally tying its Teams product into its market-dominant Office productivity suite, force installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers.
Microsoft said it look forward to providing information to EU competition enforcers.
""We created Teams to combine the ability to collaborate with the ability to connect via video, because that’s what people want. With COVID19, the market has embraced Teams in record numbers while Slack suffered from its absence of video-conferencing,"" a Microsoft spokeswoman said.
""We’re committed to offering customers not only the best of new innovation, but a wide variety of choice in how they purchase and use the product.""
Videoconference has seen a surge in demand as employees work remotely due to lockdowns aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. Other players include  Zoom Video Communications  (O:ZM), Alphabet's (O:GOOG) Google, Facebook (O:FB) and Cisco (O:CSCO).
Schellhase said it was possible Slack could take its grievance to U.S. antitrust enforcers in future.
""We have not taken similar actions in the U.S. but we are having conversations with relevant U.S. authorities as well,"" he said. 

The Commission, which has fined Microsoft a total 2.2 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in a decade-long investigation involving tying cases and other practices, confirmed receipt of the complaint, saying that it would assess it under its standard procedures.

1096,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 12:36PM ET</span>",Distress Mounts in U.S. Property Market Frozen by Pandemic,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. commercial real estate market is showing ever greater signs of stress, but there are still few deals to be had.
Transactions fell 68% in the second quarter across all property types compared with 2019 as potential buyers and sellers remained far apart on the prices of buildings, according to data released Wednesday by Real Capital Analytics.
The paralysis set in despite near-record amounts of capital ready to be deployed by some of the world’s biggest real estate investors.
“The buyer and seller expectations are not aligned,” said Simon Mallinson, an executive managing director at RCA. “Sellers aren’t being forced to the market because there’s no realized distress and buyers are sitting on the sidelines thinking there’s going to be distress.”
Industrial Strength
Second-quarter sales plunged 70% for apartments, 71% for offices, 73% for retail and 91% for hotels, according to RCA. Industrial property transactions were a brighter spot. Sales dropped only 50% in the second quarter, as online shopping thrived and manufacturers leased space to avoid supply chain disruptions.
For markets to function, there needs to be some agreement on what assets are worth. But the surging coronavirus outbreak is fueling uncertainty, making the outlook for commercial property just as cloudy as it was in March when lockdowns put the economy into deep freeze.
Dry Powder
Whether investors will come off the sidelines any time soon remains to be seen. Private real estate funds had about $273 billion for property purchases at the end of June, little changed from the record $281 billion six months earlier, according to Preqin Ltd.
Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Abandons $20 Million Deposit on Scrapped Office Deal
With the economic fallout from the pandemic mounting, deals have fallen apart or are being reworked. The buyer of the iconic Transamerica pyramid in San Francisco is going forward with its deal -- but at a 10% price cut from what it negotiated at the beginning of the year, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private talks.
A spokesperson for Transamerica said the parties are moving toward a closing, and declined to share additional details.
San Francisco’s Transamerica Tower Selling to NYC Developer
More than $32 billion of hotel and retail real estate was newly distressed in the first half of 2020, as rent delinquencies soared and borrowers missed payments, according to RCA.
Buying Time
Approximately $90 billion more of commercial real estate is “potentially troubled,” RCA reported, meaning it’s in a forbearance plan, suffering rent collection problems or early-stage delinquencies. That includes $14.5 billion for offices and $20 billion for apartments.
Still, delinquent borrowers don’t face pressure to sell yet. Lenders are focused on ways to buy time, delaying distressed property from coming to market, according to Lisa Pendergast, executive director of the CRE Finance Council, a commercial real estate trade group.
“It’s becoming clearer, especially with the resurgence in cases across the country, that a three-month forbearance is not really going to satisfy the situation,” she said. “So there are other things that can be done. A lot of that has to do with loan modifications.”
Cheap Money
Prices have also been propped up by low interest rates. Low borrowing costs mean investors can expect higher returns on real estate than Treasury bonds, even if vacancy rates rise or tenant delinquencies increase, according to Michael Fascitelli, former chief executive officer of  Vornado Realty  Trust (NYSE:VNO).
“The cost of money is one of the biggest costs of an asset for real estate,” Fascitelli said recently.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) shares extended their rally on Wednesday ahead of a quarterly report from the electric car maker that might clear the way for it to join the S&P 500 and attract over $40 billion in new demand for the stock.
Investors watching the company's quarterly report after the bell will be laser-focused on one question: Was Tesla profitable? 
A net profit, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, would mark four consecutive profitable quarters, a first for Tesla and a key hurdle for it to be added to the benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX). 
While analysts on average expect a loss, estimates improved after Tesla reported higher-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries earlier this month, helping push the stock up about more than 47% so far in July. Tesla shares were last up 1.5% at $1,591.48. 
BofA Global Research raised its Tesla price target to $800 from $500, maintaining its ""underperform"" rating.
""The technical buying ahead of (Tesla's) potential addition to the S&P 500 has added fuel to the run,"" BofA analyst John Murphy wrote in client note. ""However, in our view, the $1,500+ stock price is not supported by fundamentals, with valuation driven largely by momentum and low rates.""
Analysts on average expect a $240 million loss for the quarter, compared with an estimated loss of almost $340 million a month ago, according to Refinitiv. 
With a market capitalization of about $295 billion, Tesla would be among the most valuable companies ever added to the S&P 500, larger than 95% of the index’s existing components. It would have a major impact on investment funds that track the index.
Graphic: Tesla in the S&P 500? - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkpldgxapb/VokA0-tesla-in-the-s-amp-p-500-%20(4).png
An S&P Dow Jones Indices spokeswoman declined to comment about specific changes to the index. Eligible candidates are considered by an index committee that weighs factors including sector balance and size representation. The index committee does not make changes based on a specific timetable. 
Investment funds that replicate the S&P 500 have at least $4.4 trillion of assets, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, and those funds would need to buy Tesla shares quickly to avoid errors tracking the index’s performance.
Ivan Cajic, head of index and ETF research at Virtu Financial (NASDAQ:VIRT), estimated index managers would need to own roughly 25 million Tesla shares, currently worth about $40 billion.
Additionally, actively managed investment funds that benchmark their performance to the S&P 500 would be forced to decide whether to buy Tesla shares. Such funds manage trillions of dollars in additional assets.

Tesla is among the most loved - and hated - stocks on Wall Street. It has surged about 500% in the past year and is the U.S. stock market's most shorted stock, currently at $20 billion, according to S3 Partners.

1099,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 12:05PM ET</span>",U.S. markets watchdog finalizes rules on shareholder voting advice,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator on Wednesday voted to finalize new restrictions on firms that advise investors on how they should vote in corporate elections, following a years-long battle between corporate lobbyists and governance activists over the proposed rules. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission did, however, walk back the most contentious part of its November 2019 proposal https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sec-proxyadvisers/u-s-sec-proposes-rules-that-could-limit-shareholder-voices-idUSKBN1XF1YN, which would have required such proxy advisers to give companies five days to vet their reports, agency officials told Reuters. That proposal had been fiercely opposed by powerful hedge fund investors including major Republican donors, Reuters reported.
Wednesday's final 3-1 vote on the rule instead requires proxy advisers, which frequently issue voting recommendations on contentious issues like executive compensation and environmental measures, to let companies see the reports at the same time as its shareholders, two agency officials said. 
""Prior review is not required,"" an SEC official told Reuters of the new rules. ""The agency's aim is to give flexibility to issuers and proxy advisory firms.""
Corporate groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers had lobbied hard to rein in proxy advisers, which they say have too much power over the shareholder voting process and make often make mistakes in their company reports. They also say proxy advisers are sometimes conflicted because they frequently provide other services to the companies on which they issue voting recommendations.
The SEC measure also requires proxy advisers to disclose potential conflicts of interest in their proxy voting advice or in the electronic medium used to deliver the advice.
Republican Commissioner Elad Roisman, a key proponent of the SEC's revision of these rules, said ""these changes offer a tailored approach for updating our () proxy rules in a way that minimizes disruption to current operations of significant market participants and reaffirms existing duties."" 
Even so, corporate governance activists and proxy advisers will likely celebrate Wednesday's final rule as a victory for American shareholders.
""The final rules have been adjusted from the proposal in response to public outcry,"" said Democratic SEC Commissioner Allison Lee, adding that Wednesday's rule still adds complexity and cost into the proxy voting system without necessary justification.
""The release still wholly fails to explain how amplifying the views of issuers will improve the substance of proxy voting recommendations.""

(Reuters) - Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd  units rose 5.5% in their debut on Wednesday after the company backed by billionaire investor William Ackman raised $4 billion in the biggest IPO by a special purpose acquisition firm.
The company sold 200 million units at $20 each in the initial public offering, and they opened at $21.10 on the New York Stock Exchange, a larger first-day trading pop than typical for a SPAC listing. 
""We believe we can make an advantageous deal for our shareholders, really bringing a great opportunity for a company to accelerate its growth, deleverage the balance sheet, and provide capital for investors seeking to make an exit,"" Ackman told CNBC on Wednesday.
Ackman has said he was looking to buy a ""mature unicorn"", which has chosen to remain private due to limited pressure from their investors for liquidity until now. 
In addition to the money raised in the IPO, the SPAC also entered into a forward purchase agreement with Ackman's Pershing Square Funds for a minimum of $1 billion units, each comprising one Class A share and one-third of one redeemable warrant, at a price of $20 per unit.
The forward purchaser, which includes three funds owned by Pershing Square Capital Management, has the right to buy up to an additional $2 billion units.
The money raised for a SPAC sits in a trust earning interest until the SPAC manager identifies a company to buy. A SPAC typically acquires within two years of the IPO and investors are not notified in advance of the target. 
Blank check companies have raised $16.2 billion through U.S. IPOs so far in 2020, according to SPAC Research, easily exceeding the record $13.6 billion in 2019.

Ackman's vehicle handily beat out former  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) executive Michael Klein's  Churchill Capital III Corp  (N:CCXX), which raised $1.1 billion, to become the largest ever SPAC.

Investing.com -  Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) is making a comeback. Shares are up 9% to an all-time high after the company reported higher sales -- even with fierce competition from the mighty Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Shares are up about 12% in 2020.
Fiscal quarter-to-date revenue is up 2.5% compared to a year earlier, through July 18. Domestic sales grew 2% and international 8%. Online sales in that time grew 255% from a year earlier, driven by computing, appliances and tablets. From the time stores opened on June 15 through July 18, revenue was up 15% from the previous year. As of June 22nd, almost all stores were open after Covid-related business shutdowns this spring.
Amazon’s net sales increased 26% to $75.5 billion in the first quarter, compared with $59.7 billion in first quarter 2019. Shares are up about 73% this year.
Best Buy releases results on Aug. 25. The company also said it would raise the starting hourly wage for all domestic employees to $15 effective Aug. 2 as a result of strong demand.

Bombardier shares rose 6% in morning trade.
The Canadian corporate aircraft and train maker has pulled its 2020 forecast and announced job cuts as the health crisis pummels demand for high-margin private jets.
The company said it secured a commitment from investment funds and accounts managed by HPS Investment Partners LLC to provide the three-year senior secured term loan.
The loan will provide additional liquidity for working capital as Bombardier realigns its production rates with current market conditions, the company said.
Industry-wide deliveries of corporate jets are forecast to fall this year by at least a third as the coronavirus pandemic kept communities in lockdown and businesses shut, disrupting global travel and slowing economic activity.
In the second quarter, Bombardier expects pro-forma liquidity of about $3.4 billion, and about $1 billion of free cash flow usage. The company will report its second-quarter results on Aug. 6.
As of June 30, Bombardier said it had about $1.7 billion cash on hand and $2.4 billion in liquidity. 
In a note to clients, Desjardins analyst Benoit Porier said he was ""pleased with the better-than-expected"" cash usage and facility.
Bombardier said in May it expects free cash to start to break even or turn positive during the second half of 2020.
The Canadian company is in the midst of selling its rail business to train maker  Alstom  (PA:ALSO), which expects to secure European Union approval by the end of the month.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks edged higher in early trade on Wednesday as investors paused for breath before two of the most important earnings releases of the season, from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)
By 10 AM (1400 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 42 points or 0.2% at 26,882 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite, which hit a fresh record high earlier in the week, was up 0.6%.
Any appetite for further risk-taking at what are already elevated valuations has been kept firmly in check, on the one hand, by the apparent difficulties in crafting another stimulus package to replace many of the support measures that expire at the end of the month, and, on the other, fresh signs of antagonism between the U.S. and China.
The U.S. government has ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, less than a day after indicting two Chinese-based hackers over a decade-long run of theft of U.S. intellectual property.
Various technology stocks succumbed to some early profit-taking after posting quarterly results that were either disappointing, or at least failed to generate fresh buying interest at the current levels. Snap (NYSE:SNAP) stock fell 7% after the owner of the Snapchat social media network said its bump in user growth at the start of coronavirus-led lockdowns petered out sooner than expected. The company also revised down its forecasts for further subscriber growth. 
Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), meanwhile, fell 1%, paring larger premarket losses, after a strong set of quarterly results driven by accelerating demand for chips in all of its major business segments. The stock has still outrun many analysts' 12-month target prices, however, and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and UBS both reiterated their recommendations on Wednesday with price targets between 4% and 9% below the current level.
More positively, Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) stock rose 5.9% after the streaming company announced a new multiyear licensing deal with  Vivendi  's (PA:VIV) Universal Music Group that reinforces its catalog.
And life sciences group Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) stock rose 4.2% after the company reported a healthy rise in both revenue and profit, fueled by some $1.3 billion in Covid-19-related revenue.
On an otherwise light day for data, the growth in U.S. mortgage applications slowed to 4.1% from 5.1% the previous weeks amid signs that refinancing rates are bottoming out after their sharp decline since March. 
Low interest rates have fueled not just a flurry of refinancing, but also a sustained rally in precious metals, with Gold Futures and Silver Futures hitting nine- and seven-year highs in overnight trading, respectively. That drove Pan American Silver (NASDAQ:PAAS) stock another 4.9% higher Wednesday to a nine-year high. It's now more than tripled since bottoming in March."

Engines used by Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Jeep vehicles as well as in CNH Industrial's Iveco trucks have been found to contain potentially illegal engine management software to mask excessive pollution levels, Frankfurt prosecutors said.
The Frankfurt prosecutor's office stopped short of naming Alfa Romeo and Fiat's parent company, Fiat Chrysler, since under German law only individuals, not companies, can be prosecuted. 
The investigation targets nine individuals working at an ""internatioal carmaker"" and seeks to establish their role in putting cars equipped with potentially illegal emissions software on public roads the prosecutor's office said.
A spokesman for FCA said that a number of the group's offices in Europe were visited by investigators in the context of a request for assistance by magistrates in Germany, adding that it was cooperating fully with authorities.
In a similar emailed statement, CNH Industrial confirmed that a number of its offices in Europe have been visited by investigators after a request by German magistrates and that it was cooperating fully with authorities.
FCA and CNH Industrial are both controlled by Exor (OTC:EXXRF), the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family.
Potentially illegal software has been detected in the 1.3 litre Multijet and 1.6 litre Multijet engines used in Alfa Romeo, Jeep and Fiat engines as well as in commercial diesel engines used in Iveco and Fiat commercial vehicles, the prosecutors said.
Although these cars passed pollution tests in a laboratory, the cars used software to largely switch off exhaust emissions filtering while driving on the road, they added.

The investigation, which is coordinated by EU justice agency EUROJUST, focuses on nine individuals living in Italy and their activities between 2014 to 2019, they said.

1108,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 09:09AM ET</span>",ECB Leans Toward Asking Banks to Halt Dividends This Year,"(Bloomberg) -- The European Central Bank is leaning toward asking banks to hold off on dividends at least through the end of the year, putting a damper on investor hopes that payouts could be restarted in the fourth quarter.
Several members of the central bank’s supervisory board don’t yet see enough clarity on the economy to justify that lenders start returning capital again, according to people familiar with the matter. No final decision has been taken, said the people, who asked to remain anonymous as the matter isn’t public.
A spokeswoman for the ECB declined to comment.
Lenders including BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) SA have been lobbying to resume dividend payments as they seek to shore up slumping share prices, Bloomberg reported last month. A historic trading rally, regulatory relief, and extensive government loan guarantees have bolstered earnings at several banks. Switzerland’s UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) on Tuesday indicated that it may return capital to shareholders toward the end of the year.
The 23-member Euro Stoxx Banks Index extended declines, trading down 1.3% as of 2:09 p.m. Shares of BNP Paribas fell 1.6% in Paris.
Heated Topic
A final decision on whether to extend what is effectively a dividend ban will probably be made in the coming days, the people said. Regulators in individual euro-area countries could yet allow smaller banks that aren’t directly supervised by the ECB to make payments, said two of the people. It’s possible banks could pay dividends in shares rather than cash to conserve capital, said one person.
BNP Leads Charge to Pay Dividends as ECB Weighs Virus Impact
The supervisors asked banks in March to conserve capital to weather the pandemic by holding off on dividends at least until October. While the move was painful for some lenders, the central bank indicated it was a trade-off for unprecedented regulatory relief to help them keep up the flow of credit to virus-struck companies.
The subject of dividends was a heated topic on the ECB’s supervisory board, which comprises national regulators as well as ECB-appointed officials, within a wider debate on how quickly to reduce the relief provided to banks, people familiar with the matter have said. Some members said the ECB should take a case-by-case approach to allow the strongest lenders to return some excess capital while others argue that the environment is still too uncertain.
The ECB is aware that forgoing dividends hit bank valuations, according to Andrea Enria, who leads the supervisory board. He said last month that he’s “keen” to see investor payouts resume, but also indicated that the ECB would only give a green light if the economic environment had improved sufficiently.
The ECB says its dividend request kept about 30 billion euros ($35 billion) of capital in the euro-area banking system to absorb losses and lend to companies hit by the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. It has urged banks to comply on a voluntary basis, although Enria has said the ECB can take “legally binding measures” if the lenders don’t do as asked.

(Reuters) -  Baker Hughes  Co (N:BKR) posted its second consecutive quarterly loss on Wednesday and said it would continue to rein in costs in preparation for a longer period of volatility in oil prices.
Oil producers halted the drilling of new wells and drastically cut their budgets following a collapse in crude oil prices in March and April that clipped demand for services offered by Baker Hughes and rivals Schlumberger (N:SLB) and Halliburton (N:HAL).
Revenue from Baker Hughes' oilfield services business, which accounts for about half of total sales, tumbled 26% to $2.41 billion in the second quarter. Total revenue fell 21% to $4.74 billion.
U.S. crude futures (CLc1) were trading around $41 per barrel on Wednesday, at the lower end of what most producers need to be profitable.
Some smaller oilfield service firms have filed for bankruptcy since the oil price crash, including fracker BJ Services, in which Baker Hughes holds a minority interest.
Baker Hughes has cut its 2020 budget by over 20% year-on-year and disclosed plans to exit or shut down non-core product lines, including North American full-service drilling and completions fluids business.
""We are preparing for potential future volatility, while also focusing on structurally reducing our cost base,"" Chief Executive Lorenzo Simonelli said, pointing to the risks from a second wave of coronavirus cases and high unemployment that could lead to economic uncertainty. 
Net loss attributable to the company widened to $201 million, or 31 cents per share, in the second quarter, from a loss of $9 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier.
The quarter included an income-tax gain of $75 million related to the federal pandemic-linked CARES Act for aid and relief.
Excluding charges, Baker Hughes lost 5 cents per share, worse than analysts' average expectation of 1 cent, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Shares were up 1.23% in premarket trading at $16.50, and analysts were generally upbeat about Baker's results.

""Underlying operational results fared (much) better vs consensus expectations,"" wrote analysts for Tudor Pickering Holt & Co in a note.

1111,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 08:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Novavax executives could get big payday even if vaccine fails,"By Ross Kerber and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - One of the leading U.S. firms developing a coronavirus vaccine,  Novavax  Inc (O:NVAX), has awarded executives stock options that could pay out tens of millions of dollars even if its efforts fail.
Novavax CEO Stanley Erck and three other executives would earn the options, worth $101 million at Tuesday’s closing stock price, if the company’s vaccine candidate enters a mid-stage clinical trial - regardless of its eventual success, according to a company filing. The incentive plan, which has not been previously reported, allows the executives to start exercising the options a year after Novavax starts the so-called Phase 2 trial, as it expects to do soon.
Starting the Phase 2 trial is no guarantee the vaccine candidate will make it to market. Novavax would have to successfully complete more extensive Phase 3 trials and win approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The Gaithersburg, Maryland-based company has not brought a vaccine to market in its 33-year history. But its market value has rocketed from $250 million to $8 billion in about five months on news of its coronavirus vaccine prospects. The Trump administration has given Novavax $1.6 billion under its “Operation Warp Speed” program to accelerate coronavirus vaccine development.
Graphic - Novavax shares soar on vaccine prospects: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmopalmxzva/Pasted%20image%201595338421819.png
In a statement to Reuters, Novavax said the stock options were awarded to retain its top talent and recognize their intense effort. “Launching a Phase 2 trial quickly and under these circumstances is a significant achievement,” the company said.
The company did not address why the options were tied to mid-stage trials rather than the vaccine’s ultimate success.
Executive compensation experts and patient advocates said the Novavax options skew incentives for executives by tying a massive payout to a short-term, interim milestone.
“Drug companies like Novavax are getting billions of dollars from taxpayers to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, so it's certainly concerning to see their executives get massive payouts before we know if the vaccine actually works,” said Eli Zupnick, a spokesman for consumer watchdog Patients Over Pharma.
Sanjai Bhagat, a University of Colorado finance professor and an expert on executive pay plans, called the options an example of poor corporate governance and misguided incentive compensation.
“Phase 2 is nice,” he said. “But you want the company focused on the actual vaccine. What investors care about - and what we as general members of society care about - is the long-term success.”
SHIFTING OPTIONS
Stock options have fallen out of favor across corporate America as a way to reward executives amid concerns that they encourage management strategies that promote short-term stock gains at the expense of long-term growth. As a result, equity compensation has been shifting towards share awards that are structured to align executives more closely with their investors and cannot be gamed for a big profit as easily as options.
In the boom-and-bust biotech industry, more companies grant options that vest over time, but few tie them to performance goals, making Novavax’s arrangement unusual. Only seven of 125 U.S. biotech companies had pegged option awards to achieving drug development milestones in 2019 and 2018, according to an analysis conducted for Reuters by ISS Corporate Solutions, the consulting arm of corporate governance consultant Institutional Shareholder Services. 
Executives at another leading vaccine maker,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, have come under scrutiny for regular stock sales that have netted executives tens of millions of dollars since its share value spiked.
Whether Novavax executives reap fortunes from the options remains to be seen. The company’s prospects for selling a coronavirus vaccine should be more clear by the time executives can start exercising the options, which could be shortly more than a year from now, according to the company’s anticipated clinical trial schedule. Novavax has said it expects to start Phase 2 trials soon and enter Phase 3 trials by year end.
While vaccines traditionally could take a decade to develop, many experts expect a much faster process with the current crop of COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Their confidence stems from the effort’s massive scale and new development technologies.
Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said it is “within the realm of possibility” for Novavax or another major developer to have a COVID-19 vaccine fully approved and in use within a year. For that to happen, however, “everything would have to go perfectly” in trials and in regulatory reviews, he said.
If development drags on longer - and stock values stay high - Novavax executives could be in a position to cash in on continuing vaccine hopes regardless of whether it ultimately delivers on them.
HUGE UPSIDE POTENTIAL
Erck’s stock options would be worth $48.6 million if they could be exercised at Novavax’s closing price of $140.69 per share on Tuesday. That would be 20 times his total compensation in 2019 of $2.4 million and much higher than the $25 million received last year by Alex Gorsky, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson, one of the largest U.S. healthcare and consumer products companies and a rival of Novavax in the race for a vaccine.
Even before the stock options were awarded in April, Erck was well positioned to capitalize on the rally in Novavax shares. Erck, who has been CEO since 2011, holds options and other awards totaling roughly $64 million, with $25 million that can be cashed out now, according to an analysis by pay consultant Farient Advisors.
Novavax disclosed in its filings that the awards to its executives were among 2.5 million stock options, currently worth $304 million, granted to all of its employees in April. The company filing did not make clear what performance requirements apply to the options for employees beyond the four executives, and a spokesperson declined to comment. Novavax had 165 full-time employees as of March 6.
At the company’s June 25 annual meeting, 88% of shareholder votes cast supported its executive pay and 82% of votes favored changes allowing Novavax to issue the new options. 
A smaller Novavax shareholder, Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, voted against both of the pay items. Allianz Global analyst Robbie Miles said the executives already had adequate incentives and he would have preferred to reward them based on how Novavax shares perform. He said some investors’ concerns, however, may be alleviated should the company’s coronavirus vaccine succeed.
“If they save humanity,” Miles said, “there may be less focus on the pay construction, for sure.”

""Whilst we're delighted to re-open our doors, we are acutely aware that demand and revenue remain reduced. We anticipate this will be the case for some time to come,"" a company spokeswoman told Reuters.
Travel and leisure businesses have been among the worst hit by the pandemic, with billions of dollars in business trips and holidays cancelled as countries imposed sweeping restrictions.
Whitbread, which has around 1,300 head office employees, said that some of the proposed job losses will be offset with the creation of around 75 new roles and that final numbers will be confirmed in September.
The owner of brands such as Premier Inn, Beefeater, Brewers Fayre and Bar + Block has cut costs, completed a 1 billion pound ($1.27 billion) rights issue and utilised government support to weather the crisis.
The 278-year company said on Wednesday it had no income while its hotels and restaurants were in hibernation, which had a considerable effect on its cash outflow.
Earlier this month, the company said it had opened more than 270 hotels and some 24 restaurants of its more than 1,200 Premier Inn hotels and pubs across the UK. It has also opened all of its hotels in Germany.

The company's shares rose 2.8% before the opening bell as the results allayed investor apprehensions over rising competition to Tecfidera. 
Tecfidera, Biogen's best-selling treatment, generated sales of $1.18 billion in the quarter, ahead of Wall Street estimates of $1.11 billion.
The drug faces increasing competition from newer treatments, including Roche Holding AG's (S:ROG) Ocrevus, and Biogen in June lost a patent dispute with Mylan NV (O:MYL) over Tecfidera. Analysts have said the ruling opens the threat of cheaper rivals in the United States. 
Biogen said on Tuesday the raised forecast does not include any impact from the potential entry of generic versions of Tecfidera in the United States in 2020.
The company, which named a new chief financial officer on Tuesday, now expects 2020 full-year adjusted profit to be between $34 and $36 per share, up from its prior forecast of between $31.50 and $33.50.

Kabbage checking accounts will be issued by partner bank Green Dot (NYSE:GDOT) Bank, a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and are insured up to $250,000, the company said. 
The launch comes as small businesses across the country reel from the economic impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic, which has led many companies to permanently close.
During the pandemic Kabbage has been participating in the Paycheck Protection Program, the government's small business stimulus program, and has issued 225,000 approved loans for nearly $6 billion, it said.
""Since March, we've been focused on delivering these funds to small businesses as the funds can be fully forgiven,"" said Kabbage President Kathryn Petralia. ""We're now the third-largest PPP lender in the nation by application volume.""

Since taking over as Nasdaq's chief in 2017, Adena Friedman has expanded its focus beyond traditional exchange functions to higher-growth opportunities in technology and analytics, while offloading less profitable units. 
Information services, Nasdaq's biggest non-trading business, saw revenue jump nearly 10% to $213 million.
The company also narrowed its forecast for adjusted operating expenses for 2020 to between $1.33 billion and $1.36 billion, from an earlier range between $1.32 billion and $1.37 billion. 
Net income attributable to Nasdaq rose to $241 million, or $1.45 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $174 million, or $1.04 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.54 per share. Analysts expected a profit of $1.45 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Revenue, excluding transaction-based expenses, rose 12% to $699 million.

The airline has been banned from the airspace of the four countries since June 2017 when they cut ties with Qatar over accusations it supports terrorism. Doha denies the charges and says the bloc aims to infringe its sovereignty.
Qatar Airways said the measures specifically targeted the airline and aimed to close its operations in the four countries, destroying the value of its investments and causing damage to its global operations.
The airline is seeking the damages through four investment arbitrations under three treaties, including the Arab Investment Agreement, it said in a statement.
Representatives of the four Arab states could not be immediately reached for comment.
""After more than three years of efforts to resolve the crisis amicably through dialogue yielded no results, we have taken the decision to issue notices of arbitration and pursue all legal remedies to protect our rights and secure full compensation for the violation,"" Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker said.
Because of Qatar's limited airspace and its clash with the Arab bloc, the airline has had to rely on flying over Iran. That has meant longer costlier routes that require more fuel.
Last week, the U.N.'s highest court for disputes between countries sided with Qatar in its legal fight with the Gulf states that imposed an air blockade on Doha.

It confirmed the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has jurisdiction in the airspace row, dismissing appeals by the four Arab states.

1118,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>","Twitter, reeling from hack, faces Wall Street pique on ad revenue","By Katie Paul
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR), bruised by a hack last week that compromised the accounts of high-profile users, may have to account for a different embarrassment when it reports earnings to investors on Thursday: paltry ad revenue.
The social media company said in April that it had sped up work on long-sought tools to attract advertisers, particularly mobile games and other app makers that are continuing to target consumers stuck at home during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Months later, Twitter remains reliant on advertising targeted around big events, which have all but vanished during the pandemic, and it lacks the ""direct response"" ad products preferred by app developers at the level offered by peers.
Wall Street is bracing for Twitter to take a harder hit in the second quarter than other ad-dependent social media competitors like Facebook (O:FB), which is expected to turn a profit despite coronavirus pressures. 
Analysts estimate on average that Twitter's ad sales will decline 19.8% in the second quarter year-over-year, according to Refinitiv data. They expect a loss of nearly $126 million, blowing past the $8 million loss posted in the first quarter.
""Twitter's ad business was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic in March, and it's likely that losses continued into at least part of Q2,"" said eMarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg.
The company had aimed to stem losses this year by slashing costs, although the hack may spoil that plan if it forces costly security investments. Last week, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) warned the incident raised concerns about Twitter's internal security and possible reputational risks for users.
That could bode ill for Chief Executive Jack Dorsey, who fought off an attempt by activist investor Elliott Management to oust him from his job earlier this year by agreeing to growth targets. The deal bought time for Dorsey, who is also CEO of financial tech company Square (N:SQ), to show Elliott he could run two public companies.
Earlier this month, Twitter signaled that new revenue-generating products were on the way. It revealed via a job listing that it had convened a team, code-named Gryphon, to work on building a subscription platform.

It also announced plans to launch a new Application Programming  Interface  (NASDAQ:TILE) (API), a potential boon to the company's data licensing business, which contributes about 15% of its revenue and is growing at a faster clip than ad sales. But Twitter postponed the API's launch after the hack, saying the timing ""no longer made sense or felt right.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open mixed Wednesday, as the earnings season continues amid uncertainty over the scale and timing of the next fiscal stimulus, while tensions with China become even more fraught.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 7 points, or 0.2%, lower, Nasdaq Futures up 28 points, or 0.3%. The Dow Futures contract fell 79 points, or 0.3%.
U.S. policymakers continue to debate a new coronavirus aid bill, but there are now doubts there will be an agreement over its size and scope. Senate Republicans and the Trump administration are reportedly struggling to reach a consensus with each other, let alone with the Democrats who control the House of Representatives. .
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was reported Tuesday to have said that he doesn't expect that the bill would be rolled out within the next two weeks. With Congress set for a recess in August, time is running out for the policymakers to resolve their differences. 
The debate comes amid signs that the economic recovery in the U.S. is levelling off amid a second surge in coronavirus cases. The country recorded over 1,000 deaths within a 24-hour period on Tuesday for the first time since June.

U.S. economic data centers around the existing home sales release, at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT). Sales are expected to have risen in June after falling in May to the lowest level since 2010. 
Oil prices fell Wednesday, weighed by a bigger-than-expected crude inventory build in the United States, suggesting a dent in demand from the world's biggest oil consumer.

1122,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 06:18AM ET</span>",Banks Scramble to Cut Derivatives Losses on Eve of Market Reset,"(Bloomberg) -- They call it the big bang transition, the day when European interest-rate derivatives markets finally shift to a new benchmark next week.
And in the run-up, banks and money managers that find themselves caught on the wrong side of trades are scrambling to limit their losses while their counterparts look to cement their gains.
Nowhere is this tension more evident than in the market for swaptions. That’s because pivoting to the new benchmark -- known as the euro short-term rate, or ESTR -- to help value hundreds of billions of euros of swaption contracts is set to trigger a sudden shift in prices, magnifying in many cases the gains and losses that traders will book.
While a European Central Bank-backed committee has suggested a framework for parties that profit from the change to reimburse those that lose out, it cannot force the market to adopt its methodology, leaving trading partners to iron out their own deals. In the U.S., financial firms are watching for clues ahead of a similar transition planned for October.
The upheaval is all part of the global move away from Libor and other discredited reference rates, which still underpin hundreds of trillions of dollars of assets, from mortgages in the U.S. to syndicated loans in Asia. Clearing houses, in coordination with regulators, are switching to alternative benchmarks in part to help bolster their liquidity.
For traders of centrally-cleared interest-rate swaps, their positions will be automatically adjusted. But because the majority of swaptions are bilateral, non-cleared contracts, they won’t be governed by mandatory compensation rules.
“There are real profit and loss issues,” Priya Misra, head of global rates strategy at TD Securities in New York, said via email. “Any investor who has a positive net present value position should benefit. Whoever is on the other side will lose.”
The ECB began phasing in ESTR in October, and the benchmark will fully replace Eonia, which is still linked to more than 100 trillion euros of financial instruments, in early 2022. Regulators prefer ESTR because of the more robust trading that underpins the benchmark, making it a truer reflection of the cost of capital and less susceptible to corruption.
Similar actions are underway in sterling and dollar markets after rigging scandals engulfed indexes that for many years were bedrocks for the global financial system.
In Europe, the largest banks are already in contact over compensation tied to their swaption portfolios, said Jan Rosam, a partner at Ernst & Young in Germany. He expects talks to drag on until at least the end of next year. The whole market is hoping to avoid a messy dispute, he said.
“Large banks and brokers will start first and then it will cascade down to the buy-side,” he said. “It’s nothing that will be done in a couple of weeks. We’re talking about amending thousands of legal agreements.”
Firms are watching how big U.S. lenders respond and there is uncertainty about what comes next, said an executive at one European bank, who asked not to be named given the sensitivity. If just one major counterparty refuses to cooperate then the voluntary system of compensation could collapse, the person said, adding that the most rational expectation is that nobody pays.
In the meantime, preparations for the benchmark change are accelerating. Fintech company Capitalab has already switched a notional 290 billion euros of its clients’ swaptions from Eonia to ESTR discounting, according to a source familiar with the matter who asked not to be named.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:
“Anything bilateral is open to negotiation -- it’s strictly voluntary so let’s see how much cash compensation happens. Liquidity in ESTR products should increase as more hedging goes through.”
-- Tanvir Sandhu, Chief Global Derivatives Strategist
The ECB declined to comment on the compensation recommendations from its working group except to say they are based on market consensus and lack legal standing.
Across the Atlantic, the U.S. faces similar rancor as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, replaces the effective federal funds rate for discounting cash flows for dollar-based swaps. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee -- convened by the Federal Reserve to guide the Libor transition -- is recommending its own voluntary compensation arrangement ahead of the October shift.
Not everyone is panicking -- hedge funds in particular are keeping a cool head. A portfolio manager at one of the largest macro funds in London said he hasn’t thought much about the problem but doesn’t believe there will be major impact.
The founder of another top fund said the switch won’t create any problems and the market is adapting seamlessly. Pricing around Eonia and ESTR suggests little opportunity for arbitrage, where traders exploit differences in value, he added.
The chief executive officer of a third fund said there could be winners and losers because many legacy swaptions were priced assuming the underlying swap would use the old discounting system.
Banks now face tough decisions. They could resort to ‘cherry picking,’ seeking compensation but refusing to budge where they owe money. Although this might be cost effective, larger institutions will be wary of reputational damage from a public row with their rivals. At the same time, lengthy haggling and identifying which instruments merit compensation may simply be too much to manage.
“Some firms may just say ‘it’s not feasible and we’ll do no compensation and not engage with any of the counterparties,’” said Suzanna Brunton, a managing associate at Linklaters LLP in Paris. “I don’t think that’s an unreasonable response.”

1124,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>",U.S.-Sino tensions hit stocks; gold and silver soar,"By Marc Jones and Tom Westbrook
LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The euro traded at an 18-month high on Wednesday as financial markets continued to bask in the afterglow of the EU recovery fund agreement deal, while a precious metals boom took silver's recent gains to 20% and gold to a nine-year high.
News from China that the United States had told it to close its consulate in Houston caused a bout of risk aversion in European trading, but stock markets had been consolidating anyway after their recent surges. 
Asian stocks had spent most of the day dithering and Europe's morning dip (EU) added to the list of gyrations keeping traders occupied.
Silver  gained 5% to a six-year high of $23 per ounce before profit-taking struck. Gold's  high of $1,865 an ounce took its gains this month to nearly 20%.
The euro was perched above $1.15 (EUR=) for the first time since early 2019, and despite a minor tick up on the Houston headlines the dollar (=USD) was at its lowest against a basket of the main world currencies since March.
""With the U.S. struggling with the pandemic, there is a growing divergence of growth expectations with Europe and Asia Pacific,"" said RBC analyst Alvin Tan.
""We'll keep an eye on what is happening in Houston, but the fact is that in a typical up-cycle for the global economy the dollar tends to underperform, of course"".
China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a regular daily news briefing that the United States had abruptly told Beijing on Tuesday to close its consulate.
""We urge the U.S. to immediately revoke this erroneous decision,"" he said. ""Should it insist on going down this wrong path, China will react with firm countermeasures.""
China's offshore yuan weakened past 7 per dollar on the news and was last at 7.0028 . The dollar index inched up 0.2% from March lows it had hit on Tuesday.
""That headline triggered some profit taking, quite an aggressive one in USDCNY, USDCNH,"" said Christy Tan, head of markets strategy for Asia at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) in Singapore.
""It's a timing issue. All this is coming as tensions between the U.S. and China are escalating. This added fuel to fire,"" she said.
PEDAL TO THE METALS
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) extended its early drop to stand down 1% by 0900 GMT. Commodity-linked stocks (SXPP) along with travel (SXTP) and autos (SXAP) provided the biggest drags with falls of around 2%.
S&P 500 futures (ESc1) were down 0.5% following Tuesday's mixed session on Wall Street, amid concern about rising U.S. coronavirus cases and political disagreement over the next U.S. fiscal aid package.
The United States reported more than 1,000 deaths from COVID-19 on Tuesday, the first time that grim milestone has been passed since June. President Donald Trump warned that things would probably get worse before they got better.
The euro was last at $1.1515 (EUR=) after going as high as 1.1547, its best since January 2019. The Australian dollar  held near a year-high of $0.7144 which was bolstered by upbeat Aussie retail sales data.
Copper prices drooped 1.3% after the Houston headlines . Shanghai  and Dalian iron ore futures  rose for a second straight session on expectations of strong Chinese demand.

Oil prices remained rangebound, hurt by inventory concerns. Brent futures (LCOc1) slipped 0.4% to $44.14 per barrel and U.S. crude fell 0.5% to $41.70 a barrel.

1125,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 05:46AM ET</span>","BHP labels English lawsuit over Brazil dam failure pointless, wasteful","By Kirstin Ridley and Zandi Shabalala
LONDON (Reuters) - Anglo-Australian miner BHP has dismissed as pointless and wasteful a 5 billion pound ($6.3 billion) English lawsuit by 200,000 Brazilian people and groups over the 2015 collapse of a dam that led to Brazil's worst environmental disaster.
Kicking off an eight-day hearing in Manchester, northern England, BHP on Wednesday called for the record group action to be struck out or suspended, alleging it duplicated Brazilian proceedings and victims were already receiving redress.
""These applications are ... brought because the attempt to export and duplicate the work being done in Brazil, including the litigation, to England, is pointless and wasteful,"" BHP said in legal documents.
""It has no proper purpose or utility and will, if allowed to continue, inflict an astonishing burden on the court ... and these parties – without any tangible benefit to the claimants.""
The hearing will establish whether the case can be tried in England, although the judge is expected to reserve judgment until around September. If successful, further trials are expected to determine liability and quantify damages.
The collapse of the Fundao tailings dam, which stored mining waste and is owned by the Samarco joint venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale, killed 19 and poured roughly 40 million cubic metres of mining waste into communities, the Rio Doce river and Atlantic Ocean, 650 km away.
Claimants allege BHP, the world's largest miner by market value, ignored safety warnings as the dam's capacity was repeatedly increased by raising its height - and disregarded cracks that were early signs of rupture.
Many claimants are seeking compensation for physical and psychological injury, property damage, moving costs, loss of earnings, loss of water supply and lost fishing income. 
BHP said the Renova Foundation, a redress scheme set up in 2016 by its Brazilian division, Samarco and Vale, has spent more than 1.3 billion pounds on projects, such as monthly financial aid to about 130 indigenous Krenak families, rebuilding three villages and establishing alternative water supply systems.
It also alleged almost 100,000 of the claimants have already received payments from Renova and only 58 of the individuals, businesses, municipalities, churches, utility companies and indigenous people bringing the claim in England are not part of rival class actions in Brazil.
Claimants allege it is wrong to suggest victims are entitled to full redress in Brazil because Renova lacks independence and its compensation scheme is slow, bureaucratic, inadequate and has not properly involved victims in decision-making.
They allege BHP is responsible for the dam's collapse, liable for its ""catastrophic consequences"" under Brazilian law but that victims have no prospect of proper compensation in Brazil within any reasonable timeframe.
Samarco, Vale and BHP Brasil face a raft of lawsuits in Brazil over the disaster, including a 155 billion reais ($29 billion) class action filed by Brazil's federal prosecutors which, it alleges, overlaps ""almost entirely"" with the English case. 

The Brazilian class action has been suspended, although the parties plan to negotiate a settlement by 2022 at the latest.

News that Washington had ordered China to close a consulate sent equities in Hong Kong sliding, with the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index falling 1.9% at the close, snapping a three-day climb. The yuan also fell, erasing an earlier gain, and government bonds advanced.
The sudden drop Wednesday is a reminder of the way that markets can suddenly tumble on a renewal of tensions between the world’s two biggest economies, a rivalry that already encompasses issues from technology to trade. Investors are now waiting to see how China responds to the U.S. demand to shutter the facility in Houston.
Here’s what market watchers had to say about today’s slide:
Nathan Chow, senior economist at DBS Bank Ltd. Hong Kong Branch
This marks an escalation in the political aspect of the confrontation between China and the U.S. Investors will want to avoid risks in the near term, pressuring risk assets such as the yuan and stocks. However, I don’t expect the negative impacts of this incident to last for a long time, unless Beijing announces major retaliation measures. Considering we will see more similar cases of confrontation, I expect the yuan to end the year a level weaker than 7 per dollar.
Michael Every, head of Asia financial markets research at Rabobank in Hong Kong
This is only the latest escalation in a series that will end up in a crash for relations, for Hong Kong and for the yuan unless something changes. The markets will worry for all of five minutes and then resume rallying -- right up until they realize the China-U.S. dynamic blows everything up eventually. I’m massively bearish in the long term. So enjoy the ride and don’t believe in it for a moment.
Kenny Wen, a strategist at Everbright Sun Hung Kai Co.
People got scared about the U.S. consulate closure. It’s normal to be scared, because there were very little information about this and it’s a very big downside surprise. Investors are worried that this is another sign that the relationship between U.S. and China has worsened. And since there is little information about it, people tend to use this as an excuse to lock in profit.
Banny Lam, head of research at CEB International Investment Corp.
While everyone is well aware of the poor Sino-U.S. relations, nobody wants to see further escalation. Investors are worried the consulate closure could lead to a string of actions. All eyes will be on how both sides react later today.

""There was a lot of buying going into the deal. Now we're going back to focusing on coronavirus cases.""
Meanwhile in Europe, expectations for second-quarter corporate profits have further deteriorated, according to Refinitiv data, as fears grow over the extent of the recession triggered by the pandemic.

1129,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 05:12AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Iberdrola Navigates Bumpy Path to Green Future,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- One of the most popular bets in Europe's stock markets this year has been to buy into a Green future. However, Spain's  Iberdrola  (OTC:IBDRY) showed on Wednesday that there may still be plenty of bumps on the way there.
The renewables specialist, Europe's second-biggest utility after  Enel  (MI:ENEI), did produce a 12% increase in net profit in the first half, but revenue fell and operating margins were compressed as demand in its four key markets slumped, with foreign exchange factors in markets such as the U.K. and Brazil not helping. On the plus side, it was able to cushion falls in wholesale prices with its extensive Spanish distribution business, and with cheaper purchasing from third parties.
The company said it's still on track to invest 10 billion euros this year in growing a worldwide business of renewables, but the rise in renewable energy asset prices across the world means that that 10 billion isn't going to buy as much as once seemed possible. Iberdrola is engaged in a bidding war for Infigen (ASX:IFN), a wind specialist that would bolster its position in Australia, and had to raise its offer by some 4% to A$893 million on Wednesday.
The good news is that the company - and the sector in general - can hardly keep track of all the tailwinds now being whipped up. The sector is poised to be a huge beneficiary of the European Union's 750 billion euro recovery plan, and can also count on the support of the European Central Bank, whose President Christine Lagarde has hinted heavily at wanting to skew the regulatory framework for financing so as to improve the competitive position of renewables. To add to that, the fast-expanding universe of ESG-themed funds ensures that more and more private money is chasing a pool of assets that is not growing as fast. 
Just as importantly, Iberdrola appears to be coping well with the execution risks that its ambitious expansion strategy holds.  The company added 790 megawatts of onshore wind in the U.S. market alone in the first half, and another 225 megawatts in Spain. Overall output from renewables was up almost 19%. While that was helped by a weather-related 51% rise in Spanish hydro output, the company's track record gives reasonable confidence that it can deliver on a massive pipeline of future projects, which includes 12,000 megawatts in offshore wind under development, and options on a further 9,000 MW in Sweden.
No surprise then, that, Iberdrola stock - which a decade ago would have risen and fallen in line with its stodgy Spanish utility business - has risen 25% this year. Its Portuguese neighbor EDP Renovaveis (OTC:EDRVF) has risen 35%, while Danish-based wind farm operator Oersted (CSE:ORSTED) is up 31% and trading at forward multiples that wouldn't seem out of place in Silicon Valley.
Iberdrola (MC:IBE) stock nonetheless took a breather on Wednesday, falling 1.3% in line with the IBEX 35, having hit an all-time high on Tuesday."

LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA) has appointed Franck Lacour as its new head of equities, following the resignation of Hossein Zaimi, according to a staff memo on Wednesday.
Lacour currently serves as head of Markets, France, which he will retain until a successor is named, the memo - signed by Georges Elhedery, Co-CEO Global Banking & Markets - said.
News of Lacour's promotion comes less than a week after Reuters reported the imminent departure of Zaimi, who is leaving HSBC just months after assuming an additional post as co-global head of securities financing in March.
A spokesman for HSBC confirmed the contents of the memo.
The lender is pursuing a massive revamp of its Global Banking & Markets division and is preparing to axe tens of thousands of jobs in an effort to improve returns and compete more strongly against rival investment banks.
Zaimi is expected to remain at HSBC until the end of August to help with a transition period.
In addition, the bank has appointed Selene Chong as deputy global head of equities, and head of equities, Asia Pacific. Chong will be based in Hong Kong.

Mehmet Mazi is also appointed as co-head of securities financing, in addition to his role as head of debt trading and financing, the memo said.

Investing.com - European stock markets drifted lower Wednesday, amid a torrent of earnings while investors wait for the U.S. to agree its latest stimulus package.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 0.6%. 
A day after European leaders signed off on their historic 750 billion-euro ($860 billion) recovery package to revive the countries hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, as well the bloc's next seven-year budget, worth about 1.1 trillion euros, the focus now turns to the ratification process.
“We do not expect the national parliaments to become a hurdle, but the EU parliament may likely be disappointed regarding the size of the final budget,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note. 
Attention is also on the ongoing earnings season, with  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) stock soaring 10% after the home improvement retailer said it expected half-year pretax profit to be ahead of the prior year, as demand bounced back amid an easing of lockdowns.
ABB (SIX:ABBN) stock climbed 2.6% after the Swiss supplier of electrical equipment said it was launching a share buyback program following the completion of the divestment of its Power Grids business to Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY).
On the flip side, French car parts maker  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) stock fell 8.2% after it swung to a massive loss in the first half of 2020, including 622 million euros of restructuring charges, and also warned that it's seeing a slower recovery in Europe than in China and the U.S.
 Melrose  Industries (LON:MRON) slumped over 15% after warning that some job cuts are “inevitable” as revenues plunged 27% in the first half of the year, and suspending its dividend.
In the U.S., uncertainty reigns over the immediate prospects for more financial aid. In addition to major differences between the two main parties, Senate Republicans appear to be at odds both themselves and with the administration over how to craft the package.

1135,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 03:50AM ET</span>",Shanghai's remodeled index still not reliable benchmark for the world's No.2 stock market,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China revamped its Shanghai share index on Wednesday for the first time in 30 years, but critics say the changes don't go far enough to fully address distortions in the benchmark of the world's second biggest stock market. 
In its first overhaul of the Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC), the country's oldest index for mainland-listed A-shares, the Shanghai Stock Exchange added 25 STAR Market-listed tech companies, and removed 91 firms labeled as high-risk by the bourse. The number of index constituents stood at 1,493 on Wednesday.
The move aims to address ""index distortion"", the exchange has said. Between 2009 and 2019, China's annual GDP nearly tripled, but the SSEC - theoretically an economic barometer with a market capitalization of around $5.45 trillion- lost 7%. The blue-chip CSI300 index (CSI300) rose 15% during the period, while Shenzhen's stock benchmark (SZSC) gained 43%. 
""The revamp doesn't live up to its purpose,"" said Liu Wencai，founder of risk-management consultancy D-Union who helped design China's first index futures contracts. ""If you measure the length of a table with a ruler, what's the point of using a ruler that is bent?"" 
But even after the revamp, critics highlight some distortions in the SSEC, noting that it is still based on market value of all shares, rather than tradable stocks only - meaning the benchmark gets skewed by the extent of non-tradable shares in state-owned heavyweights, such as China Construction Bank (SS:601939) and Sinopec (SS:600028).
""For state-owned companies such as banks, tradable shares represent a tiny proportion of the entire capital case,"" said Rocky Fan, economist at Sealand Securities.
Market participants say the index revamp also glosses over deeper issues in Chinese markets, such as a failure to weed out non-viable companies, or prevent bubbles in new stock issues. 
To protect investors, the exchange is expelling from the SSEC ""special treatment"" (ST) shares -- the group of companies that have suffered consecutive years of losses, have unusual financial conditions or have been fined for regulatory violation.
And, to reduce volatility, newly-listed stocks will be included in SSEC one year after their debut, instead of after 11 trading sessions previously. The top 10 companies by size will be included in three months.
Yuan Yuwei, a fund manager at Olympus Hedge Fund Investments, said the measures were like ""burying your head in the sand"". Instead, regulators should focus on strengthening delisting rules, and study ways to prevent ""IPO froth"", he said. 

For institutional investors, the revamp may not matter after all as the SSEC is already fading into irrelevance. Only two Chinese mutual funds track the SSEC, and global investors mostly turn to global index publishers such as MSCI or FTSE Russell.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's banking watchdog plans to update next week a capital return policy that has halted dividend payments by banks because of the coronavirus crisis, offering them capital management flexibility while still urging prudence. 
Three of Australia's four dominant banks, Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ), and National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB) have halted or cut dividend payments worth over A$7 billion ($5 billion).
Wayne Byres, chairman of the Australian Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Regulator Authority (APRA) said the degree of uncertainty over the economy had fallen since April, when the watchdog asked banks to consider deferring dividend payouts.
Capital markets are now functioning in an orderly manner and stress tests indicated banks were ""well-placed"" to withstand any major headwinds as Australia navigates a health and economic crisis with ""no end in sight"", Byres said on Wednesday.
""We will be updating our capital management guidance next week,"" he told a business lobby, the Trans-Tasman Business Circle, in a speech. ""Our goal is to combine ongoing prudence with flexibility.""
That meant capital management decisions had to weigh both an uncertain outlook and the fact that stress scenarios can be overcome without having to resort to cutting business activity, he added.
APRA's stress tests assumed a slow recovery in gross domestic product growth over the three-year horizon, unemployment of about 10% in mid-2021, up from 7.4% in June, and a fall of 30% in property prices.
""We will modify the guidance, and extend it for the remainder of this calendar year, shifting from the immediate, short-term emergency response in April to a setting with a somewhat longer-term outlook,"" Byres added.
While  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) called the comments ""positive"", other analysts said banks were likely to keep dividends halted or subdued in the short term.

These include Commonwealth Bank (AX:CBA), Australia's largest, which is set to unveil its dividend payout on August 12.

1141,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 01:16AM ET</span>",How Tesla defined a new era for the global auto industry,"By Edward Taylor, Norihiko Shirouzu and Joseph White
FRANKFURT/BEIJING/DETROIT (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) rapid rise to become the world's most valuable carmaker could mark the start of a new era for the global auto industry, defined by a Silicon Valley approach to software that is overtaking old-school manufacturing know-how.
Tesla's ascent took many investors by surprise. But executives at  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), the parent company of Mercedes-Benz, had a close-up view starting in 2009 of how Tesla and its chief executive Elon Musk were taking a new approach to building vehicles that challenged the established system.
Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), which bears the name of the man who invented the modern car 134 years ago, bought a nearly 10% Tesla stake in May 2009 in a deal which provided a $50 million lifeline for the struggling start-up.  
That investment gave Mercedes engineers an inside view of how Musk was willing to launch technology that wasn't perfect, and then repeatedly upgrade it, using smartphone style over-the-air updates, paying little regard to early profitability. 
Mercedes engineers helped Tesla develop its Model S luxury sedan in exchange for access to Tesla's partially hand-assembled battery packs, but in 2014 Daimler decided to sell their stake amid doubts Tesla's approach could be industrialized at scale. 
Tesla would go on to pioneer new approaches in manufacturing, designs in software and electronic architecture which enable it to introduce innovations faster than rivals, leaving analysts to draw comparisons with Apple (O:AAPL).
Three people directly involved with the Mercedes side of the collaboration said the brief partnership highlighted the collision of old and new engineering cultures: the German obsession with long-term safety and control, which rewarded evolution, and the Silicon Valley carmaker's experimental approach which embraced radical thinking and fast innovation. 
""Elon Musk has been walking on the edge of a razorblade in terms of the aggression with which he pushes some technologies,"" said a former Mercedes engineer who worked on the partnership.
By contrast, Mercedes and other established automakers are still not comfortable about releasing a new technology, such as partially automated driving, without years of testing. 
Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.
Investors favor the Tesla model, in an industry undergoing fundamental and dizzying change even though the U.S. carmaker will face an onslaught of competing electric vehicles from established automakers during the next few years. 
They are putting their money on Musk and his company, even though Mercedes-Benz alone sold 935,089 cars in the first half of 2020, dwarfing the 179,050 delivered by Tesla in the same period.
Today, Tesla is worth nearly $304.6 billion, more than six times Daimler's 41.5-billion-euro ($47.7 billion) market capitalization. See GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/3fRM9Yu
TWO CULTURES COLLIDE  
Daimler and Tesla began collaborating after Mercedes engineers, who were developing a second-generation electric Smart car, bought a Tesla Roadster. They were impressed by the way Tesla packaged batteries, so arranged a visit to Silicon Valley to meet Musk in January 2009 and ordered 1,000 battery packs.
The collaboration expanded. At a joint press conference in the Mercedes-Benz museum in Stuttgart in May 2009, Tesla said the partnership would ""accelerate bringing our Tesla Model S to production and ensure that it is a superlative vehicle"". 
For its part, Mercedes wanted to use Tesla's batteries to power an electric version of its compact Mercedes-Benz B-Class. The Tesla Model S would hit the road in 2012. An electric B-Class, arrived in showrooms two years later.
Despite having batteries supplied by Tesla, the Mercedes had a shorter operating range after Daimler engineers configured the B-class more conservatively to address their concerns about long-term battery degradation and the risk of overheating, a second Daimler staffer who worked on the joint projects told Reuters.
German engineers found that Tesla engineers had not done long-term stress tests on its battery. ""We had to devise our own programme of stress tests,"" the second Daimler engineer said.
Before starting production of a new car, Daimler engineers specify a ""Lastenheft"" - a blueprint laying out the properties of each component for suppliers. Significant changes cannot be made once the design is frozen.
""This is also the way you can guarantee that we will be profitable during mass production. Tesla was not as concerned about this aspect,"" the second Daimler source said.
Daimler's engineers suggested the underbody of the Model S needed reinforcing to prevent debris from the road puncturing a battery pack, the first Daimler engineer said.
To quash doubts about safety and security, following a series of battery fires, Tesla raised the ride height of its vehicles, using an over-the-air update, and a few months later, in March 2014, said it would add a triple underbody shield to new Model S cars and offered to retrofit existing cars.
Musk was able to make adjustments quickly thanks to Tesla's ability to burn through more cash during development.
""At Mercedes you can make such adjustments every three years at best,"" the engineer said. 
The Model S, a four-door electric sedan would go on to outsell the flagship Mercedes-Benz S-Class in the United States in May 2013, and outstrip S-Class deliveries globally by 2017.
MUSK: INNOVATE OR GO
Musk's relentless focus on innovation explains, in part, why he has disrupted the traditional auto world. In an interview https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp8smJFaKYE at the 2020 Air Warfare Symposium, published on YouTube, he was asked about the importance of innovation among his employees. 
""We certainly need those that do advanced engineering to be innovative,"" Musk said. ""The incentive structure is set up ... such that innovation is rewarded. Making mistakes along the way does not come with a big penalty. But failure to try to innovate at all ... comes with a big penalty. You will be fired.""
Established automakers are playing catch-up to Tesla, designing their own software operating systems and dedicated electric cars. 
Mercedes will release its EQS next year - a four-door limousine built on a dedicated electric vehicle platform, with an operating range of 700 km. A new version of the Mercedes S-Class, which will have combustion and hybrid powertrains and semi-autonomous driver assistance systems, is due this year.
From an investor perspective, traditional players face billions of dollars in restructuring costs as they transform product lines and factories to move away from internal combustion technology
""No one is going to give an OEM (established automaker) a five-year window to say ... you can totally retool your business, and I am going to buy in and fund this journey,"" said Mark Wakefield, co-leader of automotive and industrials practice at consulting firm AlixPartners.
Start-ups, however, get time from investors to learn, make mistakes and grow, he added. 
Investors are betting on Tesla's ability to scale up manufacturing just as they once backed Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), which defined the auto industry's last era with its mastery of highly efficient, high-quality lean production. 
Toyota overtook the market capitalization of former industry leader General Motors  (N:GM) in 1996, though it wasn't until 2008 that it sold more vehicles than its Detroit rival.
The Japanese giant also cultivated ties with Tesla, with the U.S. startup helping it design an electrified RAV4 compact sports utility vehicle under a 2010 deal.
Toyota was impressed by the speed with which Tesla came up with the new design, but ultimately decided Tesla's methods were not suitable for mass production by a mainstream manufacturer when Toyota's standards for product quality and durability were applied, two company insiders familiar with the partnership said.
Toyota said the joint project involved cooperation on the development of electric cars, parts and production system.
""Toyota accomplished what the project set out to achieve, and it ended in October 2014 after Tesla delivered roughly 2,500 electric powertrain systems over three years"" for an electrified RAV4 crossover SUVs, a spokeswoman said.
Both the Toyota and Daimler collaborations were agreed before the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) emissions-cheating scandal in 2015, which prompted a global regulatory backlash and forced carmakers to step up investments in electric cars.

""That was all before dieselgate, which changed the economics of electric and combustion-engined cars,"" a senior Daimler manager said. ""Tesla has a lead. Let's see if they can scale up.""

In a decision on Monday, U.S. District Judge Raag Singhal in Fort Lauderdale, Florida said the seven plaintiffs failed to show that reasonable consumers were deceived into paying higher prices because of Burger King's actual cooking methods.
He said the plaintiffs did not ask about Burger King's cooking method or request an alternative to satisfy their dietary requirements, and that the company's advertising did not promise cooking on a different surface.
""Burger King promised a non-meat patty and delivered,"" Singhal wrote. The judge also found the plaintiffs' claims ""too individualized"" to justify a class action.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment. The plaintiffs can amend most of their claims if they wish.
Burger King is a unit of Toronto-based Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) Inc.
Impossible Foods Inc, which helped create the Impossible Whopper, has said it was designed for meat eaters who want to consume less animal protein, not for vegans or vegetarians.

Listings for five jobs in Singapore on networking website LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) are mainly in servicing and repair, such as a service technician and parts adviser.
It was not clear where in Singapore the new hires would be based, or whether the U.S. automaker currently has any employees in the country.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on its Singapore plans.
Singapore is one of the world's most expensive places to buy a car and has few electric vehicles. It aims to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040, and make a bigger bet on electrification to cut greenhouse gases and slow climate change.
Two years ago, Musk responded to a Tesla admirer in Singapore who asked the executive to make the automaker's vehicles available in the city-state. ""We tried, but Singapore govt is not supportive of electric vehicles,"" Musk tweeted.
Unlike traditional automakers, Tesla prefers to sell its cars directly through its own showrooms.

Local dealership Hong Seh Motors on its website said it is Singapore's only retailer of Tesla cars. It did not respond to an emailed request for comment.

Investing.com – Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways (HK:0293) has lodged a prospectus for a HK$11.7 billion ($1.5094 billion) rights issue with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE).
The issuance is part of a $5 billion bailout from Hong Kong’s government and shareholders, with Cathay likely to tap the equity and debt capital markets further to strengthen its balance sheet.
The issuance comes after Cathay’s announcement that it expects to post a HK$9.9 billion ($1.277 billion) loss for the first six months of 2020, with global air travel slashed amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
The airline said Wednesday that it reduced its monthly cash burn from $3 billion down to HK$1.5 billion, and continues to maintain minimal numbers of flights. But with COVID-19 continuing its rampage globally and uncertainty on when air travel will recover to pre-COVID-19 levels, Cathay warned that its full-year results could be “materially worse.”
The prospectus also said that Cathay would delay the delivery of airplanes due to be delivered by Airbus between 2020 and 2021, which will now be delivered between 2020 and 2025. It is also in advanced talks with Boeing (NYSE:BA) to defer its 777-9 orders.
Although no further details were given as to how many deliveries are now expected per year, a November 2019 investor presentation said that Cathay was expecting delivery of 32 A321neos, 12 A350s and 21 777-9s by 2024.
“This deferral of deliveries is expected to produce cash savings to the Cathay Pacific Group in the short to medium term, ""according to the prospectus.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nominees to Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp's (T:6502) board backed by activist fund Effissimo Capital Management said they plan to talk with investors in a push to convince them that additional directors will help the industrial conglomerate fix compliance issues.
The move comes after Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) and Glass, Lewis & Co decided last week not to side with a proposal by Effissimo, Toshiba's biggest shareholder, to add three directors, arguing that the current management team is relatively new and diverse.
Calling the decision by proxy advisers a surprise, nominees Tadaaki Sugiyama, a former Kao Corp (T:4452) executive and Akira Takeuchi, an attorney, told Reuters they planned to make a more compelling case and have more thorough discussions with Toshiba shareholders.
They also plan to argue their case again with the proxy advisers.
""If we communicate better with investors and fill in the gaps where our message has not yet gotten across then I do think it's quite possible that shareholders will vote opposite to ISS recommendations,"" Sugiyama said in an interview.
Effissimo, a Singapore-based fund with a 15% stake, is citing fictitious transactions Toshiba disclosed this year as evidence that its corporate governance has not made significant progress since a major accounting scandal in 2015.
Toshiba has opposed the move, arguing that 12 board members is sufficient and that one nominee, an Effissimo co-founder, is inappropriate, citing conflicts of interest.
While still reeling from the accounting scandal, Toshiba was then plunged into crisis stemming from the failure of its U.S. nuclear power unit in 2017, prompting it to sell $5.6 billion of stock to dozens of foreign hedge funds.
Foreign shareholders now hold 63% of Toshiba's voting rights while Effissimo and other activist funds hold about 30%. Toshiba added seven independent directors last year at the urging of U.S. hedge fund King Street Capital.

Toshiba's annual meeting is scheduled for July 31.

Twitter, which announced the change on its Twitter Safety page, said it would not serve content and accounts associated with QAnon in trends and recommendations, and would block URLs associated with the group from being shared on the platform. The suspension, which will be rolled out this week, is expected to impact about 150,000 accounts globally, Twitter said. It said that more than 7,000 accounts have been removed in the last several weeks for violating the company's rules against spam, platform manipulation and ban evasion.

The airline said the A350s due to arrive in 2020 and 2021 were now scheduled for 2020-2023 and A321neos expected from 2020-2023 would arrive from 2020-2025. It did not provide further details of the number expected each year.
""This deferral of deliveries is expected to produce cash savings to the Cathay Pacific Group in the short to medium term,"" it said in a prospectus for its HK$11.7 billion ($1.51 billion) rights issue lodged with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
Cathay had expected deliveries of 32 A321neos, 12 A350s and 21 777-9s by 2024, according to a November 2019 investor presentation.
An Airbus spokesman said his company did not comment on delivery schedules for individual airlines. A Boeing spokeswoman said her company did not comment on customer discussions.
Most airlines globally are trying to defer new aircraft deliveries as they grapple with the downturn from the coronavirus pandemic, which has wrecked travel demand.

1149,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 08:26PM ET</span>",United warns travel demand will languish until COVID-19 vaccine,"By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) warned on Tuesday that travel demand will remain suppressed until there is a widely accepted treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, which plunged the carrier to a deep quarterly loss on Tuesday.
Coronavirus infections are surging in the United States, causing some states to scale back reopening plans and reinstate quarantines in a fresh blow to airlines.
United, which is not blocking middle seats, plans to fly about 35% of its 2019 summer schedule in the third quarter and is forecasting a load factor of about 45% in July. Its planes flew about one-third full in the second quarter. 
The setback does not bode well for airline jobs in the fall, when a U.S. government stimulus package expires. To avoid furloughs, airlines have rolled out a number of packages to encourage employees to leave voluntarily.
Chicago-based United said more than 6,000 employees had opted for such packages. But after sending 36,000 notices of potential furloughs earlier this month, that relatively low take-up suggests United might have to furlough a significant number of workers.
Airline unions have urged lawmakers to pass another round of aid through March, but airlines say they are not counting on fresh funds.
Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (N:LUV), which offered cash buyouts, have reported strong employee response for voluntary departures, meaning they could have a less costly workforce on the other side of the crisis since union contracts force airlines to furlough junior workers first.
While early data from trials of three potential COVID-19 vaccines released on Monday was encouraging, it is still far from clear whether the efforts will result in a vaccine capable of ending the global pandemic that has claimed more than 600,000 lives.
With the timing of a recovery uncertain, investor focus has turned to airlines' cash on hand and their ability to pick up demand once it returns.
United had $15.2 billion in liquidity as of July 20 and reiterated its forecast for liquidity to top $18 billion at the end of September as it taps additional capital.
The airline burned through about $40 million per day in the second quarter but sees that amount slowing to roughly $25 million in the third quarter as it matches its flight schedule to demand.
The airline, which is more exposed than peers to harder-hit international travel, reported an adjusted net loss of $2.6 billion for the June quarter, or a $9.31 per-share loss, versus a $4.21 per-share profit a year ago, as revenue dropped 87% to $1.475 billion.
Analysts on average expected a loss of $9.02 per share and revenue of $1.321 billion, according to data from Refinitiv.
Still, United Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said in a statement he believed the quarterly losses and cash burn were lower than large network competitors.
Delta said last week it was burning about $27 million a day in June and July. American Airlines (O:AAL) and Southwest report on Thursday.

Shares of United, which will hold a conference call at 10:30 a.m. EDT on Wednesday, were flat after the bell.

1150,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 08:09PM ET</span>",A Bullish Alibaba Will Depend on Ant's Bottom Line,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Ant Group’s imminent initial public offering promises to make a lot of people rich, including founder Jack Ma and existing shareholders of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. 
Yet the real benefit to Alibaba is not in the value of its affiliate’s stock, which could fetch a valuation of  $200 billion upon listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai, but in the ongoing earnings the financial services company will keep feeding the e-commerce giant.
Since September last year, Alibaba has recognized Ant through the equity method of accounting. That means it takes one-third of every dollar (yuan) of net income Ant earns, representing Alibaba’s 33% ownership, but won’t account for its fluctuating share price in its income statements.
Alibaba needs that profit share.
China’s dominant online retailer is suffering its slowest growth ever, and operating margins have fallen to a third of where they were six years ago as it spends more on marketing to juice growth in a maturing economy. While profits are still decent, they’re no longer as fat or expanding as quickly as they once were. As I’ve written before, Alibaba’s heady growth days are over, and this was happening well before Covid-19 hit revenue in the March quarter. 
An early post-pandemic belief that Alibaba would benefit from social-distancing and a rebound in online spending has given way to the realization that China’s  domestic consumer economy isn’t immune to the global malaise. While most of the country has returned to a level of normalcy, a sharp drop in exports as the rest of the world continues to suffer makes it unlikely that even Chinese shoppers will have the confidence or ability to spend like they used to. 
Ant, on the other hand, should have plenty of growth ahead. As my colleague Nisha Gopalan wrote, the timing of Ant’s IPO can be at least partly attributed to its broadened base of financial products, making it more of a platform and less of a risk to China’s financial system. 
Alibaba recognized 5.3 billion yuan ($752 million) in earnings from its stake in Ant last year. But the figure understates the size of the contribution. It took the equity stake Sept. 23, so the number actually represents profit from the following day through Dec. 31. Alibaba accounts for its Ant profits one quarter in arrears, so it was seen on the books in the March period this year, which was handy because operating profit was a mere 7.1 billion yuan, down 17%, due to Covid-19.
More importantly, Ant is growing. Insurance premiums, one of many financial products it offers, doubled during the fiscal year to March 31. It has facilitated more than 4 trillion yuan in assets under management, and has 1.3 billion active annual users for its payment platforms. 
As China’s domestic consumption picture loses its luster, there’s still a belief that the financial services business — including digital payments, loans, wealth management and insurance — will continue to expand. Ant’s Yu’E Bao money-market fund, for example, grew to become the world’s largest, while the nation’s insurance industry could swell to 4.9 trillion yuan by next year.
While Ant shareholders will be buying into that story, Alibaba’s bottom line is riding on it.

(Reuters) -  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP) said on Tuesday a bump in user growth at the start of coronavirus-led lockdowns petered out sooner than expected, and it forecast fewer current-quarter users than the Wall Street consensus.
Shares of Snap fell 11% in after-hours trading before paring losses to around 6%.
The Snapchat owner said daily active users (DAUs), a widely watched metric by investors and advertisers, rose 17% to 238 million in the second quarter ended June 30. Analysts had expected 238.44 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Snap has focused on helping advertisers increase sales directly from its ads, which boosted revenue growth even as many brands have been cutting marketing budgets due to the pandemic.
Snap has positioned itself as a safe ad platform focused on friendly interactions, as more than 1,000 companies have paused ads on larger rival  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) due to concerns about hate speech.
""The growing focus on brand safety and privacy across the entire industry places us in a unique position of strength as we have invested in these areas from the beginning of our business,"" Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said during an earnings call with analysts.
Snap forecast 242 million to 244 million daily active users in the current quarter, below analysts' target of 244.82 million according to Refinitiv data.
Revenue from ad sales jumped about 17% to $454.2 million during the quarter, above estimates of $440.8 million. 
Snap's revenue gains set the bar for Twitter, which reports earnings on Thursday, and Facebook's results next week, said Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst at research firm eMarketer. 
Average revenue per user was $1.91, barely changed from the year-ago quarter. Outside North America and Europe, that measure dropped 25% to 89 cents as coronavirus-related factors inflicted more harm, Snap said.
Snap's net loss widened to about $326 million, or 23 cents per share, from $255.2 million, or 19 cents per share, a year earlier.
Chief Financial Officer Derek Andersen said third-quarter revenue growth was 32% through July 19. 
But since the pandemic could weaken the economy further, Snap's internal model is based on revenue growth of 20% for the third quarter, Andersen said.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Looking outside her Beijing coffee shop where seven other nearby cafes including a Starbucks compete for customers, Huang Ying is simply glad to still be in business.
In the 17 years since opening her cafe in the trendy 798 Art Zone district, making money has gotten harder - even before the coronavirus. Rent and labour costs have increased while rival after rival waded into a market that has failed to live up to expectations.
""Our profit can't compare with the old days,"" she said. ""I raised prices by 10% in 2017 but that has done little to offset the jump in costs.""
As a coffee market, China exerts a magnetic pull for Western brands keen to emulate the success of  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) which has over 4,400 stores in China and is still expanding. Since last year, Canada's Tim Hortons has opened about 60 stores in China while Italy's Lavazza and Sweden's Wayne's Coffee have also made forays into the market.
Much of the optimism about China's coffee market potential stems from just how little its consumers drink - just 5.4 cups per capita last year, compared to 341 in the United States and 591 in Western Europe, according to consultancy Euromonitor. 
Chinese coffee consumption is growing at an estimated rate of around 5% annually, but coffee shop proprietors like Huang say it is more important to take note of the huge jump in outlets and cut-throat pricing.
Store openings of specialist coffee and tea shops surged 50% in 2018 and 2019, and China now has some 18,350 stores, more than triple the number in 2014, according to Euromonitor. Coffee is also now sold at many convenience stores and fast-food restaurants. 
And while a regular-sized latte costs around 30 yuan ($4.24) in China, it can be as cheap as 4.5 yuan ($0.60) at some places with the use of discount vouchers. 
This year's admission by delivery-focused and coupon-reliant  Luckin Coffee  (OTC:LKNCY) that it fabricated $310 million in sales underscores how the coffee opportunity in China has been exaggerated, analysts said.
""Luckin's fraud proved that even though coffee in China is almost free, the Chinese still don't drink much of it,"" said Beijing-based independent analyst Keso Hong. 
TEA COUNTRY 
Tea is China's main source of caffeine and outside of China's biggest cities, buying a branded caffeinated drink to get through the day is not part of everyday life.
Bubble tea, which contains tapioca pearls, is also giving coffee a run for its money. Food delivery giant Meituan Dianping (OTC:MPNGF) received 210 million orders for bubble tea in 2018, ""far more than"" coffee, it has said without elaborating.
Like Luckin, other domestic chains are struggling to fulfil big dreams. 
Coffee Box, which focuses on coffee deliveries and raised some $56 million in funding, has shut or suspended business at dozens of its stores. Grey Box, which offers speciality coffee, said in 2018 it wanted 12 stores in Beijing by end of that year, but has just four. Bruno Caffe has closed most stores and only two remain.  
Among western firms, Britain's Costa Coffee, which is owned by Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), has 300 China stores according to its website, despite earlier ambitions to have had 2,500 by 2018.
The chains did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Starbucks, the first big Western brand in the market and now with 20 years in China under its belt, appears to be the only resounding success, having carefully cultivated its image as a premium cafe for young professionals. Some estimates put the U.S. giant's share of China's coffee market at as much as 80%.
Just this week, Starbucks expanded its Chinese ordering services to multiple  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) apps.
The newcomers have, however, wisely decided not to go it alone.
Lavazza has formed a venture with Yum China, the owner of KFC restaurants in China. Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR)'s Tim Hortons said last year it wanted 1,500 stores in China and has gained backing from Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY). Wayne's Coffee signed a 15-year deal with a Chinese master franchisee.
The chains did not respond to requests for comment on their prospects.
But even teaming up with a partner is no guarantee of success given the extreme competition, analysts said.
""Undoubtedly the coffee market in China will continue to grow and consumers are becoming more habitual coffee drinkers but it is still a hard market to win,"" said Ben Cavender at China Market Research.

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) has hired climate change expert Nicholas Stern to help shape its sustainability strategy as the state-backed lender prepares to rebrand as NatWest Group.
RBS Chief Executive Alison Rose has made helping to tackle climate change a big part of her strategy to rebuild its brand and break with its chequered recent past.
Stern, who authored the influential Stern Review in 2006 that helped set the agenda on the economic costs of global warming, will advise the group on meeting targets to make its own operations carbon neutral by the end of this year and halving the climate impact of its financing activity by 2030.
His two-year appointment comes as the bank said it signed up to the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative's Collective Commitment to Climate Action, which sets out how banks will align their services and lending with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.
""There is an intense urgency to tackle climate change now: this is an absolutely crucial decade for taking action to protect future generations,"" Stern said, adding that the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the ""dangers, fragility and inequities of the old economy"". 
RBS is expected to secure formal approval of its name change from Companies House in Edinburgh later on Wednesday. 
The change seeks to distance the lender from a brand sullied by reckless expansion, forcing it into a 45.5 billion pounds ($57.81 billion) government bailout during the 2008/9 financial crisis.
""The bank has changed fundamentally over the last decade and now is the right time to align our group name with the brand under which the majority of our business is delivered,"" Chief Executive Alison Rose said.
The RBS brand will still be used, primarily in Scotland, the bank said.

The NatWest brand grew out of National Westminster Bank which RBS bought in 2000 and scores more highly on customer satisfaction benchmarks.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Huatai Financial Holdings has big plans for a billion-dollar overseas push, said chief executive Levin Wang - it aims to overtake top players like  Futu Holdings  (O:FUTU) in the fast-growing market for Chinese retail investors trading offshore. 
""We target to be the No.1 player in this market (offshore),"" Wang told Reuters in an interview. ""Overseas Chinese investors, no matter where they are, will be able to use our platform to easily buy stocks without any geographical restrictions.""
Traditionally focused on institutional business, last week Hong Kong-based Huatai Financial formally launched retail stock trading app ""Zhangle Global"", aimed squarely at attracting the millions of Chinese investors living outside the mainland.
The number of rich Chinese - those with investable assets of more than 10 million yuan ($1.43 million) - was expected to reach 2.2 million by the end of 2019, according to a report by Bain Consulting and China Merchants Bank last September.
Huatai Financial's push comes after parent Huatai Securities (SS:601688) - China's third largest securities house - last year became the first Chinese firm to use the London-Shanghai stock connect mechanism, raising $1.7 billion. At least 60% of that will be used to develop international business and overseas expansion, according to the prospectus for the fund-raising.
""With the support from the group, we can make (investment) plans in a sluggish market where good assets have become less expensive,"" he said, without specifying investment targets.
""Zhangle Global"" is Huatai Financial's bet on attracting China's growing affluent class to invest overseas, starting with trading stocks in Hong Kong and the United States. It aims to offer trading services for Singapore and British stocks early next year.
To be sure, the competition would present a formidable challenge to Huatai Financial's goal: Backed by tech giant Tencent (HK:0700), Futu went public on Nasdaq last March and had over 800,000 registered clients as of the first quarter of 2020, up nearly 50% year-on-year. Its first-quarter trading volume hit nearly HK$600 billion ($77 billion), rocketing 166% year-on-year, according to filings.
While Chinese citizens are allowed to only exchange up to $50,000 in foreign currency each year, many executives and staff of overseas-listed firms already have wealth offshore - and are increasingly looking overseas to diversify their investments and hedge against weaker domestic growth.
The retail push is also part of a larger international effort, with Huatai Financial planning to build a footprint in Singapore in the next two years and aiming to double the share of its business to 20% of the group's overall revenue by 2022, according to Wang.

Republican Senator Marco Rubio advocated for the move in a letter dated Tuesday and sent to administration officials tasked with providing recommendations to the White House by early August to better protect U.S. investors exposed to Chinese companies. 
The group includes Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton. 
""Firms listed on American exchanges whose audits are shielded from inspection by [U.S. authorities] should be deregistered,"" Rubio wrote. He added that Chinese firms whose audits are not provided to the U.S. audit watchdog, known as the PCAOB, should also be banned from American initial public offerings.
The Treasury, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Reserve confirmed receipt of the letter while the SEC declined to comment.
Pressure has been building in Washington to crack down on U.S.-listed Chinese companies that do not comply with U.S. disclosure and auditing rules since April, when China's  Luckin Coffee  (OTC:LKNCY), which trades on the Nasdaq, said employees fabricated millions of dollars in sales.
Pressure is also mounting from Congress, with the Republican-led Senate passing a bill that if signed into law would bar any foreign company from listing its shares on any U.S. securities exchange if it has failed to comply with the PCAOB's audits for three consecutive years.
Rubio has said he is preparing a bill to ban Chinese companies from U.S. capital markets if they engage in spying, human rights abuse or support China's military. 

In the letter, Rubio also urged the officials to recommend bolstering legal options for U.S. investors defrauded by Chinese companies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The benchmark S&P 500 U.S. stock index is now positive for the year, yet most of its components have sat out the rally.
After a steep, months-long climb, the index is up 0.8% on the year and at its highest level since Feb. 21.
Yet for every stock that has advanced on the S&P 500 this year, 1.7 have declined, according to Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. 
That is partially because investors have gravitated to a small group of tech-related stocks they believe have the best chance of delivering steady profits in a climate fraught with uncertainty over the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout.
The five most valuable S&P 500 companies - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) - account for some 23% of the index's market capitalization, the highest level on record, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
""It's hard to imagine the index going up if you lose that leadership,"" said Robert Phipps, director at Per Stirling in Austin, Texas. ""Most of the market is really not participating here.""
Tech-related sectors to which those stocks belong have outperformed other sectors by significant margins this year. The technology index, which includes Apple and Microsoft, has climbed about 18%, while the consumer discretionary index, which includes Amazon, has jumped 15%. The communication services index, which includes Alphabet and Facebook, has risen nearly 6%.
Only one other sector, healthcare, has had year-to-date gains.
While U.S. equity valuations stand at their highest level since the dot-com boom, the flight to large-cap, tech-related companies reflects caution rather than euphoria, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.
Moreover, the top five S&P 500 companies today have a greater share of the index's earnings and trade at a lower multiple than the top five companies in 2000 did, Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), wrote in a research note on Tuesday.
Given their relatively strong balance sheets and steadier revenue streams, many investors believe large-cap, tech-related companies are better positioned to withstand the economic pressures resulting from the novel coronavirus pandemic.
""These are strong companies,"" Krosby said. ""You're not seeing a move to tech that is experimental, that doesn't have any profits.""
Meanwhile, the underperformance of the Russell 2000 small-cap index and shares in cyclical sectors such as financials and industrials suggests a still-tentative outlook toward the U.S. economic recovery, Krosby noted. 

Such shares have outperformed for brief periods over the past couple of months, but tech-related shares have then quickly resumed leadership.

The company, like other retailers, has been spending more on expanding its delivery network as more customers shop online due to the coronavirus crisis.
Best Buy said its online sales jumped more than three-fold in the current quarter through July 18, while overall sales rose about 15% since it started reopening stores on June 15.
The company, which had almost all its stores open as of June 22, has brought back about half of the 51,000 hourly employees it had furloughed in April.
""Best Buy's preliminary Q2 sales results, with stores only open for a relatively brief period, reflect the importance of its products and the effectiveness of its multi-channel model,"" Moody's (NYSE:MCO) retail analyst Charlie O'Shea said.
Best Buy also said it would raise hourly wages for its employees by 4%, replacing its short-term incentive pay it introduced during the pandemic, from Aug. 2. It added it would raise the starting wage to $15 per hour.
The company in May projected a hit to profit margins from investments in digital sales in the second quarter after reporting a 5.3% fall in first-quarter same-store sales.

Earlier on Tuesday, Walmart Inc (N:WMT) said it would spend another $428 million on bonuses this year, to compensate its U.S. employees for catering to a surge in demand for essential goods during the pandemic.

Investing.com – Shares of  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) fell in after-hours trading on Tuesday, after signs of slowing user growth overshadowed better-than-expected earnings and revenue in the second quarter.
Snap also warned that second-quarter year-on-year revenue growth will decelerate substantially compared to the first quarter.
Snap reported an earnings loss of $0.17 per share on $230.7 million in revenue against analysts’ expectations of an earnings loss of $0.17 per share on $244.5 million in revenue.
An earnings loss of $2.31 per share equates to roughly a $2.2 billion loss for the quarter, as the company revealed that stock-based compensation soared to $2.0 billion.
A large chunk of Snap’s revenue comes from advertisers seeking to leverage the social media company’s popularity with a younger audience.
Daily active users, a key metric for social media companies, missing Wall Street estimates of 239.1 million daily active users.
Average revenue per user was $1.21, unchanged year-on-year.
Looking ahead, the company given the uncertainties related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the rapidly shifting macro conditions, it would not provide its expectations for revenue or adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the third quarter of 2020.

1160,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 04:23PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: 3 Things to Watch for July 22,"By Christiana Sciaudone 
Investing.com  -- Strong earnings and the EU recovery plan helped drive the market higher on Tuesday. 
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) reported second-quarter results that beat on the bottom line, and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) delivered second-quarter results above Wall Street expectations, underpinned by a contribution from Red Hat. 
Talks about a renewed U.S. stimulus plan also helped support the market, including oil prices. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), Apache (NASDAQ:APA) and  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) rose. Financials also gained.
Tech, on the other hand, took a break from seemingly non-stop rallying, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) lower.  
Coronavirus cases in the U.S. topped 3.8 million, with over 140,000 dead, according to Johns Hopkins.
The earnings frenzy continues on Wednesday.
Here are three things that may move markets on July 22: 
1. Tesla and others on tap to tell us how they’ve fared amid pandemic madness
All eyes will be on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) when it reports Wednesday after the market close. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (NYSE:TMO) and  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG) will also tell us how their most recently completed quarters fared.
Tesla fell ahead of quarterly earnings. Revenue for the period is expected to total $5 billion with a loss per shares of 19 cents, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. While the stock has quadrupled in 2020, just seven of 27 analysts have a buy-equivalent rating on the stock. The rest are evenly split between selling and holding.
Microsoft traded lower ahead of earnings. Analysts surveyed by Investing.com expect quarterly revenue of $36 billion and earnings per share of $1.38. 
Thermo Fisher Scientific, with a market cap of more than $160 billion, may report sales of $5.9 billion and earnings per share of $2.78. Analysts overwhelmingly recommend buying the stock, with eight recommendations to buy versus one hold and zero sells, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.
Finally, the Mexican-inspired delight Chipotle reports Wednesday. Revenue for the second quarter is estimated at $1.3 billion, the  lowest since the first quarter of 2019. Earnings per share of 19 cents is forecast, the lowest in more than four years. Chipotle has 14 buy ratings, 13 holds and no sells, according to data compiled by Investing.com.
2. New homes have sold like hotcakes. How about used ones?
Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. probably jumped in June after falling in May to the lowest level since 2010. About 4.12 million units are expected to have sold, versus the total in May of 3.91 million. U.S. home construction starts rose 17% in June, with builders ramping up production as lockdowns eased.
A survey by John Burns Real Estate Consulting showed that new home sales in June jumped 55%, CNBC reported. Homebuilder Taylor Morrison (NYSE:TMHC) also reported earlier this month that June was its best sales month in company history, with a 94% increase in net sales orders year-over-year.
Crude oil inventories are also out in the morning. Oil traded higher Tuesday as analysts forecast that inventories fell again last week, extending the previous week’s draw.
3. Are more checks in store? Depends who you ask
The Dow Jones Industrial Average pulled back slightly after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he doesn’t expect the renewed stimulus bill to pass by the end of next week. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had said the bill would pass before the end of July, Politico reported. 
Mnuchin told reporters that the Trump administration is prepared to ""spend what we need to spend"" in the next coronavirus relief package. The administration is pushing a package worth $1 trillion.

Investing.com –The Dow gave up gains on Tuesday as U.S. lawmakers cooled hopes that further stimulus would be rolled out quickly. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6%, or 159 points. The S&P 500 gained 0.17%, while the Nasdaq Composite 0.81%.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly said he does not expect that the bill, which includes new money for the paycheck protection program, and seeks to extend the program by at least six months, would be rolled out within the next two weeks.
The bill will also seek to reduce the current $600 per week bonus being included in unemployment benefits, and doubts remain over whether the payroll tax cut will be included.   
With Congress set for a recess in August, time is running out for lawmakers on Capitol Hill to resolve their difference over the coronavirus aid bill. 
The news on a lack of progress over a stimulus prompted investors to rein in their bullish bets, forcing the broader market to cut its earnings-infused gains.   
Major Dow component Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) reported second-quarter results that beat on the bottom line, but missed consensus estimates on the top-line, which the beverage and snacks maker blamed on the impact from the pandemic.
International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), meanwhile, pared the bulk of its gains despite delivering second-quarter results above Wall Street expectations, underpinned by a contribution from Red Hat.
""(W)e think 2Q marks the trough for  IBM  and the renewed focus on LT growth (vs. NT profit) positions them well to emerge stronger post-COVID,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in a note as it upgraded its price target on the stock to $155 from $150.
Energy stocks were the biggest gainers, led by higher oil prices. Recent progress on potential Covid-19 vaccines and a historic €750 billion EU stimulus deal has cooled worries about oil demand weakness, sending oil prices to more than one-month highs.
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), Apache (NYSE:APA) and  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) soared, with latter rising more than 10.50% after Simmons Energy upgraded the stock to an overweight rating.
Financials were also among the biggest gainers, with banks up sharply following their mostly bullish earnings last week.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) jumped 6.6% after announcing Mike Santomassimo would become replace retiring John Shrewsberry as chief financial officer.
The rally in tech cooled, meanwhile, as the so-called Fab 5, with the exception Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), faltered. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) struggled to turn positive.
The Chicago Fed Manufacturing Index rose to a reading of 4.11 from 2.61, topping economists' forecast for a treading of 4.00. A reading below zero suggests below-trend growth in the economy and a sign of slowing inflation.

1167,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 03:20PM ET</span>",Profit or not? Analysts divided ahead of Tesla's second-quarter results,"By Tina Bellon and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - When Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) reports second-quarter results after the bell on Wednesday, investors will be keen to see whether the electric carmaker has delivered a profit during the global pandemic that has sunk most of its internal combustion rivals deep in red ink.
Analysts' estimates for Tesla's second quarter range from an adjusted loss as steep as $2.53 a share to a $1.41 per share profit. On average, they expect an adjusted 11 cents loss per share and a net loss of $240 million, according to Refinitiv data. More bullish investors have sent Tesla's shares soaring in recent weeks and made it the world's most valuable automaker. 
Tesla's April-June results also have wider ramifications. A profit would mark the company's first cumulative four-quarter net income, a goal it must accomplish to be added to the S&P 500 index, where it would be among the most valuable companies.
Some analysts have said that failing to reach that goal could send Tesla shares plummeting after they surged more than 275% so far this year. 
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, in the meantime, has poked fun at the company's naysayers and those who placed bets against him with short positions in the stock, by launching a limited edition of red satin ""short shorts."" 
Earlier this month, Tesla surpassed expectations when it announced it had delivered more than 90,000 vehicles in the quarter, significantly beating analyst estimates and running counter to the wider auto industry trend.
But while vehicle deliveries increased 2.5% on a quarterly basis, production dropped nearly 20%, clouding the outlook for the company that had predicted it would deliver at least 500,000 vehicles by the end of the year, Investors have been closely following any revisions of that target. 
Tesla's U.S. vehicle factory was shut for some six weeks during the second quarter on local regulators' orders. The company has ramped up production at its new Shanghai factory and sold more than 29,600 vehicles in China during the second quarter.
But as global unemployment remains high and the economic outlook uncertain, many consumers are expected to hold off on larger purchases, including vehicles. 
Nord LB analyst Frank Schwope expects global auto production and sales to collapse by 15% to 25% worldwide in 2020, but said Tesla might be more insulated as its buyers remain committed.

Tesla plans to build a second plant in the U.S. Southwest as soon as the third quarter. It has not announced a location, but Texas and Oklahoma have been vying for the plant, which promises to create at least 5,000 jobs.

1168,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 03:20PM ET</span>",Tesla's Musk qualifies for $2.1 billion payday,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk qualified on Tuesday for a payout worth an unprecedented $2.1 billion, his second jackpot since May from the electric car maker following its massive stock surge.
Tesla's stock was down 3% in afternoon trading, eroding a recent rally that has elevated the company's market capitalization to almost $300 billion, larger than any other carmaker. 
Despite Tuesday's stock dip, and importantly for Musk's personal finances, Tesla’s six-month average market capitalization for the first time has reached $150 billion. That triggers the vesting of the second of 12 tranches of options granted to the billionaire in his 2018 pay package to buy Tesla stock at a discount. Musk, who is also majority owner and CEO of the SpaceX rocket maker, receives no salary. 
Even with Tuesday's decline in Tesla's stock, its six-month average market capitalization rose, thanks to the stock's strong rally in recent months.
In early May, Musk’s first tranche vested after Tesla’s six-month average stock market value reached $100 billion.
Musk has already achieved targets related to Tesla’s financial growth that are also required in order to vest the latest options tranche.
Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 1.69 million Tesla shares at $350.02 each, less than a quarter of their current price. At Tesla’s current stock price of $1,594, Musk would theoretically be able to sell the shares related to the tranche that vested in May and the current tranche for a combined profit of $4.2 billion, or almost $2.1 billion per tranche.
Musk’s first tranche was worth about $700 million in May, when it vested, but its value has since increased along with Tesla’s stock price.
The median compensation for Tesla employees last year was about $58,000, according to a company filing. 
Tesla's stock has surged more than 500% over the past year as the company increased sales of its Model 3 sedan.
Following higher-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries, some investors believe Tesla might report a profit in its second-quarter report on Wednesday after the bell. That would mark four consecutive profitable quarters, a first for Tesla and a key hurdle for it to be added to the S&P 500 index (SPX). 
Analysts on average expect a $240 million loss for the quarter, according to Refinitiv. A month ago, analysts expected a loss of almost $340 million.

Gains in the broader market were also supported by surging energy stocks. Recent progress on potential Covid-19 vaccines and a historic €750 billion EU stimulus deal has cooled worries about oil demand weakness, sending oil prices to more than one-month highs.
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), Apache (NYSE:APA) and  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) soared, with latter rising more than 11.50% after Simmons Energy upgraded the stock to an overweight rating.
Financials were also among the biggest gainers, with banks up sharply following their mostly bullish earnings last week.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) jumped 6.5% after announcing Mike Santomassimo would become replace retiring John Shrewsberry as chief financial officer.
The rally in tech cooled, meanwhile, as the so-called Fab 5, with the exception Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), faltered. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) struggled to turn positive.
On the economic front, investors cheered signs that the path of the recovery remained somewhat intact despite an ongoing surge in cases.
The Chicago Fed Manufacturing Index rose to a reading of 4.11 from 2.61, topping economists' forecast for a treading of 4.00. A reading below zero suggests below-trend growth in the economy and a sign of slowing inflation.

1170,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 02:36PM ET</span>",Robinhood Puts Off Bid to Take U.S. Trading Phenomenon Abroad,"(Bloomberg) -- Global investors aspiring to be part of a Robinhood trading frenzy just like their U.S. counterparts are going to have to wait, indefinitely.
Robinhood Markets Inc., which runs a no-fee trading app in the U.S. that’s drawing millions of new users as well as a few critics, has put its global expansion on hold and postponed its launch in the U.K. That’s in the wake of several technical issues and outages to its platform this year, as well as concerns that it’s indirectly encouraging people with little financial expertise to take uninformed risks.
The decision to postpone its U.K. launch is not related to regulation but reflects efforts to refocus on strengthening its core business in the U.S. before expanding elsewhere, the Menlo Park, California-based company said in an emailed response to questions.
In the first quarter of 2020 alone, Robinhood racked up 2 million new accounts, exceeding the combined number of new users at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp., TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) Holding Corp. and E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) Corp. during the period. As of May, the firm had 13 million accounts, up from 10 million at the end of 2019. Half of its new users so far this year were first-time investors, according to the company.
Growth at a breakneck speed has been accompanied by some hiccups. A system-wide outage in March lasted an entire trading day, preventing customers from making trades as stocks surged after an intense rout. In June, the company changed aspects of its options offering after a young customer’s suicide.
Robinhood had already delayed its previous U.K. launch date from early 2020 and was planning to have its trading app available to users there before the end of the year. Its business model was approved, and it received regulatory approvals to operate as a broker in the country in August 2019, according to the company.
“We’ll be closing our waitlist and taking down our U.K. website shortly,” the firm said in an email viewed by Bloomberg to those on a waiting list on Tuesday. “We’ve come to recognise that our efforts are currently best spent on strengthening our core business in the US and making further investments in our foundational systems.”
The company doesn’t have a timeline for when it may revive plans for its U.K. launch.
Companies in the U.K. that offer similar services were boosted by the news. U.K. retail investment services provider  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) Plc’s shares rose as much as 11% in London trading, the biggest intraday advance since March 13. Another investment platform provider, AJ Bell Plc, climbed as much as 2.9%.

1171,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 02:35PM ET</span>",EU fund seen as turning point for eurozone financial assets,"By Yoruk Bahceli, Olga Cotaga and Elizabeth Howcroft
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors cheered a key step toward fiscal integration in the European Union via a new recovery fund agreed on Tuesday, seeing it as a turning point for the region's financial assets plagued for years by debt crises and a north-south divide.
The 750-billion-euro ($864.68 billion) fund had been hailed as a game changer and unprecedented act of solidarity in almost seven decades of European convergence. The move helped the single currency hit one-and-a-half-year highs.
For years, threats like Greece's debt crisis and a eurosceptic populist government in Italy had stirred fear among investors that the end could be near for the euro zone. 
So it was no surprise that the euro and Italian government bonds - assets that have taken a beating whenever those threats flared up - shined on hopes of European fiscal integration.
""This deal removed almost completely the risk of a European break-up, which has always been on the mind of investors,"" said Ugo Lancioni, head of global currency at Neuberger Berman.
Investors say the landmark deal to rescue EU economies from the coronavirus crisis bodes well for the euro and the bloc's equities, while Italy's soaring debt levels could cap further gains in Italian government bonds (BTPs).
""One of the reasons you would have been sceptical of the long-term value of the euro has been diminished,"" said Quentin Fitzsimmons, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, which manages $1 trillion. Fitzsimmons has been building a long position in the euro over the last six weeks.
BTPs have returned 6% since the recovery package was first proposed in May, and Tuesday's breakthrough deal sent borrowing costs in Italy to their lowest since March, wiping much of the coronavirus sell-off.
RISING DEBT PILE STILL CONCERNING
Those gains led some money managers to pocket profits over the last few weeks while others were gunning to make more.
Newton Investment Management's Paul Brain is happy to hold onto his overweight position, expecting the closely watched risk premium Italy pays for 10-year debt on top of Germany to fall to around 90 basis points from roughly 160 bps now.
Despite the new fund, others continued to see the rising debt pile from the crisis as a concern.
    ""Ultimately you shouldn't go all in just because of the recovery fund,"" said Andrea Iannelli, investment director at Fidelity International, who took profits from BTPs over the last two weeks.
The fund is unlikely to have a major impact on Italy's debt mountain as the net benefit it will receive pales next to the explosion awaiting its debt-to-GDP ratio, which could rise to 159% of GDP, from 134.8% in 2019.
That prospect led Kevin Zhao, head of global sovereign fixed income at UBS Asset Management, to cut his position in BTPs around a month ago. He's not thinking of adding back, seeing little prospect for a further rally.
""If the economy is still weak, you don't want to earn just a little carry without due consideration to future tail risks or shocks,"" he said, referring to a trade where investors use cheap funds to buy higher-yielding assets like Italian government bonds.
Expectations are rosier for stocks and the euro.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said it expected euro zone equities to outperform global peers by 10%, mainly led by Italy and Spain.
For the euro, investors said they chose not to overstretch their long positions this week, but added that steps toward fiscal integration strengthen the long-term case for the euro, boosting its appeal as a reserve currency.
That means the euro will tick more boxes when investors find new reasons to upsize their positions. One such situation is already brewing. 
""On the other side of the Atlantic, you still have a tricky, messy political situation and the absence of any coherent response to COVID-19,"" said Vasileios Gkionakis, global head of FX strategy at Lombard Odier, already overweight the euro. 

""It's really a perfect storm for the (U.S.) dollar and quite a strong tailwind for the euro.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Tuesday it plans to issue a proposed airworthiness directive for the Boeing 737 MAX in the ""near future"" to address changes made since the plane was grounded in March 2019 after two fatal crashes killed 346 people.
An official briefed on the matter told Reuters that the FAA is unlikely to unground the 737 MAX before sometime in October.  Boeing Co  (N:BA) has said it expects to resume deliveries before Sept. 30 following regulatory approval.
Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe said the schedule for the jet's return to service will be determined by regulators.
""Boeing is working closely with the FAA and other international regulators to meet their expectations as we work to safely return the 737 MAX to service,"" Johndroe said. 
The crisis over the grounding of the once top-selling 737 MAX has cost the U.S. planemaker more than $18 billion, slashed production and hobbled its supply chain, with criminal and congressional investigations still ongoing. 
The FAA said the public will have 45 days to comment on ""proposed design changes and crew procedures to mitigate the safety issues identified during the investigations that followed the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines accidents."" The FAA noted there are still some key steps before the plane can resume commercial service.
On July 1, the FAA said it had completed three days of certification test flights on the 737 MAX's automated flight control system. 
Final planning is under way for the FAA's Flight Standardization Board (FSB) and the Joint Operations Evaluation Board (JOEB) review of proposed training for flight crews, based on design changes and crew procedures.
The JOEB will include regulators from Canada, Europe and Brazil and will evaluate minimum pilot training requirements. The FSB will issue a draft report for public comment addressing JOEB findings. 
The FAA will review Boeing's final design documentation to evaluate compliance with regulations and the multi-agency Technical Advisory Board will review the final Boeing submission and issue a report prior to a final FAA determination of compliance.

Boeing agreed to add significant safeguards to a key safety system tied to both crashes, make other software updates and move wiring bundles.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major U.S. and European Union airlines asked the EU and White House on Tuesday to consider a joint U.S.-EU program to test airline passengers for COVID-19 as a way to allow people to travel once again between the United States and Europe.
In a letter to U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Ylva Johansson, the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, the chief executives of American Airlines (O:AAL), United Airlines (O:UAL), Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and International Airlines Group (L:ICAG) requested ""the safe and swift restoration of air travel between the United States and Europe.""
Nearly all Europeans are currently barred from traveling to the United States and similar restrictions are in place for Americans seeking to travel to most of the EU because of the coronavirus pandemic.
""We recognize that testing presents a number of challenges, however we believe that a pilot testing program for the transatlantic market could be an excellent opportunity for government and industry to work together and find ways to overcome obstacles and explore all solutions to protect health, build confidence, and safely restore passenger travel between
the U.S. and Europe,"" the airlines wrote in the letter.
Lufthansa spokesman Andreas Bartels said the airline ""wanted to raise this topic because we think there is the possibility to test people at the airport, as we have demonstrated in Frankfurt.""
U.S. and EU officials in June discussed the idea of testing as a way to allow Americans to travel to the EU but did not reach agreement.
In June, the European Union excluded the United States from its initial ""safe list"" of countries from which the bloc will allow nonessential travel.

Last week the U.S. State Department said foreign students coming from Europe are exempt from travel restrictions adopted in March. The State Department said in a memo seen by Reuters it would offer exemptions for some au pairs.

Shares of the world's largest soda maker rose about 4% as it also beat second-quarter profit estimates.
Coca-Cola generates a sizeable portion of its revenues by selling its soft drinks and concentrates to restaurants and theater operators, such as McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (N:AMC), but most of them had to close some or all of their operations due to the health crisis.
But as lockdowns eased, unit case volume trends, a key demand indicator, improved sequentially, from a decline of about 25% in April to a fall of about 10% in June. Volume trends was down mid-single digits globally for July to-date.
""We cannot discount there might be further waves of lockdowns, partial or full,"" Chief Executive Officer James Quincey told analysts.
""Having said that, I am pretty confident that second quarter will ultimately prove to have been the most difficult and the most impacted quarter.""
Adjusted revenue fell to $7.18 billion in the three months ended June 26, while net income attributable to the beverage maker's shareholders tumbled about 32% to $1.78 billion.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - London-based Nithia Capital Resources Advisors LLP is seeking to acquire troubled Singapore commodity trader Agritrade International Pte Ltd (AIPL) and its shares in its Hong Kong-listed subsidiary, according to a source familiar with the matter.
AIPL, whose businesses span palm oil and coal, is undergoing a court-appointed restructuring after it collapsed earlier this year amid fraud allegations. It owes $1.55 billion, including $983 billion to at least 20 banks.
Nithia Capital, an alternative investment manager that specialises in turning around underperforming companies, has proposed the creation of a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to invest in AIPL, according to the source, who declined to be named because the matter is confidential.
A SPV ringfences the financial risk from buying assets because it is a separate company to its parent group. Agritrade's collapse is among a number of failures to hit the opaque world of commodities trading in Singapore, which is dominated by privately held firms.
Ng Xinwei, the chief executive of Agritrade Resources, the Hong Kong-listed subsidiary, told Reuters in an email that ""negotiations are still ongoing in respect of the proposed deals"" and declined to comment further.
Nithia Capital did not respond to a request for comment. AIPL's court-appointed supervisor EY declined to comment. Agritrade Resources' supervisors and law firm did not respond to a request for comment. 
The vehicle, comprising a consortium of investors, would invest $65 million to acquire the entire share capital of AIPL, including its stake of about 55.7% in  Agritrade Resources Ltd  (HK:1131), according to the source. 
Up to $35 million in cash, or cash and convertible debentures in Agritrade Resources, would be allocated towards debt repayment, the source said. The rest would be loaned to Agritrade Resources to release security held over a power plant in India, repay debts and as working capital, the source added.
Nithia Capital's conditions include that Ng, whose father founded AIPL, remain as director of Agritrade Resources to manage the company, which would in turn require him to work out arrangements with creditors to avoid bankruptcy, the source said.
AIPL creditors Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) and Natixis  have filed bankruptcy orders against Ng. Under Singapore law, a person cannot be a company director while they are declared bankrupt. They can be reappointed as a director once they have been discharged from bankruptcy.
Natixis and Commerzbank declined to comment.
AIPL's creditors have accused the company, Ng and his father, Say Peck Ng, of fraud. They allege that they were duped into lending AIPL money because duplicate documents were used to obtain financing from multiple banks for the same shipments.
Ng has previously said that he managed the day-to-day business of the company's Hong Kong-listed unit and his father was in charge of AIPL's trading business. He has said he supported efforts to fully uncover the extent, if any, of the alleged fraud and recover money owed. 

The elder Ng's employment was terminated on Feb. 1. He has not commented publicly on the allegations and Reuters was unable to reach him for comment.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) said on Tuesday it plans to remove carbon emissions from its entire business, including its products and sprawling supply chain, over the next decade. 
The iPhone maker said its global corporate operations such as offices and data centers are already carbon neutral but that it will extend its effort to the thousands of suppliers that contribute to its products. 
Apple said it aims to achieve 75% of the goal by reducing emissions, with the remaining 25% coming from carbon removal or offset projects such as planting trees and restoring habitats. 
For its supply chain, Apple aims to address what are termed ""scope three"" emissions, which come indirectly from a company's value chain. In Apple's case, this means contract manufacturers such as  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd's (TW:2317) Foxconn. 
Apple said 74% of its overall carbon emissions are generated by product manufacturing. To address the scope three emissions from manufacturing, Apple said it will help set up a $100 million ""U.S.-China Green Fund"" to provide capital investments to suppliers for energy efficiency projects. 
The company has also been working with suppliers to reduce emissions by using recycled materials, saying its iPhones now use recycled rare earth elements in a component called the taptic engine. 
Rare earth elements are energy intensive to mine but are often used in amounts too small to make recycling economical. Apple said it has created a robot to recover the materials from some of its devices. 
Apple said its carbon removal or offset efforts will come via a fund to assist projects such as restoring mangrove ecosystems in Colombia and savannas in Kenya. The company did not disclose a dollar figure for the fund. 
Apple's nature-based carbon removal strategy contrasts with other companies such as  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), which earlier this year said it would invest $1 billion over the next four years in engineering-based carbon removal technologies. 
Apple's most recent environmental report, covering fiscal 2018, put its carbon footprint at 25.2 million tons.

More immediately, it removes any lingering concerns that the euro zone could come under renewed pressure to break up.
Market participants are hoping for a similarly happy ending to what is set to be a tough few days of negotiating in Washington, D.C., where lawmakers and the administration need to thrash out another bill to support the economy from August onward.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's federal police and public prosecutors on Tuesday carried out an operation targeting senator Jose Serra and Jose Seripieri Junior, founder and former CEO of healthcare insurance firm Qualicorp, as part of a probe into illicit funding in the 2014 election campaign.
Sao Paulo state prosecutors said police have issued four preventive arrest warrants, including one for Seripieri Jr, who is accused of organizing non-registered donations to Serra's campaign when he was running for the Senate.
In a securities filing, Qualicorp confirmed police had searched its headquarters for documents linked to its former CEO, and that it was cooperating fully with the authorities.
Representatives for Serra said he has never received any unfair advantages during his 40 years of public life.
""It is important to emphasize that all his campaign accounts, managed by the party, were approved by the Electoral court,"" they said in a statement.
Qualicorp shares were down 5.7% in morning trading on the Sao Paulo stock exchange
Investigators have also carried out search and seizure warrants in other addresses linked to Serra in Brasilia and three other cities in Sao Paulo state, they said.
""In the course of investigations it was discovered that large payments made by large companies, one in the nutrition sector and another in the construction industry, were made to one of the companies allegedly used by the then candidate to conceal the donations,"" prosecutors said in a statement.
In a separate filing, Brazilian real estate group JHSF Participacoes SA (SA:JHSF3) said the company had also been targeted, with police searching for a potential contract signed with LRC Eventos e Promoções Ltda in 2014.
All individuals linked to the investigation have had their bank accounts frozen, according to prosecutors.

1187,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 10:09AM ET</span>",Wall Street’s Hedge Fund Obsession Gets Vindicated in Research,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s obsession with where the money is flowing has some fresh academic vindication.
Hedge funds exert far more power on equity prices than most other classes of investors, according to a recent paper, while the passive cohort are among the least influential.
Ralph Koijen at the University of Chicago, Robert Richmond at New York University and Motohiro Yogo at Princeton University used a decade of data across the U.S., U.K., euro area and Japan.
Their conclusion: The fast money has more than three times the impact on equity valuations, per dollar under management, than long-term investors like pension funds.
The insights provide ammo for stock allocators who front-run the buying and selling activity of their influential peers, in a world that can famously punish those trading on the basis of fundamentals.
“The influence of hedge funds is remarkable given their relatively small size,” the authors wrote. Smaller investment advisors had the second-greatest impact on price, and proved even more influential across a host of other characteristics, Koijen et al found.
“Small, active investment advisors are most important for the pricing of payout policy, cash flows, and the fraction of sales sold abroad,” they said.
The findings are a timely reminder of the key role played by actively managed money across major markets. While passive investing has been luring assets for years and makes up an increasingly significant chunk of daily trading, there are worries it could ultimately disrupt price discovery.

The research didn’t speculate on the future. But it did note that if hedge funds were to shift to a market index strategy, that would mean bigger price moves are needed to have any impact on a large passive portfolio.
The study also highlighted an implication of small, active investment advisors being so vital to how securities are price abroad.
“If these investors would hold a market-weighted strategy instead of their current strategy, the coefficient of valuation ratios on the fraction of sales that is exported would decline by more than 10%,” the trio wrote. “These investors therefore play an important role in determining the cost of capital of global firms.”

""In a few years, Uniper's European fleet will consist mainly of climate-friendly gas-fired power plants and CO2-free hydropower,"" Uniper Chief Executive Andreas Schierenbeck said in a statement.
The agreement, which was signed last month, follows a cooperation deal with  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) to look at using hydrogen at Uniper's gas-fired power plants and producing the carbon-free gas with power from its wind turbines.
Across Europe, Uniper, which is majority-owned by Finland's  Fortum  (HE:FORTUM), operates gas-fired power plants of around 9 gigawatts, which is more than a quarter of its total generation capacity.

As part of its efforts to cut its emissions, Uniper aims to close three German hard coal-fired power plants, half its European coal-fired capacity, over the next five years.

The electric car maker reports earnings on Wednesday. Shares have almost quadrupled since January, to more than $1,615. Tesla trades at a forward price to earnings ratio of 476, according to Yahoo Finance.
“The company’s valuation now slightly exceeds the $1,500 price target that we established recently, and we believe that any intermediate-term success that TSLA might discuss during its earnings call tomorrow is now fairly reflected in the stock price,” JMP analyst said, according to CNBC Pro. “We continue to believe that TSLA can become a $100 billion car company by 2025, but we cannot arrive at a reasonable basis for arguing that the stock should be valued above current levels, even considering our fundamental outlook.”

1191,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 09:55AM ET</span>",COVID floors aero suppliers after years of planemaker blows,"By Eric M. Johnson and Rebecca Spalding
SEATTLE/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Before the 737 MAX and COVID-19 crises rocked aviation, Boeing (N:BA) offered a major 737 supplier, Teledyne Controls, a take-it-or-leave-it deal.
If the Teledyne Technologies (N:TDY) unit also wanted to be a top-tier supplier on the blockbuster 737 MAX program and a future jet codenamed NMA, it had to slash prices for its data systems, according to a person familiar with the situation.
It also needed to give Boeing a share of the higher-margin work for repairs. 
Like hundreds of suppliers facing similar demands from Boeing and European rival Airbus (PA:AIR), Teledyne agreed to sell its parts at razor-thin margins. In exchange, Teledyne and other U.S. suppliers thought they were guaranteed profits for 20 years, fueled by record output of Boeing 737s and Airbus A320s.
But the 15-month-old MAX grounding, prompted by two crashes, and now the COVID-19 pandemic have left the plans in tatters.
Already weakened by a decade of pressure from Boeing and Airbus to cut prices and invest in new technology, U.S. aerospace firms now face a wave of bankruptcies, restructurings, takeovers and mergers, industry sources and bankers say. 
Teledyne Controls has laid off more than half of the 600 or so workers at its El Segundo, California factory, and closed its Seattle-area office, with more cuts expected, the person familiar with the situation said. 
Triumph Group (N:TGI), which makes parts for Boeing's T-X training jet, is also planning a large layoff this summer and is studying selling off businesses and other options, according to another person familiar with the matter. 
Teledyne and Triumph did not answer requests for comment.
Boeing declined to comment about individual suppliers. 
The planemakers' strategy toward suppliers had already triggered consolidation as companies looked to bolster their negotiating power.
Now, Boeing and Airbus face a dilemma between letting industrial juggernauts like Raytheon Technologies (N:RTX), with a $95 billion market value, absorb smaller companies and boost their pricing power, or shelling out precious cash to bring technology in-house.
PARTS SHORTAGES
Teledyne joins Kansas-based Spirit AeroSystems (N:SPR), Britain's GKN (LON:GKN) [GKNHL.UL], Montreal-based Heroux-Devtek (TO:HRX), and many others in shedding jobs.
The downturn has led to grumbling from some suppliers that Boeing is not pulling its weight. 
Boeing argues it poured billions of dollars into the supply chain by producing 737 MAXs for months even after the jet was grounded in March 2019, people familiar with its thinking say.
Boeing, which has also invested heavily in its factory and hiring to prepare for higher output, bears more of the risk throughout multibillion-dollar programs, they add.
""There are so many mouths to feed and not enough food to go round,"" one supply chain source said. 
In April, Boeing bypassed the government support it had initially lobbied for and raised $25 billion in debt, one of the largest investment-grade bond issues of all time. 
At the time, Boeing said the sale would ""keep liquidity flowing through our business and the 17,000 companies in our industry's supply chain."" Boeing has also paid Spirit $225 million for fuselages it did not immediately need.
Now, industry sources say Boeing is putting pressure on its largest ""tier 1"" suppliers to flow money down to smaller ""tier 3"" and ""tier 4"" parts manufacturers, some of which have also applied for the COVID-related U.S. payroll protection program.
Kevin Michaels, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, said Boeing needed to do more, such as paying supplier invoices in 60 days instead of 90, and backing off on a campaign to bring in-house technology long-supplied by outside firms. 
With failures likely, planemakers face potential parts and skill shortages, Michaels said. 
""I think the challenges ahead are underestimated by both Boeing and Airbus,"" Michaels added.
A Boeing spokesman said: ""We are working closely with our airline customers and our suppliers to manage through the unprecedented downturn and balance supply and demand going forward.""
Airbus was not immediately available for comment.
PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK
Boeing has said it expects to reach production of 31 737s monthly during 2021. That means Boeing will more than double the rate in a few months, as industry sources say it will only reach 14 per month by the end of 2020.
Boeing sees 14 per month as low enough to begin to clear an inventory of 450 new 737 MAX jets once U.S. regulators clear it for service, but high enough to keep suppliers on life support.
Airbus is also producing 40 narrow-body jets a month, partly to stabilize the supply chain, a senior European source said.
For some suppliers, the damage will be tough to reverse. 
As of June, Teledyne Controls' revenue had plunged some 50%, the person familiar with the situation said. 
Nor is there much hope for new business on the horizon after Boeing shelved plans for its mid-market NMA jet.

""With how ugly business looks and how bad the forecasts look, I would not be surprised if Teledyne (Controls) is sold off,"" the person said. ""The question is, who would buy it?""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened with another bang on Tuesday, the Nasdaq Composite hitting yet another all-time high as policymakers on Capitol Hill prepare proposals for a fifth stimulus package.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Nasdaq was up 48 points, or 0.5%, at 10,813, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 208 points, or 0.8% at 26,889 points and the S&P 500 was up 0.6%.
The Nasdaq had been lifted to new records on Monday by some sharp upward revisions to Wall Street price targets for such mega-caps as Amazon. Economist Charles Barraud pointed out that the market capitalization of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) together was now greater than that of the entire Tokyo Stock Exchange. 
He also hinted that prices are looking increasingly overbought in the tech space: the Nasdaq 100 is trading at 21% over its average for the last 100 days, a level last seen at the height of the tech bubble in March 2000.
The biggest movers of Monday cooled off slightly in early trade. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell 1.8%, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) - still buzzing with speculation about its possible inclusion in the S&P 500 - edged down by 0.6%. However, BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock rose another 8.4% on the back of the test results for the Covid-19 treatment that it is developing together with  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE). Moderna, whose experimental drug produced less convincing results in comparable tests, fell 1.9%..
Markets were cheered before the open by better-than-expected earnings from companies such as  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), even though neither was confident enough to update its outlook for the full year in any detail.
IBM stock was up 2.3% while Coca-Cola stock was up 3.2%, despite both companies reporting sharp falls in earnings and providing little in the way of guidance for the full year. FactSet analyst John Butters noted in a blog post that the blended profit margins of S&P 500 companies to have released earnings for the quarter through June was around 7.1%, the lowest since 2009.
Many participants appear to have written the quarter off, however. In IBM's case, the upward move was due largely to the 30% gain in bookings at the cloud computing unit (a number that is still flattered by last year's acquisition of Red Hat).
In other markets, Gold Futures and Silver Futures both surged to fresh multi-year highs on the perception that real interest rates will stay low or negative for the foreseeable future. "

(Reuters) -  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) raised its full-year profit and revenue forecasts on Tuesday as the U.S. weapons supplier overcame coronavirus-driven supply disruptions to post higher quarterly sales in its aeronautics unit that makes the F-35 fighter jet.
Shares of the company rose 3.4% to $378 in premarket trading after Lockheed also topped analysts' estimates for second-quarter profit. 
The Pentagon has sought to make sure defense contractors do not lose highly skilled workers during the coronavirus crisis, and has used its funds to prevent employees from being laid off or poached by better-funded competitors. 
""The corporation and U.S. Government's proactive efforts, especially with regard to the supply chain, helped to partially mitigate the disruptions caused by COVID-19,"" the company said in a statement. During the quarter, Lockheed used accelerated payments from the Pentagon and cash on hand to pay its suppliers $1.3 billion.
Lockheed said it expects 2020 earnings per share between $23.75 and $24.05, compared with its previous forecast of between $23.65 and $23.95.
Lockheed's second-quarter earnings report bodes well for its peers General Dynamics Corp (N:GD) and Raytheon Technologies (N:RTX), both of which also faced disruptions caused by the pandemic.
Quarterly sales at Lockheed's aeronautics unit rose 17.2% to $6.50 billion. Total revenue rose 12.4% to $16.22 billion. Higher sales for the F-35 program helped the unit.
In May, Lockheed said it would slow production of its stealthy F-35 fighter jets at its Texas facility, possibly delaying delivery of between 18 and 24 jets this year due to a parts shortage as the pandemic hampers production across the jet's vast supply chain. Lockheed made 25 F-35s in the quarter, compared to 29 a year earlier. 
Net earnings rose to $1.63 billion, or $5.79 per share, in the second quarter ended June 28, from $1.42 billion, or $5 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, the company earned $6.13 per share, above analysts' expectations of $5.72 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Activist fund Cevian, Thyssenkrupp's (DE:TKAG) No.2 shareholder, has identified Swedish steelmaker SSAB (ST:SSABa) as the financially strongest partner for a potential steel tie-up, two people familiar with the matter said.
Among the possible partners, which include Germany's  Salzgitter  (DE:SZGG) and  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC), SSAB is the healthiest in terms of balance sheet, the sources said, citing a document the fund prepared for Thyssenkrupp's leadership.
The fund has not recommended a scenario in the paper, the sources said, asking not to be named because they are not authorised to speak to the press.
They added Thyssenkrupp needed to keep an open mind and not commit to any partner too early because that could weaken its negotiating position.
Cevian declined to comment.
Europe's steel sector was already under pressure from weak demand and ample supply, a situation aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which further depressed demand from industry.
Sweden's SSAB, Europe's sixth-largest steelmaker, on Tuesday reported a 251 million Swedish crowns ($28 million) loss for the second quarter, beating the 400 million Refinitiv forecast.
Asked about Thyssenkrupp, SSAB CEO Martin Lindqvist told journalists: ""I'm happy we are in a position that some companies could maybe see us as a partner. That's positive.""
Salzgitter and Tata Steel's European unit declined to comment.
Thyssenkrupp is looking at strategic options for its steel business, which could result in merging it with a peer, selling a majority stake or keeping it.
Its latest efforts follow an attempt to combine Thyssenkrupp's steel unit with the European unit of Tata Steel, which fell apart in 2019 on antitrust concerns after years of talks.
A deal with SSAB would likely face resistance from powerful German unions, who fear it would cause major job losses on the Thyssenkrupp side, a banking source said on condition of anonymity.
The unions favour a national solution with Salzgitter, they have previously said.

Thyssenkrupp declined to comment, referring to previous comments by CEO Martina Merz that all options were on the table.

The company said it aimed to make 15,000 fewer vehicles than its initial plan, which was around 750,000, according to Reuters' calculations. August's reduction is smaller than the cut of 10% seen in July, and June's 40% reduction.
As Japan fears a second wave of infections spreading from the capital, one Toyota employee working at its headquarters has tested positive for coronavirus since developing symptoms earlier this month, the company said on Tuesday. Toyota added it disinfected the affected work sites on July 17 and restarted operation shortly afterwards.
In the midst of the pandemic, the company also plans to skip media briefings for its fiscal first and third quarterly results, but only release filings, a company spokeswoman told Reuters.
Global automakers are slowly getting vehicle production back on track after the closure this year of many plants to curb the spread of the virus, although many still anticipate that output and sales will be lower than last year.
The updated production plan represents an output cut of 9% from a year ago.

Toyota said it would produce 6,000 fewer vehicles at home, and 9,000 less overseas.

1197,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 08:20AM ET</span>",Trial of ex-Pemex boss threatens to lift lid on Mexico's 'cash box',"By Dave Graham (NYSE:GHM)
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The trial of a former boss of Petroleos Mexicanos threatens to expose years of alleged malpractice at the state oil company and provide a canvas for Mexico's leftist president to depict rot at the heart of government that he has vowed to clean up.
Once a symbol of Mexican self-reliance and ingenuity, the firm known as Pemex became increasingly beset by graft accusations and financial problems, crushed under a mountain of debt and taxes.
The extradition to Mexico of former Pemex chief executive Emilio Lozoya on corruption charges has enabled President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to put a face on the company's woes and back his assertion that previous governments led it to ruin.
Both Lopez Obrador and the Pemex management he appointed emphasize that they have made a clean break with what they describe as corrupt practices of the past.
Lozoya's trial could boost Lopez Obrador's fortunes in the run-up to mid-term congressional elections next year. Still, creating lasting change at the giant company is likely to prove a daunting task, analysts and policymakers say.
Over time, Pemex became so deeply embedded in public sector contracts that many Mexicans came to view it as a government ""cash box,"" said Heriberto Galindo, who was a congressman for the centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which governed during Lozoya's 2012-2016 tenure.
""Pemex grew so much that the government lost control of it,"" said Galindo, a onetime member of the lower house energy committee. ""In terms of oversight, finances and public works.""
Prosecutors contend that, among other things, before becoming CEO, Lozoya solicited and obtained funds from Brazilian company Odebrecht, and funneled cash into the PRI's 2012 election campaign for former president Enrique Pena Nieto.
Then, as boss of Pemex, he awarded contracts to Odebrecht and did the same for steelmaker Altos Hornos de Mexico after receiving bribes, they allege.
Odebrecht has admitted paying bribes in Mexico. The bosses of Altos Hornos have denied wrongdoing, as has Lozoya.
Lozoya's lawyers have said he acted on Pena Nieto's orders in conducting major transactions that have landed him in trouble. Pena Nieto has not been charged with anything and has rejected any suggestion of wrongdoing.
Lopez Obrador says he expects Lozoya to catalogue corruption under Pena Nieto, whose rule the president has castigated as the culmination of a 36-year ""neoliberal"" project that fed inequality and devastated Mexico.
""The trial of Mr. Lozoya will really help to clear these things up so we find out what happened and can continue the fight against corruption,"" he said last week.
In 2013-14, Pena Nieto opened up the oil and gas market to private investors, some of whom teamed up with former Pemex executives to claim lucrative oil fields. But the tax burden stayed high and Pemex slipped further into debt.
After defeating the PRI and taking power in December 2018, Lopez Obrador halted the market liberalization, which he casts as a covert attempt to privatize Pemex.
OLD HABITS
Lozoya was due to face an initial court hearing on Friday when he landed in Mexico. Instead, he was taken to hospital with health problems. Proceedings should begin in coming days.
Lopez Obrador - whose approval ratings have been eroded by recession and his handling of the coronavirus pandemic - appears already to have reaped benefits from the case.
A daily gauge of his popularity by polling firm Consulta Mitofsky has risen every day since Spain said on July 6 it would extradite Lozoya.
The 66-year-old president has invested considerable political capital in reviving Pemex, which employs about 125,000 people. But that will not be easy, contemporaries warn.
""If there was corruption in Petroleos Mexicanos during (past) administrations, it doesn't mean there won't be corruption in this government,"" said ex-lawmaker Galindo.
Created as a monopoly by the PRI in 1938 from the expropriation of foreign oil assets, Pemex was an engine of Mexico's rapid postwar industrialization through the 1970s. By 2008, its revenues provided 44% of the federal budget.
Pemex lurched into controversy as the decades-long, one-party rule of the PRI crumbled in the final decades of the 20th century.
Scandals embroiled Pemex in the 1980s, and again two decades later, when the oil workers' union channeled millions of dollars into the PRI's 2000 presidential campaign.
The PRI lost that election, ushering in a dozen years of rule by the center-right National Action Party (PAN) - and the period of Pemex's peak oil production.
But the PRI's corrupt habits proved hard to kick for the parties that muscled in on its turf, lamented Francisco Burquez, a PAN senator between 2012 and 2018.
""All the parties got into that game,"" said Burquez.
Corruption scandals also roiled the PAN and other parties, and the PRI returned to power in 2012 under Pena Nieto. Once he became Pemex CEO, Lozoya himself pointed reporters to suspected graft at the company under the PAN.

The combined company will have a presence in 20 countries, with Europe its biggest market. It will have an estimated revenue of $1.8 billion and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) close to $600 million.
A source close to the deal said the Norwegian firm sweetened terms of its bid at the weekend by offering eBay a bigger stake, after the U.S. firm's board was initially split, with some members backing a $9 billion cash bid by online retailer Prosus (OTC:PROSF).
Jamie Iannone, eBay's chief executive, backed Adevinta's proposal and persuaded the board of its merits, the source said.
Ryssdal told Reuters the coronavirus crisis had boosted digital marketplaces, with some Adevinta sites receiving more traffic in June than a year earlier, rebounding from a sharp drop in March.
Ryssdal, who said he intended to stay in the chief executive role, said Adevinta would look for more acquisitions after completing the eBay deal, adding the combined company ""would be a great platform to do that.""
Shares in Adevinta, which was spun out of Nordic media company Schibsted and listed on the Oslo bourse last year, jumped almost 40% after trading resumed. Schibsted shares climbed about 20%.
SAVINGS
Adevinta owns brands such as Leboncoin, France's biggest online classified ads website, Brazil's OLX and dozens more across Europe, the Americas and North Africa.
The eBay Classifieds Group includes the Gumtree and Kijiji brands, and offers online ads to more than 1,000 cities around the world. The business posted an operating income of $83 million on revenue of $248 million in the first quarter of 2020.
The transaction, expected to close by the first quarter of 2021, targets $150 million-$185 million in annual savings on EBITDA within three years.
Most of the synergies are expected to come from IT, where eBay is much stronger, a person familiar with the deal said.
Schibsted said the deal meant its stake in Adevinta would fall to about 33% from 59%, but it would have 39.5% of votes.
Schibsted and eBay will appoint two directors each to the expanded board of nine, Adevinta's investor presentation showed.
Schibsted Chief Executive Kristin Skogen Lund told a presentation her firm intended to remain a significant shareholder in Adevinta but might sell part of its stake if it made further acquisitions. 
""We will have a larger liquidity and financial flexibility, but that doesn't mean that we have any immediate plans (to sell),"" she said.
As part of Adevinta deal, the U.S. firm agreed to sell Schibsted the Danish assets of eBay classifieds group for $330 million, reducing the cash consideration from Adevinta to about $2.17 billion.

 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) advised Adevinta, while  Barclays  (LON:BARC) acted as lead financial advisor to Schibsted. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and LionTree advised eBay.

1201,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 07:55AM ET</span>",Nasdaq earnings expected to benefit from tech rally,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) is expected to report higher second-quarter earnings on Wednesday as hopes of a rapid recovery from the coronavirus pandemic sent technology stocks surging, sending its benchmark Nasdaq 100 index (NDX) to record highs. 
Nasdaq benefits from trades on its exchange and when assets linked to its indexes rise.
The Nasdaq 100's climb, along with gains in the broader market, have come even as U.S. coronavirus cases have soared, with more than 3.6 million U.S. cases, and 140,000 killed.
Investors during the quarter largely focused on the benefits of a flood of fiscal and monetary stimulus, as well as hopes for a COVID-19 vaccine, vaulting major stock indices off their March 23 lows.
The rush to buy stocks, and especially tech stocks, came as more people took up trading from home while under lockdown, encouraged by the recent move by retail brokerages to offer commission-free trading. 
That helped lift Nasdaq's share price by around 21% year-to-date, versus a rise of around 0.4% for the S&P 500 (SPX).
CME Group (O:CME), New York Stock Exchange-owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE), and Cboe Global Markets (Z:CBOE) report results next week on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday respectively.
CME, the world's largest futures exchange, is expected to report lower profits as interest rate futures volumes declined sharply in response the coronavirus pandemic's impact on the economy, which has led to a long-term outlook for low rates. Shares of the company are down around 17% this year.
ICE is expected to report higher earnings as a spike in equities and options volumes off-set lower energy futures demand. ICE shares are up around 1% in 2020.

Cboe earnings are expected to rise on higher stock and options volumes. The company's shares are down around 26.5% year-to-date on reduced demand for products linked to Cboe's VIX volatility index.

(Reuters) -  Carlyle Group  Inc (O:CG) said on Tuesday that Glenn Youngkin will step down as co-chief executive to dedicate himself to public service, leaving Kewsong Lee as sole CEO of one of the world's biggest private equity firms.
Lee, who joined Carlyle seven years ago after spending 21 years at private equity firm Warburg Pincus, will become the firm's only CEO when Youngkin leaves at the end of September.
Youngkin, 53, will step down after over two decades at the buyout firm, having worked his way up after joining from management consultancy McKinsey & Company in 1995.
The move comes less than three years after the firm's founders - David Rubenstein, William Conway and Daniel D'Aniello - handed over the reins to Youngkin and Lee. Rubenstein and Conway remain co-executive chairmen of the U.S.-based firm.
""As the world continues to face so many challenges today, and as Carlyle is well-positioned, now is a natural point to focus my full-time efforts on community and public service efforts that I believe can make a meaningful impact,"" Youngkin said in a statement.
Youngkin and his wife Suzanne earlier this year launched VA Ready, a non-profit offering training for unemployed Virginians to help them find work amid the coronavirus pandemic. He has also been a donor mainly to Republican politicians. 
Prior to becoming Carlyle Co-CEO, Youngkin served as Carlyle's chief operating officer and led the firm's global industrial investment team. 

Carlyle had $217 billion in assets under management as of the end of March, spanning private equity, corporate credit and real estate.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Tuesday, with investors looking for more fiscal stimulus while solid  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) earnings improved confidence about the ongoing earnings season.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT),S&P 500 Futures traded 21 points, or 0.7%, higher, Nasdaq Futures up 76 points, or 0.7%. The Dow Futures contract rose 159 points, or 0.6%.
On Monday, the S&P 500 closed 0.8% higher, edging into positive territory for 2020. The Nasdaq Composite added 2.5% to hit a new record high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched higher, boosted by increased hope that one or more vaccine cures for the Covid-19 virus will be readily available by the end of the year.
Earlier Tuesday, European Union leaders finally agreed on a 750 billion euro ($860 billion) coronavirus rescue fund, aimed at boosting the region’s economic recovery, after prolonged negotiations over four days.
This puts the focus back on the U.S. policymakers, with Congress set to debate a fresh coronavirus aid package this week, aiming to finalize legislation on help for households and business protections in the coming weeks.
There remain differences between the two parties over the size of the deal, as well as what is included within it, but the pressure is on with a number of measures introduced earlier to support the workforce due to finish at the end of this month.
The second-quarter earnings season continues Tuesday, with household names like Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) due to report. 
The market is set to get a boost from IBM’s earnings, released late Monday, after the tech giant beat estimates for second-quarter profit, signaling demand for its cloud computing business.
Soft drinks giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) also reported Tuesday, with its earnings falling 33% in the second quarter. The company gave no guidance other than to say it expects the second quarter to be the worst of the year.
The U.S. economic data slate is quiet Tuesday, with the release of the Redbook the only significant factor. The main focus this week will be on the weekly initial jobless claims release, on Thursday, given the renewed economic shutdowns in California, Florida and Texas. 
Oil prices gained Tuesday on general optimism, with Brent rising above $44 a barrel for the first time since March 6, when the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia started. 
The American Petroleum Institute’s weekly report on U.S. oil stockpiles is due later in the session.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Novartis  (S:NOVN) lowered its 2020 sales outlook on Tuesday after a second-quarter fall as the Swiss drugmaker counts the cost of exiting the vaccine market six years ago.
Sales of the cancer therapy Lutathera and eye drugs Lucentis and Xiidra, for which it paid $3.4 billion last year, all fell as patients avoided trips to the doctor.
Its net income fell 4% to $1.9 billion on sales off 1% at $11.35 billion for the three months to June 30.
CEO Vas Narasimhan, who once headed the company's vaccine business, said Novartis now expects mid-single-digit percentage sales growth this year.
It had previously expected mid- to high-single-digit percentage growth.
In contrast, rivals including Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) have raised their 2020 forecasts.
Novartis has tested some of its older medicines, including generic malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, against the new coronavirus, but failed to recruit enough patients for that study and had to abandon it.
""My own experience in vaccines teaches me that it is difficult to de novo build scale and expertise to be able to develop large-scale vaccines successfully without the deep expertise that the three or four top manufacturers have,"" Narasimhan said on a call with reporters. 
AstraZeneca (L:AZN) on Monday announced positive data on a vaccine it is producing with Oxford University.
In addition to its absence from the race for a COVID-19 vaccine, Novartis' payments of about $1.1 billion to settle corruption cases including in the United States and Greece have weighed on investor sentiment, analysts at Zuercher Kantonalbank said.

Novartis shares were down 1.3% at 1011 GMT and are off more than 10% this year.

Administrators took over SAA in December after almost a decade of financial losses and last week creditors approved the restructuring plan, which requires at least 10 billion rand ($600 million) of new funds, on the understanding the government would find the necessary cash.
Mboweni said in an affidavit filed in the High Court that options the government might explore to mobilise funds included approaching institutions for investment of pension funds, private equity partners or other strategic partners who might want to acquire a shareholding in a restructured SAA.
The minister was responding to a court case launched by the country's largest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, which wants to block Mboweni from using emergency powers to channel public funds to SAA.
Mboweni and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan sent a letter last week to SAA's administrators which committed to ""mobilising funding"" for the plan.
Mboweni also said in the court papers that no definitive decisions had been taken on how funds would be sourced for SAA. He also said he had not used his powers to authorise the use of funds from the National Revenue Fund, nor was such a move imminent.
The finance ministry has not yet responded to a Reuters request for comment.
SAA's administrators need certain conditions to be met by Wednesday for their restructuring plan to be implemented. One of them is that the government finds money for the plan.

Their rescue plan envisages scaling back the airline's fleet and shedding jobs before gradually ramping up operations as the disruption caused by COVID-19 eases.

1212,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>",European banks face more than 400 billion euros in COVID loan losses,"LONDON (Reuters) - Economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak will cause a sharp rise in loan losses at European banks, two research reports showed on Tuesday, with more than 400 billion euros ($458 billion) of losses estimated in the next three years.
Loans to small and mid-size enterprises and unsecured consumer loans in Europe, which grew by more than 20% between end-2014 and June 2019, were seen most at risk, a report from credit ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investor Service showed.
Separately, a report from Oliver Wyman said European bank credit losses could spiral to 800 billion euros if the region succumbed to a second comprehensive lockdown to curb the spread of the virus. 
These credit losses compare with the euro zone crisis of 2012-14, but represent less than 40% of the losses experienced in the global financial crisis of 2008-10, the consultancy said.
""The pandemic is unlikely to cripple the European banking sector, however many banks will be pushed into a 'limbo state', with very weak returns,"" Christian Edelmann, Co-Head of EMEA financial services at Oliver Wyman said.
""Ambitious restructuring efforts will be needed, but to succeed they will need engagement and support from policymakers and regulators,"" Edelmann said, pointing to possible benefits from consolidation and creation of a single banking market.
The Moody's report assessed the exposure of 14 large European banking systems to SME and unsecured consumer loans, using data gathered by the European Banking Authority (EBA).
According to the report, banks in southern Europe are most exposed to SMEs, while large banking systems like Germany and the UK, have exposures below the 15% European average.
Exposures to unsecured consumer loans are highest for banks in Spain, Austria, France and the UK.
The coronavirus economic downturn is expected to drive a deterioration in loan quality, with the percentage of problem loans estimated to rise by between 100-300 basis points by 2022 for most European banks, Moody's added.
Government stimulus will not completely offset the financial and economic damage inflicted by the pandemic and the full extent of loan quality deterioration will be revealed only once these measures are unwound, the agency said.
Problem loans in these segments at European banks were 8.5% and 5.6% respectively at the end of June 2019, following a decline from 18.5% and 8.1% respectively in June 2015. This compares with 2.1% for larger corporates and 2.7% for residential mortgages.

1213,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 05:41AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Historic Summit Deal Removes Drag From European Markets,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe's stock markets are flying on Tuesday after EU leaders finally wrapped up a deal that, despite the obvious political momentum behind, appears not to have been fully priced in. 
The Stoxx 600 gained 1.2% on the news to trade at 379.80 by 5 AM ET (0900 GMT). That's its highest since March 3 but - in contrast to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, which are both now in positive territory for the year, the Stoxx is still 10% below where it ended 2019 and 13% below where it was before the coronavirus reached Europe. That, along with Europe's better success in containing the virus, suggests there is room for some catch-up in the near term, all other things being equal.
Other things aren't equal, of course. Europe doesn't have the same quantity or quality of technology firms to take advantage of the new post-pandemic circumstances, even though that deficit is arguably smaller than it used to be. Moreover, its potential growth rate is still low, and too dependent on an export model that is under real threat from the unraveling of globalization. 
However, the summit deal effectively removes one crucial risk that has dogged European assets for the last decade, by signalling that - when faced with a crisis - its member states will choose tighter integration rather than disintegration. That comes at a price of higher fiscal transfers from richer countries to poorer ones, but even the so-called Frugal Four (or Five, depending on how you count them) have acknowledged that outcome to be far superior to the alternative of fragmentation. Euroskeptic rhetoric may echo around markets for some time yet, but actions speak louder than words, and this action is unambiguous.
Euro breakup risk has been a drag on Europe's economy, and on its financial markets, ever since 2008, weighing particularly heavily on the highly-indebted southern periphery. That risk has shrunk with this deal, if not forever, then at least for a length of time that covers most investment horizons. Hence the outperformance this morning by Italian, Spanish and Greek bank stocks.
Skeptics will point to the fact that some leaders are styling the deal as a one-off. This, however, should be seen for what it is: the effort of some national leaders to justify a move that still doesn't command universal support among their electorates. The positive impact on markets of the recovery fund, from its conception to its delivery on Tuesday, will become part of Europe's political memory, making it more likely that similar measures - measures that make Europe a more coherent, less risky whole, will be the default option in future crises. 
It is, however, important to remember that the Fund's impact will be felt - at this point - entirely through the channel of sentiment or, if you prefer, faith. The money will not be disbursed until 2021 at the earliest, and of course there is no guarantee that the systematic theft, over the years, of EU money by organized crime and low-level fraudsters will end. 
But the reaction, from the Commission, the member states and the European Central Bank, to the current crisis has been several orders of magnitude better than its reaction to the last one. That deserves some form of recognition in asset prices."

Called ""Transform to Net Zero"", the group plans to recruit other members and will work with the Environmental Defense Fund and focus on delivering guidance, research and blueprints for businesses to achieve zero carbon emissions no later than 2050.
The announcement gave no details of any investment the companies would make, outlining only initial research and other work to be completed over the next five years.
Some aims for net zero carbon emissions include reductions across the entire value chain, including impact of products and services, and the substantial commitment and willingness to invest in and speed innovation. 
The current alliance also includes French food group  Danone  SA (PA:DANO), German automaker Mercedes-Benz AG, top shipping container firm A.P. Moller - Maersk A/S (CO:MAERSKb), Indian tech firm  Wipro Ltd  (NS:WIPR), and Brazilian cosmetics maker Natura & Co (SA:NTCO3).
While many companies have made commitments to improve, critics say action by the corporate world still falls far short of the sort of far-reaching change needed to meet UN targets on emissions and capping the global rise at 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Microsoft in January had announced plans to be carbon negative, pledging to remove as much carbon as it has emitted in its 45-year history and allocated $1 billion to create a ""Climate Innovation Fund"" to invest in developing carbon removal technology.

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares and the euro hit their strongest levels since March on Tuesday after European Union leaders sealed a 750 billion euro ($857 billion) post-pandemic stimulus plan after a marathon five-day meeting.
Hopes that vaccines against the COVID-19 disease might be ready by the end of the year also supported the rally, following promising early data from trials of three potential vaccines.
News of the EU deal, which includes 390 billion euros of grants, down from an initially proposed 500 billion, along with 360 billion of low-interest loans, saw the euro climb to as high as $1.1470 and the main European share indexes open more than 1% higher. 
EU summit chairman Charles Michel presented the final plan as a ""pivotal"" moment to dispel doubts about the bloc's unity and future.
""This agreement sends a concrete signal that Europe is a force for action,"" a jubilant Michel told a news conference. French President Emmanuel Macron, who spearheaded the deal with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, hailed it as ""truly historic"".
Italian, Spanish, Greek, Portuguese and Cyprus' government bonds rallied, reflecting that the countries will be allocated some of the largest amounts from the new fund when scaled to the size of their economies. 
The Netherlands, Austria and Finland, which were part of a group of five ""frugals"" that had been calling for stricter terms for the funding, saw their borrowing costs inch higher.
""It's a pretty good message compared to other countries,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) chief global equity strategist Sean Darby said, referring to the outcome of the EU summit. ""The markets should take this news very well.""
Wall Street futures were also up, by 0.5%, after its latest tech-led charge had pushed the Nasdaq up 2.5% to a record closing high, and the S&P500 to a five-month peak on Monday.
Asian and Australian shares had followed suit, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbing 2% to its highest level since February. Tokyo's Nikkei ended up a more modest 0.7% but the Australian stock market clocked up its best day in over a month with a 2.6% jump.
The main all-world share indexes now have rebounded 45% off their March lows, boosted mainly by the record levels of stimulus announced by governments and central banks to cushion the impact of COVID-19 and its ensuing lockdowns.
Early data from trials of three potential COVID-19 vaccines released on Monday, including a closely-watched candidate from Britain's Oxford University and one from CanSino Biologics and China's military research unit, also helped lift markets.
The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is one of 150 in development globally, but is considered the most advanced. In its Phase I trial, the vaccine induced so-called neutralizing antibodies - the kind that stop the virus from infecting cells - in 91% of individuals a month after they were given one dose, and in 100% of subjects who were given a second dose. 
These levels were on a par with the antibodies produced by people who survived COVID-19 - a key benchmark of potential success.
GOOD AS GOLD 
Commodity markets also had their tails up. Brent crude oil was up 31 cents at $43.59, while U.S. crude (WTI) gained 19 cents to $41.00, though both were within July's tight $2-$3 trading range.
Gold rose to a nine-year high on Tuesday as expectations of higher inflation from increased stimulus overshadowed the resultant gain in risk appetite, while silver breached the $20 level for the first time since September 2016.
Spot gold was up 0.4% at $1,822.11 per ounce by 0800 GMT, after hitting its highest since September 2011. U.S. gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,823.80.
Gold tends to benefit from widespread stimulus as the metal is widely viewed as a hedge against rising prices and currency debasement. With the EU recovery plan now finalised, investor focus is set to shift to possible further U.S. stimulus measures after $3 trillion earlier this year.

""What's really driving the gold market is stimulus and we are going to get more of it. It's the eye candy that's driving sentiment right now,"" said Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at financial services firm AxiCorp.

1216,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>",Global presence an advantage as U.S. companies brace for second-half slump,"By Gaurav Dogra and Subrat Patnaik
(Reuters) - Smaller U.S. companies will bear the brunt of the economic downturn triggered by a prolonged coronavirus crisis as they struggle to cut costs as much as bigger multinational peers, analysts' estimates compiled by Reuters showed.
The data, which pooled over 1,000 U.S companies that have market capitalizations of least $1 billion, showed that analysts expect U.S. firms to post an 18% drop in profit in the second half of 2020.
Revenue will be down 3.8% in the same period, marking the steepest fall in at least a decade, according to Refinitiv data. 
(GRAPHIC - Revenue growth at U.S. companies: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovajxnwpa/U.S.%20companies%20revenue%20growth.jpg) 
The situation looks grim for most U.S. companies, with data showing that firms with large domestic operations are likely to post a 22.7% drop in profit, compared to the 17% fall expected at multinationals.
Companies with an international presence are expected to have revenue shrink at a higher rate, but their profits will fare better, helped by cuts in operating expenses that company plans show will average 16.5% versus 6% for U.S.-centric rivals.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA),  Royal Caribbean  Cruises (N:RCL) and  General Electric  (N:GE) to name a few have cut thousands of jobs this year to reduce costs.
""Domestic firms have already most likely scaled down to the bone their initial headcount in reaction to the economic downturn in the spring and are not in a position to continue to reduce the number of employees further,"" said Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus (NYSE:SNV) Trust Co.
(GRAPHIC - U.S. companies' estimated earnings decline: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdvxrloavx/U.S.%20companies%20estimated%20earnings%20decline.jpg) 
The companies relying solely on domestic revenue streams, according to data are on average about a third as big by market value compared with the multinationals included.
The energy sector will be the worst hit, the data showed, with profit expected to fall over 80%, as oil companies struggle to recover from a slump in global fuel demand and prices.

The health sector, on the other hand, will report growth of about 2% as governments, charities and Big Pharma companies pour billions of dollars into developing a vaccine for the new coronavirus.

With U.S. companies starting to report their second-quarter results, analysts expect S&P 500 (SPX) companies overall to report a 43.9% drop in earnings, the biggest fall since the financial crisis.

LONDON (Reuters) - Grocery sales in Britain rose 14.6% year-on-year in the four weeks to July 12, slowing from previous weeks as COVID-19 restrictions were eased to allow hospitality and leisure outlets to reopen in England, industry data showed on Tuesday.
Market researcher Kantar said the growth was down from 18.9% in last month's report, with the data suggesting shoppers were cautiously returning to pre-lockdown behaviours.
The government allowed pubs, cafes and restaurants in England to reopen on July 4, giving people an alternative to eating at home.
“As lockdown restrictions are gradually eased and non-essential retail outlets re-open, some consumers are slowly resuming their pre-Covid routines and shopping habits,"" said Fraser McKevitt, Kantar's head of retail and consumer insight.
But he said normality was still a long way off. Shopper visits to supermarkets were still 15% lower and the average spend per trip was 25.05 pounds ($31.74), 35% more than the same period last year, as people continue to eat more at home.
Online sales rose 92%, accounting for 13% of all grocery sales. 
Of Britain's big four grocers No. 4 Morrisons (L:MRW) was the best performer over the 12 weeks to July 12 with sales growth of 17.4% and a market share gain for the first time since 2015. Morrisons shares were up 1.3% at 0817 GMT.
Market leader  Tesco  (L:TSCO) achieved growth of 15.1%, followed by  Sainsbury 's (L:SBRY) on 13.5%. Walmart (N:WMT) owned Asda was the laggard again with growth of 11%.
The big four's growth was dwarfed by Iceland, whose sales surged 34.1% as shoppers bought more frozen food.
German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl saw sales growth of 13% and 17.3% respectively, though as was the case in last month's report Aldi's market share did fall.

Kantar said grocery inflation was 3.6% over the 12 weeks, with prices rising fastest in markets such as cooking sauces, fresh bacon  and canned colas while falling in fresh poultry, butter and bread.

(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp 's (O:MSFT) professional networking site LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) said on Tuesday it would cut about 960 jobs, or 6% of its global workforce, as the coronavirus pandemic is having a sustained impact on demand for its recruitment products.
California-based LinkedIn helps employers assess a candidate's suitability for a role and employees use the platform to find new job. 
Jobs will be cut across sales and hiring divisions of the group globally. Announcing the plan in a message posted on LinkedIn's website, Chief Executive Ryan Roslansky said the company would provide at least 10 weeks of severance pay as well as health insurance for a year for U.S. employees, and will hire for newly-created roles from laid-off staff.
""I want you to know these are the only layoffs we are planning,"" Roslansky said in his message. Affected staff, who have not yet been told, would be able to keep company-issued cell phones, laptops, and recently purchased equipment to help them work from home while making career transitions, he said. 
As lockdowns to contain the coronavirus have hit businesses around the world, LinkedIn's business has been hit as companies lay off staff or sharply curtail hiring.
LinkedIn said employees affected by its job cuts will be informed this week and they will start receiving invitations in the next few hours to meetings to learn more about next steps. 

""If you don't receive a meeting invite, you are not directly impacted by this change,"" Roslansky said.

1219,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 04:18AM ET</span>",Germany’s DAX Set to Turn Positive for 2020 on EU Deal Boost,"(Bloomberg) -- Germany’s equity benchmark was set to turn positive for the year on Tuesday, among the first equity indexes in Europe to fully recoup coronavirus-induced losses, as European Union leaders agreed on a landmark stimulus package.
The DAX Index was up 1.6% in early trading, set to reverse a 2020 drop that had reached 38% in March, its fastest-ever recovery. That also leaves the benchmark just 4% away from its record high. Among the main stock markets in Europe, only Sweden and Denmark have fared better this year, while all the other major indexes remain in the red.
The gain comes after European Union leaders agreed on a landmark stimulus package that will see the bloc issue 750 billion euros ($860 billion) of joint debt to help member states mitigate the economic downturn.
“The DAX is now flat for the year because in the long run it does matter that Germany and its economy should come out of the crisis better than many others,” Andre Koppers, a portfolio manager at Oberbanscheidt & Cie, said by email. German stocks also benefit from being among the most liquid in Europe and hence move disproportionately. “That hurt a lot in March and feels pretty good today,” Koppers said.
While the DAX is showing a V-shaped rebound from its low just four months ago, it took about a year to erase a slump of 29% through February 2016, and four years to recover from the aftermath of the global financial crisis.

Giving shares a strong boost this time around are unprecedented fiscal stimulus measures to support the economy as it gradually reopens. Germany has given up on its balanced budget stance, making more than 1.3 trillion euros available to cushion the impact of the coronavirus, by far the most in the EU.
A strong rotation into cyclical shares has also boosted the DAX in recent months, with automakers and banks in particular outperforming.
Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) is the top performer this year, up 31% as the shares also benefit from short covering and renewed hopes that the lender can finally create shareholder value. Fresenius Medical Care (NYSE:FMS) AG, Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) AG and SAP SE (DE:SAPG) are also among the biggest gainers, reflecting a Europe-wide flight to quality stocks.
The strong recovery of Germany’s prime benchmark is only tainted by Wirecard AG (OTC:WCAGY), down 98% after the collapse of the payment company, an embarrassment for the German establishment.

1220,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 04:15AM ET</span>","Barclays, Handelsbanken lead initiative to help UK cut carbon emissions","LONDON (Reuters) - Five lenders led by  Barclays  (L:BARC) and Handelsbanken (ST:SHBa) have become founding members of a group that aims to offer financial support to businesses working to help Britain deliver a carbon-neutral economy.
The Bankers for NetZero initiative, which also includes Triodos, Ecology Building Society and digital lender Tide, will explore ways to help businesses reduce risks involved in shifting to greener and more sustainable practices.
The British government has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.
""Banks have been a bit late to the game on climate action,"" said Nigel Topping, the government's High Level Climate Action Champion for the COP26 climate talks, welcoming the launch of the banking initiative.
The group held an inaugural webinar meeting on July 16 that focused on retrofitting the built environment, a major source of carbon emissions, and on support banks could offer.
Insurer  Legal & General  (L:LGEN), one of Britain's top real estate investors, urged the government this month to legislate to improve transparency on how much energy commercial buildings use and to help businesses switch to renewable energy.
Bankers for NetZero hopes to set out recommendations, or a white paper, this year on accelerating Britain's transition.
Bankers for NetZero is run in partnership with Volans, a research and advisory firm, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking and Re:Pattern, a strategy consultancy specialising in sustainable finance. 
The initiative is engaging with the Bank of England, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Competition & Markets Authority. It is backed by the U.N. Environment Programme Finance Initiative and Britain's Green Finance Institute.

""The transition to a low carbon economy is one of the most complex challenges we face, and it will require close collaboration between both the private and public sector to get there,"" Barclays Chairman Nigel Higgins said.

Measured over five to seven years, the AO Value Creation Plan (VCP) would reward value created above a share price hurdle of 5.23 pounds ($6.64), equivalent to a market capitalisation of 2.5 billion pounds, and representing growth of about 30% a year from Monday's closing share price of 164.8 pence.
Above that hurdle, 10% of value created would be shared between all AO employees. Awards to executive directors would be capped at 20 million pounds.
AO said that to realise the full benefit of the scheme, it would need to achieve a share price of at least 9.41 pounds, a market capitalisation of 4.5 billion pounds, with that value maintained for at least two further years to March 2027.
""AO is now set up to benefit from the accelerated structural shift to online in the UK and Germany and our model is now truly scalable,"" said founder and chief executive John Roberts, who listed the group in 2014 at 285 pence per share.
""(The plan) is a vote of confidence in our people and the future,"" he said.

1227,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 01:45AM ET</span>",Dividends Come Crashing Down as Asian Companies Preserve Cash,"(Bloomberg) -- Companies in Asia Pacific are slashing dividends at the fastest pace in more than a decade as the coronavirus pandemic upends business plans and clouds the outlook for earnings.
About 23% of MSCI Asia Pacific Index members have scrapped or reduced payouts this year, according to data through July 20 compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the most for such a period since 2009, when 41% of index companies took such steps in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Firms listed in China and Hong Kong make up a majority of those scrapping dividends, followed by corporates in Japan and Australia.
Having slammed company profits around the world, the uncertain duration and nature of the pandemic is now increasing pressure on firms globally to preserve cash. Global payouts could contract by 15% to 35% this year -- dropping to $933 billion in the worst-case scenario, according to a Janus Henderson Investors study published in May.
“The lack of a mass market solution to alleviate the disruptions caused by the virus may lead to a continued impact on corporate performance and dividends alike,” said Jingyi Pan, a market strategist at IG Asia Pte in Singapore. North Asian markets such as China, South Korea and Taiwan will “continue to be favored” on the back of better management of the pandemic, she added.
Earnings for companies on the MSCI Asia gauge tumbled by more than 60% in the quarter ending March. A resurgence of the virus in places such as Australia and Hong Kong is threatening to delay the region’s economic recovery.

The consumer discretionary and materials sectors in Asia are seeing the highest instances of scrapped payouts, with companies including Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co., Wanda Film Holding Co., and Japan Airlines Co. having suspended dividends.
Still, the region has fared better than Europe where the central bank has asked banks to defer dividend payments. That’s contributed to about half of the Stoxx Europe 600 Index’s members either scrapping or reducing their payouts. Meanwhile, the U.S. has seen only 63 of the S&P 500 Index constituents announce such moves.

The S&P BSE Sensex climbed 0.9% to 37,766.99 as of 10:10 a.m. in Mumbai, set for a fifth straight session of gains that’s taken it above its 200-day moving average. The NSE Nifty 50 Index added 0.9% and has also breached the technical indicator, forming a pattern that some investors read as a signal that gains can continue.
Both measures have jumped more than 40% from a March low, while India’s economy heads for its first recession in 40 years after business all but stalled due to a nationwide lockdown. Individual investors have turned to equities for returns, even as foreign investors have sold net $437.5 million of shares this month through Friday.
“It is only in equities -- that with some risk -- one can make some returns as other asset classes aren’t performing well in these times,” said Chokkalingam G, head of the investment advisory at Equinomics Research & Advisory Pvt. in Mumbai. “The positive news on vaccine trials has added more impetus.”
While the spread of coronavirus has seen India emerge as host of the third-highest number of infections in the world, a vaccine under development by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) Plc showed promising results in early human testing. China’s CanSino Biologics Inc. and a partnership of  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) also delivered positive trial updates.
With earnings season underway, four of the six Nifty 50 companies that have announced the April-June quarterly results so far have either beaten or met analyst estimates on profits. Axis Bank Ltd., Hindustan Unilever (NYSE:UL) Ltd. and Bajaj Finance Ltd. are scheduled to announce results today.
The rupee strengthened 0.2% to 74.78 per U.S. dollar, while the yield on the 10-year benchmark government bond was little changed at 5.80%.

Investing.com – Ant Group, Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group (HK:9988)’s mobiles payment unit, is planning a simultaneous double-listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE) and Shanghai’s STAR board.
Ant Group is seeking a valuation of over $200 billion, which could see it raise more than Saudi Aramco’s blockbuster $29 billion IPO in 2019. China International Capital Corp.,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) will advise Ant Group on its Hong Kong offering, which alone aims to raise about $10 billion.
Ant Group is best known for Alipay, its mobile payment platform which was spun off from Alibaba in 2010. It also provides services from loans to travel and food delivery. The company has been working with Indian as well as Thai digital payment providers to expand its reach in Asia.
The company is following in the footsteps of other Chinese companies, such as NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com, both of which completed secondary listings on the HKSE in June.
Parent company Alibaba completed its own HKSE secondary listing in November 2019, raising $12.9 billion in the city’s biggest IPO of the year.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly up on Tuesday morning, following an overnight rally in U.S. markets over renewed hopes for a COVID-19 vaccine.
Positive results from not one, but three potential vaccines were released on Monday. Oxford University reported a promising immune response during early-stage human trials for its candidate ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, which it is developing with AstraZeneca (LON:AZN). The other two candidates are being developed by CanSino Biologics (HK:6185) alongside China’s military research unit, and German biotech BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) and U.S. drugmaker  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE).
Also boosting investor sentiment was the European Union edging closer to an agreement on a EUR750 billion ($857.979 billion) stimulus plan, despite negotiations dragging beyond a fourth day. Across the Atlantic, the U.S. Congress is currently debating a further round of economic stimulus, with some earlier measures set to expire at the end of the July.
But the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise, with over 14.6 million cases globally as of July 21, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
“The market, particularly tech stocks, is rallying on both good news and bad news, that tells us it’s all about momentum and not about the facts,” Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets Asia Pacific Pty, told Bloomberg.

SYDNEY/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Southeast Asian low-cost carriers, a key growth engine for planemakers and leasing companies for a decade before the pandemic, are faltering financially as demand plunges, raising questions over whether they can replace and double their fleets.
Auditors for Malaysia's AirAsia Group Bhd (KL:AIRA) and Vietnam's VietJet Aviation JSC (HM:VJC) are concerned about cashflows and funding, while Indonesia's Lion Air has put the brakes on a planned flotation.
Even before the pandemic, bankers and leasing bosses were worried about whether aircraft ordered during a decade-long buying frenzy by Southeast Asian carriers would end up being delivered.
The carriers, which have offshoots in multiple countries, have 938 planes on order and lease most of their existing fleets of 476 planes, according to Aviation Week data.
To be sure, budget airlines with large domestic operations are well-placed for a post-pandemic recovery, despite having less financial support than state-owned rivals.
Their lower cost structure helps reduce the rate at which they burn cash and gives them the flexibility to benefit first from any recovery, analysts say.
But with borders shut and economic growth stunted, a return to the low-cost international travel needed for them to afford all of the planes they have on order looks increasingly doubtful - a worrying sign for the companies that make and lease aircraft. 
""One area that I'm concerned about generally is just those low-cost carriers who ordered too many aircraft,"" Robert Martin, chief executive of Singapore-based lessor BOC Aviation (HK:2588) told Reuters. 
""I think there will still be work to be done on those during the third quarter,"" he said, referring to negotiations over current lease contracts.
BOOM TIMES
Until now, a fast-expanding middle class with disposable income and greater liberalisation have made the region lucrative for planemakers and their suppliers.
At the Singapore Airshow in February - before the pandemic spread broadly outside China - Boeing (N:BA) predicted Southeast Asian airlines would need 4,500 airplanes over the next 20 years, with Vietnam topping the traffic growth charts.
With that came predictions of jobs for 182,000 new commercial pilots, cabin crew or technicians.
Now employees are being laid off and furloughed and dozens of aircraft are undelivered, except for airlines still using financing arranged before the crisis, with manufacturers and leasing companies absorbing losses. 
Consultancy IBA estimates there will be an oversupply of up to 2,500 planes globally over the next 20 months.
Lessors are offering payment deferrals to customers with grounded planes, but a possible cash crunch looms when the payment holiday ends, said Singapore-based aviation analyst Brendan Sobie.
""Even with a domestic recovery, you don't have international,"" Sobie said. ""They are carrying too large of a fleet and can't fully utilise the fleet because you can't operate it back of clock on international flights at night.""
That threatens the delivery pipeline, though VietJet last month told shareholders it plans to add 12 Airbus (PA:AIR) jets to its fleet this year. 
Before the crisis, VietJet had ordered planes from both Airbus and Boeing, in part to launch subsidiaries in multiple countries. But so far, it has only set up one offshoot, in Thailand, where it competes against subsidiaries of AirAsia and Lion.
AirAsia, which has said it is looking for additional debt and equity financing, expects to reach around 70-75% of normal capacity by the end of the year. 
But the group has told Airbus it does not expect to take any new planes in 2020, prompting Airbus to put at least six undelivered aircraft up for sale. 
""Airbus is working closely with all its customers at this most challenging time,"" a planemaker spokesman said.
AirAsia declined to comment. 
In Indonesia, Lion Air had already threatened to cancel its order for Boeing 737 MAX jets after a 2018 crash. 
Bankers say the group has sharply cut spending due to the crisis. Lion Air declined to comment on its order plans. 

Boeing said that although passenger traffic might take a few years to recover, it was confident in long-term demand in Southeast Asia.

1233,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 09:30PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Mexico eager to lure firms from Asia under new trade deal,"By Stefanie Eschenbacher and Anthony Esposito
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico has spoken to a host of foreign companies, particularly steelmakers, in an effort to lure business from Asia to capitalize on a new North American trade deal, Economy Minister Graciela Marquez said on Monday.
The U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA) took effect at the beginning of this month, replacing its quarter-century-old predecessor, as the coronavirus pandemic wallops the global economy and international trade. 
The new deal includes tougher content rules both for autos and steel and aluminum than when the North American Free Trade Agreement was launched in 1994.
""In steel we see the biggest opportunity,"" Marquez, a Harvard-trained economist, told Reuters in an interview. ""We want to show these companies the opportunities that open up with this increase in regional content requirements.""
Marquez said the government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has held talks with foreign steelmakers, including South Korea's POSCO (KS:005490), Japan's Nippon Steel Corp (T:5401) and Mitsubishi Corp (T:8508) and Ternium (N:TX), about investing in Mexico to produce steel for the auto sector.
She said there is a possibility foreign steelmakers could partner with or take a stake in Mexico's Altos Hornos de Mexico . A spokesman said the Mexican company is not currently in talks. 
None of the other steelmakers immediately responded to requests for comment.
Considering Mexico's diverse manufacturing base, Marquez said the government was interested in attracting a range of companies from across the globe.
She said the government also would seek to speak with Apple (O:AAPL) and other U.S. firms about relocating their supply chain to Mexico.
Retelling a recent conversation with Lopez Obrador, Marquez said she pointed to the cellphone she was holding in her hand and said, ""These phones don't have to be produced in China, ... there is an enormous opportunity to produce them"" in Mexico.
The government is looking to attract North American and European firms producing in China, Singapore and Vietnam.
Marquez said the new trade deal came into force at a ""critical"" juncture for both the Mexican and the global economy and that it could help Latin America's second-largest country recover from the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Monday asked the Federal Aviation Administration to disclose details of an employee survey on the agency's safety culture after two fatal crashes of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX airplanes raised questions about the agency's actions.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson was asked in a letter to share the outcome of the December 2019 survey that asked employees how they felt about a long-standing agency program called Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) that delegates some new airplane certification tasks to Boeing employees.
Peter DeFazio, who chairs the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Rick Larsen, who chairs a subcommittee on aviation, wrote that it was essential that FAA officials had ""the authority, resources, willingness and support from FAA's senior management to thoroughly and aggressively manage the ODA program.""
An FAA spokesman said the agency would respond to the lawmakers.
The letter, made public Monday after it was reported earlier by Reuters, noted that the Transportation Committee investigation has already determined that issues surrounding the ODA ""played key contributing roles in the regrettable 737 MAX crashes of Lion Air flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines flight 302.""
Reviewing the survey data ""will help our committee properly fulfill our congressional role overseeing the FAA and its efforts to help improve the safety culture at the agency,"" the lawmakers added.
The MAX has been grounded since March 2019 after the two crashes in five months killed 346 people.
The letter also referenced a Transportation Department Office of Inspector General report that noted the FAA sent two letters of investigation to Boeing in June 2019 and March 2020 ""related to potential undue pressure of unit members.""
The lawmakers encouraged the FAA ""to vigorously pursue these investigations and to hold Boeing to account for any violations of FAA's regulations or U.S. law."" 
Boeing said Monday it takes ""all allegations of undue pressure very seriously, investigate them carefully, impose corrective action where warranted, and work to resolve them cooperatively with the FAA.""
Last month, a group of U.S. senators introduced legislation to strengthen FAA oversight of aircraft certification. DeFazio plans to introduce legislation to reform the ODA in September.

The Senate measure seeks to eliminate the ability of aircraft makers to unduly influence the certification process.

1235,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 08:18PM ET</span>",Combined Market Value of All Korean Stocks Is Now Less Than Amazon or Apple,"(Bloomberg) -- South Korea, central to the global supply chain for technology and electronics, is failing to keep pace with some of its largest customers. The result is that the market value of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). or Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). each now exceeds the combined capitalization of all companies on Korea’s stock exchange.
The total market capitalization of South Korean firms was about $1.4 trillion as of Friday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a $1.7 trillion valuation for Apple, while Microsoft and Amazon were each worth about $1.5 trillion.
The sobering comparison comes as South Korea’s benchmark Kospi Index is little changed this year, versus stock gains of 31% for the iPhone maker, 29% for the software firm and 60% for the e-commerce giant. Shares of Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co., South Korea’s largest company and a top-10 supplier to Apple and Amazon, have dropped about 3%.
“South Korea has a pretty small domestic market and we can’t set a global standard or rule a market like U.S. or Chinese companies do,” said Seung Hoon Lee, head of equities at DB Asset Management in Seoul. “So no matter how great a business model a Korean software company makes -- for instance, everyone knows Naver and Kakao are good companies -- it is hard to get good valuations as there’s limit to their growth because of the small domestic market.”
At $269 billion, Samsung’s market value is a little more than a sixth of Apple’s. The Galaxy-brand producer’s revenue last year was just about a third less than that of the U.S. company, reflecting its role as a supplier of low-margin products such as memory chips, in addition to being one of the world’s largest makers of phones and consumer electronics.
Apple’s market value first overtook South Korea Inc.’s on Jan. 29, with Microsoft following about a week later while Amazon, after a bit of back and forth, has been worth more since June 30, the data compiled by Bloomberg show. MSCI Korea Information Technology Index, comprised of hardware firms like Samsung (KS:005930) Electronics, Samsung SDI, LG Display (NYSE:LPL) Co., and SK Hynix Inc., fell about 0.2% this year compared with a 21% gain in the MSCI USA Information Technology Index.
Still, some South Korean internet and gaming stocks have rallied year to date, outperforming the Kospi, as Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns boosted demand for their products. Kakao Corp., a messaging-app operator, has jumped more than 100%, while NCSoft Corp. -- with games including Aion and Blade and Soul -- has surged about 60%.
South Korea’s exchange-listed companies include more than just tech producers such as Samsung, SK Hynix Inc. and LG Electronics Inc. The roster shows more variety when ranked by revenue, with Samsung, Hyundai Motor Co., conglomerate SK Holdings Co., steel producer Posco and Kia Motors Corp. comprising the top five in the past 12 months.

For investors who bought shares of  Denbury Resources Inc  (NYSE:DNR). early Monday, it might be buy the fake news release, sell on the official denial.
At 5:51 a.m. New York time, a statement carried by press release service Accesswire and purporting to be from the Texan oil driller said the company received a takeover offer at $1.20 a a share.
Denbury’s stock more almost tripled in pre-market trading, only to pare those gains after CEO Chris Kendall told Bloomberg News the release was “completely fraudulent.” The company said it reported the matter to the New York Stock Exchange. Accesswire later rescinded the announcement, and a spokesman said an investigation is ongoing.
The early morning trading frenzy in Denbury stock came just as  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) was announcing its takeover of  Noble Energy  Inc (NASDAQ:NBL). for about $5 billion to add shale assets. That deal -- confirmed by both companies -- marks the biggest U.S. oil deal in over a year and follows a tough period for many energy companies.
Denbury was grappling with a substantial debt load even before oil prices plunged amid the Covid-19 pandemic, and the shares have declined 82% this year. Last week, it elected to not make a $3 million interest payment on senior notes, triggering a 30-day grace period. Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings have lower their credit ratings this month. S&P said it doesn’t expect the driller to pay the $8 million interest payment on its 6.375% senior notes due in 2024 within the 30-day grace period.
Denbury traded 9.5% higher at 25 cents as of 2:30 p.m. in New York, valuing the company at $127 million.

1237,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>",Uber defends business model at UK's Supreme Court,"By Costas Pitas
LONDON (Reuters) - Uber (N:UBER) will defend its business model on Tuesday at Britain's Supreme Court in a battle over rights in the workplace that could have ramifications for millions of Britons earning a living in the gig economy.
In a case brought by two then Uber drivers in London, an employment tribunal ruled in 2016 that they were entitled to workers' rights such as the minimum wage, paid holidays and rest breaks.
As things stand, Uber drivers are treated as self-employed, meaning they are legally entitled only to minimal protections.
Uber says its practices have been used for decades by private hire vehicles known as minicabs, which cannot be hailed in the street like traditional taxis, and that drivers earn on average more than the minimum wage alongside other benefits.
The Silicon Valley-based company has lost two appeals in the case, prompting it to seek a hearing at the Supreme Court which will consider the matter on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
A judgement is not expected until at least October. If Uber loses, the firm is unlikely to be able to appeal again and a further tribunal hearing may be needed to decide how the ruling is applied in practice. 
Other firms in the gig economy use a similar business model, where people work for one or more companies without fixed contracts. 
Uber faces similar cases elsewhere.
In June, Canada’s top court ruled in favor of a driver in a case that paves the way for a class action suit calling for the company to recognize drivers there as company employees. 

Separately, in London, the company is trying to win back its licence after the city's transport regulator stripped it of its right to operate in November for the second time in just over two years. Its appeal will be heard in September.

1240,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 04:25PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: 3 Things to Watch for July 21,"By Liz Moyer
Investing.com --  Big tech stocks continued to dominate, pushing stocks higher on Monday even as many sectors came under pressure.
Fears about a surge in coronavirus cases, which are forcing some big U.S. cities to postpone or reverse business opening plans, counterbalanced encouraging news about vaccines under development. Either way, investors appear to be betting that FANG companies will be able to ride though Covid-induced volatility.
A smattering of corporate earnings are on tap this week, with big household names due to report Tuesday including Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL). The petroleum industry is also supposed to release its weekly inventory report on Tuesday afternoon, even as industry reports on Monday point to a build-up of crude stockpiles.
Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow:
1. S&P shows broad sector weakness even though tech stocks are pushing it up
Eight of 11 S&P 500 sectors traded lower on Monday, along with more than half of the Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks, as Briefing.com noted. Yet the major indexes pushed higher, led by tech giants such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)and Google's Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG). Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) moved up.
For the year, only four S&P sectors are positive, including technology, consumer discretionary, communication services and healthcare.
As big tech stocks continue to push higher, their influence on the market grows. They make up more than 20% of the market cap of the S&P 500 compared to just 10% a decade ago. Their dominance becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and they have helped return the S&P nearly back to its pre-Covid lockdown levels. Year-to-date, the broad market is down 0.19%, a breath away from being back in the green.
2. Good news on Covid vaccine progress boosts biotechs
Biotech was in the spotlight Monday because of positive news about progress on a vaccine, which lifted shares of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and AstraZeneca PLC ADR (NYSE:AZN).
Pfizer rose 1% and its partner  Biontech Se  (NASDAQ:BNTX) rose more than 5% on early positive data from its coronavirus vaccine. Meanwhile, Astra shares closed down 4%, but earlier its partner Oxford University announced good early results from their vaccine candidate. British biotech Synairgen (LON:SYNG) soared 590% after it said its experimental drug lowers the odds of serious Covid symptoms. Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) Science, maker of another Covid treatment called remdesivir, closed up 0.7%.
Other biotechs fell on the news, including  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA)which dropped more than 12% after an analyst downgrade.
Covid cases have risen above 3.5 million in the United States, and deaths top 144,000, with more cities slowing down or reversing reopenings of public gathering places like restaurants and bars to stop the virus' spread.
3. Oil price hovers at $40 a barrel as traders await word on demand
With Crude Oil WTI Futures prices hovering near $40 a barrel, traders have been looking to the weekly reports on crude stockpiles for any clues as to demand, and the signals have been all over the map. The numbers come out at 4:30 PM ET (1830 GMT).
Last week, the American Petroleum Institute reported an unexpectedly large draw of 8 million barrels from U.S. inventory the prior week. But indications are that the data the API reports on Tuesday for last week's trend will show inventory increased, though likely by less than 1 million barrels.
Crude stockpiles can be a harbinger of business activity, because inventory decreases as demand picks up. The API numbers always come the day before official government data."

Tech made a bold start to the week, led by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), the so-called Fab 5, making up about 40% of the Nasdaq Index as Wall Street served up bullish upgrades on the sector.
Amazon surged 7.9% after Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) upgraded its price target on the stock to $3,800 from $3,100, citing an acceleration in online spending this year. Google, meanwhile, rose 3.3% after Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju hiked the price target on Alphabet to $1,850 from $1,600 ahead of its second-quarter results due July 30.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was also a big contributor to the heavy-weight index, racking up gains of 9.5%.  
Beyond big tech, the vaccine race continues to heat up, with AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) and Oxford University revealing a positive update on a potential Covid-19 candidate.
The phase 1 trial, which included 1,000 patients, showed that doses of the vaccine – called ChAdOx1 nCov-19 - triggered an immune response in patients, boosting their antibodies and white blood cells to fight the virus.
""The immune responses observed following vaccination are in line with what we expect will be associated with protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, although we must continue with our rigorous clinical trial program to confirm this,"" said Andrew Pollard, chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial. ""We saw the strongest immune response in participants who received two doses of the vaccine, indicating that this might be a good strategy for vaccination.""
Other companies in the race for the vaccine fell.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) was down nearly 13% after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) downgraded the company to neutral from overweight, though it raised its price target on the stock to $89 from $60.
As U.S. Covid-19 cases topped 3.5 million, investors reined in their bets on stocks tied to a smooth reopening of businesses amid fears further shut downs loom.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) fell 3.7%, Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) slid 3.3%, Carnival (NYSE:CCL) slipped 3%, and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) was down 3.4%.
In deal news,  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), down 2.2%, tabled an offer to buy Noble Energy (NASDAQ:NBL) for $5 billion."

ZURICH (Reuters) - SoftBank (T:9984) has pulled a more than $500 million investment from  Credit Suisse 's (S:CSGN) supply chain finance funds after the Swiss bank reviewed the funds including the Japanese conglomerate's role, according to two sources.
The Swiss bank launched the review after the Financial Times reported last month that SoftBank had put $500 million into some Credit Suisse funds, which in turn invested in assets selected by SoftBank-backed lender Greensill Capital. 
Some of the funds' investments were in notes backed by loans Greensill made to other companies backed by SoftBank's Vision Fund.
In a memo to the funds' investors on Monday, the Swiss bank said it would change investment guidelines for its supply chain finance funds and said it had terminated an agreement with an investor in April for three of its four supply chain funds to exclusively source all of their notes through Greensill. 
""This separate agreement has recently been terminated and the investor has redeemed its investment in full,"" the bank said in the letter.
A source with direct knowledge of the matter confirmed that the investor which had terminated the agreement was SoftBank, and that the Japanese group had pulled its full investment from the funds.
A second source familiar with the case said more than $500 million was scheduled for redemption in July independently of the Credit Suisse investigation and had now been redeemed.
SoftBank declined to comment. 
Greensill did not immediately respond to requests for comment made by phone and email.
The funds invest in notes backed by trade receivables, or claims for payment from a business to its suppliers for goods or services that have been invoiced. As payment delays may cause cash-flow problems for their suppliers, supply chain finance such as that provided by Greensill allows suppliers to collect on invoices early in exchange for a fee. Greensill will then collect on the value of the invoice from the buyer.
Credit Suisse said that while in practice all the funds' investments had previously been sourced via Greensill, they were not precluded from sourcing them elsewhere. 
Credit Suisse said that around 15% of the notes now held by its funds were backed by the obligations of companies in which the SoftBank Vision Fund has minority equity stakes. 

It said it was changing its guidelines to reduce the maximum amount of exposure its funds would have to any one company, including those backed by the Vision Fund.

Investing.com -- Tesla rival Nikola Corp (NASDAQ:NKLA) dropped 20% on Monday after SEC share approval.
The Securities and Exchange Commission approved more than 77 million shares of Nikola related to warrant holders and private investment in public equities investors, CNBC Pro reported, as part of the company’s structure when it went public through special acquisition company VectoIQ on June 4.
There are roughly 24 million warrants that are now exercisable, giving investors the right to buy the stock for $11.50, and about 53.4 million shares owned by private investment in public equities investors.Deutsche Bank said large technical selling pressure could continue as early investors lock in gains, CNBC Pro reported. The sell-off could make for a buying opportunity, the bank said, with Nikola one of the few ways to gain exposure to a pure-play electric vehicle company.Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, was up 9% ahead of Wednesday's earnings report."

NEW YORK/SEOUL (Reuters) - Convinced of Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) imminent meteoric rise, Orestis Palampougioukis, a Netherlands-based software developer, took out a 43,000 euro ($49,000) loan in early October to invest it all in the electric carmaker, which at the time was trading at around $230 a share.
Since then, Palampougioukis' bet has paid off as Tesla's share price has increased more than six-fold, trading around $1,500 on Monday and surpassing every rival to become the world's highest-valued automaker. After investing an additional 14,000 euros in personal funds, he has pocketed around 10,000 euros in profit to date, even when accounting for the 7% interest he pays the bank.
""To me it didn't feel like a bet because I studied what Tesla does very closely and it's simply inevitable that it would dominate,"" Palampougioukis said, adding that he plans to own the shares for decades.
He is not alone. Retail investors around the world, staunch believers in the company's mission to lead the auto industry into a battery-powered future, have invested their personal money, and at times their parents' retirement funds, in Tesla and reaped handsome rewards. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/39bu0lO)
Tesla reports second-quarter results on Wednesday after the close of trading. While analysts polled by Refinitiv on average expect the company to report a loss, a surprisingly strong vehicle delivery report boosted hopes among many retail investors for a profitable quarter.
Discussions about Tesla on online retail investor forums have surged, with users debating whether to hold their shares in hopes of even higher returns or cash out. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/3jmlmWr) 
While the total number of Tesla retail investors is not known, around 75% of the company's stock is owned by large institutional investors and Tesla executives, including Chief Executive Elon Musk, according to Refinitiv data. 
Tesla shares are among the most popular on U.S. retail investor platforms, such as Robinhood Markets Inc and TD Ameritrade (O:AMTD). The number of users holding Tesla stock on the Robinhood trading app increased more than 400% from the first two weeks of July 2018 to the same point this year, according to data from Robintrack.net, which compiles data on the investing platform.
In South Korea, where Tesla has become the latest craze among tech-savvy professionals, the company is the most-traded overseas stock, with Koreans buying $3.2 billion worth of Tesla shares so far this year, up nearly 13-fold from all of 2019.
Choi Jong-wan, the former head of Korea's Tesla owners' club, borrowed money to invest in Tesla after the company unveiled its Model 3 in 2016. He also bought Tesla stock for his seven-year-old son, taking advantage of Korean inheritance tax breaks.
Choi, who bought a Model S, said the company's shares are supported by its many fans buying stock. Convinced of Musk's vision, Choi bought when Tesla shares tanked in the past.
""I am getting more confident about Tesla,"" he said. ""I will sell Tesla stock when other automakers introduce better electric cars than Tesla at competitive prices.""
Some investors have invested their stock proceeds in the company by buying its vehicles. David, a marketing specialist from Oakland, California, who asked that his last name not be used, bought a Tesla Model 3 last August after selling some of his Tesla shares.
He bought his first Tesla shares for a couple of hundred dollars right out of college in 2010. The company had just listed publicly, with the shares trading around $29.
David has since invested about another $40,000 and currently holds 180 shares.
""Tesla has treated me well so far. I believe in their vision and I believe in Elon Musk,"" he said. ""But the house we bought needs a new roof and I'm thinking to just sell a few shares to pay for that.""

Musk's own net worth has soared even higher thanks to the latest share price rally. The outspoken Tesla boss is within reach of another share-based payday potentially worth as much as $2 billion. Including previously vested tranches, Musk would own options for about $4 billion worth of Tesla shares.

1247,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>","Chevron to buy Noble for $5 billion in stock, biggest oil deal since price crash","By Jennifer Hiller
HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) said on Monday it would buy oil and gas producer  Noble Energy  Inc (O:NBL) for about $5 billion in stock, the first big energy deal since the coronavirus crisis crushed global fuel demand and sent crude prices to historic lows.
Chevron, which last year dropped its offer for Anadarko when Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY) bid more, has been seen as a financially disciplined oil major best positioned to strike a deal during the downturn. This purchase boosts its investments in U.S. shale and in natural gas with Noble (NYSE:NE)'s flagship Leviathan field in Israel, the largest natural gas field in the eastern Mediterranean. 
The deal diversifies Chevron's energy assets and makes it the first oil major to enter Israel. It ""is a tremendous expression of confidence in the Israeli energy market,"" Israel’s Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said in a statement. 
The Israel assets ""will rebalance the portfolio towards gas and provide a springboard"" in the region, said Tom Ellacott, senior vice president at Wood Mackenzie. Chevron's shift to more natural gas output comes as oil companies are under pressure to reduce their carbon footprint. Gas is seen as a cleaner burning fuel.
Chevron Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth said the company was ""mindful"" of tensions between Israel and nearby countries where the company has business including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the Kurdish region of Iraq. He said the company was ""apolitical"" and a ""commercial actor"" in the region.
""We engage with all of our different stakeholders as we go through something like this,"" Wirth said, declining to detail the timing of discussions with partner governments. ""We’re certainly are mindful of the fact that there are political differences and tensions ...amongst those countries.""
Noble ""offers an unique combination of shale as well long-cycle assets,"" much as Anadarko would have, said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones, adding that she thought the deal was unlikely to spark a wave of consolidation.
Pavel Molchanov, analyst with Raymond James, said a bidding war was unlikely, noting the smaller scale of this deal - $5 billion versus the $33 billion Chevron had offered for Anadarko. He said other ""prospective buyers would find it easier to replicate via other means.""
Noble's assets will expand Chevron's shale presence in Colorado and the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field where Chevron had been under pressure to expand. Last year's bid for Anadarko was an attempt to boost Permian production, but Chevron ultimately walked away and instead pocketed a $1 billion break fee.
Since then, margins and drilling in the Permian have been decimated by the coronavirus crisis, which slammed fuel demand and pushed U.S. crude prices down to an average price of $20 per barrel in April. Prices have rebounded, yet they remain depressed, making assets cheaper. Just seven months ago, Noble had a market capitalization of about $12 billion. 
Shares of Noble were up 5.7% to $10.21, after falling more than 60% this year through Friday's close. Chevron was down 1% to $86.18. 
The offer values Noble at $10.38 a share, a 7.5% premium to its Friday close. Including the company's debt pile, the deal is worth roughly $13 billion.
Chevron is paying a ""moderate premium"" reflecting a cautious outlook, said Andrew Dittmar, senior M&A analyst at data provider Enverus, who said ""there aren’t that many companies with Chevron’s balance sheet strength and investor support to make up a buyer base"" even though target companies are ""plentiful.""
Noble shareholders will own about 3% of the combined company, after the deal closes, expected in the fourth quarter.
The deal will help save about $300 million on an annual run-rate basis and add to free cash flow and earnings one year after closing, if global oil prices (LCOc1) stay at $40, Chevron said.

It would add about 18% to Chevron's proved reserves. Noble had proved reserves of 2.05 billion barrels of oil and gas, while Chevron reported 11.4 billion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street advanced with the Nasdaq set to reach a record closing high on Monday, as investors pivoted away from cyclical stocks in favor of market leaders while new cases of COVID-19 spiraled but there were glimmers of hope that an effective vaccine will emerge.
Tech shares provided the biggest boost to all three major U.S. stock indexes, but industrials were down, capping the Dow's gains.
Deaths in the United States from COVID-19 passed the 140,000 mark over the weekend, as cases continued to rise in 42 of 50 states.
Trials of potential vaccines have shown promise. Most recently, drugs from AstraZenica (L:AZN), CanSino Biologics Inc (HK:6185) and from a partnership between  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) and German biotech firm BioNTech (O:BNTX) were safely administered and induced immune responses.
""While there's good news on the vaccine front in early trials, the reality is setting in that it's going to take quite some time,"" Oliver Pursche, president of Bronson Meadows Capital Management in Fairfield Connecticut. ""With industrials and materials down, that is not a reflection of a rebound in the economy."" 
The U.S. Congress, still looking to mitigate the pandemic's economic effects, was set for a week of partisan wrangling over a new relief package, with two weeks until enhanced jobless benefits expire for millions of Americans.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 37.52 points, or 0.14%, to 26,709.47, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 19.72 points, or 0.61%, to 3,244.45 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 190.46 points, or 1.81%, to 10,693.65.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, consumer discretionary (SPLRCD) and tech (SPLRCT) enjoyed the largest percentage gains.
Second-quarter earnings season chugged along. Some 48 companies in the S&P 500 have posted results, with 77.1% of those beating consensus, according to Refinitiv data.
In aggregate, analysts now expect S&P 500 second-quarter earnings to have dropped 43.2% year-on-year, per Refinitiv.
This week,  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) are among the high-profile companies expected to report quarterly results.
Shares  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL) rose 3.5% after posting a surprise adjusted quarterly profit and better-than-expected cash flow due to cost-cutting.
 Noble Energy  Inc (O:NBL) advanced 5.4% on news that  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) agreed to buy the oil and gas producer for $5 billion.
Chevron dropped 2.1%.
 Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) dropped 15.1% on positive results from its competitors' rival COVID-19 drug trials. 
After the bell, International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM) is expected to post second-quarter results. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

GBP/USD rose 0.67% to $1.2649.
Cable has found its footing since falling three weeks in a row since June 21 with the currency pair, trading as a risk asset, rising in tandem with U.S. equities. This correlation is understandable as the U.K. is ""the largest capital importer within G10,"" JPMorgan said.
But as equities move into range-bound trading, and the Brexit process comes to a head in the next few months, it is likely to ""expect that GBP will become rather less dependent on general risk sentiment, and hence start to decouple from other high-beta currencies,"" the bank added.
The latest jump in the pound comes even as further reports suggest that the risk of the U.K. leaving the European Union without a deal continues to gather pace.
As the UK and EU resumed talks on a deal in London on Monday, former President of the EU Commission Jean-Claude Juncker reportedly claimed that U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was ""purposefully"" pushing for a no deal Brexit.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday added 11 Chinese companies implicated in what it called human rights violations in connection with China's treatment of its Uighurs in Xinjiang in western China to the U.S. economic blacklist.
The department said the companies were involved in using forced labor by Uighurs and other Muslim minority groups. They include numerous textile companies and two firms the government said were conducting genetic analyses used to further the repression of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities.
Blacklisted firms cannot buy components from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval.
It was the third group of companies and others in China added to the U.S. entity list, after two rounds in which the Trump administration cited 37 companies and others that it said were involved in China's repression in Xinjiang.
""Beijing actively promotes the reprehensible practice of forced labor and abusive DNA collection and analysis schemes to repress its citizens,"" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.
The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately comment.
The companies added to the blacklist include KTK Group Co, which produces more than 2,000 products used to build high-speed trains, from electronics to seats; and Tanyuan Technology Co, which assembles high thermal conductive graphite reinforced aluminum composites, including some for consumer electronic products.
Another company is Changji Esquel Textile Co, which Esquel Group launched in 2009. Esquel Group produces clothing for Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL), Tommy Hilfiger and Hugo Boss. In April, Esquel denied it used forced labor in Xinjiang.
Also on the blacklist is Hetian Haolin Hair Accessories Co. On May 1, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said it was halting imports of the company's hair products, citing evidence of forced labor.
On July 1, CBP seized in Newark a shipment of almost 13 tons of hair products worth over $800,000 with human hair that originated in Xinjiang.
Commerce previously added 20 Chinese public security bureaus and companies including video surveillance firm Hikvision, as well as leaders in facial recognition technology SenseTime Group Ltd and Megvii Technology in connection with China's treatment of Muslim minorities.

Southwest, with around 60,900 employees in 2019, said it would accept applications from 4,400 for early retirement and evaluate nearly 12,500 requests for extended time off packages.
One person who reviewed the numbers said they represented around 24% of Southwest pilots and 33% of flight attendants.
Meanwhile, Delta spokesman Michael Thomas said early retirement bids from 2,234 pilots before a Sunday deadline was ""meaningful progress as we look to mitigate furloughs."" The company is working to determine next steps and its overall pilot staffing outlook, he said.
Last month Delta sent furlough warnings to around 2,500 pilots, though airlines are generally reluctant to lose pilots because of the timely and costly training needed to bring them back.
If a COVID-19 vaccine is developed and demand returns, airlines want to respond quickly. But for now, many have warned that bookings that began to rise in May and June from dramatic lows in April have leveled off or even fallen due to a rise in COVID-19 cases in some parts of the country.
U.S. airline shares lost 3.4% by midday on Monday. (DJUSAR)
American Airlines (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) have also offered voluntary departure deals while together sending more than 60,000 warnings of potential furloughs to their employees, even as discussions heat up in Washington for a new round of government bailouts.

United, American and Southwest each publish quarterly results this week.

LONDON (Reuters) - An experimental vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) and Oxford University against the new coronavirus produced an immune response in early-stage clinical trials, data showed on Monday, preserving hopes it could be in use by the end of the year. 
The vaccine, called AZD1222, has been described by the World Health Organization's chief scientist as the leading candidate in a global race to halt a pandemic that has killed more than 600,000 people.
More than 150 possible vaccines are in various stages of development, and U.S. drugmaker  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and China's CanSino Biologics also reported positive responses for their candidates on Monday.
The vaccine from AstraZeneca and Britain's University of Oxford prompted no serious side effects and elicited antibody and T-cell immune responses, according to trial results published in The Lancet medical journal, with the strongest response seen in people who received two doses.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose government has helped fund the project, hailed the results as ""very positive news"" though the researchers cautioned the project was still at an early stage. 
""There is still much work to be done before we can confirm if our vaccine will help manage the COVID-19 pandemic,"" vaccine developer Sarah Gilbert said. ""We still do not know how strong an immune response we need to provoke to effectively protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection."" 
AstraZeneca shares surged 10%, but then gave up most of those gains, to close up 1.45% on the day.
AstraZeneca has signed agreements with governments around the world to supply the vaccine should it prove effective and gain regulatory approval. It has said it will not seek to profit from the vaccine during the pandemic. 
AZD1222 was developed by Oxford and licensed to AstraZeneca, which has put it into large-scale, late-stage trials to test its efficacy. It has signed deals to produce and supply over 2 billion doses of the shot, with 300 million doses earmarked for the United States. 
Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive of AstraZeneca, said the company was on track to be producing doses by September, but that hopes that it will be available this year hinged on how quickly late-stage trials could be completed, given the dwindling prevalence of the virus in Britain.
Late-stage trials are under way in Brazil and South Africa and are due to start in the United States, where prevalence is higher.
TARGETING TWO DOSES 
The trial results showed a stronger immune response in 10 people given an extra dose of the vaccine after 28 days, echoing a trial in pigs.
Oxford's Gilbert said the early-stage trial could not determine whether one or two doses would be needed to provide immunity.
""It may be that we don't need two doses, but we want to know what we can achieve,"" she told reporters. 
AstraZeneca's biopharma chief, Mene Pangalos, said the firm was leaning towards a two-dose strategy for later-stage trials, and did not want to risk a single or lower dose that might not work.
The antibody levels generated were ""in the region"" of those seen in convalescent patients, he said.

The trial included 1,077 healthy adults aged 18-55 years with no history of COVID-19. Researchers said the vaccine caused minor side effects more frequently than a control group, but some of these could be reduced by taking the painkiller paracetamol, which is also known as acetaminophen.

A draft deal is ""on the table"" but has yet to be signed subject to approval by members, a spokeswoman for Air France's main SNPL pilots' union said, confirming a report by French daily La Tribune. Air France declined to comment.
The Franco-Dutch group aims to cut some 7,580 jobs by the end of next year as airlines struggle to weather the COVID-19 pandemic and a resulting slump in global travel.

Chief Executive Ben Smith is accelerating cost-cutting measures including the transfer of French domestic services from Air France and its HOP! unit to Transavia. The move requires changes to union agreements that currently bar the no-frills division from competing on domestic routes.

Investing.com -- Got kids in quarantine? With school openings uncertain for the fall and the threat of a fresh round of stay-at-home orders in big U.S. cities, investors may be looking for a new way to get in on the burgeoning field of online learning.
To do so in one fell swoop, look no further than the first education-focused thematic exchange-traded fund, Global X Education ETF (NASDAQ:EDUT), which debuted on July 14. As far as Investing.com can tell, it’s the only pure education play on the market today. Part of the reason for that, according to the fund's creator, is that schooling has largely been in the hands of the government, so there have been fewer opportunities for investors looking for stocks of publicly traded education companies.
“Education is more publicly funded, but we do think that dynamic is changing very quickly as people are looking to plug the gap, not just in the U.S., but around the world,” said Jay Jacobs, head of research at Global X.
Education is comparable to healthcare, but in the latter, about 50% of expenditures come from the private sector, versus about 25% for the former, Jacobs said. Among the fund’s top holdings are China’s TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL),  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:ZM), Pearson PLC ADR (NYSE:PSO) and Bright Horizons (NYSE:BFAM). 
“The allocation is really what’s available on the market,” Jacobs said in a phone interview last week. Companies are likely to evolve to do “full lifecycle learning,” addressing educational needs from nursery through professional development. 
EDUT, a passive ETF, wasn’t created as a Covid-19 play, but it could end up being a good bet with the prevalence of distance learning and school systems in the U.S. showing a reluctance to open. 
“Covid is an accelerant to the theme,” Jacobs said, noting that such thematic ETFs that aim to profit off the pandemic are all the rage right now. 
EDUT’s holdings include categories of educational content, publishing, digital learning platforms, early childhood education, secondary/higher education and enterprise video and chat communications. Jacobs said the ETF took about six months to research and put together."

1266,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 10:55AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Global banks scrutinize their Hong Kong clients for pro-democracy ties,"By Sumeet Chatterjee, James Pomfret and Greg Torode
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global wealth managers are examining whether their clients in Hong Kong have ties to the city's pro-democracy movement, in an attempt to avoid getting caught in the crosshairs of China's new national security law, according to six people with knowledge of the matter.
Bankers at  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN),  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA),  Julius Baer  Gruppe AG (S:BAER) and UBS Group AG (S:UBSG), among others, are broadening scrutiny under their programs that screen clients for political and government ties and subjecting them to additional diligence requirements, these people said.
The designation, called politically exposed persons, can make it more difficult or altogether prevent people from accessing banking services, depending on what the bank finds about the person's source of wealth or financial transactions.
The checks at some wealth managers have involved combing through comments made by clients and their associates in public and in media, and social media posts in the recent past, these people said. The new law prohibits what Beijing describes broadly as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with up to life in prison for offenders.
The sources, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, said the broadened scrutiny of clients also applied to Hong Kong and Chinese officials who had implemented the law in anticipation of any U.S. sanctions against them. 
One banker at a global wealth manager that holds more than $200 billion in assets said the audit of its clients could go back as far as 2014 in some cases to gauge a client's political stance since Hong Kong's 2014 pro-democracy ""umbrella"" movement. Protesters at the time used umbrellas to shield themselves from tear gas and pepper spray deployed by police.
Reuters could not learn the identities of any people who had faced enhanced scrutiny or whether the banks had decided to take any action against people identified as politically exposed. 
Albert Ho, a veteran Hong Kong democrat who runs a law firm and helps organise an annual candlelight vigil to commemorate victims of the June 4, 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, said he feared that people like him may face “difficulties in the times to come.”
“There’s not much you can do, actually, unless you cease all your financial and banking activities in Hong Kong,” Ho said, adding he had not faced additional scrutiny from his bank as of last week. He declined to disclose the name of his bank. 
HSBC declined to comment specifically on the security law or any U.S. move to sanction local officials. In an emailed statement, it said, ""We already have a stringent set of policies and rigorous processes in place which we apply globally.” 
Credit Suisse, Julius Baer and UBS declined to comment.
When asked about the scrutiny after it announced its half-year results on Monday, Julius Baer CEO Philipp Rickenbacher also declined to comment, adding the bank would continue to develop its business in Hong Kong.
In an emailed statement, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said the financial hub implements anti-money laundering requirements ""based on international standards including with regard to politically exposed persons.""
""The relevant international standards and our guidance to the banking industry have not changed,"" the city’s de facto central bank said. 
China's foreign ministry, the Liaison Office in Hong Kong and the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office did not respond to requests for comment. 
BANKS IN FOCUS 
Global banks have long examined the backgrounds of their clients, including screening them for political ties, to satisfy regulatory requirements. Politicians, government officials and senior executives at state-owned enterprises, as well as their family members, are typically considered politically exposed persons. 
The rules are meant to enforce laws such as international sanctions and to prevent people from using the banking system to launder ill-gotten wealth. 
The banks' move to subject supporters of Hong Kong's democracy movement to a similar review comes at a time when the stance of some firms on the Chinese law has drawn scrutiny from Western lawmakers and activists. 
HSBC and  Standard Chartered  Plc (L:STAN), which have expressed support of the national security law, for example, have faced criticism from UK officials that their actions enabled Beijing to undermine the rule of law in the former British colony.
The two London-headquartered banks have said they believed the law would restore stability in Hong Kong.
Both Hong Kong and Chinese officials have said the law was vital to plug holes in national security defences, rejecting criticism from governments, including the United States and the United Kingdom, that China was violating its promise to safeguard Hong Kong's freedom for 50 years after the 1997 handover.
REGULATORY RISKS
Some wealth managers in Hong Kong say they are worried about the regulatory and reputation risks to their banks if charges under the sweeping security law are brought against some of their politically linked clients, three of the sources said.
A top executive at a regional wealth manager said that his firm's risk and compliance team prepared a list of top 10 Hong Kong individuals identified in local media as pro-democracy sympathisers within a couple of days of the enactment of the law on July 1, the anniversary of the handover. 
The executive said their firm checked its internal database to see if they had existing relationship with any of them and were ""quite relieved"" to see that they didn't.
Several elements of the law deal with the seizure of assets, including provisions to give a new police unit greater powers to freeze and confiscate funds and property as well as greater powers to obtain information. Companies can also face penalties, ranging from fines and suspension to the loss of business licenses.

One investment manager at a Hong Kong-based hedge fund said he expected more people to come under scrutiny from their bankers now. ""I think that if even a moderate democrat came through the door wanting to invest, you'd be thinking long and hard after this law,” the fund manager said.

1267,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 10:50AM ET</span>","Walmart, Marks & Spencer brace for tumultuous 'back-to-school' season","By Melissa Fares and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - As more school districts roll back their reopening plans to curb the spread of coronavirus, major retailers in the United States, EU and UK are aggressively discounting back-to-school backpacks and uniforms and airing new advertisements featuring students happily taking classes at home.
In the UK, Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) - a market leader - is offering deeply discounted merchandise, including 25% off across the entire school uniform range and free delivery for orders over £50. Land's End will offer shoppers 60% off all backpacks Monday and Tuesday.
Walmart Inc (N:WMT), which created a mask section in its ""back to school clothing"" department online, has begun airing a commercial showing a boy attending school, alone, in a mask one day, then taking class online in his bedroom the next day. Another ad shows a mom packing up a backpack with school supplies for her daughter to use while performing a chemistry experiment in the backyard.
In Europe, retailers would normally expect increased traffic for at least a week in August depending on when schools reopen, according to Sensormatic Solutions.
But shopper footfall in June and July was down substantially this year—by 60% in Britain, 50% in Spain, Italy and France and more than 30% in Germany. That could spell trouble for retailers where back-to-school is a key sales driver on par with Christmas, according to Thomas Schnabel of the German retailer association HBS.
In Germany, parents tend to start buying just before summer holidays and throughout August, Schnabel said, highlighting how it was lucky lockdowns lifted when they did as he doubted back to school sales would transfer easily online. ""People want to try the pens and feel the fit and the fabric of rucksacks,"" Schnabel said.
In England, all kids are expected to return to school in September, while schools in Los Angeles and San Diego – California's two largest public-school districts - are set to resume classes online only in August.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled a plan for reopening schools in September with a ""blended learning"" schedule that would have students alternating between classrooms and their homes.
U.S. laptop sales may boom as parents anticipate the COVID-19 pandemic will keep at least some classes online, retailers say, citing survey data. But spending on clothing is likely to take a hit. A Deloitte survey of 1,200 U.S. parents in July found they plan to spend 18% less on apparel and 28% more on technology.
Alycia Zimmerman, 38, a Brooklyn, New York, mother of a 3- and a 5-year-old, said she intends to buy fewer outfits for her kids this fall. “There will be a lot of time spent at home when I don’t care if they’re wearing the same thing four days in a row - and they don’t have to look presentable,” she said.
Several retailers - from department store operators Macy’s Inc (N:M),  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN) to discount stores like  Ross Stores Inc  (O:ROST) - canceled summer orders from suppliers at the onset of COVID-19. 
To better manage inventory, Jane Elfers, Chief Executive of Children’s Place said on a June 11 earnings call that the Secaucus, New Jersey-based company had invested in services like ship-from-store.
In the UK, retail executives expect parents to make fewer shopping trips, to fewer retailers. Most schools have a uniform requirement, and generally, there’s a compulsory product - a crested blazer, special tie, a games jersey available only at a particular supplier, while parents can get generic products like a white shirt or black trousers from anywhere, including Marks and Spencer.
""Parents who have to go to a store to go and buy that blazer and tie are then saying, ‘let me by my trousers and my shirts from here because I don't want to go to another store,'"" said Mark Stevenson, co-chair of the Schoolwear Association, a UK group that represents uniform manufacturers.
M&S said Monday it would cut 950 jobs as part of a store management revamp.
Several American makers of uniforms applied for aid from the United States Paycheck Protection Program, which injected about $521.4 billion in taxpayer cash to businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

1268,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 10:30AM ET</span>",Ecuador ploughs on with $17.4 billion debt revamp with major creditor support,"LONDON/QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuador pushed forward with its debt overhaul plans on Monday, requesting a vote among its creditors on reconfiguring the terms of $17.4 billion of its external bonds, with its largest group of creditors backing the proposal.
Under the deal put forward - unchanged from the government's earlier proposal - 10 existing bonds maturing between 2022 and 2030 would be swapped for three bonds due in 2030, 2035 and 2040, as well as a past due interest bond maturing in 2030.
This would provide debt relief of more than $10 billion over the next four years and $6 billion more between 2025-2030 as well as delivering a nominal haircut of 9%.
""This restructuring, if it is accepted, will provide important relief to the country and will allow more resources to be destined to the management of the sanitary crisis and the reactivation and recovery of the economy,"" Ecuador’s finance ministry said in a statement on Monday.
Bondholders will have until July 31 to vote on the deal.
The country's largest creditor grouping, the Ad Hoc Group including major asset managers such as AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB), BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Ashmore, is backing the plan.
""The members of the Ad Hoc Group believe the successful completion of the transactions contemplated by the Invitation will make a substantial contribution to ensuring the sustainability of Ecuador’s external debt in the medium term,"" the group said in a statement on Monday.
The Ad Hoc group collectively holds more than 53% of Ecuador’s total outstanding sovereign bonds and close to or more than 50% of almost every individual bond series.
""We welcome the launch of an offer by Ecuador to restructure its global bonds in a timely and constructive manner,"" wrote Gerry Rice, director of the communications department at the International Monetary Fund.
The deal is not done yet, however.
In its latest proposal, the government said it required the support of creditors holding at least 80% of the aggregate principal of all bonds apart from the 2024 issue. The latter, which has different terms, requires 75% support according to legal experts.
""It appears a somewhat risky strategy to us, and it may result in a temporary stall in the process,"" said Tiago Severo, Vice President of Latin America Economic Research at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), in an email to Reuters.
""However, we remain of the view that the parties will ultimately find common ground and that a comprehensive restructuring will be achieved in the next few/several weeks.""
Other creditors have tried to push for better terms in recent weeks.
A steering committee including Amundi, Contrarian Capital Management, Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo & Co, and T Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW) Associates representing more than 25 institutional investors as well as an ad hoc group of 2024 bond holders urged Quito to sweeten its offer and launched a counter proposal.
They have holdings of more than 25% in certain series of the bonds and more than 35% in others, according to earlier statements. The groups did not immediately respond to request for comment.

(Reuters) - Oilfield services giant  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL) posted its third straight quarterly loss on Monday as it took a $2.1 billion impairment charge amid a slump in oil prices and collapse in drilling by North American customers.
Demand for drilling services offered by Halliburton and rivals like Schlumberger (N:SLB) and  Baker Hughes  (N:BKR) sank after oil prices collapsed in March. U.S. crude futures were trading around $40 per barrel on Monday (CLc1), at the bottom end of what most producers need to be profitable. 
Many smaller oilfield service firms, including fracker BJ Services and sand provider Hi-Crush, have filed for bankruptcy since the price rout began. 
As North American markets face pressure, Halliburton expects its international business to become a bigger contributor to its revenue, Chief Executive Jeff Miller told investors on Monday. 
Halliburton said it anticipates third quarter revenue to decline by low single digits, pressured by lower drilling activity. The company expects North American production to remain ""structurally lower,"" Miller said. 
The Houston, Texas-based company reported a net loss of $1.7 billion, or $1.91 per share, in the second quarter, compared with a profit of $75 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Shares rose 5.05% in early trading to $13.74 as market analysts praised its better-than-expected free cash flow and aggressive cost cutting. 
""We believe 2Q results reflect quicker and potentially stronger cost reductions,"" analysts from  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) wrote in a note on Monday. 
The company reported free cash flow of $456 million, significantly topping expectations. 
Halliburton has slashed its quarterly dividend by 75%, cut its capital spending forecast to half to $800 million, and reduced its workforce and executive pay. The company is about 75% through a target of an annualized $1 billion in cost reductions.

The company posted an adjusted profit of 5 cents per share, versus analysts' expectations for a loss of 11 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

1271,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 10:16AM ET</span>","Exclusive: India seeks new preferential treatment from U.S. on drugs, other goods - sources","By Neha Arora and Aftab Ahmed
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is seeking concessions for generic drugs it exports to the United States in return for opening its dairy markets and slashing tariffs on farm goods as the two sides seek to shore up a new trade deal, three sources said.
India accounts for 40% of U.S. generic drug imports, including the anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine, touted by U.S. President Donald Trump in the fight against the coronavirus.
To win preferential treatment on pharmaceutical exports, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is dangling the carrot of opening its dairy and farm markets to the Trump administration, months ahead of the U.S. presidential election.
""Americans recognise the political compulsion that brings its own benefits,"" one of the sources with knowledge of the plans said.
India, one of the world's largest consumers of dairy products, has offered an opening to U.S. dairy imports through a quota-based system, two of the sources said. These products would need a certificate they are not derived from animals that have consumed feeds that include internal organs, blood meal or tissues of ruminants because of religious sensibilities in India.
India's federal trade ministry did not immediately comment and the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi referred questions to the U.S. Trade Representative.
The two sides have been negotiating a limited trade pact for more than a year aimed at restoring zero tariffs on a range of Indian exports to the U.S. under its Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) that the Trump administration withdrew last year, citing lack of reciprocal access to India's markets. 
RELIANCE ON CHINA
But the Indian side has proposed a more ambitious deal than just focused on the GSP, a second source said. In addition to luring American dairy producers, it has offered to roll back tariff hikes on almonds, walnuts and apples. 
It is the world's largest buyer of U.S. almonds, and second largest for its apples. 
Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross expressed support for concluding an initial trade package and the possibility of an eventual Free Trade Agreement, the Indian government said.
While India seeks concessions on drug exports, the United States has raised concerns over India's import dependence on China for sourcing raw materials for generic drugs, Mukesh Aghi, president and chief executive at U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, told Reuters.
Indian drugmakers rely on China, where the coronavirus was first identified at the end of last year, for almost 70% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients for their medicines. 
""U.S. dependence on China indirectly is tied to India itself. And the U.S. is saying, if you want access to our market then become more self-sufficient than being dependent on China,"" Aghi said.
Differences remain on a large set of issues related to e-commerce and data storage rules. India's decision to levy a new 2% digital tax on foreign transactions, which upset companies such as Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google and Amazon.com (O:AMZN), has become the latest sore point.

""The latest one on digital tax caught the U.S. side by surprise because it was announced in the budget without any discussion or consultation,"" Aghi said.

(Reuters) - Norway's Adevinta has won the auction to buy U.S. e-commerce firm eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY)'s classified ads unit for nearly $9 billion, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday.
EBay intends to keep a minority stake in the business following the close of the deal, the source said. 
The acquisition comes as the coronavirus crisis boosts demand for online market places, with consumers turning to online shopping due to prolonged lockdowns and social distancing measures in most countries.
Activist investors Elliott Management Corp and Starboard Value had been pushing eBay to sell the unit and also its ticket sales business since last January, as part of a plan that could double the company's value. 
""There is a relevant geographic overlap between the two businesses - for example in Germany, Italy, and the UK - but we think the acquisition could also be attractive to reinforce Adevinta's position as a pan-European online classifieds player,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said in a note.
Ebay's classified business includes brands such as Gumtree and Kijiji and offers online ads to more than 1,000 cities around the world. The unit posted operating income of $83 million and revenue of $248 million in the first quarter of 2020.
The eBay deal could help Adevinta double in size. Adevinta's market capitalization at Friday's closing was 79 billion crowns ($8.5 billion). Trading in the company's shares on the Oslo bourse was suspended earlier on Monday in anticipation of an announcement. 
Adevinta owns brands such as Leboncoin, France's biggest online classified ads website, Brazil's OLX and dozens more across Europe, the Americas and North Africa.
It was spun off from Nordic media company Schibsted and listed on the Oslo bourse in 2019 with the express purpose of growing the business in the online classifieds sector and making acquisitions. 
Last week, Reuters reported the U.S. e-commerce giant had received offers for the classified ads unit from online retailer Prosus (OTC:PROSF), a private equity consortium, and Adevinta.

EBay did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, while a spokesman for Adevinta declined to comment.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower on Monday ahead of a pivotal week for the U.S. economy set to be dominated by discussions over a fresh package of fiscal measures to support a flagging economic recovery.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 67 points, or 0.3%, at 26,453 points, while the S&P 500 was down 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4%. 
The oil and gas sector featured heavily in early trade, as oilfield services firm Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) reported a 46% drop in second-quarter revenue and a big net loss due to a $2.1 billion impairment charge. U/nderlying results were somewhat better than expected, however, pushing Halliburton stock up 5.4%.
 Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock fell 1.0% and  Noble Energy  (NASDAQ:NBL) stock rose 7.7% after the major said it would buy the shale player for around $5 billion in stock and assume another $8 billion in debt. That's the biggest deal in the sector since the coronavirus pandemic erupted, and is likely to repeat itself as a welter of shale companies struggle with a combination of heavy debt loads and low prices. 
More intriguingly, financially troubled shale company Denbury Resources (NYSE:DNR) was forced to deny that it had issued a press release claiming to have received a buyout proposal. A press release described by the company as ""fraudulent"" had claimed the company - which missed a coupon payment at the end of June and is seen by some as a possible candidate for bankruptcy - had received an offer more than five times above its Friday closing level of 23c. Denbury stock was up 4c at 27c. 
U.S. Crude futures, meanwhile, lost 0.9% amid broader fears for the strength of the U.S. recovery after the mayor of Los Angeles warned of possible fresh lockdown measures and the coronavirus continued to spread unchecked in Florida and elsewhere.
More encouragingly,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock rose 1.8% and BioNTech stock rose 6.5% after the two companies reported that their experimental drug for treating Covid-19 had triggered positive responses in a phase 1 and 2 clinical trial in Germany. The tests showed that the drug triggered the creation of so-called T-cells that kill not only the virus, but the cells that the virus has infected. Such responses typically suggest a drug can provide more effective and longer-lasting immunity to a disease.
The news contributed to a 15% drop in  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock, inasmuch as test results for its experimental drug released last week looked weak by comparison. Skeptics have also pointed to a high ratio of stock sales by Moderna insiders relative to purchases in recent weeks.
AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) ADRs meanwhile fell 3.9% from their all-time high posted on Friday, on a buy-the-rumor-sell-the-fact move after it too published encouraging results of a phase 2 clinical study for its drug, being developed in partnership with Oxford University.

Airlines around the world have been hammered by a slump in travel demand due to restrictions aimed at containing the coronavirus outbreak, and few expect a quick recovery.
IndiGo in June said it would cut up to 40 billion rupees ($533 million) in costs and speed up the return of older planes to leasing companies.
""These cost savings are clearly not enough to offset the decline in revenues,"" Ronojoy Dutta, chief executive of IndiGo, said in a statement.
Impacted employees will get a severance pay and will be paid for the notice period as well, the company said.
IndiGo, which had 23,531 employees on its rolls as of March 2019, said it was flying only a small percentage of its full fleet of 250 airplanes.
Following coronavirus-related restrictions, India allowed airlines to resume flights in May on domestic routes only and at one-third capacity. The country's aviation regulator earlier this month extended restrictions for international passenger services until July 31.
Indian airlines have, however, been operating rescue flights to bring back stranded citizens living overseas and have so far flown back over 220,000 people from dozens of countries.

Parent Interglobe Aviation (NS:INGL) reported a net loss of 8.73 billion rupees for the quarter ended March 31, including just over a week of India's coronavirus lockdown.

The talks had been put on hold in April so management could focus on dealing with the impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
""Walmart and Asda have restarted conversations with a small number of third-party investors who are interested in acquiring a stake in Asda and partnering with Walmart, following renewed inbound interest,"" the spokesman said.
After Asda's attempt to combine with UK rival  Sainsbury 's (L:SBRY) was blocked by the competition regulator last year, Walmart said it was considering a stock market listing for Asda. Then in February, Walmart said it was in talks with possible buyers of a majority stake in the group.
Those talks progressed until the coronavirus hit.
""We believe now is the right time to explore options for a third party to invest in our business to accelerate the long-term delivery of our value strategy, both in stores and online,"" the Walmart spokesman said.
He added that the pandemic had demonstrated Asda's resilience and the key role it plays in supporting communities in Britain.

In May, Asda CEO Roger Burnley told Reuters he did not think the crisis had diminished third-party interest in the business.

LONDON (Reuters) - The erosion of Hong Kong's ""specialness"" and its rapidly aging population could see its trend growth more than halve over the next decade and even plunge to zero in a ""plausible"" downside scenario, rating agency S&P Global estimated on Monday. 
Hong Kong's long-term economic prospects faced risks from the deterioration in the U.S.-China relationship, resulting in a decoupling of the U.S. dollar and Chinese financial systems, the agency said. 
A second risk was an accelerated financial opening of mainland China that would lessen Hong Kong's role as a global financial centre.
""Hong Kong's specialness is being eroded,"" S&P said in a new report. ""A plausible downside scenario could see trend growth of zero in a decade,"" it added, saying its ""baseline"" estimate was for a fall to 1.1% by 2030 compared to 2.7% back in 2018.
A downside scenario would be an acute or chronic deterioration in macroeconomic stability and prospects. 
""We see the most likely catalysts for each of these scenarios being financial decoupling from the U.S. and a gradual, persistent rise in domestic policy uncertainty, respectively,"" S&P said.
Washington is reviewing Hong Kong's special status under its legal system in reaction to China's decision to enact a new national security law for the former British colony, despite its wide-ranging autonomy and guarantees of freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.
""While the economic impact of such efforts could be very large, at this point we see this as an extreme tail risk rather than a plausible downside for the Hong Kong economy,"" S&P said.

Hong Kong's financial industry has long been a cornerstone of the city's prosperity. It accounts for nearly one-fifth of the economy, almost double the level just before the 1997 handover from British rule to China.

LONDON (Reuters) - Regulators in Britain and the European Union said they have dusted off their no-deal Brexit agreements to avoid disruption in cross-border asset management.
Britain left the EU in January, but unfettered access to the European market has continued under a transition agreement that ends in December.
Negotiations of a new UK-EU trade pact have stumbled, and Britain's requests for direct financial market access are being separately by Brussels.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Friday that memoranda of understanding (MOUs) drawn up in February 2019 in case Britain left the bloc without a transition deal ""remain appropriate"".
They will now come into effect after the end of December, when the transition period expires, ESMA and the FCA said in separate statements.
One MoU allows for EU and UK regulators to swap information, a legal requirement for the continuation of ""delegation"", or funds registered in EU countries like Ireland and Luxembourg outsourcing stock-picking to managers in London or elsewhere outside the bloc.
Delegation avoids the need to move portfolio managers to where the funds are domiciled.
""This was a rare bit of good news,"" a senior official at a UK-based asset management company said.
In 2019, Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and BlackRock (N:BLK) had considered temporarily moving some UK-based asset managers to New York before the original MoUs were agreed, since the United States already had such cooperation agreements with Brussels.
The other MoUs cover credit-rating agencies, allowing regulators to swap information on Moody's (NYSE:MCO), S&P and Fitch whose analysts in London rate companies in the EU. Trade repositories are also covered.
Brussels is assessing whether to grant direct financial market access, known as equivalence, to a range of financial services from January.
London and Brussels missed a deadline at the end of June for completing assessments, but Britain said last week it had now returned all EU questionnaires.

The bloc has said it will allow EU investors to continue using derivatives clearing houses in Britain temporarily after December.

1281,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>",‘Follow the Fed’ Mantra May Soon Fizzle Out Across Bond Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- A breakneck rally across bond markets may slow as traders come to grips with the notion that the Federal Reserve’s support isn’t unconditional.
After a torrid rally sparked by the Fed’s announcement in March that it would begin buying corporate debt, investment-grade bonds have stalled near record levels. A similar pattern holds true for high-yield markets, where spreads are broadly trading sideways after the asset class’s best returns in a decade brought them close to pre-pandemic levels. And the central bank’s oft-repeated commitment to keeping interest rates low have locked benchmark Treasury yields into an unrelenting range close to historic lows.
The degree to which bond markets have rebounded after a trading freeze during March’s turmoil is largely the reason why they’re stalling out now. A parade of policy makers have hinted in recent weeks that the central bank won’t have to expand its balance sheet and buy bonds as aggressively as anticipated, with liquidity restored and primary markets buzzing. While bets the Fed isn’t going to be blindly buying bonds has capped gains for now, prospects that it might start again has cushioned any downside, according to  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute.
“There has been a slight misunderstanding between the markets and the Fed,” said Sameer Samana, Wells Fargo Investment’s senior global market strategist. “What the Fed has basically said is: ‘Our goal is to make sure we have orderly and liquid markets.’ The market has taken that to mean, ‘Okay, we’re going to buy like there’s no tomorrow.’ If the market’s able to trade efficiently, the Fed is starting to see their job as mission accomplished.”
After soaring 150 basis points in March, high-grade spreads tightened by 70 basis points in April and have dropped about 12 basis points half-way through July through Thursday. Junk-bond spreads have tightened 57 basis points so far in July, after a 380 basis-point surge amid March’s turmoil.
Weekly figures published Thursday showed that the Fed’s balance sheet edged higher over the past week -- after falling for roughly a month -- but remained below $7 trillion. It exploded by $3 trillion from early March to mid-June as the central bank pumped liquidity into the financial system to keep credit flowing via short-term loans and bond buying.
To be sure, there’s a reason ‘don’t fight the Fed’ is one of the most commonly deployed refrains in financial markets. The central bank has nearly unlimited firepower at its disposal to support the U.S. economy, the sheer magnitude of which was on display after the Fed slashed rates to near-zero and pumped trillions worth of liquidity into markets. Among the tools yet to be tapped are yield-curve control, an option that Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) didn’t rule out in an interview Thursday.
Now, markets are largely back to normal and policy makers see the balance sheet’s decline as a healthy sign. But that’s after the Fed’s late-March pledge to buy corporate debt set of a wave of front-running flows, with credit ETFs and mutual funds absorbing record amounts of cash. As analysts downsize their forecasts for the central bank’s balance-sheet growth, investors are assessing whether that was overkill.
“People got a little bit carried away, were probably a little bit too positioned, and we forget that bonds often are kind of boring and we’re getting to that stage. If you want quick returns, it’s hard to see how you get them with some of these yields where they are,” said Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities. “With investment grade and high-yield, you’re back to hoping you can clip a coupon rather than any big price appreciation.”
The slimming-down of the balance sheet also helps explain why the equity market -- outside of the megatech stocks -- have hit a wall as well, according to Samana. While the S&P 500 has rebounded almost 45% since March’s low to nearly erase this year’s losses, the bulk of those gains came before early June, and are largely thanks to tech heavyweights pushing the index higher. In contrast, the small-cap Russell 2000 Index is still 12% lower year-to-date.
“Equities haven’t really gone anywhere since early June, that dovetails nicely with the slowdown in the balance sheet,” Samana said. “It’s a very small sliver of the equity market that’s making all-time highs and its the part that not only benefits from what the Fed’s done, but also benefits from all the Covid-related things.”

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - India is looking to privatise more than half of its state-owned banks to reduce the number of government-owned lenders to just five as part of an overhaul of the banking industry, government and banking sources said.
The first part of the plan would be to sell majority stakes in  Bank of India  (NS:BOI),  Central Bank of India  (NS:CBI),  Indian Overseas Bank  (NS:IOBK),  UCO Bank  (NS:UCBK), Bank of Maharashtra and Punjab & Sind Bank (NS:PUNA), leading to an effective privatisation of these state-owned lenders, a government official said. 
""The idea is to have 4-5 government owned banks,"" said one senior government official. At present, India has 12 state-owned banks.
The government official said that such a plan would be laid out in a new privatisation proposal the government is currently formulating, and this would be put before the cabinet for approval.
India's Finance ministry declined to comment on the matter.
The government is working on a privatisation plan to help to raise money by selling assets in non-core companies and sectors when the country is strapped for funds due to lack of economic growth caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Several government committees and the Reserve Bank of India have recommended that India should have not more than five state-owned banks.
""The government has already said that there will be no more mergers (between state-owned banks) so the only option for them is to divest stakes,"" a senior official at a state-owned bank said. 
Last year, the government had merged ten state-owned banks into four, creating a handful of larger banks in the process.
""Now we are thinking of selling the unmerged banks to private players,"" the government official said.
But the government's privatisation plan is being worked out when the banks may face rising bad loans later this financial year because of the fallout from the coronavirus crisis.
The divestment plans may not happen in this financial year due to unfavourable market conditions, the sources said. 
India expects bad loans at its banks could double after the crisis brought the economy to a standstill. Indian banks already had 9.35 trillion rupees ($124.38 billion) of soured loans, equivalent to about 9.1% of their total assets at the end of September 2019.

As a result, the government may need to pump in nearly $20 billion into its state-owned banks.

M&S said it had started a consultation with its employee representative group and had set out its intention to first offer voluntary redundancy to affected workers across central support functions, central operations and property and store management.
The cuts form part of M&S's plan to move to a ""leaner, faster retail management structure,"" it said.
Britain's retailers, already struggling with high rents, business taxes, tight margins and online competition, were particularly hammered by the coronavirus lockdown.

Earlier this month health and beauty chain Boots (O:WBA) announced 4,000 job cuts, while department store chain John Lewis said it would likely shed 1,300.

Airlines UK said on Monday that the government should waive Air Passenger Duty for a year to save routes and up to 8,000 jobs in an industry which has been battered by the virus, and which is already facing over 30,000 job cuts. 
Britain's airlines, airports and ground handling companies have benefitted from government employment support schemes and loans but there has been no specific support package for the industry. 
That's in contrast to some other European countries which have stepped in to help, such as France which granted Air France 7 billion euros ($7.9 billion) in aid, including state-backed loans, to help it to survive.
Many UK airlines are worried about the coming winter season, traditionally a tougher period for them financially as fewer people travel.
""UK airports are in danger of losing many valuable routes over the coming months unless the government steps in with a support package for our sector – starting with an emergency APD waiver to get us through the winter and into the recovery,"" said Airlines UK CEO Tim Alderslade. 
Airlines UK said on Monday that APD relief would boost passenger demand by around 12% over the next 12 months.

APD is a tax on passenger flights from UK airports which adds 13 pounds ($16.37) to an economy ticket for a flight between the UK and Europe, but which can add over 170 pounds to some long-haul business class tickets.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A $4.5 billion deal under which Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) Google will collaborate with India's  Reliance Industries  (NS:RELI) on a new smartphone likely heralds a big shake-up for the world's second-largest mobile market, industry executives and analysts say.
Reliance boss Mukesh Ambani, announcing the partnership at his company's annual meeting last week, said Google would build an Android operating system (OS) to power a low-cost ""4G or even 5G"" smartphone that Reliance would design.
The new phone is set to pose a major challenge to Chinese vendors such as  Xiaomi  (HK:1810) and BBK Electronics, owner of the Realme, Oppo and Vivo brands, which currently dominate a $2 billion market for sub-$100 smartphones in India.
Powered by a clever mix of Bollywood, cricket-driven marketing and product features such as powerful cameras, the Chinese firms sell roughly eight of every 10 smartphones in the country.
""If history is anything to go by, Reliance will undercut other brands and pose a real threat to the low-end smartphone market,"" said Rushabh Doshi of tech researcher Canalys.
Reliance executed a similar plan in 2017 with the launch of the JioPhone, a no-frills device that gave users internet access for as little as $20. JioPhone now has more 100 million users, many of whom are internet first-timers.
""They (the Chinese players) are likely to cut their price to compete and their margins could shrink,"" said A Gururaj, the former India head of contract manufacturers Wistron (TW:3231) and Flextronics. ""I see the Google-Jio phone as a big hit.""
Reliance's ambition to hand a smartphone to every Indian could also win subscribers from telecoms rivals Vodafone Idea (NS:VODA) and Bharti Airtel, who still have hundreds of millions of users with old-style feature phones on basic 2G networks.
Realme declined to comment. Reliance, Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo did not respond to requests for comment.
Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
CONTENT IS KING
The alliance will see Google invest $4.5 billion in Reliance's digital unit, which houses telecoms and fibre businesses as well as music and movie apps.
Jio Platforms has also since April won the backing of global financial and tech investors including Intel (O:INTC) and Qualcomm (O:QCOM), which could bolster its smartphone ambitions. 
While Reliance has given no details on the specifications or price of the new smartphone, the timing of its launch, or who might build it, the Jio network's 387 million subscribers and the Google brand name will give it a big leg up.
The Reliance-Google phone would likely be optimised for the Jio network and offer users improved performance, said Arvind Vohra, a tech consultant and the former India head of China's Gionee.
Just as important are the possibilities for bundling Jio's massive video and music libraries with the phone. Google's Android team also aims to ensure access to apps related to health, communications and jobs, and ease of use for first time smartphone owners, Sameer Samat, vice president for Android and Play at Google, told Reuters.
That kind of packaging could help woo roughly 350 million Indians who still use basic, non-touch phones and are yet to taste high-speed mobile data on fancier devices.
""This will help users choose a device for its software and bundled content rather than just specs alone,"" said Vohra.
The collaboration with Google could also set the stage for further partnerships between smartphone makers and Reliance to make devices specifically for the Jio telecoms network, said analysts.
Some Jio customers are already making plans to upgrade to the Reliance-Google smartphone when it hits the market.

""I'd like to try the new Reliance smartphone and since I'm already a Jio customer my first preference will be to remain with the network,"" said Rawil Ansari, a construction worker from a village in India's eastern Bihar state, who has been using a JioPhone for the past two years.

1286,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 07:25AM ET</span>",Uber offers COVID-19 contact tracing help amid chaotic U.S. response,"By Tina Bellon
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc has quietly launched a service to give public health officials quick access to data on drivers and riders presumed to have come into contact with someone infected with COVID-19, company officials told Reuters.
The service, offered free of charge, could help burnish the image of the ride-hailing giant, which recently launched a new ad campaign spotlighting its ""No Mask, No Ride"" policy in the United States.
Now being promoted to government health officials in all the countries where it operates, the service provides health departments with data about who used Uber's services and when and allows health agencies to urge affected users into quarantine, the company officials said. 
Information on an individual can be accessed in a few hours, the officials said, with the company considering COVID-19 an emergency involving danger of death or serious physical injury. (https://ubr.to/2Wy3v4Z)
Though Uber has provided the data for months now, it has not been put to use in many U.S. virus hotspots. 
A recent Reuters review of contact tracing policies by 32 U.S. state and local health departments found most did not use ride-hailing data to track the virus spread. Among those neglecting the data are Texas and Florida, states that have seen a surge in new infections.
Unlike several other countries, the United States has no federal program or mobile application to trace the contacts of people with coronavirus infections, a measure deemed crucial by the World Health Organization in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not respond to requests for comment.
Dozens of U.S. states in recent weeks began hiring thousands of workers to interview infected patients, identify people they have been in contact with and then order those individuals to isolate. Ride-hailing data could play an important role in that effort, health officials and experts said, because it identifies a larger set of people outside the direct social circle of an infected individual.
""This data could be potentially life-saving in cities where many people use those services,"" said Mieka Smart, an epidemiology professor at Michigan State University and a member of the COVID-19 contact tracing workgroup in Flint. 
Uber has long provided data to U.S. law enforcement officials in emergencies or criminal investigations, companies officials said. It first began to focus on health-related issues in 2019, when a resurgence of U.S. measles cases prompted several health departments to request data, the officials said.
In January, company executives flew to Los Angeles to meet with the local health department and CDC officials to discuss how Uber's data could best be used, according to Uber's chief of global law enforcement, Mike Sullivan.
The discussion quickly turned to the novel coronavirus, which at the time was only beginning to spread outside of China.
""Our timing ended up being beneficial in that it allowed us to get ahead before COVID started ramping up globally,"" said Sullivan, a veteran U.S. prosecutor who leads a team of 100 Uber employees handling data requests around the clock.
In the first half of the year, Uber received a total of some 560 coronavirus-related requests from public health departments in 29 countries, most of which were processed by the company within two hours, company officials said. That compares to only 10 requests from health departments globally in 2019.
Out of the total, 158 requests were filed by health authorities in nearly 40 locations around the United States.
Using the new portal, designed for exclusive use by public health departments, data can be sought based on trip receipts or passenger names. Health officials are prompted to specify what action they want Uber to take as part of the service.
""We want to make sure that they are the experts and we follow their recommendations"" on whether to block temporarily a driver, rider or courier from using Uber's service, Sullivan said. Uber customers with a confirmed infection are automatically blocked from the platform for at least 14 days.
Uber has seen an increase in contact tracing requests from countries credited for their initial success in containing the virus, such as Australia and New Zealand, Sullivan said. He added that contact tracing was also much more coordinated in several European countries than in the United States, including in the UK.
U.S. contact tracing efforts vary from region to region. In some areas, the effort is coordinated on the state level, while cities or counties take charge in others, requests from health departments show.
In Massachusetts, for example, local health departments gather trip details if an infected person tells investigators they have taken a ride-hailing trip. That information is then transferred to the state's health department, which reaches out to Uber or  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) to request data.
Lyft said it provided data to U.S. and Canadian health officials through its Law Enforcement Request system, but declined to provide further details, citing privacy reasons.
In California, local officials handle the entire contact tracing process. San Francisco so far has requested ride-hailing data related to the coronavirus pandemic in a handful of cases, according to Michael Reid, a physician who heads the city's contact tracing program.

""In the end, we need all the data we can to be effective,"" said Reid. ""Whether it's Uber or Lyft, or the priest telling you who was in church on Sunday.""

Europe's biggest aerospace and defence companies Airbus (PA:AIR), BAE Systems (L:BAES) and Leonardo (MI:LDOF) had expected to spend this week showcasing aircraft and entertaining clients at the biennial Farnborough Airshow in southern England.
But with the event cancelled, chief executives instead joined a webcast as part of ""Virtual Farnborough"" to discuss coping strategies for the gravest crisis in commercial aviation history. 
""I think the challenge is to keep investing in spite of the crisis that is taking away a lot of our investment capacity,"" Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said. 
Faury said co-operation between governments, bigger companies and smaller suppliers was better than he had seen for years, and that was helping processes become faster and cheaper.
Britain's aerospace industry, which employs 375,000, is not only facing the COVID-19 crisis, but also the threat of a disorderly exit from the European Union when a transition period ends this year. 
Tony Wood, CEO of UK-based  Meggitt  (L:MGGT) which supplies parts to aircraft manufacturers, called on the UK government to do more to accelerate programmes such as Tempest, a UK plan to build a new fighter jet, and investment in a zero-emissions flight to help boost the industry. 
""We're in close dialogue with the government. We'll be talking to them further this week, and hoping to try and accelerate and conclude some of those agreements,"" Wood said. 
Faury said he continued to see the relationship between Airbus and Britain, where Airbus produces wings, as a ""successful partnership"". 
On the possibility of a disorderly Brexit, he said: ""We don't like it, but it's one problem among others that we have to solve."" 

Britain's business minister Alok Sharma said on Monday that the government would provide grants totalling 200 million pounds ($252 million) to support technology to make flying more efficient.

1289,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 07:05AM ET</span>","Euro, euro zone bond markets hold out hope for recovery fund; stocks higher","By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro and euro zone bond markets held out hope European Union leaders would strike a deal on a recovery fund for the bloc's pandemic-ravaged economy on Monday, while the region's stock markets inched cautiously higher as talks paused.
The single currency hit its highest levels against the dollar since March 9, at $1.1467 after reports of progress following three days of negotiations towards the proposed 750 billion-euro fund. 
Bond markets also cheered the progress, with the risk premium investors pay for holding Italian government debt over Germany's - the bloc's benchmark - falling to 161 basis points, its lowest level since March 27.
Stock markets were more reserved in their optimism, however. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was 0.1% higher by mid-morning trade in London, with a risk-off tone expressed in sectoral gainers and losers.
""The euro has gained on the likelihood that they do come up with some solution at this meeting,"" said Marshall Gittler, head of investment research at BDSwiss Group.
""I had expected them to fail, or at best to come to only a partial agreement, but the fact that they’ve kept at it for this long shows that they really are determined to succeed,"" Gittler said. A successful agreement would probably give the euro a further boost, he said.
Talks on the fund were adjourned on Monday until 1600 CET (1400 GMT). After the adjournment was announced, both the Austrian Chancellor Sebestian Kurz and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said progress was being made.
A group of wealthy northern European states pushed during the summit for a smaller recovery fund and sought to limit how payouts are split between grants and repayable loans.
An attempt to reach a compromise failed on Sunday. A deal envisaging 400 billion euros in grants - down from a proposed 500 billion euros - was rejected by the north, which said it saw 350 billion euros as the maximum.
Discussions over the grants has since narrowed, with EU summit Chairman Charles Michel saying they would be based on 390 billion euros combined with smaller rebates.
""The chances of a deal appear higher now than before the weekend, with the Frugal Four winning concessions while also acknowledging grants must be part of the deal,"" strategists at UBS Global Wealth Management said in a note to clients.
""While it remains to be seen if a deal can be done today, we continue to expect an eventual agreement, which would act as a catalyst for the euro and support Eurozone equities and bonds."" 
They added that they expected the euro to rise in the second half of 2020 as economies bounce.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to start mixed Monday, with the looming prospect of fresh lockdown measures in the U.S. offsetting hopes for a fresh stimulus package out of Washington.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 6 points, or 0.2%, lower, Nasdaq Futures up 7 points, or 0.1%. The Dow Futures contract fell 31 points, or 0.1%.
The second-quarter earnings season really kicks into gear this week, with almost 80 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report.The quarter is on course to see the largest drop in profits since the fourth quarter of 2008, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices, and investors will be looking at results from the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for guidance this week.   IBM  (NYSE:IBM) earnings are due after the closing bell Monday.
The energy sector will be one in a particularly harsh spotlight. Oil and gas services company Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) announced a 46% drop in second-quarter revenue on the year Monday as firms cut back on drilling expenditures. Drillers cut the number of oil and natural gas rigs operating to a record for an 11th week in a row, Baker Hughes data showed on Friday. 
Elsewhere, shale company  Noble Energy  (NASDAQ:NBL) agreed to be bought by  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) for just under $5 billion in an all-stock deal. The company had been worth over twice as much at the start of the year.
The epidemic isn't stopping for earnings season, though. In the U.S., more than 3.7 million people have been infected and 140,000 killed. Daily growth in cases has tripled to more than 70,000 since mid-May, and the 7-day moving average of deaths, after falling steadily from April to July, has turned higher.
U.S. lawmakers return to work this week against the background of these Covid-19 numbers, and are set to resume contentious talks on a new coronavirus-aid bill.
The Republicans want the upcoming stimulus bill to cost no more than $1 trillion while leading Democrats are seen as asking for something approaching three times as much. Analysts fear that a less generous package will mean that the already fragile economic rebound will falter.
The U.S. economic data slate is empty Monday.
Oil prices fell Monday as the growth of coronavirus cases around the globe continued to pose a threat to the recovery in fuel demand. While fuel demand has recovered from the record drop in April after countries around the world imposed strict lockdowns, usage is still below pre-pandemic levels.

1292,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>",BNP Paribas plays long-game to be Europe's banking winner from COVID crisis,"By Maya Nikolaeva and Gwénaëlle Barzic
PARIS (Reuters) - When the COVID-19 crisis struck Europe, companies turned to one bank more than any other to arrange emergency loans:  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP).
The French lender took advantage of internal restructurings at European rivals, at a time when U.S. banks were preoccupied with rescues at home. It expanded its balance sheet by 23% to 2.7 trillion euros in the first quarter, extending multi-billion sums to the likes of energy giant  BP  (NYSE:BP) and automaker Daimler (OTC:DDAIF).
By comparison, competitors such as Santander (MC:SAN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) barely expanded their balance sheets by 5%. 
BNP, the euro zone's biggest lender, has long had a goal of becoming Europe's dominant investment bank and aims to use the lending platform built in the crisis to further this ambition, according to several bankers and a source close to BNP's management.
BNP declined to comment for this story ahead of its results on July 31.
""Can BNP take advantage of the quality and resilience of its profits to grow (European) market share? I think the answer is, yes,"" said Francois Chaulet, managing director at Montsegur Finance, whose funds invest in BNP.
However capitalising on lending growth to earn higher-margin business from customers it has lent to, such as advising on equity issuance or mergers and acquisitions, has been a hard nut to crack and still doesn't look easy. 
While the bank's risk-weighted assets grew by 5.5% between 2015 and 2019, and revenue rose 3.9%, its return on tangible equity - a measure of profitability - has remained flat at around 10%.
TRAILING ON M&A
In the first half of 2020, BNP has trailed Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Deutsche Bank,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Credit Suisse in terms of merger mandates, ranking outside the top 10 advisers, and came in ninth on equity deals, unchanged from a year ago.
""Just because you have lent a lot of money does not mean that you can do for a large European corporate client everything that the client wants to do: it takes specific skills, and money is not everything,"" said a senior Paris-based investment banker at a foreign rival.
""American competition is very tough ... they (BNP) know they have the balance sheet, but it's hard.""
BNP's corporate banking business combines M&A, ECM activity and syndicated loans, as well as trade finance and cash management. It accounts for more than a third of its corporate and institutional banking revenue, which also includes markets and securities services. 
For now, upping its lending is allowing BNP to shed its image as a French-only bank. 
It was the sole underwriter on a $10 billion credit facility for Britain's BP (L:BP) in early April - an unusual move for such a large facility, particularly in a sector like energy that is under strain. The loan was then syndicated to 20 banks.
""The leaders of BNP used to say: my first client is the French economy,"" said a person who used to work close to the top management of the bank. ""More recently, they say my first client is the European economy.""
INTERNATIONAL PUSH
As it has pushed to court more international clients, BNP - long the go-to bank for the French establishment - has played hardball on some corporate rescues in its home market, according to six banking and industry sources close to the deals.
It imposed stiffer terms on a 4-billion-euro state-backed loan for flagship carrier Air France, for example, extracting a bigger guarantee from the French government following heated discussions with officials, the people said. 
""BNP Paribas was especially difficult,"" one legal source who worked on that deal said.
The French finance ministry declined to comment on the process, while Air France was not immediately available to comment. 
The approach partly reflected prudent risk-management.
But two investment banking sources said the tussle was also a sign of BNP's desire to ensure it had enough resources to pursue its international growth strategy without being sucked into local pressure to bail out too many companies. 
""It is more about where BNP wants to allocate capital,"" said one of the sources, who was involved in the Air France bailout.
Nonetheless, BNP is still poised to lend significant sums at home, having said this month it had received 17 billion euros in demands from French companies for state-backed loans – a higher proportion than its usual market share for such lending. 
Bankers at rival banks said BNP could profit, as a first step, by picking up mandates to help companies in France that received loans and needed restructuring or capital injections. 
Cementing that kind of work could be key. As government support programmes start to be wound down, the risk of loans on its newly expanded books turning sour could increase. 
""BNP's balance sheet continues to swell,"" analysts at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) wrote in June. ""BNP is more sensitive than most to changes in credit quality"".

1293,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 06:05AM ET</span>",Surging demand for medical equipment puts Philips on course for second-half recovery,"By Bart H. Meijer
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Electrical equipment maker Philips said a recent surge in orders for scanners and other medical equipment should enable group sales and margins to rebound over the next six months from a slump in the second quarter.
The Dutch company, which makes products ranging from electrical toothbrushes to high-end hospital equipment, said its core earnings fell by almost a quarter in April-June to 418 million euros as sales dropped 6% to 4.4 billion euros, hit by the impact on demand of the coronavirus pandemic. 
The results, however, were better than analysts had expected. While the pandemic had hit demand for some products in the second quarter, Philips said the virus had also spurred a 27% increase in new orders as hospitals rushed to buy CT scanners, ventilators and monitoring equipment needed to help patients battling the respiratory disease.
Shares in the company were up 4.3% in late morning trade making them the only notable winner on Amsterdam's blue chip AEX index.
A company-compiled poll of analysts had predicted second-quarter adjusted EBITA would drop to 344 million euros, on sales of 4.34 billion euros.
""For the full year 2020 we continue to aim for a modest comparable sales growth and adjusted EBITA margin improvement,"" Chief Executive Frans van Houten told a media call.
The surge in new orders in the second quarter followed on from a 23% rise in orders in the first quarter, reflecting strong demand for medical equipment during the pandemic. In the second quarter of last year, the group's total new orders rose by just 8%.
Longer term, van Houten said the pandemic had led hospitals to look at ways to better deal with highly infectious diseases.
This includes the need for devices that enable careworkers to remotely monitor patients, which are at the heart of Philips' strategy to make better use of patient data and internet technology to enable patients to remain at home, he said.
""Hospitals want to create a more resilient infrastructure where patients that are infected can be treated in a different way and elective procedures can continue"", Van Houten said.
""That bodes well for Philips, also beyond 2020.""
CHINA RECOVERY STAGNATES
Philips shares have in recent months recovered to levels seen at the end of 2019, after losing over a third of their value in the first quarter of this year.
""Philips reported a much better than expected second quarter update"", ING analyst Marc Hesselink said, adding that he expected Philips to meet its growth outlook for the year.

Van Houten said the results were helped by a stronger than anticipated rebound in consumer demand in Europe, but the recovery in China had stagnated after an initial surge when lockdowns were eased.

1294,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 05:33AM ET</span>","StockBeat: AstraZeneca, Philips, Synairgen Put Virus Fight Center Stage","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- For most of the four months since Europe and North America went into lockdown to stop the Covid-19 virus, investors have been focusing on which stocks will profit most from the economic changes likely to follow it.
In Europe, at least, it’s been relatively rare for the stocks in the front line of combating the infection to be at center stage. However, that’s definitely the case on Monday, with the market eagerly awaiting the results of the latest trial of the experimental drug being developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca (LON:AZN).
The medical journal The Lancet is due to publish the results of the first large-scale human trial of the experimental vaccine, a trial that has involved 9,000 patients in South Africa and Brazil. Early-stage results had shown that the drug had provided double protection from Covid-19, triggering the body to produce both antibodies and so-called T-cells to kill the infection.
Antibodies are proteins that kill the virus itself. T-cells, meanwhile, can also kill the cells it has infected, greatly strengthening the body’s response to viral infections. The contribution of T-cells is important because antibodies can weaken within a few months, reducing a person’s long-term immunity to the virus.
Speculation that the results will be encouraging already drove AstraZeneca’s stock to a new all-time high on Friday, and it added a further 2.1% by mid-morning in London on Monday. Its 23% rise so far this year has made it the most valuable stock in the FTSE 100, worth 124 billion pounds ($156 billion).
If the results are positive, Adrian Hill, director of Oxford University’s Jenner Institute, has indicated that the critical phase 3 trials may be completed by the end of the year, complemented by a so-called ‘challenge trial’, in which healthy volunteers are deliberately exposed to the virus in a controlled lab setting. Challenge trials can typically be completed in less time.
However, AstraZeneca wasn’t the only biotech company in the spotlight on Monday. Dutch medical giant Koninklijke Philips NV (AS:PHG) stock rose 4.8% to its highest since January after saying it expects profits to return to a year-on-year increase in the second half, as it works through a ballooning order backlog. The company's results had been hit by drops in demand for its non-Covid-19 related products and services in the first half, but the second quarter was supported by a surge in demand for its ventilators. 
U.K.-based small-cap Synairgen (LON:SYNG), spun out of the University of Southampton’s research facilities, rose as much as 300% after it announced highly encouraging early-stage trial results for its experimental Covid-19 treatment, a protein called interferon beta.
The test results indicated the drug cut the chances of a Covid-19 patient in hospital developing severe disease - such as requiring ventilation – by nearly 80%.
Patients were also more than twice as likely to recover to a degree where the disease would not inhibit their everyday lives, the company said.
Separately, GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) said it will invest 150 million euros ($173 million) in CureVac, the German-based biotech company at the center of a diplomatic incident between the U.S. and Germany earlier this year.
CureVac fired its CEO Daniel Menichella in March after reports that he had accepted overtures from the Trump administration to make its experimental drug available exclusively to the U.S."

MUMBAI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - India's Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) said on Monday it expected to resolve about 57% of its near trillion rupee ($13.35 billion) debt pile even as the pandemic delayed the resolution process in some of the group companies. 
About 50% of the debt is expected to be resolved by March 2021, the indebted infrastructure lender's board said in a progress report, with 18% already addressed as of June end. The board had said in an update in October that it aimed to resolve 50% of the debt by March this year. 
""So far whatever we have achieved, I do believe, is relatively successful given the current macro-economic situation, because this has been a triple whammy for all of us: bad lending, no follow up, and economic disaster all around,"" Vice-Chairman Vineet Nayyar told reporters. 
The new board, led by banker Uday Kotak, was appointed by the government in 2018 after a series of defaults by IL&FS and its group companies triggered concerns of a bad debt crisis in India's shadow banking sector.
Since then, management has put several of its group companies up for sale to raise funds to pay off creditors.
The total number of group entities has fallen to 276 from 347, the company said, adding that only 60 group entities will remain by March 2021.
The coronavirus pandemic has led to one bidder walking away from a road project at the last minute and is expected to erode the value of bids in real estate assets, Managing Director CS Rajan said. The claims process is also a challenge, with liquidity constraints at state governments, he added.
""This is the game plan we have given considering the risks, to the best of our judgment,"" IL&FS' non-executive chairman Uday Kotak said. ""Therefore we are putting out transparently things as we see today, and our reasonable estimate of how things look as we go forward.""

1296,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 04:36AM ET</span>",Risk Assets Seen Entering ‘Danger Zone’ in Next Few Months,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors may be too complacent about upcoming risks to markets over the next couple of months, according to strategists from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), RBC Capital Markets and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA.
As a run of positive catalysts comes to an end -- including improved clarity from earnings season, a new European Union recovery fund and the possibility of further U.S. fiscal stimulus -- the favorable environment for risk assets is expected to change, Morgan Stanley strategists led by Andrew Sheets wrote in a note Friday.
The team suggested investors reduce exposure for the August-September “danger zone” when seasonality worsens for equities and credit, the U.S. presidential election comes into focus and an “exceptional” period of positive economic surprises likely moderates.
“Over the next two months, positive catalysts fade, seasonality gets worse and near-term risks emerge,” they wrote. They recommended investors consider raising cash balances and buying credit-default-swap index protection in the bond market. They also suggested looking at European assets which are more likely to outperform.
Risk assets have proved resilient even amid the ongoing uncertainty of the impact from Covid-19 on economies and public health, as global policy makers stepped in with unprecedented fiscal and monetary support. An MSCI gauge of global stocks has gained about 43% since its March low, and the ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA MOVE Index -- a measure of volatility in the Treasuries market -- closed on Friday at its lowest since March 2019.
RBC Capital Markets derivatives strategist Amy Wu Silverman agrees that markets could become more volatile into August, at least in the U.S., according to a July 19 note. Risks include less-supportive fiscal stimulus than previously expected and Congressional wrangling around coronavirus aid packages -- with a tail risk that partisan disagreements prevent passage of another package entirely -- she said.
“August could be bumpy,” she said. “I think short-term volatility will rise.”
Meanwhile, investors concerned about any return of volatility should consider haven assets such as the yen and Swiss francs, according to Societe Generale’s chief FX strategist, Kit Juckes.
“After a spectacular spring for risk assets, this year even more than most, we recommend applying plenty of protection,” he wrote Monday. “Don’t forget the sunscreen, something to cover your face, some yen, some Swiss francs and some EUR/USD volatility, which may come in handy if things get a bit lively.”

1297,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 04:30AM ET</span>",Tomorrow Group-linked shares tumble after China seizes affiliated financial firms,"By Julie Zhu and Cheng Leng
HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Shares in three companies with connections to troubled Chinese conglomerate Tomorrow Holdings Co Ltd slumped on Monday after regulators seized control of nine firms affiliated with the group.
Chinese financial regulators announced on Friday they had temporarily taken over brokerages, trust companies and insurers linked to the embattled group, amid a campaign to stem systemic financial risks in a slowing economy. Regulators took control of Baoshang Bank, controlled by Tomorrow Group, in May 2019 in China's first bank seizure in nearly two decades. 
Meanwhile, Tomorrow's founder Xiao Jianhua was investigated more than three years ago amid a state-led crackdown on conglomerates, and has not been seen in public since 2017.
Shanghai-listed Xishui  Strong Year  Co Ltd Inner Mongolia (SS:600291), a cement and clinker manufacturer with a 51% stake in Tianan Property Insurance - one of the nine companies seized by regulators - fell by the daily limit of 10% in morning trade on Monday. 
Baotou Tomorrow Technology (SS:600091) which produces and sells chemical products and is minority owned by Tomorrow also saw its shares drop 4% on the Shanghai bourse on Monday. 
Shenzhen-listed Zhongtian Financial Group Co Ltd (SZ:000540), which said in 2017 it planned to buy up to 25% https://www.reuters.com/article/us-zhongtian-fincl-huaxia/chinas-zhongtian-financial-to-buy-up-to-4-7-billion-stake-in-huaxia-life-idUSKBN1DL052 in Tomorrow-linked Huaxia Life Insurance, dropped by over 8% during the morning session before it narrowed losses to 3.9% in the afternoon. Huaxia Life was another company seized by the government on Friday.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) was up 3.11% on Monday, while the main Shenzhen index (SZSC) rose 2.68%.
Xishui Strong Year said in a statement on Monday that the ultimate impact on it of Tianan Property Insurance's seizure was still uncertain. It added that it would actively cooperate with the regulators.
Zhongtian Financial Group said in a statement that its stake purchase was still underway and it was still assessing what the government takeover means and would communicate once that was clear. 
On Saturday, Tomorrow lashed out at the state takeovers, in a rare example of public criticism of official action. The statement was quickly removed from its social media account. 
ONE-YEAR DEALS
Regulators said on Friday that they had taken over the companies for one year, during which their operations will remain normal. They said the takeovers won't change their debt obligations or creditors' rights.
Creditors had total exposure of between 40 to 50 billion yuan ($7.15 billion) in the nine firms, state-backed Shanghai Securities Journal reported on Monday, citing unnamed regulatory sources. It added that the risk of wider contagion was limited.
Regulators took over Baoshang Bank in 2019, citing serious credit risks and sending shockwaves through the financial system.
""Beijing is clearly interested in cleaning up its financial system and taking down some larger companies that have no strategic value to China. The relationship between Tomorrow Group and the troubled Baoshang Bank may have tipped the balance for Tomorrow Group,"" said Andrew Collier, founder of Orient Capital Research. 
In May 2020, regulators announced they had extended Baoshang Bank's one-year takeover by a further six months.

""As the asset clean-up of Baoshang Bank comes to an end, regulators need to concentrate on handling the complicated web of debt of other Tomorrow Holdings affiliates,"" said Wang Yifeng, analyst at Everbright Securities.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Monday, amid disappointment at signs that the region’s leaders are preparing to water down an agreement over the EU's groundbreaking proposed recovery fund, making it less effective than hoped.
At 4:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.6% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.8%. 
European Union leaders remain deadlocked after three days of haggling over a plan to revive economies hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, unable to agree on how to structure the 750 billion euros ($860 billion) proposed for the recovery fund and what conditions to put on the countries - mainly from the Mediterranean rim - that would benefit from the fund.
Five European Union governments--Austria, the Netherlands, Finland, Denmark and Sweden--have been holding up negotiations over the deal to reboot the bloc’s economy.
Still, Bloomberg reported these four governments are now satisfied with 390 billion euros of the fund being made available as grants, not the 500 billion originally envisaged, with the rest coming as low-interest loans. This could result in a deal being signed as soon as this afternoon.
In corporate news, Koninklijke Philips (AS:PHG) stock rose 3.7% after the Dutch medical-technology company offered up a positive update, expecting to return to sales growth in the second half of the year.
 Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) stock was flat after the Italian bank increased its takeover offer for smaller rival Unione di Banche Italiane (MI:UBI), adding a cash component to what had initially been an all-share offer. UBI Banca stock rose 12%.
 Julius Baer  (SIX:BAER) stock fell 3.3% despite posting a sharp rise in net profit in the first six months of the year, as assets under management declined despite net inflows during the period.
U.K.-based small-cap Synairgen (LON:SYNG) stock tripled after preliminary results suggested its new treatment for Covid-19 dramatically reduced the number of patients needing intensive care. An update on the Oxford University experimental drug being developed in partnership with AstraZeneca (LON:AZN) is due later Monday.
Oil prices fell Monday as the growth of coronavirus cases around the globe continued to drag on the recovery in fuel demand. While fuel demand has recovered from the record drop in April after countries around the world imposed strict lockdowns, usage is still below pre-pandemic levels. 
Additionally, last week the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, agreed to scale back oil production cuts from August.
At 4:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1% lower at $40.34 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1% to $42.72.
Elsewhere, gold futures were flat at $1,810/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1448, up 0.2% on the day.

1299,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 04:00AM ET</span>",Bondholders back in for Virgin Australia after administrator selects rival Bain deal,"By Jamie Freed
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Bondholders in  Virgin Australia  Holdings Ltd (AX:VAH), in administration since April, on Monday submitted an updated proposal to take over the struggling company that rivals the approach from Bain Capital selected by administrator Deloitte. 
The new proposal from bondholders Broad Peak Investment Advisers and Tor Investment Management is ""substantially the same"" as a recapitalisation pitch for Australia's second-biggest airline they lodged last month, a spokesman said in a statement.
The spokesman said the bondholders were seeking to work cooperatively and constructively with Deloitte to receive access to stakeholders and information ahead of an Aug. 26 meeting at which a deal for the future running of the company is to be finalised.
Deloitte told creditors on July 17 it had selected the Bain proposal for a deed of company arrangement because it provided certainty over a transaction being completed, immediate funding for the business and resulted in the best outcome for company creditors, including employees, as a whole.
Virgin Australia entered voluntary administration in April owing A$7 billion ($4.89 billion) to creditors, having been struggling financially even before the coronavirus pandemic slammed the travel and airline industries.
According to a court submission, the original proposal by Broad Peak and Tor - which hold around A$300 million of the airline's A$2 billion of unsecured bonds - involved interim funding to allow Virgin to continue operating. 
It also provided for the conversion of noteholders' and certain other unsecured creditors' debts into equity worth around 69 cents on the dollar, with an option for creditors to sell their shares for cash.
A Deloitte spokesman said on Monday that a proposal had been received and his firm had no further comment.
Deloitte told creditors on July 17 would issue a report to creditors on Aug. 19, ahead of a vote on the proposed arrangement with Bain on Aug. 26. 

The bondholder proposal could also be presented at the same meeting, a lawyer representing the bondholders said at a court hearing this month.

In a tell-tale sign of rising retail activity, exchange trading volumes of so-called thematic ETFs have more than doubled this year from the same period in 2019, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. About 9.4 billion euros ($10.8 billion) of the equity products, which track investing themes like marijuana, robotics and AI, have been bought and sold.
Any sign of increased engagement by smaller investors will surely be welcome in Europe, which has struggled for years to develop a retail customer base. Morningstar estimates that more than 80% of ETF assets in the region are in the hands of institutions like private banks, hedge funds and pension funds, who typically trade over-the-counter.
“Because retail is still a pretty small part of the market there’s a push by issuers to capture that,” said Athanasios Psarofagis, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.
The situation is in stark contrast to the U.S., where moms and pops have been instrumental in growing the world’s biggest pool of ETF assets.
Funds tracking companies that benefit from work-from-home policies have won over investors this year, according to Psarofagis. Among the most popular products in Europe are the VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports fund (ESPO LN), which has around $450 million, and the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (FSKY LN), with $340 million.

Under questioning from a lawyer for Deutsche Bank, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) senior official Jane Lin told a pre-trial hearing in Sydney she did not know why the material was deleted.
Lin was shown a JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) draft witness statement which included suggestions the banks were concerned about disrupting an orderly market if they dumped their unsold shares simultaneously. The final signed statement excluded the remarks.
""The ACCC has excised parts of his draft which demonstrate an intention ... to do the right thing by the market,"" Deutsche Bank lawyer Marugan Thangaraj said.
""I have to agree ... that it's not in the final statement,"" Lin replied.
Asked why the ACCC cut references to ""exculpatory matters going to elements of the offence"", Lin said: ""Either someone else is better placed to give that evidence, a contemporaneous document (might give it, or) it wasn't in the right format in regards to admissibility. There are a whole range of iterations.""
The ACCC alleges the three investment banks engaged in criminal cartel behaviour in a A$2.5 billion ($1.8 billion) share issue for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) in 2015. The banks say they acted independently.
The case is being closely watched by financial players around the world because it could influence the way share issues are run.
A third bank which worked on the issue, JPMorgan, cooperated with investigators.

Hong Kong recorded more than 100 cases in a 24-hour period over the weekend, the most since the pandemic took hold in late January. 
The rise in cases took the tally close to 2,000 patients, 12 of whom have died. 
Hong Kong banks shut scores of branches in late January when the first wave of the coronavirus cases hit the city. These later reopened as case numbers dropped. 
Bank of China (Hong Kong) (HK:2388) said in a statement on Monday it would suspend services at nine branches due to the spread of the virus. It had already suspended services at three branches, one of which reopened on Monday. 
HSBC said in a separate statement it would temporarily close two business centres for commercial banking and three mobile branches operating from trucks, and shorten operating hours at all branches. 
HSBC subsidiary Hang Seng Bank (HK:0011) closed one branch for 14 days for deep cleaning after a member of staff preliminarily tested positive for COVID-19, it said on Sunday. 
Standard Chartered and Bank of East Asia (HK:0023) said they would shorten branch opening hours.

Investing.com – Asian stock markets were mostly down on Monday morning, with the global number of COVID-19 cases and deaths showing no sign of slowing down.
There are almost 14.5 million cases and over 600,000 deaths as of July 20, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
The rising numbers dampened the recent release of positive economic data from China and the U.S. China reported a better-than-expected second quarter GDP year-on-year on Thursday. Some investors expected a continued, but slower recovery.
“Our base case remains for the economic recovery to continue, but for the deep V rebound evident in much recent data to give way to a slower bumpier recovery going forward,” Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital Investors Ltd, told Bloomberg.
“Shares are still vulnerable to a further correction or consolidation, with renewed lockdowns and the U.S. presidential election being the main risks,” he added.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.33% by 11:02 PM ET (4:02 AM GMT), with Japan reporting a 26.2% decline in June exports year-on-year earlier in the day. The fourth consecutive month of double-digit declines in exports, attributed to drastically decreased demand due to COVID-19, is an indication that Japan is experiencing its deepest recession in decades.
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.34% and the ASX 200 slid 0.66%, with the Australian government scheduled to release a ‘mini budget’ later in the week
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.10%. The city recorded a record 108 cases on Sunday, and tightened social distancing measures to require civil servants to work from home and mandate the wearing of masks in all shared indoor areas among others.

1312,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 19, 2020 08:54PM ET</span>",Asia’s World-Beating Stock Rally Has Bulls Betting on More Gains,"(Bloomberg) -- In a global market where hardly anything made sense this year, one trend seems to be supported by economic reality: Asian stocks’ outperformance versus the rest of the world driven by the region’s better containment of the coronavirus.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index is set to beat the S&P 500 and the MSCI Europe Index for a second straight month in July as Asia scores high on curbing the virus as well as reopening economies. That, along with attractive valuations and Asian shares’ relative insulation from risks related to the U.S. presidential election, is prompting money managers to call for more gains.
“We have a heavy bias toward Asian equities,” said Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Investment Funds SA, which oversees the equivalent of $255 billion in assets. “We expect this theme to prove resilient to what should eventually be a much more difficult time in equity markets in September and October.”
Galy’s comments echo views from funds like Fidelity International Ltd. and Capital Group Cos., who see Asian stocks winning more allocation from investors. Virus cases in the region -- the focal point when the pandemic originated in China -- have been below 20% of the global count since world equity markets hit 2020 lows in March, data compiled by Bloomberg and Johns Hopkins University show.
On the other hand, infections in the U.S. now make up for more than a fourth of the global count, while the Europe, Middle East and Africa region accounts for about a third of the total.
While most of the Asian economies have reopened between 70-95%, that run rate for most of the U.S. stands at 45-60% as of last month, according to Cushman & Wakefield’s global economic reopening tracker, which takes into account factors such as essential services, borders, schools, retail and manufacturing.
“Asia and in particular countries like China, South Korea, Taiwan have controlled the virus quite well and we are seeing economic activities picking up quite fast,” according to Tuan Huynh, chief investment officer for Europe and Asia at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Wealth Management.
Investors also cite a recovery in China’s economy as reason to be bullish on Asian equities. China’s gross domestic product expanded 3.2% in the second quarter from a year ago, data showed Thursday, reversing a decline in the first quarter and beating forecast.
READ: BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Favors Asia Markets Closely Tied to China’s Recovery
The economic rebound will spread all around Asia Pacific with a lag of a few months, said Galy of Nordea Investment.
Risks Remain
Nevertheless, there are some risks that can botch the bullish Asia narrative.
For one, a resurgence in virus infections from Hong Kong and Tokyo is forcing policy makers to delay or reverse business re-openings. India’s cases have exceeded 1 million, becoming the third country in the world to cross that tally. Such moves could thwart an economic recovery and dampen appetite for regional stocks.
READ: Here’s One Metric That May Have Asia Stock Bulls Worried
At the same time, investor enthusiasm may wane if earnings upgrades continue to lag positive revisions seen in the U.S. and Europe.
“I would not agree that Asia will perform the best,” said David Wong, an investment strategist at AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB) in Hong Kong. “If we’ve learned anything from the pandemic, it is that the equity market is not equal to the economy and that returns have no correlation with GDP growth.”
Appealing Valuations
That said, advocates of investing in Asian shares also cite better valuations.
“Asian equity valuations are attractive in the context of the long-term growth opportunities and a potential rebound in earnings next year,” said Sumit Mangal, a fund manager for Asia ex-Japan equities at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. “We could see a strong recovery in demand.”
Bloomberg-compiled data on the estimated return on equity show that Asian company valuations are way cheaper than their U.S. and European peers even as the efficiency of Asian companies to generate profits using their assets remains in double digits.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has rebounded more than 35% from its March low. Still, the gauge can rise about 10% over the next one year, according to price forecasts by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That’s set to outpace the roughly 5% advance predicted for U.S. and European stocks.
The gauge was little changed on Monday as investors weighed potential for additional policy support and a ramp up in the earnings season.
U.S. Election
While the pandemic remains a challenge, investors globally are also starting to factor in risks related to the U.S. presidential election as recent polls show President Donald Trump trailing Democratic nominee Joe Biden.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). analysts have flagged the potential for earnings-depressing tax hikes should Democrats do well in November.
Expectations that Democrats will win the U.S. election will keep a lid on stocks in the U.S. and Europe, while Asian equities remain insulated from that risk, according to John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.
“Europe also has some correlation with the U.S. stock market,” he said. “We are strongly preferring Asia ex-Japan to the rest of the world.”
Equities in Asia excluding Japan have outperformed the U.S. heading into elections in three of the four previous cycles, with an average outperformance of about 6% in four months until the polls, according to  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc.

1313,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 19, 2020 07:54PM ET</span>",SoftBank-Backed Insurer Aims for 2021 IPO in India Tech’s Debut,"(Bloomberg) -- Online insurance platform Policybazaar aims to go public in 2021 at a valuation north of $3.5 billion, potentially becoming the first of India’s mega-startups to debut as its digital economy booms.
The startup plans to secure about $250 million in a round of financing at a $2 billion-plus valuation before a September 2021 initial public offering, co-founder Yashish Dahiya told Bloomberg News. Policybazaar is now selecting two to three IPO lead underwriters from a roster that includes several Wall Street banks, said Dahiya, chief executive officer of Policybazaar parent ETech Aces Marketing and Consulting Pvt.
“We have global interest and will raise in the coming weeks,” Dahiya said from London, where he is currently based.
Policybazaar, which counts SoftBank Group Corp.’s Vision Fund, Tiger Global Management and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. among its largest backers, may become the first of India’s digital-era upstarts to go public. Like fellow unicorns Ola, Flipkart and Paytm, the fintech firm rode an upswell of internet and mobile use that spurred digital services across the world’s second-most populous nation. It may be hoping to replicate the spectacular coming-out party of another SoftBank-backed insurer, Lemonade Inc., which soared on its U.S. debut last month.
Read more: How Facebook’s Reliance Deal Upends a $1 Trillion Digital Arena
Policybazaar intends to list in Mumbai but Dahiya said he’ll consider a dual listing if rules change. India is tweaking regulations to help companies list overseas. Many startups have incorporated in countries like Singapore and the U.S. because of friendlier public listing rules (among other considerations), but India currently prohibits that for sensitive sectors like financial services. SoftBank and Singaporean state investment firm Temasek Holdings Pte each hold about a 15% stake each in the startup, while Tencent and Tiger Global have about 10 and 8%, respectively.
Policybazaar is among a clutch of fintech startups seeking to upend the stranglehold of state- and bank-backed insurers in a tightly regulated financial services segment. Like rivals Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.-backed Paytm, it’s trying to tap a large population of under-insured -- or non-insured -- Indians. Though the government has recently pushed health insurance plans to the less privileged, overall insurance penetration hovered at less than 4% in 2017, according to the government’s India Brand Equity Foundation.
Yet as economic uncertainties rise, a young insurable population, growing middle class and rising awareness about the need for retirement planning is buoying the market. The industry should touch $280 billion in revenues this year and expand by 14% to 15% annually over the next three to five years, according to the foundation.

Policybazaar itself helps sell about a million policies a month. The aggregator lets users compare life, health, auto, travel and property policies from 40 insurers on its website without going through conventional agents, who sell based on incentives. Policybazaar’s own customer service reps help users settle claims, redeem paybacks and amend policies. Sister unit Paisabazaar facilitates loans, credit cards and sells mutual funds, tapping an adjacent Indian digital payments market forecast by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) to cross $1 trillion by 2022.
It’s in insurance where there’s a pressing need. India’s middle classes almost never have health or life insurance, said Dahiya. Less than a fourth of the 45 million Indians who currently do subscribe to an individual health plan are adequately covered for chronic diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure.
“The rest of them have ‘a’ plan,” said Dahiya. In recent years, a government-funded program has covered half a billion of India’s underprivileged. “But the middle India has no support at all.”

1314,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2020 07:25PM ET</span>","UK lawmakers, retailers call for action to prevent garment workers' exploitation","LONDON (Reuters) - A group of 50 British lawmakers, retailers such as Marks & Spencer and New Look, and investors and NGOs called on Monday for urgent action to prevent the exploitation of garment factory workers in the United Kingdom.
Their joint letter, coordinated by industry lobby group the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and addressed to interior minister Priti Patel, asked for the introduction of statutory licensing of garment factories to ensure they all meet their legal obligations to employees.
The letter was published following recent media reports of workers being paid below the minimum wage, not being supplied with personal protection equipment (PPE) and working in unsafe conditions.
Britain's minimum wage is 8.72 pounds ($10.95) for people over 25 years old and 8.20 pounds for people aged 21 to 24.
The BRC said it and its members have long been calling for greater enforcement by the authorities to support the actions retailers are taking to ensure fair treatment of workers and to enourage businesses to invest in UK fashion manufacturing.
""Recent reports in the media demonstrate the urgent need for action before more workers are needlessly taken advantage of,"" said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson.
The letter said the proposed licencing scheme would protect workers from forced labour and mistreatment, ensure payment of taxes and create a level playing field for businesses to compete fairly by preventing rogue manufacturers undercutting prices.
It would also encourage retailers to source their clothing from the UK, supporting the development of the industry.
Retailer signatories include ASOS (L:ASOS), Walmart (N:WMT) owned Asda, M & S (L:MKS), Morrisons (L:MRW), N Brown (L:BWNG), Joules (L:JOUL), New Look, River Island and Matalan.
Online fashion retailer  Boohoo  (L:BOOH) was not a signatory. It wrote its own letter to Patel on Friday backing a licensing scheme.
""We fully support the proposals of the BRC and others on the need to implement statutory licensing of garment factory owners and managers,"" said a Boohoo spokesman.
Investor signatories include Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, Columbia Threadneedle Investments, Fidelity International, Jupiter Asset Management and  Schroders  (LON:SDR) Investment Management.

Ghosn, who was also the chairman of Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF) Corp, was arrested in Japan in late 2018 on charges of underreporting his salary and using company funds for personal purpose - charges he denies. He fled to Lebanon from Japan.
""There is a market confidence problem in the alliance. Personally, I find the results of Nissan and Renault pathetic. The two companies are looking inwards. There is no longer any real mix of management between Renault and Nissan, but a distrustful distance, "" he told Le Parisien newspaper.
Ghosn compared the share price fall from November 2018 to June 2020 of competitors General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp of 12% and 15% respectively to Nissan dropping 55% and Renault 70%.
""All of these manufacturers are facing the same COVID crisis, but Renault and Nissan are being punished more than the others,' he said. 
Ghosn fled Japan to Lebanon, his childhood home, in December as he awaited trial on charges of underreporting earnings, breach of trust and misappropriation of company funds, all of which he denies.
Ghosn was questioned in Lebanon in January. He has said he will cooperate fully with the Lebanese judicial process, but it is unclear what cooperation there will be between Tokyo and Beirut. 
French prosecutors have also stepped up their investigation into alleged misappropriation by Ghosn of funds at Renault and had summoned him in France on July 13, but he did not attend.
""There is a technical obstacle. My passport is in the hands of the attorney general in Lebanon, because Japan has issued an international arrest warrant for me,"" Ghosn said. 

""I also want to be sure that my security is assured and that I am guaranteed freedom of movement.""

1319,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 19, 2020 10:03AM ET</span>",Point/Counterpoint: The Case for Cruise Lines,"By Christiana Sciaudone and Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Admittedly, this isn’t the best time to talk about taking a cruise. A still-pervasive pandemic has put a damper on things for now, but there is hope. 
Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL),  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) and  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd  (NYSE:NCLH) halted operations around March. But during that time they haven't been standing still, and just a few months later they're getting ready to set out to sea again.
A CDC order keeping them in port until the end of September isn't stopping some operators from planning trips outside the United States. But cruise lines will likely struggle until tourists return to the seas, forced to take on debt to keep operations going.
Investing.com's Christiana Sciaudone and Liz Moyer argue the bull and bear case on cruise lines. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Bull Case
Carnival (NYSE:CUK) has three ships scheduled to head out next month from Germany, and departures from Italy could be close behind. Norwegian’s still going to Alaska in September, and may restart other trips after October. Like Carnival, Royal Caribbean is set to start traveling again out of Germany with their TUI cruise line, as of July 24. 
The cruise lines don’t need to be running full steam to make the numbers work, either. 
In 2019, Carnival said operating just 15 ships resulted in cash flow break-even. This year, if they operate 25 ships, generating 40% of cash flow, it would cover the pause costs for the rest of the fleet and all shoreside SG&A, and lead the company to be cash flow break-even, Chief Financial Officer David Bernstein said on an earnings call earlier this month.
They also have the chance to operate only their most productive and newer ships, which should optimize earning power, said Jaime Katz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar.
But who, you may ask, would ever want to go on a cruise at a time like this? We can’t exactly name them, but they're out there. The cruise lines have the numbers to prove it.  
Carnival reported July 10 that it has seen steady demand for new bookings next year; for the first three weeks in June, almost 60% of 2021 reservations were new. 
Norwegian said in May that there continues to be demand for cruise vacations, particularly beginning in the fourth quarter 2020 and accelerating through 2021. The company’s overall booked position and pricing for 2021 is within historical ranges, it said.
The companies have also been tapping credit markets to bolster their balance sheets. As of May 31, Carnival had $7.6 billion of available liquidity, and $8.8 billion of committed export credit facilities available to fund ship deliveries originally planned through 2023. 
Norwegian added $2.4 billion.That along with other “liquidity-enhancing initiatives,” will help it weather 18 unlikely months of suspended voyages, according to CEO Frank Del Rio. 
Finally, at Royal Caribbean, we find recent bond sales that helped add to the $6.6 billion in cash on their balance sheet, Bloomberg reported.
And while the U.S. Congress ignored the industry when handing out cash, the U.K. handed Carnival £25 million ($31.3 million) and Royal Caribbean £300 million ($375 million), Skift reported. Something’s better than nothing. 
Looking at the shares, Norwegian, in particular, is cheap, said Morningstar’s Katz, with book value per share higher than where it’s trading now. 
“It’s still trading at a discount, but what that discount implies is that cruising resumes at some point,” Katz said in a phone interview on July 17. “There is a finite period to this so it should again be a revenue generating business.”
Plus, because of where they are incorporated, they don’t pay taxes, she noted.
Pack your bags, it's time to buy.
The Bear Case
Hello, Covid?
That's basically the case against cruise ship operators at this point.
While many industries have rebounded since hitting their pandemic-era lows in March and April, cruise operators have struggled. Royal Caribbean, Carnival, and Norwegian Cruise Line are all down more than 60% this year and ships remain empty as Covid-19 cases spike across the country.
Analysts expect Royal Caribbean to report a loss of $4.55 a share next week, according to Briefing.com. Carnival Cruise Line, which next reports is seen having a loss of $1.97 when it next reports in September, though it recently said it sees an increase in bookings for next year.
Coronavirus is especially a problem indoors in tight quarters, as public health officials have been telling the world for months. This was obvious with cruise ships during the spring. Many continued to operate, with their live entertainment venues, night clubs, and buffet dining in full swing, and experienced big outbreaks of the virus among passengers and crew.
One of the most notorious examples was Carnival Corp.'s Diamond Princess, which docked in Japan with an outbreak of more than 700 infected people, about 20% of the more than 3,700 people on board. Nine of those people died.
People kept getting on cruise ships during the spring, when coronavirus was raging worldwide, despite the warnings. On Thursday, the CDC blamed cruise operators for widespread transmission of Covid-19, counting 99 outbreaks among 123 ships in U.S. waters from the beginning of March to this month. That includes almost 3,000 cases and 34 deaths on board ships in U.S. waters.
The CDC extended its March no sail order through Sept.30. Already many cruise ship lines had voluntarily suspended operations to mid-September. They have to come up with plans to prevent the on-board spread of Covid. The CDC has complained about cruise operators having inadequate plans for monitoring crew, inadequate medical and personal protection supplies, and insufficient rules for social distancing and other onboard restrictions.
With no passengers, cruise operators are burning through cash and being forced to raise money to stay in business. Norwegian Cruise Line said Thursday it was trying to raise $1.2 billion to get through the crisis, including $925 million in debt. Carnival recently sold $1.3 billion in debt, Motley Fool noted, at an expensive interest rate of 10%.
Even if Covid-19 goes away and passengers return to cruise lines, paying back that expensive debt with much-depleted cash stores is going to make it tough for the big operators to return to profit quickly."

""It is looking likely that a return to operating as a private REIT, at least temporarily, is in the best interests of the fund and its investors,"" the company said in a statement.
It said current market conditions in UAE public equity markets had damaged the share's performance and led to an ""unjustifiably large gap between the fund's share price and its true value"".
The real estate sector in Dubai, one of the main emirates of the UAE, has been sluggish for years, due to a chronic oversupply of homes coupled with weak economic growth, a problem now exacerbated by the coronavirus crisis.
Emirates REIT, which has a market capitalisation of around $45 million, said ""a cyclical downturn in the UAE real estate sector and a challenging operating environment"" had contributed to its decision to review its options, including a potential de-listing.
Emirates REIT's shares were trading at $0.15 on Sunday compared with a net asset value (NAV) per share of $1.57 at the end of 2019.
Earlier on Sunday, Emirates REIT said its manager, Equitativa, was being investigated by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) for matters connected to the management of Emirates REIT, specifically on valuation, information and interests and corporate governance.
Emirates REIT said Equitativa intended to cooperate with the investigation.
In a statement to Reuters, DFSA confirmed it was investigating Equitativa with respect to its role as fund manager of Emirates REIT. It said the probe had started on May 24 but did not disclose details of the investigation.

The Japanese government hopes to tap the expertise of global chipmakers to rejuvenate the lagging domestic chip industry as advanced chip technologies have become a focal point in national security issues, Yomiuri said.
The government is planning to offer a total of several hundred billion yen, or equivalent to several billion dollars, over multiple years to overseas chipmakers who join the project, the daily said, without citing sources.
The report gave no timeline for the project.
A TSMC spokesperson denied there was any such plan at the moment when contacted by Reuters but said the company would not rule anything out in the future. The Japanese industry ministry did not answer calls.

TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, in May unveiled plans for a $12 billion plant in the United State in an apparent win for the Trump administration's efforts to wrestle global technology supply chains back from China.

1322,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2020 07:35AM ET</span>","Hong Kong national security laws shouldn't harm banks' operations, regulator says","By Scott Murdoch
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's capital markets regulator sought on Sunday to reassure global banks in the city that China's new national security laws for the financial hub would not harm their operations.
The ""free flow"" of information is one of the ""fundamental attributes"" that have made Hong Kong an international financial centre, and this is not expected to change under the new laws, said Securities and Futures Commission chief executive Ashley Alder.
The regulator ""would like to clarify that it is not aware of any aspect of the (new laws) which would affect or alter the existing ways in which firms and listed companies originate, access, disseminate and transmit financial market and related business information under the regulatory regime it administers,"" Alder said in a statement.
The city's major investment banks have been gauging the impact of the laws on their operations, including the independence of analysts' research.
Another concern, particularly for commercial banks, is the U.S government's planned retaliatory sanctions on financial institutions that do business with those found to have participated in any crackdown on the city.
Beijing argues that the laws, which punish what China broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, are vital to restoring stability after more than a year of protests.
Britain, Hong Kong's former colonial ruler, and the United States have strongly opposed Beijing's legislation, expressing concern over the erosion of the autonomy Hong Kong has been granted by China since the city returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Senior British and U.S. politicians criticised HSBC (L:HSBA) and  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) banks, global firms with a strong presence and history in Hong Kong, for backing the laws shortly after they were enacted on July 1. 
The Hong Kong regular has held discussions with ""globally active financial institutions,"" centring on their concerns about ""the potential ambit and effect"" of the laws on their businesses in the city, Alder said.

Alder said Hong Kong's rules on short-selling, hedging strategies, exchange traded and over the counter derivative markets would not be altered by the security laws.

The video, which included music from the group Linkin Park, disappeared from the president's Twitter feed late Saturday with the notification: ""This media has been disabled in response to a report by the copyright owner.""
Twitter removed the video, which Trump had retweeted from White House social media director Dan Scavino, after it received a Digital Millennium Copyright Act notice from Machine Shop Entertainment, according to a notice posted on the Lumen Database which collects requests for removal of online materials.
Machine Shop is a management company owned by the rock band Linkin Park, according to its LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) page.
""We respond to valid copyright complaints sent to us by a copyright owner or their authorized representatives,"" a Twitter representative said in an email statement.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Twitter began challenging Trump's tweets in May and has repeatedly clashed with him since. The social media company has several times disabled or commented on tweets by the president because of what it said were copyright complaints or violations of a policy against threatening violence.
Twitter removed an image the president tweeted on June 30, which included a picture of Trump, because of a complaint from the New York Times, whose photographer had shot the image.

The company also put a tweet from the president behind a warning label in late May, saying that he had violated its rules against ""glorifying violence"" when he advocated that Minneapolis authorities be tough in responding to protests over the death of George Floyd.

1327,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2020 06:00AM ET</span>",Twitter says attackers downloaded data from up to eight non-verified accounts,"(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) said on Saturday that hackers were able to download account information for up to eight accounts involved in the hack of its systems this week, but said none of them were verified accounts. 
The company said the unidentified attackers targeted 130 accounts, and were able to reset passwords to take control of 45 of them and tweet from those accounts. 
Hackers accessed Twitter's internal systems to hijack some of the platform's top voices including U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden, reality TV star Kim Kardashian, former U.S. President Barack Obama and billionaire Elon Musk and used them to solicit digital currency.
Publicly available blockchain records show the apparent scammers received more than $100,000 worth of cryptocurrency.
In the attack that occurred on Wednesday, Twitter said hackers were able to view personal information including email addresses and phone numbers of the 130 targeted accounts, but unable to view previous account passwords. 
""In cases where an account was taken over by the attacker, they may have been able to view additional information"", Twitter said in the statement without specifying the type of information accessed. 
Hackers may have also attempted to sell the user names of some of the accounts, it said. 
The high-profile accounts that were hacked also included rapper Kanye West, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, investor Warren Buffett, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates, and the corporate accounts for Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). 
In its latest statement, Twitter said attackers ""manipulated a small number of employees"" to gain access to the internal support tools used in the hack. 
The company said it was holding back some of the details of the attack as it continues its investigation and reiterated that it was working with impacted account owners. 

The FBI's San Francisco division is leading an inquiry into the hacking, with many Washington lawmakers also calling for an account of how it happened.

1328,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2020 03:10AM ET</span>",China's Tomorrow Holdings slams seizure of its financial firms,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese conglomerate Tomorrow Holdings Co on Saturday lashed out at a move by regulators to seize nine of its affiliated financial firms, in rare public criticism that was quickly removed from its social media account.
The statement came a day after Chinese financial regulators announced that they had taken over for one year the brokerages, trust companies and insurers linked to the embattled group, amid a campaign to stem systemic financial risks in a slowing economy.
Tomorrow Holdings said it had been actively moving forward with asset disposals, which the surprise takeover had disrupted, and that none of the institutions had faced liquidity risks or group protests from investors, and that regulators had exaggerated risks.
""With tight regulation limiting the firms' business development, each institution still managed to operate normally,"" the statement said. ""However, they were flagrantly announced to be taken over. What is the purpose of that?""
Tomorrow Holdings questioned the motives of the regulators.
""The regulators have been pushing hard on the takeovers, so some of them can become corporate executives to delay their retirement. How much trade-off of fortune and power is behind this?"" it said.
The regulators could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday about the group's statement.
On Friday, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission cited business violations in its takeover of Tianan Property Insurance Co of China, Huaxia Life Insurance Co, Tianan Life Insurance Co and Yi'an P&C Insurance Co., as well as New Times Trust Co and New China Trust Co.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission, meanwhile, said it had seized control of New Times Securities, Guosheng Securities and Guosheng Futures, accusing the firms of concealing shareholder information, among other violations.
The nine firms had combined assets of more than 1.2 trillion yuan ($170 billion) at the end of 2019, according to a calculation by Caixin, a Chinese financial media outlet, with Huaxia Life Insurance accounting for nearly half if that at 587.3 billion yuan.
Tomorrow's statement was quickly replaced with a message from the WeChat Official Accounts Platform Operation Center saying that the content ""violates regulations.""
The group also said that Xiao Jianhua, who controls the Beijing-based conglomerate, had returned to mainland China in early 2017 to fully cooperate with investigations.
Xiao, a billionaire with links to China's Communist Party elite, vanished from public view in early 2017. He was last seen leaving the Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong in a wheelchair with his head covered, accompanied by several people described in media reports as mainland Chinese agents.
The group said in its statement that it sold assets in China and abroad for hundreds of billion yuan over the past three and half years, and has used 300 billion yuan of its own funds to repay principal and interests for investors of Tianan Property Insurance.
In 2019, regulators took over Baoshang Bank, a lender once controlled by Tomorrow, citing severe credit risks. The lender, which had operated nationwide, was revamped into a much smaller lender back in its home region of Inner Mongolia.

1330,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2020 09:10PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Fund managers navigate 'Night of the Living Dead' in small caps,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are searching for bargains in the world of U.S. small-caps, as the beaten-down asset class prepares for what may be the worst earnings season in its history amid a resurgent coronavirus pandemic. 
Small-cap companies are expected to post a year-over-year earnings declines of approximately 90% as companies report their second-quarter results over the next several weeks, compared to a 67% hit for mid-caps and 44% for large-caps, according to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF). That would be the largest drop since the fourth quarter of 2008, data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed. 
While some investors had counted on a third-quarter rebound, many are now concerned that potential coronavirus-fueled economic shutdowns in California, Florida and Texas will deal a disproportionate hit to smaller firms, which are more directly tied to domestic spending and have been among the biggest beneficiaries of stimulus measures delivered by the Federal Reserve and Congress.
People fear a ""'Night of the Living Dead' of small-cap companies that would otherwise go bankrupt without the benefit of the stimulus and record-low interest rates,"" said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management. 
Small-cap stocks are often considered a barometer of investor sentiment and tend to be among the first to recover in an economic revival. Their lackluster performance this year has led to concerns over the sustainability of a nascent recovery in unemployment and other key metrics after devastating declines. 
The Russell 2000 index (RUT) of small-cap companies is down approximately 12% for the year to date, compared with a less than 1% decline in the S&P 500 index, according to Refinitiv data. The Russell 2000 is up just 16.5% over the last 5 years, compared with an approximately 52% gain in the S&P 500.
There are signs that recent economic gains may already be faltering. Real-time measures of the economy such as retail foot traffic and employee work hours have stalled recently, as states have implemented new restrictions to try to halt the spread of coronavirus pandemic. 
Still, some investors believe a patient approach will win out over time.
Jon Christensen, a portfolio manager at Kayne Anderson Rudnick, said the recent jump in coronavirus cases will likely make small-caps more volatile until there is a vaccine or effective treatment. 
As a result, Christensen is buying companies he believes will outperform over the next three years, despite recent hits to their share prices. He recently added shares of daycare provider Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc (N:BFAM), which are down 23.1% for the year to date. 
""Over the long term, even if we have more people working from home we know that Bright Horizon centers will continue to benefit from people needing childcare away from home,"" he said. 
Joe Van Cavage, a portfolio manager at Intrepid Capital, is focusing on companies that were gaining market share ahead of the economic shutdowns. He has purchased shares of discount retailers Burlington Stores Inc (N:BURL) and Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings Inc (O:OLLI), which he believes could benefit from a prolonged economic recession as consumers trade down and spend less. 
With fewer companies providing earnings guidance, ""we say 'Let's stay on the edge of the storm and see what we can scoop up and not fly into the middle and try to hold onto dear life,"" he said.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended higher on Friday as investors weighed the prospect of more fiscal stimulus against fears of further business disruptions due to a record rise in COVID-19 cases.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) tumbled 6.5% after the video streaming service forecast slower-than-expected subscriber growth during the third quarter, pulling the communication services sector down 0.4%.
The S&P 500 utilities, real estate and healthcare indexes were the session's strongest gainers.
However, a 1.5% drop in Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) helped keep the Dow in negative territory. 
For the week, the S&P 500 and the Dow rose 1.2% and 2.3%, respectively, after optimism over an eventual coronavirus vaccine and hopes of a post-pandemic economic recovery helped investors look past a continuous surge in COVID-19 cases. The United States witnessed 77,000 new infections on Thursday.
The Nasdaq ended 1.1% lower for the week as investors sold shares of high-flying companies including  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and moved into cyclical sectors.

Next week, second-quarter earnings season shifts into high gear with reports expected from corporate heavyweights including Microsoft, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ). 
With this year largely written off as a disaster for U.S. corporations because of the coronavirus, investors are looking for information from companies about the potential size and timing of an eventual recovery. 
“The question is what 2021 and 2022 look like, and what can folks glean from the commentary, especially when companies have withdrawn their guidance and made it difficult to get a sense of what their prospects look like,” said Tom Hainlin, National Investment Strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
The Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" ended at 25.68, its lowest closing level since June 5.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.23% to end at 26,672.36 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.29% to 3,224.75. 
The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.28% to 10,503.19.
Unprecedented stimulus measures and improving economic data have helped the S&P 500 rise to within about 5% of its February record high.
Investors are also hoping for more fiscal support as a program that offers additional unemployment benefits is set to expire on July 31. The U.S. Congress will return to Washington on Monday to debate another coronavirus aid bill.
""Both Republicans and Democrats have a strong incentive to agree upon further pre-election stimulus. It's not a matter of 'if' a stimulus passes, it's just what the size and content of that package looks like,"" said Andrea Bevis, senior vice president, UBS Private Wealth Management, based in Boston.
BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, rose 3.7% after reporting a jump in quarterly profit as investors poured money into its fixed-income funds and cash management services.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.5 billion shares, compared with the 11.6 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.43-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.50-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 89 new highs and 11 new lows.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) told pilots on Friday it would avoid furloughs if they agreed to reduced guaranteed minimum pay, according to a memo seen by Reuters. 
Delta is still struggling due to a dramatic decline in travel demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic. This week it reported second quarter revenue fell 91% and a $3.9 billion adjusted pre-tax loss.
The airline is working to further cut costs and more than 17,000 employees are taking voluntary departure packages, including more than 1,700 of 7,900 pilot ahead of a Sunday deadline for pilots to accept voluntary packages.
Delta flight operations senior vice president John Laughter 
said in a memo the company is ""committed to preventing involuntary furloughs for as many, if not all, Delta people.""
Laughter said the company proposed reducing guaranteed minimum pilot pay by 15% for 12 months in exchange for a guarantee of no furloughs for one year.
""Our approach is to spread the work of a smaller airline among all our pilots to preserve all jobs – that would be unheard of in our history,"" Laughter wrote.
Laughter said Delta pilots are currently being paid for more hours than they are actually flying. In June pilots flew about 10 actual hours and it will be 15.5 in July.
A spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association said the union met with Delta on Thursday and suggested the airline was choosing ""to negotiate in public directly with our pilots,"" which it said that could impede the process.
Laughter noted ""forward bookings have stalled as infection rates in parts of the U.S. spike and anxiety over the virus rises. Demand is still down about 80%, and we don’t expect to see measurable improvement until the U.S. infection rates fall again.""

The memo was reported earlier by CNBC.

1334,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 17, 2020 04:45PM ET</span>",Health Tech Firm Draws Zoom Comparison After 270% Jump Since IPO,"(Bloomberg) -- Livongo Health (NASDAQ:LVGO) Inc. may focus on chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure, but it’s really “a tech company in healthcare clothing,” according to RBC Capital Markets.
One year since its public debut, Livongo is fetching comparisons to software-as-a-service names like  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc. and Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. Analyst Sean Dodge said the digital health company is increasingly being valued as a tech company, and it’s warranted given its significant market potential, blistering revenue growth and ability to scale.
“From a financial model standpoint, Livongo’s characteristics aren’t all that different,” Dodge said in an interview.
Livongo shares have risen 270% since the company went public in July 2019. Most of that advance has taken place since March amid strong revenue and demand for remote patient monitoring services during the pandemic. The market value now exceeds $10 billion.
Livongo helps members manage diabetes and prediabetes, high blood pressure, weight and behavioral health. The company sells its services to clients like health plans and self-insured employers, who then cover the cost for their staff to participate.
The platform is powered by an engine that aggregates personal data like weight or blood sugar and then interprets them to deliver personalized “health nudges” to users. The company also offers 24/7 human coaching support. Livongo members can receive updates on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) and Samsung (KS:005930) smartwatches, and the company has collaborated with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). on an Alexa feature that complies with federal laws on health privacy. Chief Executive Officer Zane Burke said Livongo straddles the line between identifying as a health care company or a tech company.
“We’re much more of a tech SaaS business model that understands health care very well,” Burke said in an interview.
Locating the company’s headquarters in Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s home of Mountain View, California, was no accident. Setting up shop in Silicon Valley “was very purposeful in terms of having the right developer mentality for a consumer application,” Burke said.
RBC’s Dodge said he’s received a lot of phone calls from investors to discuss the stock, and there’s been a big increase in the proportion of tech specialists as opposed to those focused on health care. Livongo has several tech-like attributes that cause it to be valued more like a tech company, he said.
Livongo shares trade around 20 times estimated sales for 2021, similar to Crowdstrike. Zoom’s valuation is nearly 30 times estimated sales for the fiscal year ending January 2022, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Benchmark Co. analyst Bill Sutherland said that while Covid-19 has been a tailwind for Livongo so far, higher permanent unemployment could pressure client growth and increase member churn. Burke says the coronavirus has accelerated the transition to a consumer-directed virtual care system.
Dodge estimates Livongo’s total addressable market is about $50 billion, with $28 billion attributable to diabetes, $18.5 billion to high blood pressure and the balance to behavioral health.
That has attracted competition. Closely held peers, like Glooko Inc. and Omada Health Inc., have likely also been growing rapidly and are closer to achieving the size and scale they need to go public, according to Dodge. Heath insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH). launched a digital service for type 2 diabetes earlier this week.
Livongo is also attracting more short bets. About 22% of shares available for trading are currently sold short, according to data compiled by financial analytics firm S3 Partners. That’s up from around 10% at the beginning of June.
All but one of the 17 analysts tracked by Bloomberg has a buy rating on the stock, though their average price target is about 5% below where the shares are trading. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) downgraded Livongo to neutral earlier this month, saying growth appeared priced in.

Investing.com – The Dow notched a three-week winning streak despite ending lower on Friday as utilities and healthcare stepped up to fill the gap left by sluggish tech stocks.
The S&P 500 gained 0.29%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.28% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.23%.
In a sign that bullish investor sentiment is waning, utilities, often used as a defensive play, were among the biggest gainers, rising nearly 2%.
Healthcare was also among the biggest gainers, led by a jump in  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) on reports the European Union is in talks with various drug makers to buy millions of doses of Covid-19 vaccines.
Tech, which is on pace for a weekly loss, bounced off session lows but gains were kept in check by a slump in FAANG component Netflix.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) fell 6.5% after reporting second-quarter earnings that missed analyst expectations and serving up a gloomy outlook on subscriber growth for the rest of the year.
The streaming giant's report prompted several analysts on Wall Street to rein in their optimism on the stock.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) downgraded Netflix to neutral from outperform, citing ""a lack of near term catalysts."" The bank also cut its price target on the stock to $525 from $550.
The economic front, meanwhile, offered up further ammo for the bears as data showed consumer sentiment softened, which analyst warned could be a sign that economic growth could slow amid a sharp increase in cases.
The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment fell to 73.2 in early July. ""We do not expect to see a material increase in consumer sentiment until it is widely viewed that the virus is under control,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said.
The U.S. reported 77,200 cases on Thursday, a daily record, with the death toll above 138,000, according to Johns Hopkins University.
The increase in cases has been led by an ongoing rise in virus hotspots across the U.S. including Texas, Florida, Arizona, and California, which reported 9,986 the virus cases compared with a 14-day average of 8,241. 
Elsewhere, Tesla rival Nio Inc Class (NYSE:NIO) slumped 15% on Friday after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) downgraded the stock to a sell, citing valuation concerns."

The company said in the letter that it supported the call by the British Retail Consortium to implement a licensing scheme that would ensure all garment factories are meeting legal obligations to their employees.
""We fully support the proposals of the British Retail Consortium and others on the need to implement statutory licensing of garment factory owners and managers to ensure they are 'Fit to Trade'"", Boohoo said in the letter, dated July 17.
Boohoo shares fell earlier this month when The Sunday Times reported that workers in a factory in Leicester, central England, who were making clothes destined for Boohoo, were paid as little as 3.50 pounds ($4.40) an hour.
The firm said in response that it would commission an independent review of its supply chain in Britain.

(Reuters) - U.S. infectious disease specialists this week asked the federal government to ""use every authority it has"" to ensure adequate supplies of the antiviral drug remdesivir as the number of people infected with the novel coronavirus continues to rise.
In a letter to Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Alex Azar, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) expressed concern that developed countries are relying on a single manufacturer for the only antiviral so far shown to be effective against COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Remdesivir is made by  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD), which has committed to supplying 500,000 treatment courses of the drug to HHS for distribution to U.S. hospitals in July, August and September. The company has also licensed remdesivir to several generic drugmakers for sales in 127 low-income countries.
""We urge the administration to fully leverage all authorities including the Defense Production Act and other tools to ensure adequate supplies of remdesivir,"" the IDSA said.
Gilead, which last month priced a five-day course of its drug at $3,120 for U.S. insurers, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The IDSA said remdesivir, available since May under an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, has been a critical tool for reducing the strain on hospitals.
Several hard-hit Southern and Western states have reported running low on the drug, prompting HHS earlier this month to ship emergency supplies to Florida, Texas, California and Arizona.

""We are concerned that the current supply of remdesivir is insufficient, particularly given dramatically escalating caseloads in many states and the likelihood of a continuing surge into the fall and winter,"" the IDSA said in its letter.

The SoFi Weekly Income ETF will trade under the ticker TGIF and focus on investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The fund will be actively managed and primarily hold securities maturing in less than three years.
The Friday payouts could be an attempt to attract older investors looking for more frequent income payments, according to Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst. Most bond ETFs have monthly distributions, he said.
TGIF’s debut would also add further momentum to one of the hottest trends in the ETF market. Actively managed ETF launches are outpacing passive for the first time in 20 years. As of Thursday, 68 active exchange-traded funds had started trading in 2020, compared with 63 passive ones, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major U.S. bank executives this week said they extended forbearance programs to millions of credit card, auto loan and mortgage customers who were financially hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic. 
While that is good news for customers who need more time to pay their bills, the delays mean some of the largest U.S. banks may not know how many consumer loans have gone bad until the end of this year or early next.
""Significant credit card losses won't show up until 180 days past the end of (forbearance) programs,"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said on Thursday. ""I would not expect to see significantly higher losses until 2021."" 
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co, Bank of America,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co have all extended programs launched this spring that allow customers to delay payments on their credit card balances or loans without incurring late fees or hurting their credit. 
The four banks set aside $33 billion this quarter for loans that could go bad, according to Reuters calculations.
Executives have said that many consumers who signed up for forbearance still made payments in the second quarter as federal stimulus checks and unemployment benefits helped prop them up. 
But with some of those benefits going away, analysts say many consumers face harder financial decisions ahead.
JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, said it extended forbearance assistance to 1.7 million accounts holding nearly $80 billion in balances since early March. While a ""large percent"" still made at least one payment during the period, the bank's chief financial officer said, many have re-enrolled in the program, which allows credit card holders to delay at least one payment.
Bank of America, the second largest U.S. bank, extended assistance to 1.8 million mostly credit card accounts since mid-March. As of July 9, 1.7 million customers holding roughly $30 billion in consumer balances were still in forbearance.
""It's true that people signed up for forbearance and continued to pay,"" said Jon Van Gorp, co-leader of Mayer Brown's banking and finance practice. 
""People are now making some real decisions about their businesses and the ongoing viability of them without having a temporary support system to keep them going. We're in for a pretty difficult next six months.""

The deliberations are part of a European Commission outreach campaign to several drug companies -- Johnson & Johnson,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc., CureVac GmbH and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) are others -- seeking agreements on the advance purchase of any successful Covid-19 vaccines, according to the person, asking not to be indentified because the talks are confidential.
A Sanofi representative confirmed the number of doses being discussed. BioNTech declined to comment. CureVac didn’t immediately respond to an email request for comment. Johnson & Johnson and Moderna couldn’t immediately be reached.
The commission, the EU’s executive arm in Brussels, has also taken charge of a deal reached last month between four member countries and AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) Plc to distribute a possible Covid-19 vaccine. That accord was to provide 300 million to 400 million doses in stages starting from the end of 2020.
Europe is keen to avoid falling behind the U.S. or China in obtaining supplies of any immunization shot. The EU is seeking to mimic the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which has entered into partnerships with vaccine companies in a bid to ensure quick availability for Americans of any successful candidates.
Reuters reported earlier on Friday that the EU is in negotiations for advance purchase deals of potential coronavirus vaccines with Moderna, Sanofi, Johnson & Johnson, BioNtech and CureVac. The report, citing two unidentified people in the EU, said any pact with Johnson & Johnson would be for the supply of 200 million doses.
A possible EU accord with Johnson & Johnson would also include options for two further batches, the official told Bloomberg News.

Moreover, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell in July to 73.2, its first fall in four months, disappointing hopes of an increase to 79 from the previous 78.1.
With other indicators suggesting a leveling off of economic activity, with the Nasdaq having posted successive record highs in recent weeks, and with the two other major indices closing in on their pre-pandemic levels, it appears that it's getting harder to make meaningful gains. 
The morning's biggest mover was Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which fell 7.2% after the streaming giant warned that it can't carry on growing exponentially, even if the world is put back in lockdown due to a second wave of the pandemic. The company expects subscriber growth to slow to 2.5 million in the current quarter, from over 10 million in the past three months.
The challenge of getting new subscribers is likely to get tougher in the coming months as disruptions to filming caused by the pandemic limit the amount new material it can offer. While that's a problem that is hardly limited to Netflix, the stock had risen 42% since the pandemic eruption before coming off its record highs.
Even at Thursday's closing levels, Netflix was valued at more than 10 times last year's revenue, a multiple that assumes rapid growth even though its largest market, the U.S., is fast becoming saturated. 
Of the early earnings releases on Friday, asset management giant BlackRock took the eye with a 22% gain in earnings per share, helped by hefty net inflows and an unabated stock buyback program. BlackRock  (NYSE:BLK) stock rose 3.7%.
While the stock market still appears to believe in the rebound continuing, the oil market appeared more skeptical. Gasoline RBOB futures fell nearly 2% to their lowest in over two weeks at just over $1.20 a gallon. "

(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc's (N:BLK) results topped Wall Street estimates on Friday, helped by investors flocking to the world's largest asset manager's bond funds in the second quarter as global financial markets rebounded strongly from a COVID-sparked brutal selloff in March.
BlackRock ended the quarter with $7.32 trillion in assets under management, up from $6.84 trillion a year earlier.
The S&P 500 (SPX) rose 20% in the second quarter after falling by that amount in the first three months of 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic slammed the economy.
""We had more conversations with our clients in the last six months than we have probably had in aggregate in years,"" Chief Executive Larry Fink said in an interview.
""Clients are looking to BlackRock more than ever before.""
BlackRock reported a 21% jump in quarterly profit as investors poured money into its fixed-income funds and cash management services.
The New York-based company's net income rose to $1.21 billion, or $7.85 per share. Analysts had expected a profit of $6.99 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. (https:// The asset manager's fixed-income funds took in $60.27 billion in new money. Its cash-management business attracted $24.2 billion in net inflows in the second quarter. ""Improved investor sentiment led to robust asset gathering,"" said Kyle Sanders, an analyst with St. Louis-based financial services firm Edward Jones. ""We were most encouraged by the sharp rebound in asset flows, as we believe sustained flow growth above industry peers is a key driver for the stock,"" he said.  The asset manager's technology business, a key area of growth for the firm, reported a 17% rise in revenue. BlackRock's financial markets advisory unit, which manages the U.S. Federal Reserve's bond-buying program, generated $39 million in revenue, down from $53 million for the same quarter a year ago. 
BlackRock shares, up about 13% for the year, were about 1% higher in early trading Friday.

1348,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>",Wall Street analysts look past Netflix's weak subscriber forecast,"By Subrat Patnaik and Aakash B
(Reuters) - Wall Street analysts shrugged off Netflix Inc's (O:NFLX) weak third-quarter subscriber forecast, as it racked up a record number of users in the first half of the year, allaying worries about competition from new players such as Disney+ and HBO MAX.
At least 10 brokerages raised their price targets on the company, saying demand for its streaming service was skewed toward the first half of the year as COVID-19 forced people around the world to stay at home.
Netflix has added nearly 26 million subscribers in the first half alone, compared with 28 million it added for the whole of 2019.
""We view the sub guide as conservative and believe the current dearth of viewing options, including lack of sports, positions Netflix as the go-to option,"" Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) analysts said.
Netflix's membership rolls rose even as it faced more streaming competition than ever. Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) Disney+ came online in November and AT&T Inc (N:T) debuted HBO Max in May, among other new entrants.
The world's largest subscription streaming video service now has nearly 193 million paying online customers, including the addition of new members. (Graphic: Netflix global subscriber additions, https://graphics.reuters.com/NETFLIX-RESULTS/qzjpqezwkpx/chart.png) 
SHARES HIT
Netflix shares, which are among the biggest gainers this year, plunged more than 8% in pre-market trading on Friday morning, after the company said it expected to add 2.5 million new paid streaming customers globally, roughly half of what analysts were expecting.
Analysts were also concerned that Netflix, which had released two hit shows ""Stranger Things"" and ""Money Heist"" in the third quarter of 2019, will not be able to pull in similar numbers of subscribers with the shows slated this year.

 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said they expect price increases to kick in late 2020 to mid-2021, likely hampering subscriber additions and investor interest in Netflix as a stay-at-home ""winner"" might taper off with countries reopening.

1349,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2020 09:20AM ET</span>","Exclusive: EU in talks with Moderna, BioNtech, CureVac to secure possible COVID vaccines, sources say","By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is negotiating advance purchase deals of potential COVID-19 vaccines with drugmakers  Moderna  (O:MRNA), Sanofi (PA:SASY) and Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and biotech firms BioNtech (O:BNTX) and CureVac, two EU sources told Reuters.
The talks follow a deal reached in June by four EU states with AstraZeneca (L:AZN) for the upfront purchase of 400 million doses of its potential COVID-19 vaccine, in principle available to all 27 EU nations.
The information on the ongoing talks was shared by the European Commission, the EU executive arm, with EU health ministers at a meeting in Berlin on Thursday, the sources said.
The multiple talks confirm the bloc's more assertive stance on procuring potential COVID-19 shots and drugs after Washington's early moves in securing promising treatments and vaccines.
""We are in talk with several companies on possible COVID-19 vaccines,"" a spokesman for the EU Commission told Reuters on Friday, declining to comment on specific firms as negotiations were confidential.
More than 150 possible vaccines are being developed and tested around the world to try to stop the pandemic. Of 23 in human clinical trials, at least three are in final Phase III testing - including candidates from China's Sinopharm and  Sinovac Biotech  (O:SVA) and AstraZeneca and Oxford University.
The most advanced EU talks appear to be those with Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi, confirming a Reuters report in June, because the EU is already discussing details on the number of doses needed.
With U.S. giant Johnson & Johnson, the European Union is negotiating a supply of 200 million doses of its potential vaccine, the sources said, adding that additional supplies may also be available.
'ADVANCED TALKS'
The bloc is also planning to secure in the second half of next year 300 million doses of the potential vaccine developed by France's Sanofi in cooperation with British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc (L:GSK), the sources said.
Asked about the negotiations, Sanofi told Reuters it was in ""advanced talks with the EU for the delivery of 300 million doses"". 
Negotiations were also ongoing, sources said, with U.S. firm Moderna, whose experimental COVID-19 vaccine showed this week it was safe and provoked immune responses in all 45 healthy volunteers in an ongoing early-stage study, according to U.S. researchers.
The bloc is also in talks with German biotechnology firms BioNtech and CureVac to buy in advance their potential vaccines, the sources said. Both firms, which have already been offered EU funds to develop their shots, declined to comment.
BioNtech is developing a potential COVID-19 vaccine in cooperation with U.S. pharmaceutical giant  Pfizer  (N:PFE), for which 100 million doses could be available by the end of the year.
CureVac is a pioneer in the so-called messenger RNA approach, which is also being pursued by BioNTech and Moderna.
RNA molecules are single-stranded versions of the DNA double-helix that can be produced in a relatively simple biochemical process.
The EU-led talks are conducted by negotiators selected by a steering group in which all 27 EU states are represented. 
Once deals are struck, EU states can place orders with drugmakers to secure precise amounts for their populations.
If doses of successful vaccines were not sufficient to cover the whole EU population, shots would be distributed based on demographic and epidemiological data, the Commission has repeatedly said.
A third EU source said the bloc was also renegotiating the deal struck with AstraZeneca by Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands, to make sure all EU states had equal access to the doses secured in the initial deal.

The source said this discussion was backed by the four states which first signed the deal.

ROME (Reuters) - The Italian government plans to list Autostrade per l'Italia by early next year after forcing through an agreement with the Benetton family to take  Atlantia 's (MI:ATL) motorway business under state control, sources close to the matter told Reuters.
The agreement was hammered out at an all-night cabinet meeting this week, avoiding the threatened cancellation of Atlantia's lucrative operating concession.
""On Wednesday we built the picture frame, now we have to put the picture in,"" one of the sources said, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The deal opens the way to settlement of a bitter dispute sparked by the collapse of a Genoa bridge run by Atlantia's tollway business in 2018, killing 43 people.
Under the proposed deal, state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) is expected to take an initial 33% stake in Autostrade through a capital increase of more than 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion).
An official memorandum of understanding is expected to be ready by the end of July, the sources said.
CDP will then, by October, set up a vehicle that will control an overall 55% of Autostrade by incorporating a stake bought from Atlantia by private investors designated by the state lender.
Atlantia, which is currently 30% owned by the Benetton family, has an 88% stake in Autostrade, with Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG), France's EDF (PA:EDF) and China's Silk Road owning the rest.
A second source cautioned that the situation is fluid and the deal's structure could change in the next few days.
Over the next six to eight months Autostrade will be demerged and listed, paving the way for the Benettons to reduce their stake to about 10%, two sources said.
""The new Autostrade could be listed as soon as January,"" one of the sources said.
As the largest shareholder in Atlantia, which also controls airport operator ADR and digital toll payment business Telepass, the Benettons have become the focus of intense pressure from the ruling 5-Star Movement, which wants the family to pull out completely at the time of the planned listing.
CDP, Atlantia and the Benettons declined to comment.

Taiwan-based Wistron, one of just three contract manufacturers that assemble Apple’s iPhones, said Friday it’s agreed to sell two subsidiaries in eastern China for 3.3 billion yuan to Luxshare. One of those units, based in the city of Kunshan, is Wistron’s sole iPhone manufacturing site, according to people familiar with the company’s business.
The deal is a win for Luxshare, which produces accessories and components from cables and chargers to antennas but is also the world’s biggest manufacturer of Apple’s AirPods -- a lucrative business that helped the company become one of 2019’s top Asian stock performers. Apple in turn has sought a mainland Chinese partner in part to broaden local sources during a trade war.
A Wistron representative said the Kunshan site being sold to Luxshare makes smartphones, notebooks and connected devices, and the company will shift production of some of those products elsewhere in China. She declined to comment on the its iPhone business. An Apple representative didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
Luxshare and other contract manufacturers have long sought to compete in assembling Apple’s most profitable device. Wistron is the smallest of three iPhone assemblers, lagging behind Pegatron Corp. and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the company also known as Foxconn. Wistron continues to assemble cheaper iPhones in India.
“With the acquisition of the Wistron’s iPhone unit, Luxshare can now become an iPhone assembler,” GF Securities analyst Jeff Pu said. “This will first pose a threat to Pegatron’s iPhone business in China.”
The deal is slated to be completed by year’s end pending regulatory approval, Wistron said in an emailed statement."

1354,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2020 07:25AM ET</span>","On eve of bankruptcy, U.S. firms shower execs with bonuses","By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Nearly a third of more than 40 large companies seeking U.S. bankruptcy protection during the coronavirus pandemic awarded bonuses to executives within a month of filing their cases, according to a Reuters analysis of securities filings and court records.
Under a 2005 bankruptcy law, companies are banned, with few exceptions, from paying executives retention bonuses while in bankruptcy. But the firms seized on a loophole by granting payouts before filing.
Six of the 14 companies that approved bonuses within a month of their filings cited business challenges executives faced during the pandemic in justifying the compensation.
Even more firms paid bonuses in the half-year period before their bankruptcies. Thirty-two of the 45 companies Reuters examined approved or paid bonuses within six months of filing. Nearly half authorized payouts within two months. 
Eight companies, including J.C. Penney Co Inc and Hertz Global Holdings (NYSE:HTZ) Inc, approved bonuses as few as five days before seeking bankruptcy protection. Hi-Crush Inc, a supplier of sand for oil-and-gas fracking, paid executive bonuses two days before its July 12 filing.
J.C. Penney - forced to temporarily close its 846 department stores and furlough about 78,000 of its 85,000 employees as the pandemic spread - approved nearly $10 million in payouts just before its May 15 filing. On Wednesday, the company said it would permanently close 152 stores and lay off 1,000 employees.
The company declined to comment for this story but said in an earlier statement that the bonuses aimed to retain a “talented management team” that had made progress on a turnaround before the pandemic.
The other companies declined to comment or did not respond. In filings, many said economic turmoil had rendered traditional compensation plans obsolete or that executives getting bonuses had forfeited other compensation.
Luxury retailer Neiman Marcus Group in March temporarily closed all of its 67 stores and in April furloughed more than 11,000 employees. The company paid $4 million in bonuses to Chairman and Chief Executive Geoffroy van Raemdonck in February and more than $4 million to other executives in the weeks before its May 7 bankruptcy filing, court records show. Neiman Marcus drew scrutiny this week on a plan it proposed after filing for bankruptcy to pay additional bonuses to executives. The company declined to comment. 
Hertz - which recently terminated more than 14,000 workers - paid senior executives bonuses of $1.5 million days before its May 22 bankruptcy, in part to recognize the uncertainty they faced from the pandemic’s impact on travel, the company said in a filing.
Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) Corp bestowed $14.6 million in extra compensation to executives days before its April 1 bankruptcy. Shale pioneer Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK) awarded $25 million to executives and lower-level employees in May, about eight weeks before filing bankruptcy. Both cited fallout from the pandemic and a Saudi-Russian oil price war, which they said rendered their incentive plans ineffective. 
Reuters reviewed financial disclosures and court records from 45 companies that filed for bankruptcy between March 11, the day the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and July 15. Using a database provided by BankruptcyData, a division of New Generation Research Inc, Reuters reviewed companies with publicly trade stock or debt and more than $50 million in liabilities.
Such bonuses have long spurred objections that companies are enriching executives while cutting jobs, stiffing creditors and wiping out stock investors. In March, creditors sued former Toys 'R' Us executives and directors, accusing them of misdeeds that included paying management bonuses days before its 2017 bankruptcy. The retailer liquidated in 2018, terminating more than 31,000 people. 
A lawyer for the executives and directors said the bonuses were justified, given the extra work and stress on management, and that Toys 'R' Us had hoped to remain in business after restructuring.
In June, congressional Democrats responded to the pandemic-induced wave of bankruptcies by introducing legislation that would strengthen creditors’ rights to claw back bonuses. The bill - the latest iteration of a proposal that has long failed to gain traction - faces slim prospects in a Republican-controlled Senate, a Democratic aide said.
Firms paying pre-bankruptcy bonuses know they would face scrutiny in court on compensation proposed after their filings, said Clifford J. White III, director of the U.S. Trustee Program, a Justice Department division charged with monitoring bankruptcy proceedings. But the trustees have no power to halt bonuses paid even days before a company’s bankruptcy filing, he said, allowing firms to “escape the transparency and court review.”
DODGING BONUS RESTRICTIONS
The 2005 legislation required executives and other corporate insiders to have a competing job offer in hand before receiving retention bonuses during bankruptcy, among other restrictions. That forced failing firms to devise new ways to pay the bonuses, according to some restructuring experts.
After the 2008 financial crisis, companies often proposed bonuses in bankruptcy court, casting them as incentive plans with goals executives must meet. Judges mostly approved the plans, ruling that the performance benchmarks put the compensation beyond the purview of the restrictions on retention bonuses. The plans, however, sparked objections from Justice Department monitors who called them retention bonuses in disguise, often with easy milestones.
Eventually, companies found they could avoid scrutiny altogether by approving bonuses before bankruptcy filings. Dozens of companies have approved such payouts in the last five years, said Brian Cumberland, an executive compensation expert at consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal who advises companies undergoing financial restructurings.
Companies argue the bonuses are crucial to retaining executives whose departures could torpedo their businesses, ultimately leaving less money for creditors and employees. Now, some companies are bolstering those arguments by contending that their business would not have cratered without the economic turmoil of the pandemic.
The pre-bankruptcy payouts are needed, companies say, because potential stock awards are worthless and it would be impossible for executives to meet business targets that were crafted before the economic crisis. The bonuses ensure stability in leadership that is needed to hold faltering operations together, the firms contend.
Some specialists argue the bonuses are hard to justify for executives who may have few better job options in an economic crisis.
“With double-digit unemployment, it’s a strange time to be paying out retention bonuses,” said Adam Levitin, a professor specializing in bankruptcy at Georgetown University’s law school.
CLOSED STORES, BIG BONUSES
J.C. Penney has not posted an annual profit since 2010 as it has struggled to grapple with the shift to online shopping and competition from discount retailers. The 118-year-old chain, at various points, employed more than 200,000 people and operated 1,600 stores, figures that have since been cut more than half.
On May 10, J.C. Penney’s board approved compensation changes that paid top executives, including CEO Jill Soltau, nearly $10 million. On May 13, Soltau received a $1.7 million long-term incentive payment and a $4.5 million retention bonus, court filings show.
The annual pay of the company’s median employee, a part-time hourly worker, was $11,482 in 2019, a company filing shows.
J.C. Penney filed for bankruptcy two days after paying Soltau’s bonuses. At a hearing the next day, a creditors’ lawyer argued the payouts were designed to thwart court review. The payouts were timed “so that they didn’t have to put it in front of you,” said the lawyer, Kristopher Hansen, addressing U.S. Bankruptcy Judge David Jones.
Jones - who is also overseeing the Whiting Petroleum, Chesapeake Energy and Neiman Marcus cases - told Reuters that such bonuses are “always a concern” in bankruptcy cases. “That said, the adversarial process demands that parties put the issue before me before I can take action,” he added, emphasizing he was speaking of general dynamics applicable to any case. “A comment made in passing by a lawyer is not sufficient.”
In its statement earlier this year, J.C. Penney said the bonuses were among a series of “tough, prudent decisions” taken to safeguard the firm’s future. 
Dennis Marten - a shareholder who said he once worked at a J.C. Penney store - disagrees. He has appeared at court hearings pleading for an investigation of the company’s leadership.

“Shame on her for having the gall to get that money,” he said of Soltau.

(Reuters) - Retail investing is having a moment. Major U.S. brokerages that reported quarterly results this week cheered the self-directed day trading happening on their platforms as individuals with a bit of extra money and time on their hands during the coronavirus pandemic have been engaging more in markets. 
Bank of America Corp’s (N:BAC) self-directed investment platform Merrill Edge saw trading volume rise 184% and new accounts up 13% during the second quarter. It now has nearly 3 million users with a record $246 billion in assets, a spokesperson said.  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), which is in the process of acquiring E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) Corp , expects to see similar gains when the deal is complete, Chief Executive James Gorman said. ""(E*Trade has) attracted hundreds of thousands of new accounts... with that has come real money, not just kids playing,"" Gorman said Thursday. ""They've brought in billions of dollars of net new assets and deposits, and their platform has remained very stable.""
E*Trade reports earnings later this month. Growth in self-directed investing has accelerated during the pandemic as more people take up day trading from their living rooms on platforms like Robinhood, E*Trade and Fidelity. 
That type of trading is not as profitable for brokerages as handling assets for more affluent clients, especially after startups like Robinhood came on the scene with commission-free trading. That led others to slash fees to $0, but brokerages assume they can make money from retail investors in other ways. They can lend out their shares or earn money from margin loans or additional services. Plus, people who are casually interested in markets now may eventually want other services, whether in the wealth management sphere or in more traditional banking. Some customers with significant assets also want a self-directed account to place their own bets, said a senior wealth management executive at Bank of America, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
""We've seen more and more clients who are hybrid,"" the executive said. ""They have a relationship with a financial adviser but they also have some of their assets where they choose to be self-directed."" Executives at BofA and Morgan Stanley said that wealthier clients have not been as active in recent months as the pandemic led to big, unexpected market swings. Those customers continued to hoard cash, even as equity markets rebounded lately, executives at Bank of America and Morgan Stanley said. ""The indicators are clearly pointing to a cautious outlook for our clients,"" Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said. Second quarter commissions revenue fell 19% from the first quarter this year, although wealth management revenues at Morgan Stanley rose overall. 

Revenue in the wealth management division at Bank of America fell 10% primarily due to lower interest rates and transaction fees during the second quarter.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to end the week a little higher, but trading is likely to be cautious as investors continue to take their cue from an earnings season which is generating its fair share of disappointments, the latest of which came from streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
Netflix, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the wave of lockdowns across the globe in the second quarter, reported after the bell on Thursday that it expects subscriber growth to slow to 2.5 million in the third quarter, less than half of what Wall Street had expected. Its shares were down 8.2% by 7:15 AM ET (1115 GMT). 
The broader market was up, however:  S&P 500 Futures traded 11 points, or 0.4%, higher, Nasdaq Futures up 95 points, or 0.9%. The Dow Futures contract rose 53 points, or 0.2%.
As it stands, the S&P 500 cash index is up 1% on the week, theDow Jones Industrial Average up 2.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite is 1.4% lower.
Earlier Friday, Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) reported a 22% gain in per share earnings for the quarter, somewhat better than expected. The world's largest asset manager also reported $100 billion of  net inflows and $1.1 billion of stock buybacks. Its stock gained 1.9% premarket.
Optimism about the general trajectory of recovery is still outweighing alarm at the spread of the coronavirus across the U.S.  The U.S. reported a new daily record of  over 77,000 new virus cases on Thursday, taking its total to over 3.5 million.  U.S. deaths also rose to their highest for a single day since early June.
More than 13.8 million people around the world have been diagnosed with Covid-19, with Brazil passing the 2 million and India the 1 million mark. More than 590,000 have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Meanwhile, the U.S. and China continue to spar. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that administration officials are discussing banning travel by China’s Communist Party members and their families to the U.S., in response to the new security law in Hong Kong, while there are likely to be further moves against Huawei and video service TikTok.
U.S. economic data Friday includes the latest housing starts, which are expected to have risen 1.1 million in June, after increasing just under one million in May. Building permits are expected to have jumped to 1.29 million from 1.216 million a month earlier. 
The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index is expected to rise to 79 in July, from 78.1 last time out.  
Oil prices were lower, but essentially range-bound. At 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% lower at $40.52 a barrel, while Brent fell 0.6% to $43.11.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,805.65/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1427, up 0.4%."

1360,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>",Former Pemex boss arrives back in Mexico to face politically charged trial,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A former boss of Mexican state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos arrived back in Mexico on Friday where he will face an initial court hearing to answer corruption charges that could engulf leaders of the last government.
Emilio Lozoya, who was extradited back to Mexico from Spain overnight, faces trial for alleged bribery and money laundering offenses dating back to his 2012-16 tenure in charge of the firm known as Pemex.
He denies wrongdoing.
Shortly before 1 a.m. local time, a plane carrying Lozoya landed at the Mexico City airport, media reported. The aircraft remained in a hangar belonging to the Mexican attorney general's office for more than two hours, according to media and television footage, as journalists waited to capture the first images of Lozoya back on Mexican soil.
Once a rising star of Mexican politics, Lozoya has become a key witness in President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's drive to expose graft in and around the government he took over from his predecessor, Enrique Pena Nieto, in late 2018.
Under Mexican law, the 45-year-old Lozoya must make an initial statement to a judge after entering the country.
That first court hearing should be on Friday, a Mexican official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Scion of a political family and former luminary of the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Lozoya has agreed to shed light on alleged acts of corruption under the government of Pena Nieto, according to Lopez Obrador.
That prospect has sparked speculation in Mexican media that Lozoya will make damaging revelations about ex-colleagues and politicians to reduce any possible sentence. Pena Nieto denies wrongdoing.
Prosecutors say Lozoya solicited and obtained funds from Brazilian firm Odebrecht for Pena Nieto's 2012 presidential campaign. Pena Nieto won, defeating Lopez Obrador.
In exchange, they contend, Lozoya awarded contracts to the firm as boss of Pemex and also took money for contracts from Mexican steelmaker Altos Hornos de Mexico.
Prosecutors allege that while at Pemex, Lozoya spent some $450 million renovating and acquiring an out-of-service fertilizer plant from Altos Hornos de Mexico.
Odebrecht has admitted paying bribes in Mexico. The bosses of Altos Hornos de Mexico have denied wrongdoing.
Lawyers for Lozoya have said he acted under the orders of Pena Nieto.
Lopez Obrador has shied away from pointing the finger directly at Pena Nieto.

But the leftist leader has suggested that Pena Nieto's landmark 2013-14 liberalization of the energy market, which Lopez Obrador strongly opposed, was tainted by corruption.

1361,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 17, 2020 06:00AM ET</span>",U.K.’s $38 Billion Stimulus Package Is Coming Under Fire,"(Bloomberg) -- U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak’s 30 billion-pound ($38 billion) stimulus package is coming under fire, with the opposition Labour Party calling on the country’s spending watchdog to open an investigation.
Central to Sunak’s announcement last month was the Job Retention Bonus, a 9.4 billion-pound program which pays employers 1,000 pounds for every employee they take back out of furlough and retain for three months. He has since acknowledged the plan has a “deadweight” cost, as taxpayers will pay companies to rehire staff they would have taken back regardless.
On Friday, Labour’s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, wrote to the National Audit Office to request a probe into whether Sunak’s package represents value for money.
“The chancellor’s Job Retention Bonus risks handing over billions to businesses that were already planning to bring their workers back from furlough,” Phillipson said in a statement. “Labour accepts that no scheme can be perfect -- but a poorly targeted and wasteful scheme is a missed opportunity. That’s why the NAO should investigate.”
The opposition party has repeatedly called for more targeted support to those parts of the economy most affected by the pandemic, an approach Sunak has suggested is too complicated because of the inter-linkages between sectors.
Criticism
Sunak’s stimulus has also come under criticism from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which said that not all of it is new money. The think tank cited research by the Office for Budget Responsibility suggesting the final bill for the package could be just 20 billion pounds and, of that, 8 billion pounds had been diverted from other previously planned expenditure.
“The 30 billion-pound package turns out to be more like 12 billion pounds of additional spending plus some 8 billion pounds or so reallocated from previously planned projects,” IFS Associated Director David Phillips said. “While such reallocations may be perfectly sensible -- the Covid-19 crisis may have made some projects less of a priority or even infeasible in the short term -- official policy documents should be clear what is happening and where spending is expected to be lower than previously planned.”
Separately, the House of Commons Treasury Committee, a cross-party panel which scrutinizes the work of Sunak’s department, said it would begin an inquiry into what the tax system should look like after the coronavirus pandemic.
The probe will look at how the U.K. can protect its tax base in the face of pressures from globalization and technological change, as well as whether there is a role for windfall taxes post-pandemic, the committee said in a statement.

(T:9984) quietly sold an additional $2.2 billion of its stake in  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. as part of the Japanese conglomerate’s fund-raising effort to pay down debt and buy back its own shares.
The deal, which includes a collar contract and call spread, is expected to be settled between May 2024 and June 2024. The details were disclosed on page 276 of SoftBank’s year-end financial filing released on June 25, but have not been previously reported. A SoftBank Group spokesman confirmed the details of the sale.
This step is the latest in an unwinding of a relationship between the two companies that spans two decades. SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son was an early backer of Jack Ma’s Alibaba and the Chinese e-commerce giant remains his most successful investment by far. In early 2000, Son invested $20 million into the then-unknown web portal connecting Chinese manufacturers with overseas buyers, a stake that is now worth more than $150 billion. Son and Ma stepped down from each other’s boards last month.
The deal brings the total of Alibaba stock sold by the Tokyo-based company this year to $13.7 billion. SoftBank in May said that it entered into several prepaid forward contracts with banks in April and May using Alibaba shares to procure a total of $11.5 billion. That includes a $1.5 billion forward contract with settlement in April 2024, a $1.5 billion floor contract with settlement in Dec. 2023 and Jan. 2024, and a $8.5 billion collar contract with settlement from Jan. to Sept. 2022.
SoftBank is in the process of offloading 4.5 trillion yen ($42 billion) of assets to bankroll stock buybacks and slash debt to reassure investors after a swoon in its shares earlier this year. In addition to Alibaba, the company is selling a stake in T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc. for as much as $20 billion and stock in its domestic telecom unit.
SoftBank shares have recovered as the company has sold assets and bought back stock. The stock has climbed about 140% from their low in March and hit the highest level in two decades this month.

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's stock markets and fast charging currencies were left treading water on Friday, as EU leaders met in Brussels to try to hammer through a 750 billion euro post-pandemic recovery fund.
European and world equity markets were heading for their third weekly gain in a row, but they were the smallest yet and Friday's go-slow involved all the main asset classes from commodities to bonds. 
London's FTSE, Paris, Milan and Madrid had all sagged into the red in early trading and though the euro ticked up, Italian and Spanish bond yields were struggling to stay anchored to their recent lows. 
""Presumably, as is the way of Europe, they will agree to come back from more talks followed by a compromise and a watered down deal,"" Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY)'s Kit Juckes said of the EU discussions. ""The positive though is that we are getting a recovery fund."" 
An eventual green light to the 750 billion euro plan should finally lead to joint European debt, but investors are seeing their broader list of uncertainties and questions growing again.
Will the COVID-19 pandemic force economies into lockdown again? Will governments and central banks keep feeding the markets beast with stimulus? And finally, are tech shares losing their mojo? 
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares had dived 9% after the bell in Wall Street on Thursday after its results had flopped.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei slid 0.3% on concerns about rising virus infections in Tokyo. China's CSI300 index climbed 0.25%, though that was after a near 5% slump on Thursday. 
Adding to the recent rise in U.S.-Sino tensions, Washington had said it was considering banning members of the Chinese Communist Party travelling to the United States. The party totals more than 90 million people.
Market watchers said investors were counting on more stimulus. As well as Europe's recovery fund, the U.S. Congress is set to begin debating a new aid package next week, as several states in the country's south and west implement fresh lockdown measures to curb the virus. 
While retail sales for June released on Thursday beat market expectations, real-time measures of retail foot traffic and employee working hours and shifts have flatlined after steady growth since April.
""We now see higher risk of a market correction, considering the improvement in hard economic data we have seen over the past couple of months is likely to halt,"" said Tomo Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco in Tokyo.

STUCK IN A RUTTE
In currencies, the euro hovered below the four-week high it touched earlier this week, but was barely budging as European Union leaders met.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, one of the main resisters to the recovery fund including mass grants, said that he was ""not optimistic"" that agreement would be reached on Friday as he arrived for the meeting.
The Netherlands wants countries receiving EU support from the fund to agree to reforms in their labour markets and pension systems, and is leading a group of several smaller EU nations calling for stricter conditions.
The euro fetched $1.14, up 0.2% on the day and heading for its fourth straight week of gains against a dollar that has been struggling globally.
The yen was up fractionally at 107.13 per dollar and Sweden's high-flying crown was up again. 
In commodities trading, oil prices were little changed with Brent down 0.25% at $43.26 per barrel and U.S. crude down 0.15% at $40.87. 
The United States reported at least 75,000 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, a daily record. Spain and Australia reported their steepest daily jumps in more than two months, while cases continued to soar in India and Brazil.
The two benchmark crudes had fallen 1% on Thursday too after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, agreed to trim their record supply cuts of 9.7 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2 million bpd, starting in August.

1365,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 17, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Huawei's Pain is Ericsson's Gain,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Few companies have as much reason to be as grateful to Donald Trump as Ericsson (ST:ERICb).
Europe’s largest maker of telecom network equipment seemed on a slow route to junior status, if not quite irrelevance, on the world stage as China’s Huawei swept all before it in the first two decades of the millennium.
However, the U.S. President’s assault on Huawei has changed all that. The Swedish company is enjoying a new lease of life as the U.S. and - slowly - its allies, squeeze the Chinese company out of their vital infrastructure, fearing that it enables and facilitates the rampant and increasingly sophisticated industrial and military espionage practised by Beijing.
That political choice has given Ericsson and its Finnish-based rival Nokia (HE:NOKIA) an effective duopoly in Europe and a much stronger position in North America, just as operators are having to spend billions on upgrading their networks to the 5G standard.
The hallmark of any monopolist or duopolist is margins and, after years of struggle, the easing of competition is having an increasingly clear effect on Ericsson. The company’s operating margin rose to 8.2% from 7.0% a year ago, with a particularly strong expansion in the group’s Digital Services division. The gross margin excluding restructuring charges widened by 1.8 percentage points over the first half, compared to the same period a year ago. Changes in the product mix and the falling away of previous investment costs also helped. 
Despite obvious challenges to the business environment, the group recommitted to its target of an operating margin of as much as 12% within two years. 
Ericsson stock leaped more than 10% in Stockholm in response to the news on Friday to their highest in over five years.
Naturally, Ericsson has more going for it than the fact that its most feared competitor has been hobbled. The acceleration of the Working From Home will force network operators to roll out more bandwidth to households than they had envisaged, and faster. So far, that appears to be a bigger factor than the drop in demand from offices and other shared spaces.
But the reality is this: a U.S. ally such as the U.K. is forcing network operators to stop buying Huawei kit from 2021, and to replace it entirely in their networks by 2027. BT Group (LON:BT) reckons this will cost it 500 million pounds ($625 million).  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) says it could cost billions of pounds. Even allowing for corporate exaggeration and special pleading, it’s clear that Huawei’s loss is someone else’s gain. In many – perhaps most – cases, that someone will be Ericsson, probably for years to come.
Small wonder that Ericsson’s shares are up 18% year-to-date, while Nokia’s are up 14%."
1366,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 17, 2020 05:36AM ET</span>",China Stocks’ Quickest Reversal Since 2015 Blindsides Investors,"(Bloomberg) -- After the worst weekly drop for China’s stock benchmark in four months, traders are now asking whether the once sizzling rally is over.
The CSI 300 Index capped a 4.4% loss this week, after surging 7.6% the week before. That’s the fastest reversal since the yuan devaluation in August 2015. The plunge came after the government adopted a series of measures to slow the pace of gains in what had suddenly become the world’s hottest equity market.
Retail investors, who bore the brunt of the losses when a stock bubble burst five years ago, are again questioning the merits of stock investing.
“This week’s slump was a shock, I didn’t even have time to think before everything was suddenly plunging,” said Wang Yao, a 36 year-old information system auditor based in Wuhan who lost “a lot of money” in 2015. “A long-term bull market is looking very unlikely.”
Such a reaction may be welcomed by officials after investors took on the most margin loans in five years to chase gains.
“The so-called ‘fast bull’ is definitely over,” said Shen Zhengyang, Shanghai-based strategist at Northeast Securities Co., who thinks most stocks in China now look expensive. “Leverage was the key reason behind this rally. The regulators do not want rapid gains and they are conducting measures to cool sentiment.”
A slow pace of gains would lower the risk of another destabilizing bubble. Rising share prices could boost consumer spending as well as make it easier for companies to raise funds and pay off debt.
Dai Ming, a fund manager at Hengsheng Asset Management Co. pointed to more sustainable sources of support for the rally such as mutual fund issuances and foreign inflows. China’s equity mutual fund issuance is on track for the largest full-year amount since 2015’s record, while net foreign inflows into mainland stocks via trading links in the first half of this year were the second-highest on record.
“I feel quite relaxed about the drop,” he said. “I don’t think the state media warnings can easily change this cycle.”"

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Indonesian tycoon Anthoni Salim narrowly won shareholder backing on Friday for a $3 billion takeover transaction between companies he controls, overcoming criticism about the deal's valuation and questions about corporate governance.
 First Pacific  Co Ltd (HK:0142), Salim's holding company, said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange that a takeover by its subsidiary Indofood CBP (ICBP) (JK:ICBP) of Pinehill Company Ltd was approved by its independent shareholders at a special meeting where 52% of votes were cast in favour. 
ICBP is best known for the Indomie noodle brand and Pinehill is one of Indomie's distributors and manufacturers, in the Middle East and Africa.
ICBP shares dropped 3.1% on Friday, compared to a 0.4% fall in the local benchmark (JKSE). First Pacific shares traded flat.
Citi analyst Vivi Lie said in a note that while Friday's vote may put ""slight negative pressure"" on ICBP shares, the downside was limited as the negative sentiment on the deal was already priced into valuations.
Salim is Indonesia's sixth-richest man with a net worth of $5.5 billion according to Forbes. He and a relative own a combined 57.3% of a company which owns 51% of Pinehill and Salim also holds 44.3% of First Pacific's shares, according to corporate filings. ICBP's 2019 annual report says Salim controls First Pacific. 
The transaction, which needed a simple majority on Friday to pass, also needs approval of ICBP shareholders to proceed. 
Some First Pacific shareholders had earlier raised concerns about the $3 billion price ICBP was paying for Pinehill, saying it was too high.
While Salim and his associates were not eligible to vote at Friday's meeting under Hong Kong's related-party rules as they are not considered independent shareholders, they can vote under Indonesian rules in ICBP's extraordinary general meeting (EGM). Some shareholders have said that raised governance questions. 
Those in favour of the transaction have said the takeover could boost ICBP's financial performance significantly. 

ICBP's EGM, which had been scheduled for July 15, was postponed because Indonesia's financial regulator said it needed to give shareholders additional information, according to announcements in local newspapers.

(Reuters) - European shares were little changed on Friday, with stocks trading in a narrow range as focus turned to Brussels where European Union leaders are expected to hammer out details of a 750-billion-euro recovery fund.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was flat after opening marginally higher, as banks (SX7P), energy firms (SXEP), travel and leisure (SXTP) sectors declined more than 1%.
The United States shattered its daily record for coronavirus infections on Thursday, raising fears of slower recovery in the world's largest economy.
Investors were on a wait-and-watch mode ahead of the outcome from the weekend's EU summit.
Euro zone stocks (STOXXE) slipped 0.2% after rallying earlier this week to highest since early March, mostly on hopes that an EU-wide fund to support the pandemic-stuck economies could lift the bloc out of a recession.
Analysts believe markets could tolerate a few days' or weeks' delay with opposition from the Netherlands and the threat of a Hungarian veto weighing on chances of a deal on the EU's 2021-27 budget, envisaged at slightly above 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion), and the attached recovery fund.
""The hope is tempered by the fact that the obstacles to an agreement remain high with 4-5 countries insistent that any grants be allocated with conditionality on the part of the countries receiving them,"" CMC Markets' Michael Hewson said in a note.
""This is hardly unreasonable, but also suggests there will be no quick solution, with the probability that the can will get kicked down the road.""
However, the STOXX 600 was on course to record a third straight week of gains, as reports of progress in developing a COVID-19 vaccine supported cyclical stocks.
Automakers (SXAP) were the top sectoral gainers in Europe as  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) rose 3.4% after saying it expects to post a smaller-than-expected operating loss in the second quarter in a pre-earnings release.
Sweden's main stock index (OMXSPI) gained 0.5%, with truck maker Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb) and telecom equipment maker Ericsson (ST:ERICb) reporting better-than-expected core profits. Ericsson's shares surged 10.4% in their best one-day percentage gain in more than two years.

Tobacco group  Swedish Match  AB (ST:SWMA) surged 8.2% as it beat quarterly profit forecasts helped by U.S. sales of its ZYN tobacco-free nicotine pouches.

1369,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 17, 2020 04:18AM ET</span>",U.S. Virus Relief Set to Vanish in Series of Fiscal Cliffs,"(Bloomberg) -- America’s leaders face an urgent set of decisions on whether to extend history’s biggest rescue effort -- or let parts of it lapse.
The government approved more than $2 trillion of extra spending after the coronavirus brought swaths of industry and commerce to a sudden halt. Some measures targeted those who took the biggest hit, like the unemployed and small business. Others were across-the-board, reaching every corner of the economy.
But these programs are due to run out in the coming weeks and months. Each expiration date will test the still-fragile U.S. recovery -- unless policy makers opt to keep crisis supports in place.
These kind of cutoff dates, when past decisions dictate a big change in net government spending unless further action is taken, are sometimes known as “fiscal cliffs.” They have a history of roiling markets, as politicians take the debate to the brink.
The Trump administration wants another relief bill, with a price tag not exceeding $1 trillion, before lawmakers head out of town for summer recess in early August. The Democrat-controlled House already approved additional measures worth $3.5 trillion, but Republicans who have a Senate majority oppose many of them.
Here are some of the looming deadlines, and the numbers involved.
Unemployment Insurance
The federal government added $600 a week to state-provided jobless benefits under the CARES Act, the main coronavirus relief measure passed by Congress in March. Those extra payments, which helped plug a hole in household finances, are due to run out in the final week of July.
What to do next has turned into a fierce political fight. With unemployment still at levels not seen since the Great Depression era, the Treasury has been disbursing the benefits at a record pace of about $100 billion a month since May. Republicans are concerned that the payments could deter people from resuming their jobs, and want some of the stimulus channeled into a “back-to-work bonus” instead.
Big Business
The government handed $25 billion in payroll support to America’s passenger airlines to help them retain staff through the end of September, as well as offering loans worth a similar amount.
The carriers have already signaled that layoffs will likely start as soon as that program expires. This month, United Airlines told some 36,000 employees -- about 45% of the U.S. workforce -- that their jobs will be at risk starting in October.
So far the trade group for major carriers, Airlines for America, says it isn’t seeking additional funding, although labor unions in the industry have called for an extension of the aid programs.
Small Business
The deadline to apply for more than $132 billion still available in the small-business relief program has been extended until Aug. 8.
Congress also took action to smooth the path for companies that already borrowed under the program. They were originally supposed to spend the money within eight weeks -- mostly on payroll -- to qualify for forgiveness of the loans. That was stretched out to as long as 24 weeks.
Student Loans
The CARES Act froze repayments through the end of September on student loans owned by the federal government, which make up about three-quarters of the $1.54 trillion total. Americans will likely save about $7 billion a month while the measure is in place.
When those bills start arriving again in October, there’s a risk that millions won’t be able to pay. Even in 2019, with unemployment at half-century lows, about 11% of student debt was delinquent -- and the New York Fed says that the effective rate is twice as high, since half of the loans weren’t currently due for payment anyway.
Mortgage Borrowers
The CARES Act set up a forbearance program that covered federally insured mortgages. The total payments on loans that qualify for the plan would be about $55 billion a month, the New York Fed estimates.
The Mortgage Bankers Association said this week that 8.2% of loan balances, owed by an estimated 4.1 million homeowners, were in forbearance.
Renters
The CARES Act imposed a freeze on evictions through July 25 for multifamily properties whose mortgages are financed by federal agencies like Fannie Mae. Owners who benefited from mortgage relief are barred from evicting tenants after that date too, for as long as their loans are in forbearance. And the Federal Housing Finance Agency has extended safeguards through at least Aug. 31 for tenants of single-family homes with federally insured mortgages.
All told, the federal measures cover about 12.3 million of the country’s 43.8 million rental homes, according to the Urban Institute. A patchwork of measures by states and cities also offered protection to renters. Some of those have already run out, and others are about to, according to Princeton University’s Eviction Lab.
About one-third of tenants who responded to the Census Bureau’s Household Pulse survey during the first week of July said they had little or no confidence that they could make next month’s payment.
Taxes
Americans were allowed until this week to file their income-tax returns, after the federal deadline was delayed by three months to July 15.
Two other measures will be in place through Dec. 31. Payroll-tax deferral allows businesses to defer their portion of the taxes and repay them in 2021 and 2022. Companies can also claim the Employee Retention Tax Credit through the end of the year. It’s worth as much as $5,000 per employee, and there’s bipartisan support in Congress for increasing that sum in the next stimulus package.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded mixed early Friday, amid caution about the likelihood of additional stimulus for the region as new coronavirus case numbers continue to rise globally.
At 3:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.5% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.2%. 
European Union leaders meet later Friday to seek agreement over a proposed recovery fund to help the countries hard hit by the coronavirus outbreak to rebuild.
The current 750-billion euro  ($850 billion) proposal sees a split of 500 billion in grants and 250 billion in loans, which would mark a major step towards fiscal integration in Europe. This is likely to face opposition from some richer, mainly northern European nations, but has the backing of both Germany and France.
French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday he was confident but cautious that the European Union would reach an agreement on this recovery plan, while Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte put the chances of a deal this weekend at less than 50%.
“We are not confident that an agreement will be reached this weekend, but we expect it to be reached before the European Commission starts its summer holidays in August,” said Danske Bank.
The European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde warned Thursday that further ""ample stimulus"" was needed to counter high uncertainty around efforts to combat the virus and mitigate the economic impact.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) and Glass, Lewis & Co on Thursday recommended that Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp shareholders elect all company directors, dealing a blow to two activist investors pushing to add five newcomers.
ISS and Glass Lewis each backed the Japanese conglomerate's 12 board members and said shareholders should vote against hedge fund Effissimo Capital Management's three proposed directors, including one of the fund's partners, and against 3D Opportunity Master Fund's two candidates.
Shareholders will vote at Toshiba's annual meeting scheduled for July 31 and many investors follow the proxy advisers' recommendations.
""The recently reconstituted board is appropriately focused on the key issues impacting Toshiba, and therefore, additional change at the board level does not appear necessary at this time,"" ISS said in its report.
Toshiba acknowledged its more international ownership, which includes U.S. hedge funds King Street Capital and Farallon Capital Management, when it added seven independent directors, with the input of shareholders, last year.
Toshiba said ISS's recommendation underscores that its ""slate of directors has the right mix of skills, experiences and new perspectives to provide independent oversight of the continued execution of our transformational Toshiba Next Plan (TNP).""
The company faced fresh pressure from shareholders this year when 3D, which owns a 4.2% stake, said the share price was being hampered because the company is a conglomerate. Effissimo, Toshiba's biggest shareholder with a 15% stake, argued that more progress on corporate governance was needed after an accounting scandal in 2015.
Toshiba and Effissimo also tangled recently over whether large investors should be able to serve as board members. Effissimo said investors make good directors because their interest is in pushing the company to greater success. The company expressed concerns about conflicts that shareholders would have. 

ISS did not weigh in on the issue.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen edging higher Friday, amid hopes for additional stimulus for the region as new coronavirus case numbers continue to rise globally.
At 2 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%, while CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1%.
European Union leaders meet later Friday to seek agreement over a proposed recovery fund to help the countries hard hit by the coronavirus outbreak to rebuild.
The current 750-billion euro  ($850 billion) proposal sees a split of 500 billion in grants and 250 billion in loans, which would mark a major step towards fiscal integration in Europe. This is likely to face opposition from some richer, mainly northern European nations, but has the backing of both Germany and France..
“We are not confident that an agreement will be reached this weekend, but we expect it to be reached before the European Commission starts its summer holidays in August,” said Danske Bank.
The European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde warned Thursday that further ""ample stimulus"" was needed to counter high uncertainty around efforts to combat the virus and mitigate the economic impact.
In the U.S., political leaders are set to begin debating such another recovery package next week, as several states in the country's south and west implement fresh lockdown measures to curb the virus while some existing programmes to support businesses are set to expire within weeks.

1376,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 17, 2020 01:36AM ET</span>",How to Generate a Bigger Bonus While Trading From Home,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Struggling to make money in the financial markets now that the pandemic has taken you away from the buzzing arena of the trading floor? Try talking to yourself. Adopt a kitten. And don’t just review your trades, profitable or otherwise, take the time to re-view them.
That’s the advice of Brett Steenbarger, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York. Steenbarger specializes in trader psychology. Legendary investor Paul Tudor Jones employed him from 2010 to 2014 as the director of trader development at his global macro fund, Tudor Investment Corp. Since 2003, Steenbarger has published five books on the psychology of successful trading.
I caught up with him by telephone on Wednesday, soon after he’d finished feeding his four rescue cats. “I'm a firm believer that we set the tone for our day by what we do at the start of the day,” he’s written. “I don't start by looking at market quotes, news, emails, or chats. I start by loving and serving those I love. Actions, repeated, transform us: We become what we do.” Below is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation.
Mark Gilbert: On your blog, you talk about re-viewing trades, by going back through charts showing things like price action and volumes minute-by-minute, rather than just reviewing them. What do you mean by that distinction?
Brett Steenbarger: What we’re doing is not just looking them over, we are re-experiencing them. What we experience is what we internalize. Traders I worked with in Chicago some years ago, they had a recording, they would replay the markets they had traded and literally re-experience what had happened, what they had been thinking, but now in the context of being an observer and being able to see the opportunities that they perhaps missed, correct the mistakes that they made. That re-viewing accelerated their learning curves and was probably the number one thing they did that was most effective in spurring their development.  
MG: You’ve written about the benefits of talking through trading ideas out loud to yourself. How does that work?
BS: Any time we talk aloud, we become the listener as well as the speaker. It gives our ideas a greater objectivity. We become more aware of those ideas, it adds a layer of mindfulness to what we’re doing. Let’s say I have an impulse to buy or sell an asset, maybe because it’s moving a particular way and I don’t want it to move against me. If I say out loud what I’m thinking and what I’m about to do, immediately I can recognize if it sounds ridiculous: “This is not how I do my best money management, I’m being completely reactive.” I would be embarrassed to speak it out loud to a valued colleague. We get a layer of self-observation when we talk out loud that can be really useful. It makes us in a certain sense accountable.  
MG: How are the most successful traders dealing with lockdown?
BS: That is the top question I’ve been dealing with in talking with portfolio managers, team members at hedge funds and individual traders. Being in this lockdown mode, working from home, they don’t have the same level of stimulation that they had when they were in the regular working world and they don’t have the same level of stimulation in their personal lives. They are overwhelmed because they have no balance between the work and the responsibilities. All those things that would normally be balancing factors, that produce the positives, they have less access to.
Positive emotional experiences really provide us with a buffer against stress. We can deal with a lot of pressure, a lot of uncertainty, if we have positive experiences to balance that, so the stress doesn’t become distress. So many people I work with are lacking those positives.
MG: How important is teamwork and staying connected?
BS: There are two forms of teamwork. One is the teamwork that goes on purely professionally when money managers are generating ideas, sharing information. Staying connected to others is an important source of stimulation intellectually. I’ve done some research on what makes portfolio managers and traders successful, and the number one factor has been intellectual curiosity. Really successful money managers love generating ideas, they love the hunt for new opportunities. And so by connecting via teamwork they’re able to feed that curiosity that keeps them stimulated even when they’re working from home.
Then there’s the other kind of teamwork. Working together closely in our social lives, with friends, with extended family, with the family we’re living with, but using the time creatively to get that stimulation that we might not be getting because we’re not doing the same travel, going to clubs and so forth. Interaction is not just inspiring, it gives us energy.
MG: Finally, going back to your blog, you’ve written about a trader who adopted a kitten during lockdown and found that it’s helped him cope with frustrations during the trading day. What’s going on there? 
BS: What the cat provides, or any pet or even a small child, is it takes us out of ourselves. In the case of this trader, having this little one is a way of cultivating emotions that otherwise might be difficult to access, such as caring emotions or loving emotions. It’s easy for even the best traders to become quite hard on themselves, to become perfectionists. When we have a little kitten, it takes us to a different emotional place that we reinforce, and we can recruit in dealing with ourselves.

1377,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2020 12:00AM ET</span>","United Airlines, pilots union reach creative deal to limit furloughs","By Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) - United Airlines (O:UAL) and its pilots' union said on Thursday they had reached an agreement on two different packages aimed at reducing involuntary furloughs in the fall and keeping pilots at the ready once coronavirus-hit demand starts to pick up.
U.S. airlines, grappling with a dramatic industry downturn, have warned that tens of thousands of jobs are on the line in October when a U.S. government bailout runs out. 
To minimize the number of forced cuts, large airlines have been offering a variety of early departure packages.
United's agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association International (ALPA) includes an early retirement deal for pilots 62 and older, as well as a slew of different options for pilots to voluntarily reduce their hours or take a leave of absence during which they would potentially receive health benefits as long as they keep up their training, covered by United.
Bryan Quigley, United's senior vice president of flight operations, sent the terms to pilots in a memo late Thursday which was reviewed by Reuters.
ALPA Chairman Todd Insler said the deal had ""groundbreaking provisions that provide the option (for pilots) to remain qualified, allowing a faster recall once passenger demand returns.""
Airlines are generally reluctant to furlough pilots because of the timely and costly training involved in bringing them back. If a COVID-19 vaccine is developed and demand returns, airlines want to be able to respond quickly.
Airlines had hoped for a recovery before $32 billion in government payroll grants for the aviation industry expire in September. Now unions are lobbying lawmakers to provide another $32 billion through March to prevent tens of thousands of furloughs.

Chicago-based United said last week it was sending notices of potential furloughs to 36,000 U.S.-based front-line employees, or about 45% of staff, including 2,250 pilots.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly up on Friday, ending the week on a high over hopes that the U.S. would reveal fresh stimulus measures to combat COVID-19's economic impact despite the incessant surge in the number of cases.
The U.S. Congress is scheduled to debate the new measures the following week, with some current stimulus measures due to expire at the end of July. But economic data released by China and the U.S. during the past week led some investors to point to a long road ahead to a full recovery for the global economy.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Thursday showed China posted a better-than-expected second quarter GDP growth year-on-year but saw June retail sales miss expectations.
“Data released over the last 24 hours seriously questions the speed of any post-Covid-19 economic recovery,” Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, told Bloomberg.
“The numbers illustrate the economic challenges posed by secondary infection outbreaks.”
The number of COVID-19 cases also shows no sign of slowing down, with over 13.7 million cases globally and almost 600,000 deaths as of July 17, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The U.S. reported a record-breaking 75,000 cases on Thursday, and Brazil topped 2 million cases.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.59% by 11:07 PM ET (4:07 AM GMT). The city reported a record high of 67 cases on Thursday.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.37% and the Shenzhen Component jumped 2.06%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.24% and South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.62%.
Down Under, the ASX 200 was down 0.15%, reversing earlier gains. The city of Melbourne, which re-imposed lockdown measures the previous week, saw a record increase of 428 cases on Thursday.
Meanwhile, investors are also keeping an eye on worsening U.S.-China tensions. The U.S. fired the latest shot, as it is considering banning all members of the Chinese Communist Party and their families from traveling to the U.S. The potential ban reverses President Donald Trump’s announcement on Wednesday that he would not impose further sanctions on Chinese entities involved in enacting Hong Kong’s national security laws.
U.S.-China relations soured during the past week over the U.S. disputing Chinese claims in the South China Sea as well as Trump removing Hong Kong’s special trade status and approving initial sanctions."

(Reuters) - British Airways, the world's largest operator of Boeing 747, said late Thursday it would retire its entire jumbo jet fleet with immediate effect due to the downturn in travel industry caused by the coronavirus pandemic.  
Global curbs imposed to stem the spread of the virus led to a turbulence in air travel, placing the future of many airline companies in doubt. 
""It is unlikely our magnificent 'queen of the skies' will ever operate commercial services for British Airways again,"" the company said in a statement. 
BA, which is owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group (L:ICAG), added that it will operate more flights on modern, fuel-efficient aircraft such as its new A350s and 787s and expects such aircraft to help in achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.  
A wave of restructuring triggered by the virus outbreak is hitting airlines and industrial firms across the world. 
The Sun reported last month that BA had reached an agreement with its pilots to sack 350 and another 300 in 'pool' for rehiring when needed.
The majority of pilots being 'pooled' were expected to be the jumbo jet first officers, according to the report. 
 Boeing Co 's (N:BA) 747, a plane that democratized global air travel in the 1970s but fell behind modern twin-engine aircraft, marked its 50-year flying anniversary in February 2019.
The U.S.-based aerospace company and its suppliers signalled the end of the plane, when they set the final number of parts it would need for the 747 jumbo jet program at least a year ago. 

However, the decision was left in limbo for years amid falling orders and pricing pressure.

1381,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 09:45PM ET</span>","Burnt Banks Claim Fraud, Fabrications in Asian Oil-Trading Web","(Bloomberg) -- Fabricated documents, suspicious transactions and $192 million in the hole. That’s the predicament two banks claim they’ve found themselves in after funding crude oil deals in the midst of Singapore’s commodities trading meltdown.
The troubled transactions, outlined in court documents, offer the clearest look yet at some of the deals at the heart of a web of scandals in the Asian energy-trading hub that have already caused more than $9 billion in potential losses for global lenders.
The Singapore units of CIMB Bank Bhd. and Natixis SA claim to be victims in separate cases filed in the High Court of Singapore. Their accusations span four separate oil deals, but involve the same players:
The banks said they issued letters of credit and paid Sugih for oil on behalf of Hontop, based on Hontop showing them supposedly binding contracts to on-sell the oil to BP, according to the filings. However, when they went to collect from BP, the oil major said it had never agreed to some of the purchases.
CIMB and Natixis said they paid Sugih a total of about $192 million on behalf of Hontop for oil that Hontop promised it would sell on to BP, according to the filings.
When the banks went to BP’s Singapore unit to be paid back, the oil major told them the transaction for one of the shipments was contingent of another payment that never materialized, and two never existed at all, adding that the lenders had been victims of their client’s fraudulent conduct, according to the filings.
As for the oil at the center of the deals, the banks say it’s unclear if the cargoes were there to begin with and whether they were discharged as planned, according to the filings.
An attorney for Sugih, now Aeturnum, said the firm is an innocent party in the series of sales. It sold the cargoes to Hontop, and Hontop never disputed that they were delivered, he said. Hontop is the one who failed to pay the bank for the cargoes, and that’s who the banks should be looking to for payment, the attorney said.
BP declined to comment, as did attorneys for Hontop, CIMB and Natixis.
The accusations shine a spotlight on the special relationship between banks and commodity traders, which require ample low-cost financing for the high-capital low-margin business. The magnitude of the losses in Singapore are now prompting lenders to take a long and hard look at whether the rewards of financing the sector are sufficient to offset the risks amid the most dramatic oil-price crash in a generation.
The following is a summary of the trades in question, based on an affidavit CIMB filed in a case against Hontop in the Singapore court on July 1, and claims filed by Natixis against Sugih on June 19 and 29. The Green Attitude shipment counts as two deals as both lenders were involved.
Green Attitude
Hontop approached CIMB in early November 2019 to finance a purchase of Russian ESPO crude from Sugih for resale to BP.
As proof of the deal, Hontop gave the bank a purchase contract between itself and Sugih and a sales contract between itself and BP, emails between the firms recapping the deals, and copies of bills of lading for about 518,000 barrels of ESPO crude on board the tanker Green Attitude.
Based on that, CIMB agreed to issue a letter of credit to Sugih and eventually paid the firm about $36 million on Hontop’s behalf.
When the bank went to BP expecting to collect the money from Hontop’s subsequent sale, however, the oil major told them the contract was subject to a framework agreement under which its payment obligations were conditional upon another payment from Hontop to BP, according to the filings.
Since Hontop hadn’t paid, BP said it wasn’t obliged to pay Hontop or CIMB. BP went on to allege that the bank was “apparently a victim of Hontop’s fraudulent conduct,” according to a letter from BP included in the filing.
In a separate claim filed by Natixis, the bank said it financed a purchase of 270,000 barrels of ESPO crude on board the Green Attitude after Hontop applied for a letter of credit in November, at the same time Hontop approached CIMB.
Hontop provided documents to show it agreed to buy the oil from Sugih with an on-sale agreement to BP, according to the filing. Hontop has failed to reimburse the $18 million Natixis paid to Sugih, which refused to provide the documentation the bank requested.
Gem No. 5
Hontop approached CIMB in December last year to finance another purchase of Russian oil from Sugih, this time for resale to Mitsui & Co.’s trading unit in Singapore.
CIMB declined to finance the deal because Mitsui wasn’t on its approved buyer list, and within eight hours Hontop came back and said BP would buy the cargo instead. Upon receiving purchase and sale contracts, email deal recaps and bills of lading from Hontop, CIMB agreed to finance the transaction and issued letters of credit totaling $70 million.
CIMB later asked Sugih for more documentation, and the trader gave it contracts, invoices and other documents showing it bought 1.3 million barrels of crude from another firm, a Singapore unit of Chinese manufacturing conglomerate WanXiang Group. CIMB then paid Sugih the $70 million after receiving the documents.
That’s when things started to go awry. First, BP’s lawyers said they searched their records and could find no contract to purchase the cargo from Hontop and suggested it had been fabricated. The oil giant refused to pay the bank’s invoice.
Then CIMB reached out to Wanxiang. The trader said Hontop and Sugih had asked it to come into the deal, buying the cargo from Hontop and immediately selling it to Sugih, according to the filing. In addition, Wanxiang claimed that Sugih had altered the sales documents it forwarded to CIMB, the filing shows.
Wanxiang isn’t being accused of any wrongdoing. An attorney for the firm said it isn’t a party to the legal proceedings and therefore isn’t aware of all the details of the case.
New Honor
Hontop approached Natixis in late November last year to finance a purchase of Brazilian Lula crude from Sugih for resale to BP. Hontop provided supporting documents such as purchase and sale contracts with Sugih and BP and bills of lading on the tanker New Honor for about 982,000 barrels of Lula.
Natixis issued a letter of credit with Sugih as beneficiary and eventually transferred $67.5 million to the firm’s bank.
Once again, though, when Natixis sought payment from BP, the oil major said it had not entered into nor was it aware of a contract to purchase oil from Hontop, and it refused to pay.
Natixis claims Sugih refused to give it more documentation. In addition, the bank alleged that only 425,000 barrels of Lula crude were discharged in China -- less than half the agreed-upon volume -- and that the cargo was delivered to another company called Shandong Dongying Yatong Petrochemical Ltd., rather than Hontop.

Tinder dry vegetation and strong winds, combined with low humidity and warm temperatures, contributed to extreme rates of fire spread, which burned a total of 77,758 acres and destroyed more than 370 structures, Cal Fire said in a statement https:// 
The fire investigation report has been forwarded to the Sonoma County District Attorney's Office, Cal Fire added.
The Kincade fire, the worst of several blazes raging throughout California last year, had erupted near the base of a damaged high-voltage transmission tower owned by PG&E, the utility and fire officials had said.
The company had in June pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter stemming from a devastating 2018 wildfire in Northern California touched off by its power lines.

The Camp Fire killed at least 84 people, and is considered the most destructive wildfire in California history.

It is the first known confession of wrongdoing in the collapse of one of Germany's biggest companies. 
The unidentified jailed executive was the chief executive officer of Dubai-based Cardsystems Middle East.
""My client has voluntarily given himself up for the proceedings and - in contrast to others - takes individual responsibility,"" his defence lawyer Nicolas Fruehsorger said.
The Munich prosecutors declined to comment. They have not identified the individual by name to avoid prejudicing legal proceedings.
Wirecard filed for insolvency last month owing creditors 4 billion euros ($4.55 billion) after disclosing a 1.9 billion euro hole in its accounts that its auditor EY said was the result of a sophisticated global fraud.
The executive had travelled from Dubai and turned himself in last week. 

The arrest was made on suspicion of conspiracy to commit fraud, attempted fraud and aiding and abetting other crimes, prosecutors said.

1385,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 08:09PM ET</span>",Singapore’s Hottest Stock Is Set to Continue Its Winning Streak,"(Bloomberg) -- A top-performing  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). supplier in Singapore is set to continue its winning streak in the stock market as it benefits from emerging trends in the semiconductor industry.
AEM Holdings Ltd. -- a chip-testing equipment provider that counts the U.S. tech giant as its main customer -- has surged 50% this year to become the top performer in the 107-member FTSE ST All-Share Index, the broadest measure for Singapore stocks. All four analysts covering the stock have an equivalent of a buy rating on it, and on average expect it to gain more than 20% over the next 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
This puts it in the running to be the best performer on the index for four of the past five years, as Intel further expands into data centers, autonomous vehicles and next-generation technology. And as pandemic-induced remote working arrangements become more commonplace, demand for chips is set to remain high.  Gartner  (NYSE:IT) Inc. estimates the global semiconductor industry to log more than $400 billion in revenues this year, just down 0.9% from 2019.
“We expect the share price to trend toward a new record high” with positive industry developments and data center demand, said Lee Keng Ling, an analyst at DBS Bank Ltd. She upgraded the stock to a buy rating in June. The firm currently has return-on-equity at more than 60%, in stark contrast to the median 8% of its peers, Bloomberg-compiled data show.
Intel typically uses AEM’s machines for its chips for computers, laptops and servers, said Kenny Tan, an analyst at KGI Securities (Singapore) Pte. In March, Intel said that it is delivering more than 90% of its products on time despite the pandemic. That has supported AEM’s revenue guidance of between S$430 million ($309 million) and S$445 million for 2020 -- an all-time high.
“More AI, more 5G applications, more telecommuting, more cloud services. Overall the macros look positive to us,” said AEM Chairman Loke Wai San in an interview.
Concentration risk, however, remains a concern for a company that relies on Intel for more than 90% of its revenue. The U.S. technology giant is facing its own set of troubles, with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). planning to build in-house processors for Mac and competition increasing for chip technology from the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
Intel Can’t Take Off Another Round in Chip Battle: Tim Culpan
Looking ahead, the company is scanning markets globally for small acquisition targets that have annual sales of less than $10-$20 million. For now, “the majority of AEM’s market share gain will be tagged to Intel’s growth,” Tan said.

(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) on Thursday elevated its content chief Ted Sarandos to co-CEO, making the 20-year veteran of the pioneering streaming video service a clear successor to co-founder Reed Hastings.
The promotion came as Netflix forecast its subscriber growth during the coronavirus pandemic would slow even more than Wall Street expected during the third quarter, sending its shares tumbling 9.5% in after-hours trading.
Sarandos will continue his role leading the content operations. Hastings said the two would each work full time as co-CEOs and that he had no plans to leave the company soon.
""To be totally clear, I'm in for a decade,"" he said in a post-earnings interview with an analyst. 
Netflix also gave Chief Product Officer Greg Peters the additional role of chief operating officer.
For July through September, Netflix forecast it would add 2.5 million new paid streaming customers around the world. Analysts on averaged expected a projection of 5.3 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. (https:// ""Investors are disappointed by the weak future guidance and see the initial boost from the pandemic coming to an end,"" Haris Anwar, Investing.com senior analyst, said.  For the June quarter, the company reported diluted earnings per share of $1.59, below analyst forecasts of $1.81. Revenue climbed 25% to $6.1 billion.  Netflix added 10.1 million streaming subscribers from April through June, its highest second-quarter gains ever, as the novel coronavirus forced people around the world to shelter at home. Those restrictions led to ""huge growth in the first half of the year,"" Netflix said in a letter to shareholders, but ""as a result we expect less growth for the second half of 2020 compared to the prior year."" Shares of Netflix, which ranked among the biggest gainers of the pandemic, plunged 9.5% to $477.15 in after-hours trading. With the new members, the world's dominant streaming service reached nearly 193 million paying online customers. Netflix is trying to win new customers and outrun the competition as viewers embrace online viewing. The pandemic sparked new interest in the service as people around the world were told to stay home, movie theaters went dark and sports leagues canceled live games. The second-quarter gains were expected, Fitch Ratings director Patrice Cucinello said, but she questioned if the benefits would last.  ""Do they have to give back some of these subscribers once people aren’t locked in their homes?"" she asked. New releases during the quarter included ""Space Force,"" ""Too Hot to Handle,"" a Jerry Seinfeld comedy special and new seasons of ""Money Heist"" and ""Dead to Me."" Netflix's membership rolls rose even as it faced more streaming competition than ever. Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) Disney+ came online in November, and AT&T Inc (N:T) debuted HBO Max in May, among other newcomers. The new programming schedule for Netflix remained ""largely intact"" for 2020, the company said, despite a widespread halt to production of new film and TV shows amid the COVID-19 outbreak. In 2021, the disruption likely will lead to more of Netflix's major titles being released in the second half of the year, the company said. The total number of original film and TV shows in 2021 should exceed 2020, it added.

PG&E transmission lines northeast of the town of Geyserville sparked the blaze, which burned 77,758 acres and injured four people, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said in an emailed statement Thursday. It was the biggest in the state last year.
PG&E had said that one of its transmission lines failed near the origin of the Kincade fire shortly before it was reported to have started on October 23. The company said in May that it may need to book a loss of at least $600 million stemming from damages tied to the wildfire.

1389,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 06:10PM ET</span>","With shift toward merit-based pay, Japan's Hitachi to drop old ways","By Makiko Yamazaki and Noriyuki Hirata
TOKYO (Reuters) - Hitachi Ltd (T:6501) is moving to scrap a remnant of one of Japan Inc's most famous practices: seniority-based pay.
The change reflects Hitachi's transformation from a hardware-focused manufacturer into a services business and highlights the realisation that for many Japanese firms old-school human resources practices aren't practical.
The 110-year old conglomerate also needs to align pay at home with its overseas operations, which now account for more than half of its 310,000 global workforce after the $7 billion merger with ABB Ltd's power grid business this month.
But first it will lay out job descriptions for its domestic workforce and use those as criteria for performance assessments that will eventually link to pay. 
Seniority-based pay made sense when the factory floor was the main training ground and new hires were taught to produce TVs, displays and chips from scratch, Chairman Hiroaki Nakanishi said in an interview. 
""That model no longer works,"" he said. The company ditched the bulk of its hardware-device business following the 2008 global economic crisis and now Hitachi is focused on infrastructure and related digital services.
In those areas, employees need to create business ideas.
Japanese firms including Hitachi have partially adopted merit pay for some employees, but labour experts say seniority-based pay remains the norm.
""This is half a step forward for Japan embracing merit pay,"" said Hajime Ohta, a professor of organization studies at Doshisha University professor, adding the lack of clear job roles has hampered full adoption. 
Hidenobu Nakahata, Hitachi's chief human resources officer said the company expects to find ""a considerable number of people in mismatching positions"".
Low labour mobility in Japan could be an issue, but Nakahata said Hitachi's 150,000-strong job pool in Japan will allow reshuffling without layoffs.
Other firms have taken note. Fujitsu Ltd (T:6702) is moving in a similar direction, saying it will introduce job descriptions.
But Keiichiro Hamaguchi, research director general at the Japan Institute for Labour Policy and Training, said many manufacturers would be reluctant to adopt job descriptions for their blue-collar workers since it would tie them to a specific process though most can perform a wide range of tasks.
That flexibility on the factory floor has been a pillar of Japan Inc. 
""Tech companies like Hitachi have been frontrunners in this because the manufacturing part of their business has already been sold or gone to contractors,"" he said.

""But do Japanese automakers really want to introduce a system similar to General Motors (NYSE:GM) or Chrysler for factory workers?""

The Fed's total balance sheet size rose to $7.01 trillion as of July 15 versus $6.97 trillion a week earlier, data released by the central bank on Thursday showed. It was the first increase since June 10, and was largely due to continued purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities aimed at keeping financial market conditions easy.
But the Fed's facilities aimed at steadying credit and other financial markets continued to get little traction. 
Under the Fed's Main Street Lending Program, which became fully operational last week, the central bank purchased just $12 million in loans from eligible lenders, Thursday's data showed. The lenders are required to hold on to 5% of the balance for loans made through the program. 

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said he expects the Main Street Lending Program to come in handy in the fall, when more companies may be financially stressed enough to need to tap it.

1391,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 06:00PM ET</span>",Twitter stepped up search to fill top security job ahead of hack,"By Joseph Menn, Katie Paul and Mark Hosenball
(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) had stepped up its search for a chief information security officer in recent weeks, two people familiar with the effort told Reuters, before the breach of high-profile accounts on Wednesday raised alarms about the platform's security.
The FBI's San Francisco division is leading an inquiry into the Twitter hacking, it said in a statement, as more Washington lawmakers called for an accounting of how it happened.
The law enforcement agency said hackers committed cryptocurrency fraud after they seized control of the Twitter accounts of celebrities and political figures including Joe Biden, Kim Kardashian, Barack Obama and Elon Musk. 
A day after the breach, it was not clear if the hackers were able to see private messages sent by account holders, although Twitter said it had no evidence that attackers had been able to access passwords.
The company said in a statement that it was continuing to lock accounts that had changed passwords in the past month, but said ""we believe only a small subset of these locked accounts were compromised."" Twitter declined to comment on the job search.
In a sign of how much the attacked unnerved U.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans showed rare bipartisan agreement that Twitter must better explain how the security lapse happened and what it was doing to prevent future attacks.
""This hack bodes ill for November balloting,"" U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said in a statement scolding Twitter for ""its repeated security lapses and failure to safeguard accounts.""
Echoing a similar sentiment, Representative Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, asked what would happen if Twitter allowed a similar incident to occur on Nov. 2, a day before the U.S. presidential election.
Jordan said he remained locked out of his Twitter account as of Thursday afternoon.
President Donald Trump, a prolific Twitter user, was planning to continue tweeting and his account was not jeopardized during the attack, spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said. 
The White House had been in ""constant contact with Twitter over the last 18 hours"" to keep Trump's Twitter feed secure, she said. 
Twitter said hackers had targeted employees with access to its internal systems and ""used this access to take control of many highly-visible (including verified) accounts.""
Other high-profile accounts that were hacked included rapper Kanye West, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, investor Warren Buffett,  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates, and the corporate accounts for  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL).
The company, which has been without a security chief since December, said the hackers conducted a ""coordinated social engineering attack"" against its employees.
Some security experts who have been studying the hack from outside believe there could be multiple actors involved.
Their theory is that access to the employee tool, which should have been more closely monitored, spread among people interested in prestige accounts for bragging rights or money. It could have spread further, to spies or pranksters.
In an extraordinary step, Twitter temporarily prevented many verified accounts from publishing messages as it investigated the breach.
The hijacked accounts tweeted out messages telling users to send bitcoin. Publicly available blockchain records show the apparent scammers received more than $100,000 worth of cryptocurrency.
As of Thursday, Twitter was continuing to block tweets containing the bitcoin addresses the scammers had used.  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) appeared to have enabled a similar security feature on its Messenger service temporarily on Wednesday, but did not respond to queries on whether it had also been targeted in the attack.
Twitter's shares fell a little over 1% on Thursday. 
CEO Jack Dorsey said on Wednesday that it was a ""tough day"" for everyone at Twitter and pledged to share ""everything we can when we have a more complete understanding of exactly what happened"".
Dorsey's assurances did not assuage Washington's concerns about social media companies, whose policies have come under scrutiny by critics on both the left and the right.
Frank Pallone, a Democrat who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee that oversees a sizeable portion of U.S. tech policy, said the company needed to explain how the hack took place.

The U.S. House Intelligence Committee was in touch with Twitter regarding the hack, according to a committee official who did not wish to be named.

WASHINGTON/MUNICH (Reuters) - A U.S. judge in Detroit on Thursday approved the transfer to Germany of a former Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) executive imprisoned in the automaker's diesel emissions scandal.
In 2017, the U.S.-based VW executive Oliver Schmidt, who oversaw emissions issues, was sentenced to seven years in prison and fined $400,000, the maximum possible under a plea deal the German national made with prosecutors after admitting to charges of conspiring to mislead U.S regulators and violate clean-air laws.
Schmidt, now 51, was not scheduled to be released from a U.S. prison until December 2022. Under the terms of his transfer approved by Judge Elizabeth Stafford, Germany will assume responsibility for enforcing the remainder of his sentence.
The Justice Department declined to comment. 
A half-dozen former VW executives charged by U.S. prosecutors are believed to still be in Germany, including former Volkswagen boss Martin Winterkorn.
Winterkorn was also charged by German prosecutors in 2019 with stock market manipulation.
Germany’s Federal Justice Ministry has said it does not extradite German nationals to countries outside the European Union.
In total, nine people have been charged by U.S. prosecutors and two former VW executives who have pleaded guilty in the case were sentenced to prison terms, including Schmidt.
Volkswagen has admitted to using illegal software to cheat U.S. pollution tests in 2015, allowing up to 40 times legally allowable emissions and in 2017 pleaded guilty to fraud, obstruction of justice and falsifying statements as part of a $4.3 billion settlement reached with the Justice Department.
The scandal triggered a global backlash against diesel vehicles that has so far cost VW 30 billion euros ($33.3 billion) in fines, penalties and vehicle buyback costs.

Last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled VW cannot escape potential financial penalties stemming from lawsuits filed by two counties that may amount to a ""staggering"" additional liability.

The company said it will post an operating loss of 1.68 billion euros ($1.91 billion) in the second quarter, pre-releasing earnings ahead of July 23. 
""Daimler pre-released better than consensus second-quarter numbers,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Philippe Houchois said in a note late on Thursday.
A slump in demand forced by dealership closures and lockdowns due to the coronavirus crisis pushed Daimler to report an adjusted second-quarter loss before interest and taxes (EBIT) of 708 million euros during the same period. 
At its Mercedes-Benz Cars & Vans unit it posted an operating loss of 1.13 billion euros, and an adjusted operating loss of 284 million euros. 
Daimler said it had spent 129 million euros on restructuring efforts during the second quarter, a figure that includes staff buyouts at Mercedes. It also announced a 105 million-euros valuation adjustment on YOUR NOW, its car-sharing joint venture. 
Daimler further said it had incurred 687 million euros in restructuring costs to retool its global production network of factories producing Mercedes-Benz passenger cars. 
It will stop building a variant of the compact A-Class at its factory in Aguascalientes, Mexico, to concentrate on a newer, higher-margin sport utility vehicle model, the GLB. 
Furthermore, Mercedes-Benz will stop making the C-Class sedan in Tuscaloosa, leaving the plant in Alabama making only SUVs, the carmaker said. 
Daimler had already announced it was preparing its factory in Hambach, France, for a sale.

That record streak was under threat after Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX).’s big after-hours drop sent exchange-traded funds tracking the tech space reeling.
The index, heavily weighted to megacaps like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., was already down 0.7% in Thursday’s regular session, as investors rotated out of tech in favor of laggards like airlines and energy. An ETF tied to its sister index, the Nasdaq 100, dropped more than 1% after the close.
The proximate culprit was Netflix, which said it expects to add 2.5 million paid subscribers to its streaming service in the third quarter, about half the estimate in data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock is down about 10% from its close at 4 p.m. in New York, dragging Amazon and Facebook down in sympathy.
A retreat Friday in the larger Nasdaq Composite would end the 43-day stretch without posting losses two days in a row.
Two down days in a row hardly proves that tech shares’ 2020 dominance is coming to an end, but the trend has shown signs of cracking in recent weeks.

Investing.com  -- Markets sagged as tech stocks underperformed and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), in particular, completely disappointed investors. 
Gold prices lost nearly 1% on Thursday and fell below the key $1,800 support, despite worsening U.S.-China relations. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) posting better-than-expected earnings, with shares up 2.5% and down 2.7%, respectively. Both banks flagged an increase in loan loss provisions to protect against a wave of potential client defaults. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) also topped estimates as growth in its pharmaceutical business softened the blow from coronavirus-led disruptions. 
Earnings Friday will include BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and  State Street . 
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow: 
1. Time to stream and chill… maybe not on Netflix
Netflix plummeted post-market after reporting results that made no one happy. Earnings per share of $1.59 missed the expected $1.82, according to data compiled by Investing.com. Though revenue came in at $6.15 billion versus $6.09 billion, the streaming giant forecast less growth for the second half of 2020 after seeing significant adds in the first part of the year. Net additions for the third quarter are expected to increase by 2.5 million versus 10 million in the second quarter. 
Netflix also said Chief content Officer Ted Sarandos would join Reed Hastings as co-CEO.
2. Stuck at home? Get a new one 
Housing starts probably rose to 1.1 million in June after increasing slightly in May totaling 974,000, from the prior month. Building permits are also expected to have jumped to 1.29 million from 1.216 million a month earlier. Homebuilder Taylor Morrison (NYSE:TMHC) reported that June was its best sales month in company history.  
The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index may rise to 79 from 78.1 two weeks ago and 72 a month earlier. 
3. More financials on the horizon
BlackRock reports earnings, and analysts forecast earnings per share of $6.89 compared to $6.41 a year earlier. Revenue of $3.55 billion would compare to $3.52 billion for the same period in 2019.
State Street Corp (NYSE:STT). also reports on Friday, with earnings per share expected at $1.59 compared to $1.45 a year earlier. Revenue is forecast to come in at $2.86 billion versus $2.87 billion in 2019.
Finally, Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG) is expected to report earnings per share of 9 cents compared to 95 cents in the previous period a year earlier. Sales are expected to bump up slightly to $1.67 billion from $1.63 billion.

Investing.com - Shares of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) plunged on Thursday as the streaming giant's second-quarter earnings fell short of estimates and it forecast lower-than-expected subscriber growth for the third quarter.
The company said that chief content officer Ted Sarandos would also become co-CEO.
Netflix was down more than 10% after the report.
Looking into the third quarter, Netflix said it expected to generate 2.5 million new subscribers, while Wall Street estimated 5.3 million, stoking worries about waning demand as competition heats up.
""In Q1 and Q2, we saw significant pull-forward of our underlying adoption leading to huge growth in the first half of this year (26 million paid net adds vs. prior year of 12 million). As a result, we expect less growth for the second half of 2020 compared to the prior year,"" Netflix said in a statement.
Netflix announced earnings per share of $1.59 on revenue of $6.15 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.82 on revenue of $6.09 billion.
The earnings beat was driven by a rise in the subscriber growth during the second quarter, as lockdown measures worldwide bolstered demand for streaming.
Subscriber numbers grew by 10.1 million during the three months that ended June 30, markedly above Wall Street estimates of net new subscribers of 8.26 million.
Looking ahead to the full year 2020, Netflix said it was still targeting a 16% operating margin.
""The problem is in the details. The company is now seeing a significant deceleration in this growth as it expects the initial boost from the pandemic to evaporate soon and things go back to normal.This projection is certainly negative for the stock which has to give up some gains and reflect this new reality,"" Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said.
Netflix shares are up 62% from the beginning of the year, still down 8.31% from its 52-week high of $575.17 on July 13. They are outperforming the S&P 500 which is down 0.47% from the start of the year.

1405,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 01:55PM ET</span>","In Utah, a debate stirs over Estonian radioactive waste","By Valerie Volcovici
(Reuters) - In southeast Utah, nerves are frayed over a pile of radioactive material parked 5,000 miles (8,000 km) away in Estonia.
Regulators are weighing weather a local uranium company can import the material for processing at a mill near the border of a Native American reservation. 
Utah officials have no deadline for making their decision on the license approval, and will do so after ""thoroughly reviewing"" the high volume of public comments, said Jared Mendenhall, spokesman for the state's Department of Environmental Quality.
For  Energy Fuels  Inc (A:UUUU), the shipment represents an economic lifeline, after the company posted an operating loss of $7.8 million for the first quarter. Its president in March described the U.S. uranium industry as being “on the cusp of complete collapse.” 
But for the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe living near the facility - the only operational uranium mill in the United States - the proposal has stoked fears that tribal land will become a dumping ground for global radioactive waste. 
Both the White Mesa mill and the tribal reservation are in San Juan County, Utah’s poorest.
The tribe along with environmentalists argue that processing the radioactive byproduct would mark a dangerous extension of the mill’s operations. The mill, built in 1979, was only meant to process conventional uranium ores from the Colorado Plateau for up to 20 years, the tribe says. The Navajo Utah Commission and Navajo Nation have also that the company’s application be rejected. 
""The state of Utah must recognize and acknowledge the reality that the mill is far past its design life and no longer a conventional uranium mill, but, instead, a radioactive waste dump seeking to operate for decades, if not a millennium,"" the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe said in a document submitted to the state on Friday, the deadline for public comments.
The 660 tons of powdered material in question, now sitting in 2,000 drums at a plant on the Estonian coast near the Russian border, would be Energy Fuels' first-ever radioactive import from outside North America. The powder is a byproduct from tantalum and niobium mining by Estonian company Silmet, which contains uranium. But it cannot stay within Estonia, where there is no licensed facility for reprocessing radioactive material. 
Energy Fuels says there is enough uranium in that byproduct that it is worth processing. Opponents say Energy Fuels is simply taking in waste, which would be stored on site.
""These feeds are important to the continued economic viability of the mill, particularly given the current state of the uranium market,"" Paul Goranson, chief operating officer of Energy Fuels, said in an email. He said business from the shipment would help the company keep its 70 workers employed.
WORLD'S DUMPING GROUND 
Energy Fuels anticipates demand for domestic uranium could rise, after the Trump administration in April proposed a $1.5 billion federal uranium reserve that would purchase uranium from domestic producers. Such a reserve, however, would need Congressional approval – a major hurdle. 
The reserve was one of the main proposals to come from a federal Nuclear Fuel Working Group aimed at reviving the U.S. uranium and nuclear industry. The United States currently imports over 90% of its uranium from abroad for its reactors.
The company has also asked to expand its capacity from 5,000 to 10,000 cubic yards per site per year, so it can accept more “alternate feed” that is of “significant value” beyond the Estonian shipment. 
In the meantime, the San Juan County commission has joined in resisting the license approval. In comments to regulators this month, it said it ""respects"" Energy Fuels as a local employer, but is concerned about the long-term impact of future imports of radioactive waste without new regulation or oversight – especially as residents are still dealing with the legacy of other unfinished mine cleanups and water contamination from existing operations. ""It's time the state of Utah treat areas near Native American communities ... with equal consideration as you would a metropolitan area, and deny the amendments and modifications to the permit proposal,"" said San Juan County Commission Chairman Kenneth Maryboy, a member of the Navajo Nation. 

""The residents of San Juan County deserve nothing less, and certainly do not need to continue to be the world's dumping ground for hazardous materials.""

The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday in the U.S. District Court in Newark, New Jersey, and seeks unspecified damages.
It claims shareholders lost money because of Deutsche Bank's (DE:DBKGn) dealings with Epstein, who was implicated in dozens of sexual abuse cases. He died last August at the age of 66 after being found hanging in a Manhattan jail.
New York regulators last week announced Deutsche Bank would pay the fine for ""significant compliance failures"" over Epstein and two unrelated cases.
Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the lawsuit. Last week, it said the settlement showed ""how important it is to continue investing in our controls and enhancing our anti-financial crime capabilities"".
The lawsuit also names as defendants Deutsche Bank's finance chief James von Moltke and former CEO John Cryan.

The named plaintiff is Ali Karimi, who lives in Connecticut, according to court documents.

NEW YORK (LPC) - Epicor Software Corp has awakened a sleepy dividend recapitalization market, unveiling the first such deal in almost five months as its private equity owner KKR prepares to cash out from the investment, two sources familiar with the proceedings said.
The enterprise software maker is launching a US$2.75bn, two-part transaction into the syndicated loan market on Thursday to support a so-called portable dividend recapitalization, the sources said. Epicor's deal will be the first shareholder dividend transaction in the US leveraged loan market since  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) Global Business Travel (Amex GBT) launched a US$1.13bn loan in February, according to Refinitiv LPC data.
The loan backing Amex GBT's purchase ultimately did not fund as buyers the  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd walked away from the decision to acquire a 20% stake.
A portable deal for Epicor allows KKR to pay itself a dividend and transfer payment obligations of the new loan and the rest of the company's debt to a new sponsor, should KKR sell its portfolio company.
As credit conditions have improved since March, sources are confident that timing is right for the leveraged loan market to complete its first dividend deal since the coronavirus gripped the financial markets, and for KKR to pocket some extra cash before evaluating a possible sale price for the company.
""There is not a ton of supply. It's mainly refinancings, pushing out maturities and now, maybe, it's time for dividend deals,"" according to an investor. ""The market will have an appetite for dividend recaps if it's a good business and has some OID (original issue discount) on it.""
Epicor's transaction comprises a US$1.925bn first-lien term loan and a US$825m second-lien loan. The company has approximately US$1.7bn outstanding on an existing first-lien loan that pays 325bp over Libor and matures in June 2022, according to Refinitiv LPC data.
KKR Capital Markets,  Barclays  (LON:BARC), Nomura, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) and Macquarie are arranging the US$2.75bn transaction, the sources said.
Spokespersons for Epicor, KKR, Jefferies, Nomura and Macquarie all declined to comment. A Spokesperson for Barclays was not immediately available for comment. 
SECOND TIME AROUND
Austin, Texas-headquartered Epicor generates revenue through the sale of business-related software in the retail, distribution and manufacturing sectors.
Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service, which rates the company B3, acknowledged Epicor's high rate of recurring revenue as a cushion during uncertain economic times, the ratings agency said in a report on Tuesday.
KKR did explore Epicor's sale that valued the company at roughly US$5bn, including debt, Reuters reported in August last year.
With this portable dividend, however, a second attempt to sell Epicor would come attached with greater leverage.
Debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization will increase to more than 8.0 times due to the new first- and second-lien loans, the ratings agency said.
Epicor should, however, improve leverage to less than 8.0 times over the next 18 months in the absence of acquisitions or more shareholder distributions. And under the terms of the new first- and second-lien loans, the credit agreement does include provisions for incremental debt. Epicor must also use any future asset sales proceeds to reduce debt, Moody's said in its report.
Despite the aggressive debt levels, Moody's praised Epicor's history of reducing leverage since being acquired by KKR from fellow private equity firm Apax Partners in 2016. The company also benefits from good cash flow and has shown ""relative resiliency during economic downturns.""
The company's new debt facilities are ""portable"" to a potential new owner, but are subject to specific leverage-based tests, Moody's said.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - American Airlines (O:AAL) and JetBlue Airways (O:JBLU) said on Thursday they were forming a strategic partnership to boost flying options in New York and Boston and create what executives called a ""growth engine"" to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The deal, which allows the two carriers to sell each other's flights and link frequent flyer programs, gives them more muscle against rivals United Airlines (O:UAL) and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) in the Northeast at a time when carriers are preparing to downsize and cut jobs.
It makes American ""a more-powerful player in the country's economic center,"" said Scott Mayerowitz at the Points Guy, helping it to fill international flights and compete for lucrative corporate contracts without investing in a network of domestic routes. 
For starters, American will use the partnership to feed traffic out of New York (JFK) to international destinations including Tel Aviv, Athens and Rio de Janeiro in 2021.
That will increase nonstop flying options to Israel, where before the pandemic United was offering twice daily service from Newark and Delta daily from JFK. Struggling Israeli carrier  El Al  Israel Airlines (TA:ELAL) was flying out of JFK and Newark but has suspended all flights through August and is negotiating a government bailout. 
JetBlue, which has similar partnerships with other airlines but whose expansion aspirations have suffered from space and government limitations in New York, will add flights at all three New York area airports including its home base, JFK.
""This allows us to recover more quickly,"" Scott Laurence, JetBlue's head of revenue and planning, told Reuters. ""It means that airplanes that would otherwise have been in a desert, they're going to be flying and generating revenue.""
Discussions began before the coronavirus pandemic nearly ground the aviation industry to a halt this year, but accelerated as a result of the crisis, he said.
The deal - subject to governmental review - will help American, which has a significant presence across the middle of the country, gain relevance in New York and Boston, said American's chief revenue officer, Vasu Raja.
It follows American's revived partnership with Seattle-based Alaska Airlines ALKAIR.UL in February to boost expansion opportunities out of the West Coast.

Alaska is due to join the oneworld alliance led by American and British Airways by summer 2021, but JetBlue is not joining and still plans to independently launch and operate transatlantic flights to London in 2021.

(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) is in talks with the government of Japan and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation about locking up allocations of its potential COVID-19 vaccine as it prepares to kick off human trials, the company's Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk told Reuters in an interview.
More than a hundred vaccines are under development to try and stop the COVID-19 pandemic, and drugmakers including J&J are working to ramp up supply for their vaccines in the face of unprecedented demand. 
J&J has already agreed to prioritize an allocation to the United States as part of its funding agreement with the U.S. government's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), Wolk said.
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation would focus on allocating any vaccine it acquired to developing countries, Wolk added. Reuters previously reported that J&J is also in talks with the European Union.
""Nothing has been finalized yet. We continue to have those discussions,"" Wolk told Reuters. ""People from the countries and the organizations we mentioned want to lock in a certain minimum level of capacity that they would get."" 
Wolk said that the ""general construct"" of the discussions is likely to take a form similar to AstraZeneca Plc’s (L:AZN) deal with the U.S. government, which provided $1.2 billion in drug development aid to the U.K. drugmaker in exchange for locking in a delivery of around 300 million doses for fall 2020. 
AstraZeneca has also signed a contract with France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands for up to 400 million doses of its potential vaccine. It has also partnered with non-profits to ensure distribution to developing countries.
Wolk added that these discussions will help Johnson & Johnson determine pricing for its vaccine, which the U.S. drugmaker intends to sell on a not-for-profit basis during the pandemic.
""The more demand we have the better and lower that cost would potentially be,” Wolk said.
The company aims to begin manufacturing the vaccine later this year, depending on its success in clinical trials, he added. 

In its Thursday earnings call, J&J said it plans to start its first human trials of its COVID-19 vaccine on July 22 and could kick off late-stage studies as soon as September.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. fast food chain Burger King and a car manufactured by a General Motors (NYSE:GM) joint venture were picked out for criticism on Thursday by China's state television station in its high-profile annual show on consumer rights.
Since it was first aired by state-owned China Central Television (CCTV) in 1991, the television programme has become an event watched in fear by international and local brands alike, due to the potential impact on sales and public relations of appearing on its list of shame. 
The programme has in previous years criticised foreign businesses such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), resulting in prompt apologies from the companies. 
Burger King and GM were the only foreign firms to feature on this year's show, which mainly focused on Chinese companies. The criticisms come at a time of heightened tension between the United States and China over trade, technology and other issues. 
Burger King, owned by Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) (RBI) but whose Chinese outlets are mainly managed by Tab Food Investments (TFI), was criticised for allegedly selling products that failed to meet its own standards. 
The programme cited a Burger King outlet in Nanchang, southeast China, where it alleged employees only put two pieces of cheese on the burger when there should be three.
Burger King China said on its official Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) account that the outlet was managed by a sub-franchisee, and apologised for management mistakes given the practices were a departure from its ""consumer is king"" motto. 
""As soon as we saw the report, we immediately set up a task force to conduct the investigation,"" it said, adding the franchisee ran six outlets which had now been shut down.
The show also interviewed buyers of the Baojun 560 sport-utility vehicle made by General Motors' Guangxi-based joint venture with SAIC Motor and a local partner. The customers complained of gearbox problems.
The venture recalled 12,485 Baojun 560 in 2016 to fix gearbox issues. In a statement, the venture apologised for the inconvenience to consumers and said it was investigating. ""We will be responsible for the issue at all costs,"" it said.
The show, usually aired on March 15 to coincide with world consumer rights day, was delayed this year by the COVID-19 pandemic.
It also discussed shoddily built new flats, online education services and said  Qutoutiao  (NASDAQ:QTT), an app that delivers customised feeds of articles and short videos to users based on algorithms, carried misleading advertisements with dubious health claims or which led to gambling websites when clicked through. 
The New York-listed company saw its shares tumble in pre-trading after it was mentioned in an opening segment - even before the programme detailed its criticisms. They were down 11% after the two-hour show ended. 
In a statement on its Weibo account, Qutoutiao said it realised there were many issues with its advertising ecosystem and that it would carry out an investigation. 

""We are very grateful for the oversight and criticism provided by CCTV and the media,"" it said.

(Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) posted a record quarterly profit on Thursday that blew past analysts' expectations as another of Wall Street's big investment banks gained from huge swings in financial markets due to the coronavirus crisis.
The bank wrapped up second-quarter results for the big U.S. lenders that shook out along expected lines. Trading powerhouses Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) performed better than Main Street rivals JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), which had to build massive reserves for loans that may go bust.
Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, like other Wall Street executives this week, cautioned that the bank's record-setting trading numbers would be hard to repeat in the coming quarters.
""Clearly, it will be challenging for the back half of 2020 to meet the record first half results .... That said, many parts of our business should continue to perform well,"" said Gorman.
A hallmark of Gorman's tenure as CEO has been the bank's decade-long expansion into wealth and asset management, businesses that diversified the bank's revenue streams and provide balance against the unpredictability of its trading business.
Gorman said the decision to keep the bank's consumer loan business small also helped this quarter. Credit cards and small business loans are expected to be badly hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, and rival bank Goldman Sachs had to set aside $1.6 billion for loans that could go bad.
In contrast, Morgan Stanley set aside just $239 million.
The bank's stock was up over 3% at $52.98 by mid-morning.
""Morgan Stanley's impressive second-quarter results strongly reflected its favorable business mix,"" said Donald Robertson, a senior vice president at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Financial Institutions Group. ""Its lack of traditional retail and commercial banking activities left it ... unscathed from the large loan-loss provisions.""

TRADING, INVESTMENT BANKING SURGE
The bank's trading unit recorded a 68% jump in revenue, led by a nearly 168% surge in bond trading. Equities trading revenue rose 23%.
Investment banking was another bright spot, with revenue jumping 39% as companies looked to shore up their financial position to ride out the effects of COVID-19 pandemic.
Overall revenue jumped 31% to a record $13.41 billion in the quarter, clocking a rise in all its segments.
In the wealth management unit, where revenue rose 6% since last year, clients took advantage of both the markets and lower interest rates to borrow more. The unit generated about a third of the bank's revenue for the quarter.
Securities-based loans, or loans on the value of one's brokerage account, rose 17% year over year, while mortgages rose 12%.

The bank's earnings attributable to common shareholders rose 45% to $3.2 billion, or $1.96 per share. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.12 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

(Reuters) - Global insurers want to increase investments in commercial warehouses as their stakes in office space become riskier because of employees working remotely during the novel coronavirus pandemic, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management (GSAM) executives said.
The pandemic is hastening a shift among insurers to exchange ""undesirable"" real estate investments, which also include retail properties, such as store fronts, for investments in warehouses, said executives from GSAM's arm that manages investments for insurers' portfolios.
The executives spoke during a briefing about results on Thursday for an annual GSAM survey about insurers' investments.
Pandemic lockdowns have spurred companies to re-examine their need for office space if employees continue working at home in the post-pandemic world, a trend that could drive down office occupancy rates and rents. 
Worries about COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, have also increased demand for warehouse space as business moves to e-commerce sites and consumers avoid making trips to brick-and-mortar stores.
Commercial real estate trends during recent years are accelerating because of the pandemic, but it is difficult for insurers to unload troublesome real estate assets, such as mortgages, during the pandemic in order to make the switch, said Mike Siegel, global head of GSAM Insurance Asset Management.
Insurers are monitoring the impact on their real estate investments and trying to ""manage through,"" Siegel said.
""They are not going to sell unless they feel they can get good value,"" he said.
Insurers would have to sell those investments into funds that buy ""distressed"" investments, but they are in a position to avoid such a move, he added.

Distressed funds acquire risky holdings on the cheap, hoping to turn a profit.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Thursday after data suggesting that the improvement in the U.S. labor market since April is running out of steam. 
By 10:15 AM ET (1415 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 77 points, or 0.3% at 26,793 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.2%.
Earlier, the Labor Department had said that 1.3 million people filed initial claims for jobless benefits last week, vs 1.31 million in the previous week. Analysts had expected a drop of 60,000. The number of continuing claims fell by more than expected, but the data are linked not only to the pace of re-hiring, but also to the rate at which people stop looking for work.
The jobs data overshadowed the less timely news that retail sales had risen 7.5% in June, extending their rebound from a lockdown-driven collapse in April. 
With the U.S. continuing to post more than 60,000 new cases of the Covid-19 virus every day, and with hospitalizations and death rates rising across the south and west of the country in particular, the jobless claims data stoked fears that another wave of economically restrictive measures may be necessary even before the first wave has been fully unwound. 
The news hit cyclical stocks hardest, with cruise operators and airline stocks again demonstrating the fragility of sentiment towards that sector. Sentiment was hardly helped by news that American Airlines  (NASDAQ:AAL) intends to furlough up to 25,000 staff when its federal aid expires at the end of September. American fell 6.4%.
Twitter stock was also heavily traded in the wake of an embarrassing hack that compromised the accounts of dozens of high-profile users from Barack Obama to Elon Musk. The stock also had to cope with news that Europe's top court had outlawed the current system for data transfers between the EU and U.S. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) still pared overnight losses to be down only 2.5%. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), also affected by the EU court's decision, fell 1.4%.
On a busy morning for earnings, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) fell 2.8% after putting aside $4 billion in provisions against possible loan losses, while  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) fared better by virtue of its concentration on markets and investment banking. Morgan Stanley stock rose 1.7% after it - like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) - reported a banner quarter for its traders.
Elsewhere, Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) rose 9.0% after it lured Michael Colglazier away from Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) to be its next CEO, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 4.5% after a report suggesting that its sales in California fell by nearly half in the second quarter."

The average for a 30-year fixed loan fell to 2.98%, hitting a record low for the third straight week and the seventh time since the coronavirus outbreak began roiling financial markets.
Rates have tumbled to the lowest level in almost 50 years of record-keeping by  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC) as the Federal Reserve holds its benchmark rate near zero and buys mortgage bonds as part of its plan to stimulate the economy.
The low rates have fueled demand for homes, propping up prices and helping the housing market hold up better than expected amid the economic fallout from the pandemic.
“It’s not a silver bullet for the economic woes we’re experiencing, but it’s night-and-day different than what the housing market was looking like during the last recession,” said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist for Haus, a co-investment platform for homebuyers.
In May, when the Federal Reserve started buying lower-coupon mortgage securities, analysts predicted that rates could drop below 3%. Now, there’s speculation that the slide could continue.
Earlier this week, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the costs of originating and servicing loans, including rules and regulations, are keeping rates high.
“We’ve been very consistent that mortgages, believe it or not, are far more costly than they should be,” Dimon said on a conference call.

(Reuters) - U.S. passive equity funds have started to witness inflows after a two-month hiatus as investors flock to rising equity markets, but prefer shadowing indexes to picking stocks.
Data from fund research firm Refinitiv Lipper showed passive equity funds, which are mutual funds that mirror stock indexes, attracted $860 million in June, after a combined outflow of $24.5 billion in the previous two months. 
On the other hand, active funds where fund managers promise selective stock investing to beat index performance, witnessed sharp outflows in every month in the first half of this year.
(Graphic: Flows into active and passive funds, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmypmgzqbpr/flows1.JPG) 
Analysts said June marked a return to the long-term trend, in which passive funds attract a larger proportion of equity investments compared with active funds.
Passive funds outperformed active funds in terms of price returns during 9 of the past 10 years, the data showed. (Graphic: Price performance of active and passive funds, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkplxnqjpb/price1.JPG) 
""While markets are swiftly recovering from the COVID-induced drawdown, the cash which rushed to the sidelines has a tendency to find its way back into the market in the easiest and most fluid manner possible: passive,"" said Michael White, portfolio manager at Picton Mahoney Asset Management.
""There is massive pent-up demand and ample liquidity furnished by both monetary and fiscal policy,"" he said, referring to liquidity from stimulus measures as lockdown restrictions to curb the spread of the new coronavirus are gradually eased.
According to Lipper data, money market funds attracted $988.3 billion in the first half of this year, while equity funds saw an outflow of $171.7 billion.
The demand for passive funds has also been driven by the narrow stock-market rally, with investors favoring well-established large-cap stocks which are already part of the major stock index, analysts said. 
The market-cap weighted benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX), which allocates more weighting to the performance of large-cap stocks, has recovered most of its first-quarter losses and is just down 1% for this year. 
On the other hand, the equal-weighted S&P 500 index (SPXEW1), which weighs all stock constituents equally, is still down 10% so far this year.
(Graphic: Price performance of equal-weighted and market-cap weighted indexes, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmopajebdva/comparison1.JPG) 
With large-cap stocks boosting indexes, some analysts expect the demand for active funds to flag further in coming months.
""Given the manner that the stock market, and therefore passive funds, have rebounded quickly, it forces investors to question their allegiance to active managers,"" said Matt Ahrens, chief investment officer at Integrity Advisory. 
""The one time these higher-cost managers are supposed to really offer a benefit is when the market is volatile, and many failed to perform."" 
""Market leaders like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) continue to power the market higher, and given their weightings in passive investments, they make it nearly impossible for active managers to keep up. I expect we'll continue to see market inflows to passive investments, especially in stocks.""

1427,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 08:40AM ET</span>",Bank of America profit more than halves as threat of bad loans looms,"By Noor Zainab Hussain and Imani Moise
(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) saw its profit more than halve in the second quarter as it set aside $5 billion against future loan losses in what its top boss called the ""most tumultuous period since the Great Depression"".
The falls in revenue and profits were broadly similar to those for other major U.S. banks this week that have suffered from a combination of the need to brace for a deep recession, while profiting from the surge in financial market volatility and trading since February.
Shares in Bank of America, however, fell around 3.3% in response to the results, which showed it setting aside a much lower dollar amount for reserves this quarter than some of its peers earlier in the week.
That in part was due to the bank having set aside more than some in the first quarter, but its provision expense rose just 7% in the second, compared to a 26% increase at JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), a 12% jump at  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and more than double at  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC).
Net income applicable to common shareholders fell to $3.28 billion, or 37 cents per share, for the second quarter ended June 30 from $7.11 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average had expected 26 cents per share in adjusted earnings, according to Refinitiv.
""Strong capital markets results provided an important counterbalance to the COVID-19-related impacts on our Consumer business,"" Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said.
Net income for the bank's global markets unit rose 81% to $1.9 billion, while its net interest income (NII) fell 11% to $10.8 billion.
NII, a key measure of how much banks can make from their lending activities, has been pressured by the pandemic as the U.S. Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to near-zero levels.
The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender is especially vulnerable to rate movements because of the composition of its balance sheet.
Revenue, net of interest expense, fell 3% to $22.3 billion.
Consumer banking net income dropped to $71 million from $3.29 billion a year earlier, while global wealth and investment management income fell more than 40%.

 Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) posted a better-than-expected surge in quarterly profit on Thursday, driven by strong trading gains as the coronavirus pandemic drove record swings in global financial markets.

Hackers infiltrated the twitter handles of U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden, reality TV star Kim Kardashian, former U.S. President Barack Obama and billionaire Elon Musk to solicit digital currency - raising major concerns about security on the widely-used platform.
The hack ""certainly doesn't help,"" Joe Wittine, Edgewater Research analyst, told Reuters in an email. It will pose more of a ""reputational risk"", versus ""material near-term risk to advertising revenues.""
Twitter said hackers targeted employees with access to its internal systems and ""used this access to take control of many highly-visible (including verified) accounts and Tweet on their behalf.""
In an extraordinary step, Twitter temporarily prevented many verified accounts from publishing messages as it investigated the breach.
Twitter Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey said in a tweet on Wednesday that it was a ""tough day"" for everyone at Twitter and pledged to share ""everything we can when we have a more complete understanding of exactly what happened.""
Other high profile accounts that were hacked included rapper Kanye West, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, investor Warren Buffett,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates, and the corporate accounts for Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Several accounts of cryptocurrency-focused organizations were also hijacked.

Publicly available blockchain records show that the apparent scammers received more than $100,000 worth of cryptocurrency.

1429,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 08:20AM ET</span>",J&J raises forecast after quarterly profit beats estimates,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) raised its full-year profit forecast and beat analysts' estimates for quarterly earnings on Thursday as strength in its pharmaceuticals unit cushioned a steep fall in sales of its medical devices due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The healthcare conglomerate, which is among the companies racing to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus, is planning to begin human studies later this month. 
Meanwhile,  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) is gearing up to begin late-stage studies later this month, while AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN) is expected to report results from its experimental coronavirus vaccine soon.
Sales of medical devices at J&J tumbled by a third in the second quarter as hospitals and patients delayed non-urgent procedures like hip and knee replacements, but J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott said the unit seems to be benefiting from a faster-than-expected rebound in these procedures.
Some states have started to resume elective procedures, and J&J said in April that it expects a recovery in the fourth quarter of this year.
A strong performance by its pharmaceuticals business, its biggest, offset some of the slump in medical device sales. The unit was helped by strong demand for Stelara, used to treat Crohn's disease and plaque psoriasis, and cancer drug Darzalex.

The company raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast to $7.75 to $7.95 per share, from its prior estimate of $7.50 to $7.90 per share. 
J&J reported net earnings of $3.63 billion, or $1.36 per share, in the second quarter, down from $5.61 billion, or $2.08 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, J&J earned $1.67 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.49, according to Refinitiv estimate.

1430,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 08:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Nissan plans 30% cut in car output through December as virus hits demand,"By Naomi Tajitsu and Maki Shiraki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201) is planning a 30% year-on-year cut in global vehicle production through December as falling demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic complicates its turnaround efforts, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Japan's No. 2 automaker plans to produce around 2.6 million vehicles between April and December, down from 3.7 million during the same period last year, the sources said. Nissan made 4.6 million cars in the financial year ended March. 
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity as the information is not public. Nissan, which has yet to announce a sales forecast for this financial year, declined to comment on its production plans. 
Global automakers are struggling after factories were shuttered earlier this year to stem the spread of the pandemic. 
Car dealerships were also closed in many countries, pummelling vehicle sales in March through May, although the fall in sales slowed in June as economies started to reopen. 
The pandemic has been particularly difficult for Nissan, which was already grappling with falling sales and a deteriorating cash position. In May, it unveiled a far-reaching restructuring plan after posting its first annual loss in 11 years. 
In the first two months of this financial year, the maker of the Rogue SUV and the Leaf electric car made around 307,000 vehicles globally, down 62% from last year, according to monthly production figures. 
It will announce June output figures next month. 
Nissan is planning for production to increase from 510,000 vehicles in the first quarter to around 930,000 in July-September, the sources said. Second quarter output will be about 25% lower from a year ago, according to Reuters calculations.
Production is expected to increase to around 1.1 million vehicles in October-December, roughly 8% lower on the year. 

In July-September, Nissan's output will be hit hardest at home, falling around 47% from last year, after the automaker said it would cut more shifts at its Japanese assembly plants. Domestic output will recover slightly through December.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to weaken at the open Thursday, snapping a four-day win streak, as earnings season continues against a backdrop of mounting tensions between the U.S. and China.
At 7:20 AM ET (1120 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 18 points, or 0.6%, lower, Nasdaq Futures down 136 points, or 1.3%. The Dow Futures contract fell 143 points, or 0.5%.
On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.9% higher, the fourth positive day in a row, while the S&P 500 gained 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.6%.
However, the corporate world is taking notice of the recent flare-up in tensions between the U.S. and China, with Washington imposing restrictions on employees of the telecom equipment maker Huawei and completing measures against social networking application TikTok. 
China has vowed to retaliate, although it has reiterated its commitment to the phase 1 trade deal with the U.S. this week.
Economic news out of China earlier Thursday was more positive, as the country became the first major global economy to return to growth in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The U.S. continues to suffer from a second surge in the Covid-19 virus, with another 60,000 new cases reported on Wednesday, according to CDC data. 
The U.S. has the world’s largest number of coronavirus cases and deaths, and it’s reporting rising levels at a time when many other countries appear to have gotten a grip on their outbreaks (notwithstanding a flurry of localized flare-ups in recent days).
The earnings season remains in focus Thursday, with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) reporting a 35% hit to second-quarter profit, but still able to raise full-year guidance.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock dropped 2.5% premarket after reporting a drop of more than 50% in profit as it set aside $4 billion for potential loan losses tied to the coronavirus pandemic.
By contrast,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) climbed 1.2% premarket after reporting strong numbers across the board, and its provisions, already small, actually dropping.
There’s some key U.S. economic data due Thursday at 8:30 AM ET, with the weekly initial claims likely to continue the gradual improvement in the employment picture. Also, retail sales are expected to show a gain of 5% in June, a pickup but not quite May’s massive 17.7% jump.  
Oil prices eased Thursday, after OPEC and allies such as Russia agreed to ease record supply curbs from August, though the drop was cushioned by hopes for a swift pick-up in U.S. demand after a big drawdown from the country's crude inventories.
At 7:20 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% lower at $40.75 a barrel, while Brent fell 0.7% to $43.48.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,807.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1401, down 0.1%."

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares opened lower on Thursday after Asian stocks faltered overnight, with risk appetite hit by deteriorating U.S.-China relations and worse-than-expected Chinese domestic consumption data.
The White House said on Wednesday it had not ruled out further sanctions on top Chinese officials to punish China for its handling of Hong Kong.
The United States also said it was studying the national security risks of social media applications including China's TikTok and WeChat.
Europe's STOXX 600 was down 0.9% at 0800 GMT and London's FTSE 100 also fell 0.9%, both partially erasing yesterday's gains.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was down 0.5%, and MSCI's main Europe Index was down 0.8%. 
Although China's GDP returned to growth in the second quarter, up 3.2%, retail sales data was worse than expected.
""We're going to see a mechanical V-Shaped recovery without a doubt but it's the economic effects, things like discretionary spending, that I think people's concerns are centred around,"" said Russell Silberston, investment strategist at Ninety One.
""The big concern that we have is the economic scarring – how much damage is being done,"" he said.
In currency markets, the dollar index firmed, up 0.1% at 96.104, having hit a one-month low on Wednesday.
The riskier Australian and New Zealand dollars slipped and euro-dollar, which hit a four-month high of $1.1452 on Wednesday, edged back down, at $1.1406.
Oil prices eased after OPEC and allies such as Russia agreed to taper record supply curbs from August, though the drop was cushioned by hopes for a swift pick-up in U.S. demand after a big drawdown from the country's crude stocks.
Brent crude fell 18 cents to $43.61 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 29 cents, at $40.91 a barrel at 0800 GMT.
Gold prices eased somewhat but were near a nine-year peak.
Euro zone bond yields held broadly steady, with borrowing costs in the periphery near their lowest levels since March. The benchmark German 10-year Bund yield was at -0.446%.
In Europe, the focus is on the European Central Bank's meeting, at which it is expected to announce no new policy measures, having already bought record amounts of debt as part of its emergency response to COVID-19.
""Though recent comments from ECB officials have shown signs of an emerging optimism, our economists don’t believe these signal a change in the policy stance, and expect the commitment to ""substantial monetary policy stimulus"" to be repeated,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid wrote in a note to clients.
The International Monetary Fund's top official warned on Wednesday that a second major wave of infections could trigger more economic disruption.
Rising COVID-19 cases have seen some countries re-impose lockdown measures, but the effect of new infections on daily market moves is not clear-cut, as the more economies shut down, the more stimulus from central banks and governments is expected.
""If cases are rising and we see more lockdowns then that uncertainty will almost definitely hit markets,"" Ninety One's Silberston said.
""But, big picture, markets have rallied massively from the lows on the basis of stimulus so there's a counter-argument that says: Ok, if we do go into lockdown, we'll see even more stimulus,"" he said.
The ECB delivers its decision at 1145 GMT, and ECB President Christine Lagarde will hold a news conference at 1230 GMT.

Investors are also focused on a European Union summit on Friday and Saturday, at which the proposed EU-wide coronavirus recovery fund will be discussed.

J&J was also able to raise this guidance, with its full-year adjusted profit forecast rising to $7.75 to $7.95 per share, from its prior estimate of $7.50 to $7.90 per share.
“The post-pandemic environment has brought many challenges for J&J, especially in its medical devices business where surgeries are being delayed to clear space for the virus patients,” said Haris Anwar, an analyst at Investing.com.
“That said, J&J is still in a better position to get through this difficult time due to its diversified operations. Demand for its consumer brands such as the pain reliever Tylenol and its blockbuster cancer drugs remain strong, offsetting some negative impact. J&J’s defensive nature and its attractive dividend should keep the stock well-supported in this crisis.”

1440,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 06:27AM ET</span>","One in Four British Fashion Jobs May Disappear, Group Says","(Bloomberg) --
More than a quarter of jobs in the British fashion industry may be lost because of the fallout from pandemic-induced lockdowns, a study shows.
About 240,000 of the 890,000 people employed in fashion in the U.K. are predicted to lose their jobs, the British Fashion Council said in a statement Thursday, citing data from Oxford Economics. The figure increases to 350,000 if supply chain positions and other indirect roles are included, which is equivalent to 1% of the U.K.’s total workforce, according to the report.
“The Covid-19 recession could hit the fashion industry twice as hard compared to the U.K. overall,” the BFC said. “An entire generation of creative talent is threatened to disappear, putting in danger the U.K.’s position as the creative crucible of global fashion.”
Revenue generated by the industry will drop by more than a quarter to 88 billion pounds ($110.40 billion) this year from 118 billion pounds in 2019, the fashion council estimated. U.K. fashion house Burberry Group (OTC:BURBY) Plc announced plans on Wednesday to eliminate 500 positions globally, including 150 in the U.K., after lockdowns caused revenue to plunge by almost half in the three months ended in June. That represents about 5% of the company’s total workforce.
The government should provide assistance by enabling lease renegotiations when landlords don’t act responsibly, and granting moratoriums on duties and tariffs, among other measures, the not-for-profit industry group said in the statement.

1442,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 05:33AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Mixed Updates for Vice Stocks Show Checkered Recovery,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Another day, another set of updates that show how uneven the recovery from the pandemic is likely to be.
 Heineken  (AS:HEIN) shares fell as much as 10% on Wednesday in response to preliminary data that confirmed investors fears – and then some - about the impact of Covid-19 on its business.
First-half net revenue fell by 16.4% on an organic basis. Sales volumes fell 11.5% and average selling prices fell 3.6%, as the Dutch brewing giant suffered from the closure of bars and restaurants around the world. Heineken’s reliance on this channel for sales, which generates the highest margins in the brewing business, meant it was also harder hit than most.
The company also reported 550 million euros of impairments which took it to a reported net loss of 300 million euros. Underlying net profit fell 76%.
The group said it “remains confident in its ability to navigate the crisis while continuing to build a bright future,” but its release was nonetheless conspicuously lacking in upbeat details about the pace of recovery. Understandably so, given the closure of bars and restaurants across the south and west of the U.S., the reimposition of a ban on alcohol sales in South Africa and – as of this week – the closure of the Magaluf party strip in Mallorca due to the inability of Europe’s tourists to observe social distancing.
All sobering stuff, even if Heineken stock did subsequently recover to be down only 2.9% on the day.
The resurgence of animal spirits has been a problem for the authorities wherever lockdowns have been eased, from Tokyo to Texas. However, the gambling sector appears to be one where activity has rebounded best with relatively little added risk.
Well-developed online channels have allowed punters to indulge their vice from the comfort and safety of their sofas as most of Europe’s most lucrative soccer leagues and horse racing events have resumed.
GVC, the owner of bwin and  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL), said that activity in sports betting has been close to pre-Covid levels since the resumption of sports events, although nothing could hide the effects of a quarter in which its betting shops were closed for all but the last two weeks. Net gaming revenue was down 22%.
GVC (LON:GVC) shares fell 5.0%, although this was as much due to the separate announcement that respected Chief Executive Kenneth Alexander is to retire as of this week, to be succeeded by Shay Segev, who is currently chief operating officer."
1443,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 04:54AM ET</span>",Hedge Funds in Gold Futures Market Get Crushed by ‘Big Boy’ ETFs,"(Bloomberg) -- There’s a big shift in the balance of power in the global gold market.
A relentlessly expanding physical hoard of bullion stored in London and New York means exchange-traded funds have usurped managed money in the futures market as the key driver of the price of the shiny metal.
For much of the grind higher that saw gold break above $1,800 per ounce for the first time in eight years last week, investors in the biggest futures market were reducing their positions. At the same time, ETFs were increasing their holdings to more than 3,000 tons -- the highest total ever recorded.
“ETFs are definitely the big boys now,” said David Govett, head of precious metals trading at Marex Spectron. “In the past they were certainly a factor, but there were a lot of others too -- funds, CTAs, day traders. But they have become very cautious with the lack of liquidity in the market.”
It’s a radical shift in the market’s structure. The Comex exchange in New York is the biggest gold futures trading venue in the world, and managed-money positioning there historically tends to make or break rallies. Arguably the current bull market was triggered by a short-squeeze on Comex in 2018.
Yet between March 16 and July 7, net-long managed-money positioning as a share of open interest slumped from 45% to 31% as asset managers closed out leveraged positions, probably to meet liquidity needs elsewhere.
Over that period ETFs tracked by Bloomberg added more than 450 tons of metal, worth roughly $27 billion, and the price of spot gold rose almost 20%. Bernard Sin, a regional director at one of the leading Swiss refiners, said the passive products were “without a doubt” instrumental in sustaining the rally.
For the time being, it looks like fast money in the futures market has given up the fight. Positioning bottomed out five weeks ago, setting up a powerful dynamic whereby both forces -- futures and the ETFs -- may be bullish at the same time.
“ETFs are telling a story about the longer term belief in gold,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S. He predicts gold could test its record high of $1,920 in the coming months.
Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY) analyst Carsten Fritsch, for one, is telling clients to pay close attention to the money flowing across the passive market. In a recent note he pointed out that in just six months ETFs have bought more gold than all central banks in 2018 or 2019.
“This shows just how prominent a role this investment form is currently playing on the gold market,” he wrote.

(Reuters) - European shares eased from one-month highs on Thursday as a batch of weak earnings and mixed economic data from China dented sentiment, while investors waited to hear from the European Central Bank.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 1% after closing at a five-week high in the previous session.
Data showed China's economy returned to growth in the second quarter, but unexpected weakness in domestic consumption highlighted the lasting economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic.
The numbers took a toll on Asian stocks, with investors also jittery about Beijing's heightened tensions with Washington on trade, technology and geopolitics. [MKTS/GLOB]
Europe's luxury goods group  Richemont  SA (S:CFR) fell 5.3% as its quarterly sales almost halved, and it gave no details on current trading or the outlook.
Shares in peers LVMH SE (PA:LVMH) and  Kering  SA (PA:PRTP), that also rely on China for a large portion of their revenue, fell 1.4% and 2.2% respectively.
Dutch beer maker  Heineken  NV (AS:HEIN) slid 2.6% as its first-half net revenue fell 16.4% due to coronavirus-related lockdowns.
Norway's  Telenor  ASA (OL:TEL) declined 3.9% after forecasting a single-digit decline in subscription base and traffic revenue this year.
""The data that came out from China was not terrible by any means, but if you look at consumers, it was not as strong as what investors may have hoped,"" Rabobank strategist Bas van Geffen said.
Focus turns to the European Central Bank, which is set to deliver its monetary policy decision at 1145 GMT, but the ECB is all but certain to keep policy on hold after a series of extraordinary moves. President Christine Lagarde will hold a news conference at 1230 GMT.
""If there's anything it will be in the press conference and I think Lagarde will be very careful not to say anything to upset markets while they're waiting for more information,"" said Geffen.
Sweden's Getinge AB (ST:GETIb) gained 4.3% as a surge in demand for ventilators and other life support equipment in the wake of the pandemic lifted its quarterly core profit.

German online fashion retailer  Zalando SE  (DE:ZALG) jumped 6.3% as it raised its full year earnings forecast.

1445,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 04:20AM ET</span>",Twitter hacking spree alarms experts concerned about the platform's security,"By Joseph Menn and Raphael Satter
SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The extraordinary hacking spree that hit Twitter on Wednesday, leading it to briefly muzzle some of its most widely followed accounts, is drawing questions about the platform's security and resilience in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election.
Twitter said late Wednesday hackers obtained control of employee credentials to hijack accounts including those of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, former president Barack Obama, reality television star Kim Kardashian, and tech billionaire and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) founder Elon Musk.
In a series of tweets, the company said: ""We detected what we believe to be a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools.""
The hackers then ""used this access to take control of many highly-visible (including verified) accounts and Tweet on their behalf.""
The company statements confirmed the fears of security experts that the service itself - rather than users - had been compromised.
Twitter's role as a critical communications platform for political candidates and public officials, including President Donald Trump, has led to fears that hackers could wreak havoc with the Nov. 3 presidential election or otherwise compromise national security. 
Adam Conner, vice president for technology policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think-tank, said on Twitter: ""This is bad on July 15 but would be infinitely worse on November 3rd."" 
BITCOIN BOUNTY
Posing as celebrities and the wealthy, the hackers asked followers to send the digital currency bitcoin to a series of addresses. By evening, 400 bitcoin transfers were made worth a combined $120,000. Half of the victims had funds in U.S. bitcoin exchanges, a quarter in Europe and a quarter in Asia, according to forensics company Elliptic.
Those transfers left history that could help investigators identify the perpetrators of the hack. The financial damage may be limited because multiple exchanges blocked other payments after their own Twitter accounts were targeted. 
The damage to Twitter's reputation may be more serious. Most troubling to some was how long the company took to stop the bad tweets.
""Twitter's response to this hack was astonishing. It's the middle of the day in San Francisco, and it takes them five hours to get a handle on the incident,"" said Dan Guido, CEO of security company Trail of Bits.
An even worse scenario was that the bitcoin fraud was a distraction for more serious hacking, such as harvesting the direct messages of the account holders.
Twitter said it was not yet certain what the hackers may have done beyond sending the bitcoin messages.
""We’re looking into what other malicious activity they may have conducted or information they may have accessed and will share more here as we have it,"" the company said.
Mass compromises of Twitter accounts via theft of employee credentials or problems with third-party applications that many users employ have occured before. 
Wednesday's hack was the worst to date. Several users with two-factor authentication - a security procedure that helps prevent break-in attempts - said they were powerless to stop it.

""If the hackers do have access to the backend of Twitter, or direct database access, there is nothing potentially stopping them from pilfering data in addition to using this tweet-scam as a distraction,"" said Michael Borohovski, director of software engineering at security company Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS).

The outgoing-CEO, who oversaw a series of major acquisitions and led the company through coronavirus lockdowns that shut down its network of gambling shops, will be replaced by Chief Operating Officer Shay Segev.
Alexander said he had made the decision over the last four months. ""This feels like the right moment,"" he said. ""I have given 13 years to GVC and I now want to give some time to my family.""
GVC said that Alexander has offered to remain available to Segev and the team as required.
The company, whose brands also include Coral, bwin and Foxy Bingo, said it expects first-half core earnings to be in the range of 340 million pounds ($426.94 million) to 350 million pounds. 
The company posted an 86% plunge in UK retail like-for-like net gaming revenue for its second-quarter, hit by store closures due to the coronavirus lockdown. Net gaming revenue for European retail was also down 90%.

1447,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 03:35AM ET</span>",UK seeks to raise record £385 billion from debt markets,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said on Thursday it would seek to raise 110 billion pounds ($138 billion) from the bond market between September and November, taking total gilt issuance in the first eight months of the financial year to a record 385 billion pounds.
The United Kingdom Debt Management Office is currently on track to raise an unprecedented 275 billion pounds between April and August, financing record borrowing that funds COVID-19 spending, replaces lost tax revenue and repays maturing debt.
Thursday's announcement represented a slowdown in the record pace of borrowing - dropping to 36.7 billion pounds a month for September to November from an average 55 billion pounds before - and the government hopes for a further easing off.
""The higher volume of issuance seen so far this year due to COVID-19 is not expected to persist over the final four months of the year,"" the finance ministry said in a statement alongside the DMO announcement.
The finance ministry also said it was seeking to increase the amount of money raised from its NS&I savings business, which takes money direct from the public, by 29 billion pounds to 35 billion.
Thursday's borrowing announcement is broadly in line with analysts' expectations, and there was little immediate market reaction.
Helped by a further 300 billion pounds of Bank of England asset purchases, investors have shown a strong appetite for British government debt since late March.
Yields on two-year debt sank to a record low -0.13% on Tuesday after data showed Britain's economy made a weaker-than-expected recovery in May from the massive hit from COVID-19 and the associated lockdown.
But the economic damage means Britain could be on course to borrow nearly 400 billion pounds this year, on top of refinancing existing debt, the government's Office for Budget Responsibility has warned, taking public-sector debt as a share of the economy to its highest since the 1950s.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded lower Thursday, weighed by disappointing Covid-19-impacted trading updates ahead of the latest meeting from the European Central Bank.
At 3:35 AM ET (0735 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.8% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.9% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.7%. 
Compagnie Financiere Richemont  (SIX:CFR) stock fell 4.9% after the Swiss luxury-goods group said its sales plunged 47% in its first quarter from a year, falling significantly across all regions, except China, due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Continuing the theme, Heineken (AS:HEIO) stock dropped 3.1% as the world’s second-largest brewer was hit hard by the lockdowns of bars and restaurants. Net income plunged 76% as the company took a 550 million euro ($630 million) asset impairment charge. And GVC Holdings PLC (LON:GVC) shares fell 4.7% as the owner of  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) and Coral bookmakers reported an 11% drop in net gaming revenue in a half-year ravaged by the cancellation of sports events and the closure of its high street stores.
On the flip side, Zalando (DE:ZALG) stock rose 2.5% after the online fashion retailer raised its guidance for the full year following strong growth in the second quarter.
Attention will now turn to the latest ECB get together, although the central bank is unlikely to deliver another easing package so soon after June’s largesse.
“We think the ECB will strike a more positive note on current economic developments, while continuing to express caution about the outlook further out,” said analysts at ABN Amro, in a research note.
Also coming later, the weekly U.S.  initial jobless claims number is set to show a slowly improving employment situation, while the June retail sales release will be studied to see if May's big jump can be repeated. 
Earlier Thursday, China reported 3.2% growth in its second quarter GDP year-on-year earlier Thursday, as the world’s second-largest economy returned to growth after the first quarter’s contraction of 6.8%.
But the recovery is still uneven. Separate data showed China's industrial output beat expectations in June, but retail sales unexpectedly fell again, suggesting consumer demand remains weak.
At the same time, the Covid-19 virus continues to work its way through the global population, with the summer tourism season in Europe generating pockets of high-risk gatherings. 
Oil prices weakened Thursday after the world’s major producers agreed to relax their record cuts to output, but losses have been mitigated by a sizable drop in last week’s official U.S. crude inventories.
At 3:35 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% lower at $40.86 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.5% to $43.57.

At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.5% lower, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.4%, while CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.4%.

But the recovery is still uneven. Separate data showed China's industrial output beat expectations in June, but retail sales unexpectedly fell again, suggesting consumer demand remains weak.
“Although the quarter-on-quarter growth of 11.5% supports the V-shaped recovery narrative, which financial markets have been trading on, year-on-year growth of 3.2% is still the lowest since records began in 1992,” said analyst Amy Yuan Zhuang at Nordea, in a research note. “It suggests that economic activity remains far below the pre-pandemic levels.”
At the same time, the Covid-19 virus continues to work its way through the global population, with the summer tourism season in Europe generating pockets of high-risk gatherings. Tensions between the U.S. and China are also still simmering.
“Lingering uncertainty could prolong the recovery and make the asset price rebound fragile to a correction,” the analyst at Nordea added.

Block, the longtime Musk critic and short-selling founder of Muddy Waters Capital LLC, said on Wednesday that he doesn’t have any bearish wagers against Tesla even though he thinks the business is unsustainable.
“I’m not short the stock, thank God,” Block said in an interview with Bloomberg’s Tracy Alloway and Joe Weisenthal on the Odd Lots podcast. “We used to joke that Tesla, when it files for bankruptcy, will probably have a $30 billion market cap. Short it at your own risk. I wouldn’t do that.”
Tesla’s more than 300% surge since mid-March has captivated bulls while baffling skeptics who say the electric vehicle maker is grossly overpriced. Even as individual investors buy at a frenzied pace, the value of wagers against the stock has swelled to nearly $20 billion. It now trades at 182 times estimated 12-month earnings, versus 10 times for General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).
Block said at one point he had a Tesla position that involved buying the company’s convertible bonds and using the coupon payments to fund long-dated put options on the stock, but he eventually sold the debt and let the puts expire.
“It’s one thing to bet on Elon Musk, but it’s another thing to bet against him,” Block said. “The guy specializes in pulling rabbits out of the hat.”

Most parts of the United States were under government-imposed stay-at-home orders between April and June to combat the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, which impacted production and caused a plunge in auto sales.
Tesla's only U.S. vehicle factory in California was shut for some six weeks of the quarter.
The report released on Wednesday showed registrations in California, a bellwether market for the electric-car maker, plummeted almost 48% from a year earlier to 9,774 vehicles in the three months ended June 2020.
Model 3 registrations in the state, which accounted for more than half of the total registrations, fell 63.6% to 5,951 vehicles.
Total vehicle registrations in the 23 states from where the data was collected fell nearly 49% to 18,702 vehicles.
The automaker had earlier this month outpaced analysts' estimates for vehicle deliveries in the second quarter, defying a trend of plummeting sales in the auto industry as COVID-19-related lockdown orders kept people at home.

Registration figures might not accurately reflect the number of vehicle deliveries during the quarter as registrations in the United States typically take about 30 days from the time of sale.

(Reuters) - Perbacco, the upscale Italian restaurant in San Francisco's Financial District, had a new takeout menu and a skeleton crew to offer outside service as the coronavirus pandemic first forced cities and states to cancel indoor dining.
But after coronavirus cases surged across California, San Francisco indefinitely postponed the re-opening of indoor dining at 50% capacity, just before Governor Gavin Newsom banned indoor restaurant dining across the entire state.
The lingering uncertainty was the last straw for Perbacco co-owner Umberto Gibin. Takeout and outdoor dining have not been enough to offset costs. Come this Friday, he will shut everything down, with the hope that after Labor Day the city will allow indoor dining and he can re-open.
""It's time to take a break,"" he told Reuters in a phone interview.
As cases surge in California, Texas, Arizona, Florida and elsewhere, bars and restaurants with indoor dining face new shutdown orders.
Restaurant owners feel whipsawed, left with kitchens full of perishable food, plexiglass dividers they had specially ordered to keep customers safe - and unending bills.
Even restaurant chains are feeling the pain.
Greg Flynn, the founder of Flynn Restaurant Group, a franchisee that owns more than 1,250 Applebee's, Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA), Arby's and Taco Bell restaurants in 33 states, said early this week that nearly 100 of his dining rooms were closed, mainly Applebee's (N:DIN).
""Without dining rooms open, no full-service restaurant is going to get back to even,"" he said.
On Monday, the KFC fried chicken chain, which like Taco Bell is owned by  Yum! Brands Inc  (N:YUM), said it would close dining rooms at its corporate-owned restaurants in Florida, leaving only drive-thru. It advised franchisees to consider re-closing seating areas in states with large outbreaks.
In Los Angeles, the second-largest U.S. city, restaurateurs are also struggling.
""When they first closed indoor dining I thought, 'Okay well, we'll get through this,'"" said Caroline Styne, whose Lucques Group runs two Los Angeles restaurants, a bakery and a catering business.
""Now I have to say I'm feeling very pessimistic about even being able to seat indoors at all for the rest of the year,"" she said. ""I often wonder if we should have just stayed closed.""
Styne is working with the Independent Restaurant Coalition to lobby for a $120 billion federally funded restaurant revitalization fund.
In Houston, Axelrad Beer Garden shut its 10,000-square-foot venue in mid-March, reopened to 25% capacity on June 10, and closed again two weeks later as hospitalizations soared.
The bar poured out most of its specialty beer after the first closing and is now sitting on inventory it has not been able to return to distributors. ""We don't know how long this is going to last,"" said co-owner Adam Brackman.
Restaurants try to predict six months ahead of time how much food and supplies they will need to order, based on past annual sales, said Rob Menendez, co-owner of It's A Cubano B eatery in Pompano Beach, Florida.
""This whole pandemic has completely limited that ability because things are changing so fast,"" he said. ""Cities are changing policies. Customer sentiment is all over the place. People are afraid to go out. You have a segment of the population who is refusing to follow the mandates.""
About six weeks ago, Menendez was able to reopen his small seating area at 50% capacity when south Florida allowed it.
He quickly found that a ""very significant portion of the population just did not want to abide by mask use.""
So nearly a month ago, he closed dine-in and stuck with takeout and delivery. ""It wasn't worth the risk,"" he said.

The company, California’s biggest oil producer, has been weighed down by massive borrowings since its spinoff from Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY). in late 2014, right at the start of the previous downturn in the crude market. Low levels of cash and stricter state drilling regulations added to the pressure on California Resources, despite a $320 million investment from Tom Barrack Jr.’s Colony Capital (NYSE:CLNY) Inc. last year.
Many investors have shunned producers operating outside of the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the most prolific U.S. oil patch. Even before the most recent price crash, American drillers were increasingly struggling to attract capital amid market volatility and growing doubts about their ability to generate returns for investors.
More roadblocks appeared this year as the Covid-19 pandemic prompted widespread lockdowns that decimated global demand, while Saudi Arabia and Russia battled for market share before finally reaching an agreement with other members of the OPEC+ group to cut production. While oil prices have recovered from the extreme lows seen in April, they remain at a level where many American producers are struggling to achieve free cash flow.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Leaf Group (NYSE:LEAF) said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that one of its board members resigned and another was removed from the audit committee because he is ineligible to serve on it.
The move comes just days after an investor group, which owns 40% of the consumer internet company's stock and is looking to oust the chief executive, pointed to conflicts on the board and suggests that Leaf Group has acknowledged a mistake.
A spokesman for Leaf declined to comment.
Mitchell Stern on Friday told the company that he was stepping off the eight-person board, Leaf said in the filing.
Leaf also said Charles Baker, who was appointed to the audit committee in May, ""is unable to serve on the committee under applicable NYSE rules,"" the filing said.
Leaf had said in its proxy that Baker is an independent director. But the group of six investors on Monday said Baker does not meet the NYSE's criterion of being independent and called the company's disclosures ""misleading.""
The group, which includes Osmium Partners, PEAK6 Investments, Boyle Capital Opportunity Fund, Oak Management Corp, Generation Partners II LLC and Spectrum Equity Investors, is pushing to remove Leaf's CEO, Sean Moriarty, refresh the board, have all directors elected annually, and consider the sale of the firm's media and marketplace businesses.
They blame Moriarty for having lost 60% of their capital during his tenure. The stock price has tumbled 47% in the last 12 months alone. On Wednesday it closed at $3.93.
On Monday the group raised the pressure on Leaf by writing to its board that Moriarty and board member Baker had ties to each other that raised questions about Baker's ability to ""properly serve on the Company's Audit Committee.""

1459,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 08:25PM ET</span>","Dell considering spinning off VMware stake, shares surge","(Reuters) - Dell Technologies Inc (N:DELL) is considering spinning off its 81% stake in cloud computing software maker VMware (N:VMW), the PC maker said on Wednesday, adding that such a move would not occur before September 2021.
The company said the evaluation was in an early stage and it was looking at options including keeping its current ownership.
VMware said a spinoff could result in a simpler capital structure and it has formed a special committee for talks with the corporate computing giant.
In case of a spinoff, Dell said it would negotiate payment of a special cash dividend by VMware to all its shareholders and would try to formalize commercial arrangements similar to those in place, including intellectual property agreements.
If the VMware spinoff proceeds as Dell plans, the PC maker would receive a pro-rated portion of a special dividend to help reduce its debt of $57.3 billion, much of which was taken on during the 2016 acquisition of VMWare's then-majority owner EMC (NYSE:EMC). VMware could also issue additional debt as part of a transaction.
The two sides intend to begin talks well ahead of September 2021, when such a deal would become tax-free under U.S. tax laws.
Shares of Dell jumped 8%, while VMware rose 5% in aftermarket trading.
Any deal would require VMware shareholder approval. Other options including an outright sale and maintaining the status quo are likely to be considered, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
VMware is currently Dell's best-performing unit as it benefits from companies looking to cut costs and move to the cloud, a shift that is being hastened by the coronavirus pandemic.
VMWare last year bought two providers of cloud security and developer services in deals that together were valued at about $5 billion.

The unit's revenue increased 12% in the latest reported quarter, even as Dell's total revenue growth dipped.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday confirmed a 643 million euro ($734 million) arbitration award favoring a unit of Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) that claimed it was fraudulently induced to buy an ailing German pipemaker that inflated sales to look profitable.
U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman in Manhattan said an arbitration panel employed ""sound"" reasoning in ruling against Schulz Holding GmbH, which sold U.S. and German businesses to Berkshire's Precision Castparts for 800 million euros ($913 million) in 2017.
Schulz's U.S.-based lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
""We intend to move swiftly to enforce the court's well-reasoned judgment,"" Precision spokesman David Dugan said in an email.
The Schulz purchase was a rare misstep for Buffett's conglomerate, whose $32.1 billion acquisition in 2016 of Precision, which makes aircraft and industrial parts, remains its largest. 
Precision, based in Portland, Oregon, accused Schulz of using backdated orders and fake invoices to inflate revenue and profit, when the Krefeld, Germany-based company was actually teetering near bankruptcy.
It estimated that the businesses it bought were worth no more than 157 million euros.
In its April 9 ruling, the New York arbitration panel said Schulz engaged in a ""pervasive scheme"" to mislead Precision.
""This is not a close case,"" the panel said. ""The evidence strongly points to fraud, and there is little in the record to suggest otherwise.""
Schulz claimed that the panel should have dismissed Precision's fraudulent inducement claims, and accounted improperly for claims the companies had settled. 
It has also argued that the businesses it sold were worth more than 800 million euros.
Precision has struggled during the coronavirus pandemic, and laid off some workers amid the slowdown in aerospace.
Greg Abel, a Berkshire vice chairman, said at the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's May 2 annual meeting that Precision's defense contract business remained ""very sound and strong.""
The case is Precision Castparts Corp et al v Schulz Holdings GmbH & Co, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-03029.

Under U.S. bankruptcy law, ""pay-to-stay"" bonuses cannot be offered solely as incentives for Chief Executive Geoffroy van Raemdonck and other executives to remain with the retailer, said Henry Hobbs, the lawyer monitoring the bankruptcy, in court documents filed Tuesday.
Neiman Marcus' bankruptcy was one of most prominent among retailers forced to temporarily close stores in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Many retailers worldwide are also failing to cope with market uncertainties and mounting debt during the crisis.
Neiman Marcus said in May it expected to emerge from Chapter 11 in early fall with a $750 million package from creditors that provided its initial bankruptcy loan.
It reached an agreement with creditors for $675 million of debtor-in-possession financing to aid operations while it attempts to reorganize.
The retailer also negotiated a plan with most of its creditors to cancel about $4 billion of debt in exchange for handing control to senior lenders led by Pacific Investment Management Corp, Sixth Street Partners and Davidson Kempner Capital Management.

ZURICH/LONDON (Reuters) - Billionaires looked after by Swiss bank UBS (S:UBSG) are looking to move their cash out of equities after profiting from an unprecedented sell-off and rapid rebound from March to May, the world's largest wealth manager said on Thursday.
During the rout in stock markets across the globe in March, UBS' richest customers took out loans to place billions into crashing stock markets. They are now looking to pull that money from equities and put the profits in illiquid and private assets, UBS' head of global family offices told Reuters.
Their strategy has helped family offices which manage the financial affairs of the world's richest beat hedge funds and overall markets to outperform their target benchmarks through May, according to the bank's survey of 120 family offices, with an average family wealth of $1.6 billion, published on Thursday.
""We had record loans written during the middle of March and the middle of April, of significant family offices who asked us for balance sheet and then went into the market,"" Josef Stadler said in an interview. ""They bought, for example, U.S. equities, but they didn't buy $50 million. They bought a billion-plus of those equities to rebalance. And they made a lot of money.""
Known as the ""fortress bank for billionaires"", banking half the world's very richest, UBS said its wealthiest clients serviced by individual family offices were now looking to invest in residential real estate and private equity, or to make corporate and strategic deals.
Stadler said the trend had largely been seen in Asia and he expected it to accelerate in the last quarter of 2020 and into the early months of 2021. As a consequence, he expected equities markets to soften throughout the rest of this year.
Asked whether unrest in Hong Kong and its tensions with mainland China had affected investment decisions, Stadler said UBS did not see family office money moving out of Hong Kong to other jurisdictions.

""They made their arrangements years ago, where they want to put themselves on the map,"" he said, adding that such clients tended to keep their money in multiple jurisdictions and based their decisions on long-term strategies.

1463,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>",Rupert Murdoch's big investment headache: Australia,"By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - The birthplace of Rupert Murdoch's media empire, News Corp's (O:NWSA) Australian business, is shaping as a trouble spot for the global firm, following a billion dollar writedown and a move to stop printing more than 100 regional newspapers.
It's an emotional challenge, given 89-year-old Murdoch's ties to his native country where he turned a single newspaper inherited from his father in 1952 into one of the world's most influential companies.
The Australian arm faces a double incursion: the broadcast business, Foxtel, is fast losing subscribers to streaming giants like Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), while the print arm, like its rivals, is ceding advertisers to Facebook (O:FB) and Google (O:GOOGL). 
""You couldn't engineer more pressure, I don't think, than what Foxtel is under at the moment,"" said a person with direct knowledge of the company's Australian strategy, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""The business should have moved much more aggressively into the streaming space than it did.""
The Australian arm was the only part of News Corp left unchanged when the company spun off its broadcast business in 2013, keeping publishing assets like The Wall Street Journal, HarperCollins and a string of British newspapers.
Along with more than 100 newspapers controlling two-thirds of the Australian market, the unit included a stake in real estate website REA Group Ltd (AX:REA) and struggling pay-TV group Foxtel.
Now, it is proving to be the biggest single drag on earnings for News Corp globally.
In a statement to Reuters, News Corp Co-Chairman and Rupert's son Lachlan Murdoch reinforced the company's commitment to its Australian operations.
""No media company is in a stronger position to face the uncertainties of the digital age than News Corp. We have incredible strength in print with publications such as The Wall Street Journal, the Sunday Times, The Australian and our dailies in Australia,"" he said.
""Our company began in Australia and Australia remains a critical part of our future.""
FOXTEL WOES
Started in 1995 as a joint venture with local telecom Telstra (OTC:TLSYY) Corp Ltd (AX:TLS), Foxtel, which used satellite dishes and television ""set-top boxes"", once seemed primed for home viewing dominance against a handful of free-to-air TV channels.
Then Netflix arrived, and Foxtel's subscriber numbers swooned. At end-March 2020, Foxtel had 2.9 million subscribers, barely changed from 2016, while Netflix has at least double that number, according to figures supplied by Foxtel and Roy Morgan market researchers.
In the March quarter, Foxtel's earnings fell 31% from a year earlier, while News Corp took a $931 million impairment charge on the value of the pay-TV service, pushing News Corp to a $1 billion loss. 
Earnings have been hurt by subscribers taking up cheaper - and lower revenue - online offers from Foxtel itself, while it now faces a pandemic-related shutdown of sports, its main competitive difference.
News Corp owns 65% of Foxtel - paying about A$2 billion ($1.4 billion) in 2012 for an extra 25% stake, implying a total value of around A$8 billion - while Telstra holds 35%. In May, Telstra valued its stake at just A$450 million, implying that all of Foxtel is now worth around A$1.3 billion.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts put the value at A$1.1 billion including debt, which stood at roughly A$1.7 billion in 2019, based on figures in News Corp's annual report.
""I've had a view it's worth nothing for a long time,"" said Rhett Kessler, a principal at Pengana Australian Equities, a top-20 shareholder of Telstra.
Telstra declined to comment.
News Corp declined comment beyond Murdoch's statement. It has said a new streaming service, Binge, will capitalise on Australians' appetite for content during prolonged periods at home due to the coronavirus response.
ACCELERATING CHANGE
Globally, News Corp is benefiting from a campaign to build digital subscribers and cut reliance on advertising, led by subscription surges for high-end titles like Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal.
In May, the Australian arm said it would stop printing 112 regional newspapers. While many will be published online, some 36 titles were shuttered altogether.
Analysts said the move was a step in the right direction, with bigger national titles like broadsheet The Australian more likely to be able to win digital subscriptions.
Still, short-sellers - investors who profit when stocks fall - are targetting the stock. Since March, News Corp's Australian-listed CDIs (AX:NWS), which offer indirect share ownership, have been the most shorted instrument in Australia most days, industry figures show.
Its $7 billion market value is less than that of its assets combined. Its 61% stake in listed real estate website REA Group Ltd (AX:REA) is worth about $6 billion, while The Wall Street Journal, if valued on the same multiples as rival The  New York Times  Co (NYT), is worth about $4 billion, Australian shareholder L1 Capital noted recently.
Accelerating change in Australia may fall to Lachlan, 48, when Murdoch senior cedes control, analysts and people with knowledge of the company say, with the company taking a more commercially focused approach.
Foxtel will replace its set-top box model with streaming inside a decade, they say, although this will generate a fraction of current revenues per customer and the company will be competing in a crowded market.
Still, Lachlan shares his father's belief that news is central to the business model and is unlikely to shut the main newspapers, keeping the Australian unit as part of News Corp's sprawling global business.
""His responsibility now is to transform the business from a traditional media business that could be going the way of the dinosaur to something that will be survivable for the next few decades,"" said JPMorgan analyst Eric Pan.

1464,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 06:50PM ET</span>","American Airlines sending 25,000 furlough notices as U.S. demand sags","By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO (Reuters) - American Airlines (O:AAL) said on Wednesday it is sending 25,000 notices of potential furloughs to frontline workers and warned that demand for air travel is slowing again as COVID-19 cases increase and states re-establish quarantine restrictions.
The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act requires companies to provide 60 days' notice of potential layoffs or furloughs.
In a memo to employees released on Wednesday, American said the notices are tied to the overstaffing it expects in October when U.S. government payroll assistance expires.
American, with more than 130,000 employees in 2019, had already warned that furloughs would be hard to avoid as pandemic-hit revenue remains more sluggish than the airline had hoped.
Among different work groups, warnings are being sent to 2,500 pilots or about 18% of the total, nearly 10,000 flight attendants or 37% of the total, and 3,200 mechanics or 22% of the total.
Overall, American expects to be overstaffed by about 20,000 in the fall, but hopes to reduce the actual number of furloughs through enhanced leave and early-departure programs it has rolled out alongside unions, Chief Executive Doug Parker and President Robert Isom said in the memo.
They noted, however, that if Congress passes another round of payroll support through March 31, the need for involuntary furloughs at that time would be ""much less throughout the industry"" because ""there would most certainly be more demand for air travel.""
Unions representing aviation workers have asked lawmakers for another $32 billion in payroll aid to keep hundreds of thousands of workers employed for another six months past October. Airlines are not opposed to the idea but so far have not actively lobbied for it.
Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) said this week it believed it could avoid furloughs after about 17,000 employees signed up for early-departure deals.
By encouraging more senior workers to leave, U.S. airlines could trim their labor costs - their main expense - during the recovery, giving them more pricing power. Airline union contracts require airlines to furlough junior workers first.
United Airlines (O:UAL) has sent 36,000 furlough notices, representing about 45% of workers, and Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) has also warned that job losses will be hard to avoid. 
After boosting summer flying following some signs of pent-up leisure demand in May and June, some airlines are now scaling back their schedules due to a surge in COVID-19 cases across the country.
The U.S. outbreak has prompted several countries to impose travel restrictions on Americans. The European Union excluded the United States from its ""safe"" travel list.
Both Canada and Mexico want to extend the ban on non-essential travel at U.S. borders.

Even within the United States, Americans from 22 states are required to self-quarantine for 14 days if they enter New York or New Jersey, two states that have managed to curb infections.

Carnival said the notes will be secured by a second-priority lien, a lower priority of repayment in case of bankruptcy or liquidation of assets.
The cruise business is one of the worst hit from the pandemic and many cruise operators have been forced to raise billions through various means, even by pledging ships and private islands.
Carnival has raised over $10 billion through a series of financing transactions since its voyages were paused, enough to withstand another full year in a zero-revenue scenario, Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald had said earlier this month.

Travel-related stocks Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp,  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Cruises Ltd, Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) and Wynn Resorts (O:WYNN) surged, as did the S&P 1500 airlines index.
The S&P 500 beat the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite for a fourth straight session, a feat scored only twice since Wall Street launched its massive recovery last March.
Gains for the Nasdaq were capped by online retail giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), video streaming platform Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), which slipped after surging to record highs recently.
""The Moderna news woke everybody up again that this is not going to last forever, and there is light at the end of the tunnel. That is why you are seeing such a strong move today into those economically sensitive stocks,"" said Tim Ghriskey, Chief Investment Strategist Inverness Counsel in New York.
Adding to investors' enthusiasm, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book survey showed U.S. businesses saw an uptick in activity into the beginning of July as states eased restrictions to contain the novel coronavirus pandemic.
A raft of stimulus measures and encouraging economic data have lifted the S&P 500 to about 5% below its record high hit in February.
However, the United States has failed to control the coronavirus and there is a high level of uncertainty over how much the pandemic will affect the economy, Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Patrick Harker said, as a number of U.S. sunbelt states reported a surge in COVID-19 cases recently.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 228.47 points, or 0.86%, to 26,871.06, the S&P 500 gained 29.1 points, or 0.91%, to 3,226.62 and the Nasdaq Composite added 61.92 points, or 0.59%, to 10,550.49.
Goldman Sachs rose after it said its trading revenue doubled in the second quarter, driven by big swings in stock and bond markets since March.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) gained ahead of their results on Thursday. The broader banking index also climbed.

UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) fell after warning of rising costs later this year as Americans catch up on less urgent surgeries halted by the coronavirus pandemic.

1470,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 04:09PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: 3 Things to Watch for July 16,"By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Stocks continue to trade up on optimism about a coronavirus vaccine, as big banks blow past expectations on their second quarter performance.
On Wednesday, it was  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)'s turn to dazzle, handily beating analyst forecasts on the strength of its trading operations. It joined JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) on that trend, while  Wells Fargo  & Company (NYSE:WFC) reported its first quarterly loss in a decade on Tuesday.
More bank earnings are on tap for Thursday, along with profit reports from other big companies like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT).
Retail sales numbers will be released in the morning, and analysts will undoubtedly be watching for signs that the economy is coming back to life despite recent rollbacks of business openings following the Covid lockdowns.
Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow:
1. Earnings could reveal how retail Investors reacted to lockdowns
Thursday's earnings line-up includes Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Charles Schwab  Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) on the financial front. All three are expected to benefit from trading, as other banks demonstrated in their reports this week.
Schwab may shed a light on activity by retail investors as people took to trading the markets during a period of high volatility. Stay at home orders that covered much of the second quarter may have been all the excuse some people needed to start trading in their spare time. Online brokers are getting a lot of attention recently. Morgan Stanley is seeking to acquire Schwab competitor ETrade Financial in a $13 billion deal linking Wall Street and Main Street. Shareholders recently approved Schwab's own $26 billion merger with TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD).
Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect Schwab to report profit of 52 cents a share on revenue of $2.5 billion.
2. Netflix earnings on tap
Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) also reports earnings on Thursday. The video streaming giant, a big beneficiary of shelter-in-place orders that boosted demand for home entertainment, is seen reporting EPS of $1.82 on revenue of $6.1 billion.
As part of the FAANG cohort of big tech stocks, Netflix has helped push NASDAQ Compositeto repeat record highs in recent days, but it faces increasing competition from other streaming services, including one rolled out this week by NBC Universal.
Netflix shares hit a 52-week high of $575 on Monday but have since drifted lower.
3. Retail sales numbers due out for June
Retail sales are scheduled to be released Thursday at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), and analysts will be watching to see if May's big jump can be repeated. They are anticipating a gain of 5% in June.
Sales surged an unexpectedly strong 17% in May after plunging in April amid Covid-related lockdowns, and sales excluding autos and gas rose 12.4% in May. Many areas of the country opened more fully in June, though recent spikes in virus cases has forced some states and cities to rollback those reopening efforts.
Retailers such as Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)have hit recent highs as consumers continue to shop despite restrictions. Walmart hit a 52-week high again on Wednesday even after the company said it would require shoppers to wear masks in all 5,000 of its stores. It joins other major retailers, including  Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), with a mask requirement.
Other stocks have also gotten a boost from strong sales, including  Hanesbrands  Inc (NYSE:HBI), the underwear and comfort apparel maker, which jumped 15% in trading on Wednesday after analyst upgrades."

Investing.com – The Dow notched its fourth-straight daily gain on Wednesday as positive vaccine news and earnings from banks boosted investor sentiment.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.85%, or 227 points, the S&P 500 gained 0.93%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.59%.
Drugmaker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) jumped 6.9% after reporting that its coronavirus vaccine candidate, mRNA-127, produced antibodies in patients aged 18 to 55, suggesting the treatment could protect against infection by the virus.
Some on Wall Street, however, said it was too early to draw a conclusion from the early-stage clinical data.
""Many open questions obviously remain, including on immune response durability, and what the profile might look like in older adults, but we believe the data represent a good start,"" Chardan analysts said in a note.
Covid-19 cases meanwhile continued to mount, led by virus hotspots across the U.S. including California, Arizona, Florida and Texas.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) jumped 16%, Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) added 7.9%, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) was up 9.3%, and Carnival (NYSE:CCL) surged 16%.
Financials, meanwhile, eased from session highs as Goldman Sachs pared some gains following a blowout quarterly report.
 Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) rose 1.3% after reporting second-quarter earnings of $6.26, above consensus estimates of $3.90, led by strong performance in its trading division.
US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) also beat forecasts to rise 3.7%, while PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC) was up 2.8% despite swinging to an unexpected loss. 
In tech, FAANG stocks traded mix as the intraday bid in megacap tech faded.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) gave up some gains after rising more than 2% following an upgrade from Needham and reports that the tech giant had won a legal dispute over a $14.8 billion tax battle with the European Union.
Needham upgraded its rating on the stock to $450 from $350, citing the value of its ecosystem.
Energy continued its strong start to the week boosted by rising oil prices as data showing a larger-than-expected draw U.S. crude supplies offset worries over waning demand amid reports that some major oil producing nations are set to rein in production cuts.
Elsewhere, Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) climbed 3% after the plant-based food company announced an expansion into Brazil.  "

Switzerland's Federal Administrative Court upheld a decision to revoke UBS's position as a party to the arrangements over what information to send to France.
Under a previous arrangement, the Swiss Federal Tax Administration had allowed UBS to inspect the files and inform the bank of all final decisions related to 40,000 UBS bank accounts requested by France. UBS could also challenge the respective final decisions on what details to send.
But after UBS contested some of the decisions, the Swiss tax authorities eventually ended the bank's involvement for the documents not already supplied.
The bank appealed against the decision, which was rejected by the Federal Administrative Court earlier this month.
""The Swiss Federal Tax Administration has rightly revoked UBS's status as a party to the ongoing proceedings,"" the court said in a judgment published on Wednesday.
The bank did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. 
Switzerland's highest court last year ruled that historical data about 40,000 UBS clients must be handed to French tax authorities in a landmark case, while blocking the use of the data against the bank itself.
In Wednesday's judgment, the court said UBS feared the data could be used in the ongoing criminal cases against the bank in France, a concern the court said was unfounded.
In February last year, a French court found UBS guilty of illegally soliciting clients and laundering the proceeds of tax evasion and ordered it to pay 4.5 billion euros ($5.13 billion) in penalties.
UBS has denied any wrongdoing and has appealed against the ruling. Appeal proceedings are due to start next March.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk and other Tesla employees are not at risk of having contracted the novel coronavirus after a July 3 meeting with Oklahoma's governor, who said on Wednesday he had tested positive for the virus, a spokesman for the governor said.
""That visit was more than a week before the governor may have been contagious. There is no risk to any Tesla employees from the July 3 visit,"" Charlie Hannema, a spokesman for Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt said in a statement, adding an additional meeting with Tesla executives on Monday was conducted virtually over Zoom.
""The science now is that an infected person is only possibly contagious 48 hours before the onset of symptoms,"" Hannema said, adding that since Stitt's symptoms developed on Monday, anyone in contact with him before Saturday is not at risk of exposure.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on whether company employees, including Musk, have been tested for the virus or other measures taken.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on its website https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html states that the period of infectiousness for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, is not yet known. But it says that based on existing literature, the time from exposure to the development of symptoms ranges from two to 14 days.
The CDC also recommends that anyone who has come in contact with a person who has COVID-19 should stay home for 14 days.

Musk and other Tesla executives met with Stitt and his team on July 3 to visit the site of a potential new Tesla vehicle factory. Oklahoma and Texas are both competing for the new $1.1 billion plant that promises to create thousands of new jobs.

1476,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 01:40PM ET</span>",Blow for EU as Apple wins fight against $15 billion tax order,"By Foo Yun Chee and Padraic Halpin
LUXEMBOURG/DUBLIN (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) scored a major win on Wednesday as Europe's second-highest court rejected an EU order for the iPhone maker to pay 13 billion euros ($15 billion) in Irish back taxes, dealing a blow to the bloc's attempts to crack down on sweetheart tax deals.
In its order four years ago, the European Commission said Apple benefited from illegal state aid via two Irish tax rulings that artificially reduced its tax burden for over two decades - to as low as 0.005% in 2014.
""The General Court annuls the contested decision because the Commission did not succeed in showing to the requisite legal standard that there was an advantage for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU1,"" judges said, referring to EU competition rules.
They said the EU executive was wrong to say Apple's two Irish subsidiaries - Apple Sales International (ASI) and Apple Operations Europe (AOE) - had been granted a selective economic advantage and, by extension, state aid.
Apple welcomed the ruling, saying the case was not about how much tax it pays, but where it is required to pay it. 
Ireland - which had appealed against the Commission's decision alongside Apple - said it had always been clear it had not given special treatment to the U.S. company.
The defeat for European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager could weaken or delay pending cases against Ikea's and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE)'s deals with the Netherlands, as well as Huhtamaki's agreement with Luxembourg.
Vestager, who has made the tax crackdown a centrepiece of her time in office, saw the same court last year overturn her demand for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) to pay up to 30 million euros in Dutch back taxes. In another case, the court also threw out her ruling against a Belgian tax scheme for 39 multinationals.
Vestager said she would study the court's judgment and reflect on possible next steps. The Commission can appeal on points of law to the EU Court of Justice, Europe's top court.
The Commission, which was ordered by the court to pay Apple's and Ireland's legal costs, could still salvage its case, said Dimitrios Kyriazis, Head of Law Faculty at the New College of Humanities in London. 
""Its defeat is very similar to its defeat in the Starbucks cases, that is it won on matters of legal principle and lost due to the allocation of evidentiary onus,"" he said.
""It is more likely that the Commission will re-adopt a decision against Ireland and Apple and try to show exactly how the tax rulings granted AOE and ASI a selective advantage,"" he said.
IRELAND IN SPOTLIGHT 
The European Network on Debt and Development (Eurodad) said the judgment showed the need for corporate tax reform in Europe.
""Today's court decision illustrates how difficult it is to use EU state aid rules to collect tax. If we had a proper corporate tax system, we wouldn’t need long court cases to find out whether it is legal for multinational corporations to pay less than 1 percent in taxes,"" its tax justice coordinator Tove Maria Ryding said.
The ruling puts Ireland's tax regime back in the spotlight at a delicate juncture. With attempts to get a global agreement on taxing multinationals buckling, plans for an EU tax could be revived, putting Dublin's low rates in the firing line.
Multinationals, attracted by Ireland's low taxes, employ around 250,000 people in the country, accounting for one in ten workers at the end of last year.
However, the government has faced heavy criticism from opposition parties for fighting against a tax windfall that would have amounted to 14 billion euros, including interest, and could have covered at least half of a budget deficit forecast to balloon to as much as 10% of GDP this year.
""This is a bad day for the taxpayer,"" said Pearse Doherty, the finance spokesman for the main opposition Sinn Fein party.
""While the Department of Finance might be thinking this is a good day for themselves, morally this is a terrible day.""

Apple says it has 125 million monthly active users of its Apple News product, but it does not disclose revenues or the number of subscribers to the paid version, Apple News+, which costs $9.99 a month for U.S. users. The iPhone maker maintains a staff of editors that curate the stories in both the paid and free versions of its app.
Apple said Wednesday that paying subscribers will gain access to audio versions of longer stories from magazines such as such as Esquire and Vanity Fair, along with newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Times. 
The audio effort intensifies competition with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google, both of whom offer audio news options on their smart home speakers, as well as  Spotify Technology  SA (N:SPOT), which has been expanding its podcast business with news content.
Apple is also launching a weekday morning audio news program called Apple News Today, which will be hosted by New York-based journalists Shumita Basu and Duarte Geraldino and highlight stories from the publishers that work with Apple. The show will be available to both free and paying users, and both it and the audio stories will also be adapted for Apple's CarPlay, the system that connects iPhones to many newer vehicles.
Apple also said it would offer expanded access to local news in its app, starting with five metro areas in the United States: San Francisco and the rest of the Bay Area, Houston, Los Angeles and New York. Apple will maintain editors in each area to curate local stories, and paying News+ subscribers will get access to premium content from the local newspapers that take part in the program.

1480,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 01:20PM ET</span>",Trump to renew challenges to Manhattan prosecutor's subpoena for financial records,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump plans further challenges to a Manhattan prosecutor's efforts to seek his financial records, despite a U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing the pursuit.
According to a joint filing by lawyers for Trump and Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, the president plans by July 27 to file a complaint raising arguments against Vance's grand jury subpoena, which Trump said the nation's highest court allowed him to make.
Vance countered that most of these arguments have already been rejected in the litigation, and Trump deserves no special treatment because he is president. The district attorney agreed not to enforce the subpoena through July 27.
U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in Manhattan has scheduled a Thursday hearing on the matter.
The case concerns a subpoena last August to Trump's accounting firm Mazars USA for eight years of personal and corporate tax returns, related to Vance's criminal probe into Trump and his Trump Organization.
That probe was spurred by news about hush money paid before the 2016 election, including to buy the silence of adult film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal about their claimed relationships with Trump, which he denies.
Vance had prevailed on July 9 at the Supreme Court, which rejected Trump's claim he was immune from criminal probes while in the White House and could block the release of his records.
""No citizen, not even the President, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote.
The court separately rejected the Democratic-led House of Representatives' effort to see many of the records Vance sought. 
Its decisions likely mean the records will not become public until at least after the Nov. 3 election.
In Wednesday's filing, Trump's lawyers said the Republican president may argue that Vance's subpoena was too broad, or that enforcement might ""impede his constitutional duties.""
They may also argue that Vance, a Democrat, pursued the subpoena to harass Trump, or retaliate against his policies.
Vance has denied acting in bad faith, and said the motives for a subpoena are not something courts should normally examine.

The case is Trump v Vance et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-08694.

Penney filed for bankruptcy protection in May, with plans to explore a possible sale, joining a spate of brick-and-mortar retailers to crumble under the pressure brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.
On Tuesday, Calvin Klein owner PVH Corp (N:PVH) also announced a reduction in the number of office employees.

Investing.com --  LCI Industries (NYSE:LCII) rose more than 5% after the company said second quarter sales are likely to be better than expected. 
The maker of recreational vehicle equipment said preliminary second quarter sales should be between $515 million and $530 million, ahead of the consensus of $376 million, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. While it beat analysts’s expectations, it compares to 2019’s second quarter net sales of $629 million, itself a decrease of 8% from a year earlier.
The company touted RVs as the safest way for American families to vacation as the reason for the latest sales trends.
“Increased demand for RVs drove accelerated outdoor recreational products sales, which was well ahead of increasingly bullish expectations as we moved through the early part of the second quarter,” said Jason Lippert, LCI Industries’ president and chief executive officer. “A recent RVIA survey reported that 46 million people intend on taking a trip in an RV in the next 12 months.”
Shares of LCI have almost doubled since March. The company has three buy ratings, two holds and no sells, according to data compiled by Investing.com
Last month, Winnebago Industries (NYSE:WGO) fell after reporting better than expected third-quarter results, which were supported by a surprise increase in motor home sales. But revenue  was down 24% from a year earlier, and gross profit came in at $32 million compared to $87 million for the fiscal 2019 period.  
Winnebago shares are up almost 4% on Wednesday.
Lipper said the company’s “long-term fundamentals are strong, and our sales are being further propelled by the consumer’s desire to find safe, alternative outdoor activities that allow them to spend time with family but also practice social distancing.”

1486,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>","Goldman Sachs leans on trading profits to boost capital, legal reserves","By Anirban Sen and Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc's (N:GS) outsized reliance on trading and investment banking became a big advantage in the second quarter, driving up revenue while avoiding losses due to the coronavirus, but the pop may prove to be fleeting.
The bank's revenue rose 41%, with trading revenue doubling, in line with rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) that reported results earlier in the week.
Unlike those rivals, Goldman's fledgling presence in consumer banking meant it had to set aside much less for expected credit losses. 
The bank had to account for other problems, though, including adding to its regulatory capital and setting aside $945 million for potential legal and regulatory costs. Its quarterly profit rose 2% year-over-year and beat Wall Street’s expectations. 
Analysts characterized the period as felicitous for the Wall Street firm, and investors celebrated its ability to trade through the crisis. Goldman shares were off earlier highs, up 1% at $216.26.
""The quarter couldn't have come at a better time for Goldman Sachs,"" Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr wrote in a note.
It remains to be seen whether Goldman can repeat the performance in subsequent quarters. Other banks have said they expect trading revenue to fall in the coming months. And Goldman, which has been trying to diversify its businesses over the past few years, still has more work to do before they can make up the difference.
The global pandemic that has so far killed 578,718 people and slammed the global economy, isn't helping. (GRAPHIC: https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-MAP/0100B59S39E/index.html)
Chief Executive David Solomon, who took the reins in 2018, has staked his legacy on transforming Goldman into a different kind of bank. He is building out a consumer bank called Marcus and creating new businesses that manage money for corporations and individuals.
Solomon acknowledged on Wednesday that his plan to grow one wealth-management division has gotten tougher because financial advisors cannot meet new clients in person during the pandemic. 
Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr said the bank has also modified its consumer lending strategy due, in part, to the coronavirus recession. But he struck an upbeat note. 
""Our core businesses are performing well, and many of our new initiatives are advancing ahead of plan,"" Scherr said on a conference call. ""We remain confident in our financial position, capital base and liquidity.""
DRAG ON PROFITS 
Goldman earned $2.2 billion, or $6.26 per share, during the second quarter. Analysts had expected the bank to earn just $3.78 per share, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv.
Excluding special items, Goldman might have earned $11.79 per share, Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said.
Within the special items was a $945-million provision for potential legal and regulatory costs. Goldman has been in talks to settle investigations involving its role in a corruption scandal at Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB.
Goldman also set aside $1.6 billion for loans that could potentially go bad, most of which was not related to its consumer business.
Last month, the bank fared poorly on the Federal Reserve’s stress test, forcing it to boost capital levels and stop repurchasing shares. Scherr and Solomon said they were quickly shifting money toward Goldman's balance sheet to satisfy the Fed.
Return-on-equity (ROE), a key measurement of how well banks wring profits from shareholder dollars, was 11.1% in the second quarter. It would have been over 15% if not for the money Goldman had to put toward capital goals and legal reserves, the bank said.
Goldman is aiming to deliver ROE of 13% within the next few years.

1488,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 12:26PM ET</span>","As virus-wary shoppers opt for online purchases, retailers pay the price","By Lisa Baertlein, Melissa Fares and Nivedita Balu
LOS ANGELES(Reuters) - Online sales may be a saving grace for pandemic-battered retailers with fewer shoppers in their stores. But many retailers, from department store chain Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) to essential retailer  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), are grappling with higher expenses related to e-commerce. 
Retailers often use the more lucrative in-store sales to subsidize hefty e-commerce costs, ranging from marketing to fulfillment and shipping. Companies don't usually break out those expenses, which of late have been overshadowed by massive write-downs for unsold inventory and lower online profits. 
Margins for the hardest-hit nonessential retailers - including mall-based clothing chains – on average are this year likely to be about half what they were in 2019, according to credit ratings agency S&P Global. The shift to e-commerce probably erased a couple of percentage points from company margins, Sarah Wyeth, senior director for retail and restaurants said.
When it comes to online sales, ""retailers have always given away too much margin,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail. ""Now that more stores are closed and online penetration is higher, losses have exploded."" Historically, sales in stores accounted for more than 80% of all retail sales in the United States, according to eMarketer. E-commerce as a percentage of retail sales, excluding gas and auto, zoomed to 22.9% in the second quarter after the pandemic accelerated the shift to online shopping, said Andrew Lipsman, principal analyst at that research firm. 
As of mid-July, the spike of COVID-19 infections around the United States has spurred states such as California to shutter indoor shopping malls - further endangering in-person transactions, which are generally lower cost. 
Almost 18% of Macy's stores are in California. 
On July 1, the retail operator, which also owns Bloomingdale's store, said gross margin tumbled to 17.1%, down more than 21 percentage points from a year earlier. 
Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette said the chain was seeing ""a noticeably worse trend in brick-and-mortar"" stores in Texas, Florida and Arizona, where infections are setting new records. 
""Conversely, in those particular states, the dot-com business is improving,"" he said on the heels of posting a staggering $3.58 billion loss for the quarter that ended May 2. 
FAST-FORWARD, TIGHTER SQUEEZE 
RSR Research co-founder Paula Rosenblum estimated that typical online orders cost retailers roughly 10-15% more than purchases in stores, where shoppers do the work of selecting items and transporting them home. Her calculation does not include returns, which are more common with e-commerce purchases because shoppers don't see, touch or try on products beforehand.
While Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and other deep-pocketed companies can spend heavily on projects like automation and inventory tracking to reduce e-commerce expenses ""a lot of companies are on the ropes and can't afford to,"" said Hilding Anderson, senior director of strategy and consulting at Publicis Sapient. 
Target stayed open throughout the early stages of the pandemic, but its gross margin fell 450 basis points in the first quarter, when digital sales surged 141%. The retailer blamed the deterioration on apparel write-downs, a shift to lower profit sales of food and essential items, and rising digital fulfillment and supply chain costs. 
""Our first quarter digital volumes weren't anticipated for another three years ... It was an extreme test of our model and our team,"" Target Chief Operating Officer John Mulligan said on a May 20 conference call. 
Meanwhile, FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) and  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) have a lock on e-commerce delivery, but lost a significant amount of high-margin business when offices shuttered. Those carriers are raising their prices to offset the explosion in higher-cost home deliveries of everything from food to furniture and electronics and exercise equipment. 

""The margin squeeze might go on for a while,"" said Gabriella Santaniello, founder of retail research firm A Line Partners. ""It's going to be really hard to put the genie back in the bottle.""

1491,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 12:00PM ET</span>",Retail Investors Win Big Again With Hedge Funds Playing Catch-Up,"(Bloomberg) -- Yet again, with reports on vaccine progress lifting beaten-down industries Wednesday, retail day traders holding firm to stocks that do best in an economic recovery are looking like the smart money.
A Goldman Sachs basket of shares favored by individual investors surged more than 3%, triple the return of the S&P 500 and roughly seven times that of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, stuffed with companies that do well in a stay-at-home environment. Meanwhile, a similar basket of hedge funds’ top stock picks rose less than 1% as of mid-morning.
A signature narrative of the 2020 stock market has been the role of retail investors and their unwavering enthusiasm for the companies that stand to benefit from an economic reopening. The pros have remained much more skeptical, yet early evidence shows they may be starting to give in.
“You’ve seen very large investors talk about how bearish their outlook was and yet the market kept climbing and climbing and climbing,” said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Wealth Management. “There is a little bit of not only catch-up, but a little bit of trying to get in front of what the next wave may be, which is the cyclical rotation.”
On Monday, in the midst of a 4% bearish reversal for the Nasdaq 100 that ranked with the largest of the dot-com days, hedge funds were selling stay-at-home stocks while scooping up shares that should improve most from a swift economic reopening, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).’s prime brokerage unit.
The firm’s data showed large clients of the firm were net sellers of high priced software stocks, and also shunned “The Big 5” -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT).,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. -- for a sixth day straight. At the same time, among the industries that saw the highest net purchases were hotels, restaurants and leisure stocks. All in all, prime brokerage clients were slight net buyers, driven by short covering in value oriented sectors including industrials and financials.
For now, the timing of the trade has been a boon. Late Tuesday, results published in the New England Journal of Medicine said  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc.’s vaccine candidate produced antibodies to the coronavirus in all patients tested in an initial safety trial. Then early Wednesday, reports that a medical journal will release positive news on a vaccine AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) Plc is developing with University of Oxford researchers also lifted sentiment, reviving the recovery trade that had lost momentum in recent weeks.
Retail’s love affair with airlines and cruise lines had stalled in the last 30 days, with none of the companies showing up on a list of stocks with the highest interest over the last month on the Robinhood investing app, data from website Robintrack.net show. Still, the buying spree in March, April and May was so large that American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL)., Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp., Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd., Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc. are all among the 20 most widely held securities among Robinhood clients.
An analysis of TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) clients in June showed investors continued to increase their exposure to stocks, purchasing shares of companies including Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co., Delta and Norwegian. The infatuation with airlines was also apparent across exchange-traded funds, as the U.S. Global Jets ETF (ticker JETS) took in more than $800 million in the three months ended in June, the best quarter for the fund on record.
“The retail space has been extremely euphoric,” said Candice Bangsund, portfolio manager of global asset allocation at Fiera Capital Corp. “You’ve seen record numbers of brokerage accounts being opened, obviously government payouts keep consumer confidence fairly elevated, people feel wealthy, they’re getting these checks in the mail, and of course the sheer increase in the popularity of day trading while people are stuck at home and social distancing. That’s really taken off. And those flows have largely been directed toward the high-flying names.”

1492,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 11:54AM ET</span>",Hedge Fund That Jumped 40% Picks Winners in Office-Free World,"(Bloomberg) -- Hedge fund manager Said Haidar isn’t counting on a return to his Midtown Manhattan office for two or three years -- a work-from-home new normal that will benefit haven assets and technology stocks.
To Haidar, who’s been ensconced at his Tuxedo Park home office since March, a post-pandemic world means fewer business trips, more video calls and only periodic visits to New York City. There’s value in local debt from Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as well as some Asian technology stocks, he said, while Latin America, home to some of the largest Covid-19 outbreaks over the past month, looks less attractive.
“Tech companies will be beneficiaries,” he said in an interview. “You’ll have these national champions that the Chinese will build up.”
Haidar, 59, helped steer one of the standout portfolios in the first half as many of his peers suffered losses. His $936 million Haidar Jupiter Fund jumped about 40% through the end of June, even after slipping by 9.1% that month, according to a letter to investors seen by Bloomberg. Haidar declined to comment on his fund’s performance.
The hedge fund manager said it’s been surprising to watch the big equity rally over the past few months, even as Covid-19 cases spike. Haidar attributes the biggest gains to what he calls “creative destruction” -- companies and sectors that benefit from people staying home will perform better. He said his fund also has had a positive outlook on precious metals.
It’s unclear how long the recent rally can last. Eventually, central banks will cut back on support, yet that could be a bigger theme next year, according to Haidar. The other big unknown is the U.S. election in November, where the presidency, the House and the Senate are all up for grabs. A sweep by the Democrats may result in a weaker dollar or propel a risk-off mood, he said.
“That’s a big risk factor,” Haidar said.

1493,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 11:54AM ET</span>","Food Inflation Arrives, Adding to the Woes of Ailing Restaurants","(Bloomberg) -- Food inflation has arrived, according to newly released data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And that means slimmer profits for many already-ailing restaurants even as diners pay more for meals.
Full-service restaurant prices rose a record 0.9% in June from a month earlier. At the same time, home cooking grew costlier: Grocery prices rose 0.7% from the prior month and 5.6% from a year ago, the largest increase since 2011.
Overall inflation has remained subdued amid a slower climb in rents.
Restaurants, which just started reopening in many states, are serving fewer customers as they adhere to social-distancing requirements, which is crimping sales. Rising labor costs and difficulties hiring during the pandemic are adding to their woes.
“Currently our labor costs are greater than our sales for lunch Monday through Thursday,” said Geoff Tracy, a Washington, D.C. restaurateur who is cutting back his hours. “You don’t need an MBA to know that model does not work.“
At Taco John’s International Inc., a fast-food chain with about 400 mostly franchised restaurants, employee expenses are putting pressure on menu prices, said Chief Executive Officer Jim Creel.
“I think where we’re going to see a price increase is going to be labor,” Creel said. “It almost feels like it’s going to be worse” coming out of Covid-19.
The Cheyenne, Wyoming-based company is looking to hire roughly 10 workers per restaurant as dining rooms slowly begin to re-open, but it’s tough to find people. Many are reluctant to work around the public and are making enough with unemployment to delay entering the workforce, he said.
“We’ve been trying throughout the whole pandemic to hire crew members and we’re just not having a whole lot of luck,” he said.
As restaurants struggle, some have added Covid-19 surcharges in response to rising food prices and the costs associated with adding personal protective equipment.
The restaurant industry has always been a low margin business and this pandemic has just made it more challenging, said Tracy.
Many restaurants, along with other small businesses, have been bolstered by the Payroll Protection Program and other government stimulus efforts.
“Once the money runs out, once the landlords want their rent come fall -- it’s over for most restaurants,” he said.

As coronavirus infections spike in many states across the country, face masks have become the leading recommendation from health experts and government officials looking to control the pandemic, while reopening the economy.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investors demanded more change at European and Japanese companies in the first half of 2020 while giving U.S. companies a pass, for now, new data from investment bank Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) show.
While U.S. companies have long been activists' favorite targets, they made up only 42% of all campaigns launched in the first six months of the year.
Starboard Value's demands at GCP Applied Technologies (N:GCP) and Elliott Management's push for changes at Evergy (N:EVRG) ranked as major U.S. campaigns in the first half. In total investors launched 42 campaigns and put $9 billon to work. A year earlier, Lazard counted 71 campaigns at U.S. companies where investors put $15 billion to work in the first half.
Europe and Asia, especially Japan, saw more activity, Lazard said, reporting that Europe's share of global campaign activity rose to 28% in the first half.
“U.S. campaigns declined notably in the first half of 2020, driven by ongoing uncertainty about the impact of COVID on corporate balance sheets, operations and performance, and the depth and length of a U.S. recession and recovery,"" said Jim Rossman, who heads shareholder advisory at Lazard.
""Unlike the U.S., campaigns surged in Japan, driven by a growing set of local activists and large U.S. activists who see over-looked opportunities for change, and increased in Europe, particularly in Germany,"" he added.
In Japan, 19 campaigns were launched in the first half, matching the record 19 campaigns seen in all of 2019. U.S. investment firm ValueAct Capital asked that Nintendo (T:7974) transform itself into a broader entertainment company, was a notable campaign.
Activists also appeared to have backed off calls for companies to sell themselves as the coronavirus outbreak made for uncertain times. Lazard reported that only 34% of all campaigns included calls for M&A, down from 47% a year earlier.

1499,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 09:54AM ET</span>",BlackRock Sees Bond ETF Assets Soaring to $2 Trillion by 2024,"(Bloomberg) -- The bond ETF universe could almost double in less than four years as traditional fixed-income heavyweights embrace the funds, according to BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).
Institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance companies are increasingly warming to bond exchange-traded funds in the aftermath of March’s coronavirus-fueled market turmoil, the world’s largest asset manager said in a report Wednesday.
First-time buyers of BlackRock’s iShares fixed-income ETFs collectively added roughly $10 billion of inflows during the first half of 2020, according to the firm. The shift -- at the expense of individual bonds and other fixed-income instruments -- could help swell assets in fixed-income ETFs globally to $2 trillion by 2024 from about $1.3 trillion currently, BlackRock said.
The high trading-volume and price-discovery aspects provided by ETFs during the trials of March solidified their place in institutional portfolios, according to Carolyn Weinberg, iShares global head of product.
“We needed a market event for some of the skeptics or institutions who theorized that they wouldn’t work to show and demonstrate that ETFs are important and critical tools,” she said by phone. “It’s more challenging and likely more costly to find the individual bonds quickly and buy them in a time of market stress.”
Trading froze across bond markets in March as volatility surged, sapping liquidity in an asset class where even in normal times individual securities may not change hands for days. Fixed-income ETFs -- which trade on exchanges and behave like stocks -- acted as an exit route of sorts, with the funds selling off more quickly than their harder-to-unload holdings.
Average daily dollar trading volume in BlackRock’s $57 billion iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF -- the biggest credit ETF -- was 7.5 times greater than that of its five largest bond holdings from February through April. In the $28 billion iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, it was 25 times greater.
Critics have long warned that the liquidity mismatch between bond ETFs and the securities they hold could exacerbate selling pressure and destabilize markets in a meltdown. However, before the Federal Reserve announced on March 23 that it would intervene in credit markets, fixed-income ETFs provided investors with a vehicle to trade corporate bonds as underlying markets seized, according to S&P Global Ratings.
“ETFs are playing an increasing role in providing secondary market liquidity, which was on display during the recent volatility,” S&P Global analysts wrote in a report last week. “Record ETF volumes helped to support liquidity and, importantly, provide price discovery.”
Evidence is mounting that insurance companies are stepping up activity in the space. S&P Dow Jones data show that insurers bought more than $3.4 billion worth of bond ETFs in the first three months of 2020, versus about $600 million worth of equity ETFs. The ETFs were likely easier to access amid the height of the turmoil, according to CFRA Research.
“Insurers found the liquidity of fixed income ETFs appealing relative to accessing the cash bond market, as credit spreads widened amid elevated default risk and bond sellers outweighing buyers in March,” Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA’s head of ETF and mutual fund research, wrote in a report last week.

1500,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 09:36AM ET</span>","Stocks - Wall Street Surges at Opening on Vaccine Hopes, Goldman Beat","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets surged at the opening of trade on Wednesday on growing confidence that a vaccine for the Covid-19 virus will soon be available, and on a blowout quarter from investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 372 points, or 1.4%, at a one-month high of 27,015 points. The S&P 500 was likewise up 1.0% while the Nasdaq Composite was lagging slightly with a gain of 0.5%. 
The biggest gainer of note was  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), whose experimental drug for treating Covid-19 generated positive results in early stage tests on humans, according to a study published in a medical journal late on Tuesday. Moderna stock rose 11.5%. Rival AstraZeneca's (NYSE:AZN) were also up 4.5% after a Business Week article claiming that its joint project with Oxford University was still likelier to produce a workable vaccine first.
Positive news on the fight for a treatment for the coronavirus tends to disproportionately support the old-economy and transportation stocks that have been hit hardest by the pandemic.  Royal Caribbean  Cruises  (NYSE:RCL) stock rose 11.6%,  Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) stock rose 10.5% and Carnival (NYSE:CCL) stock rose 9.2% on bets that the three cruise operators will benefit from the greater peace of mind that a vaccine might bring to customers.
The market was also lifted by fresh data showing a rebound in the U.S. economy in June. Industrial production rose 5.4% on the month, above expectations, while the New York Empire State Manufacturing index also came in above forecasts.
Earlier, Goldman Sachs had posted its second-highest quarterly revenue after its bond and stock traders delivered their best results in over nine years. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) stock rose 3.5% to its highest level since February. Goldman's focus on investment banking means that it's less exposed to the wave of corporate and personal bankruptcies that caused huge write-offs at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) in Tuesday's earnings blitz.
Main street lenders PNC Financial and US Bancorp earlier both reported big increases in provisions in the second quarter and warned of high ongoing uncertainty. However, they too were caught up the broader enthusiasm. PNC (NYSE:PNC) stock rose 1.3%, while US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) stock rose 3.5%.
Elsewhere, UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) stock dropped 0.9% after the company warned that a spike in earnings due to lower claims for discretionary treatments during the pandemic will be reversed when things return to normal. 
Elsewhere, oil and gas stocks got a modest lift as the Crude Oil market took in its stride guidance from the OPEC+ bloc of producers that it will raise supplies by some 2 million barrels a day from next month, as expected.

The COVID-19 pandemic has curtailed dining-in at restaurants across the United States, resulting in a surge in online orders. Chipotle intends to cater to this demand by speeding up plans to add drive-thru lanes at its outlets. 
The company said 60% of its new restaurants will feature a drive-thru, or ""Chipotlane"", where customers can pick-up orders without leaving their cars.
The burrito chain's online sales jumped 80% in the first quarter and demand on the company's app is not expected to fall any time soon, as virus cases spike in many Southern and Western states. 
California, Chipotle's biggest market, rolled back reopening plans on Monday and banned indoor restaurant dining. 
Chipotle's hiring blitz comes as the U.S. unemployment rate hovers in double digits, with data last week showing 32.9 million people collected unemployment checks in the third week of June. 

Other restaurant chains such Domino's Pizza Inc (N:DPZ) and McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) have also said they would hire thousands more workers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The global financial system remains vulnerable to further liquidity stresses and a potential ""sudden and sharp"" market repricing as economies continue to reel from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) warned on Wednesday.
Writing to G20 finance ministers and central bank governors ahead of their virtual meeting on July 18, FSB chair Randal Quarles said global financial markets had responded well to a slew of decisive measures aimed at bolstering system-wide liquidity, but that policymakers could not be complacent. 
""The crisis is far from over and we must not lose sight of the hard work we must do together to support global recovery,"" wrote Quarles, who is also vice chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has taken a raft of measures to keep cheap money flowing and prop up ailing companies. 
The FSB, an international body that coordinates regulation for the Group of 20 major economies, also on Wednesday published a report that assessed COVID-related financial stability developments and outlines necessary response measures.
""While improving market sentiment has lifted risky asset prices, this may not fully reflect the fact that the pandemic continues and the path of recovery remains highly uncertain. As a result, risky assets remain vulnerable to shifts in the economic outlook,"" the report says. 
The group noted that high levels of corporate debt have grown as companies have borrowed more to navigate the crisis, raising solvency concerns for some borrowers. And while lending to the real economy has generally continued, banks ""face a challenging combination of deteriorating credit quality and rising credit demand,"" it said. 
The FSB added that it supported measures, taken by the Fed and European regulators, to allow banks to eat into their excess liquidity buffers to continue lending and that supervisors have agreed that banks will be given sufficient time to restore them.

1503,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>","Delta takes $3 billion charge on buyouts, American Airlines workers brace for furlough warnings","By Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) said on Wednesday it would record charges of up to $3 billion in the current quarter for buyout packages aimed at reducing costs while avoiding involuntary furloughs in the fall.
U.S. airlines are grappling with overstaffing as the coronavirus pandemic crushes air travel demand, but the terms of a $25 billion payroll stimulus package awarded by Congress in March ban them from forcing job reductions before October.
That has spurred a round of voluntary offers from large carriers and warnings that an industry recovery will be slow, forcing them to downsize.
American Airlines (O:AAL) employees were bracing for furlough warnings this week, people familiar with the matter said on Monday, while United Airlines (O:UAL) has already sent warnings to 36,000 workers, or about 45% of staff.
According to labor rules, airlines must give employees 60 days' notice of potential furloughs. Not everyone who receives a notification will be let go.
Southwest Airlines Chief Executive Gary Kelly (N:LUV) told employees this week that passenger numbers would need to triple by the end of the year to prevent job cuts. Any furloughs would be the first in the low-cost airline's history.
Southwest, like Delta, has offered cash in its early retirement packages, which also include health and travel benefits.
By encouraging more senior workers to depart, U.S. airlines could trim their labor costs - their main expense - during the recovery, giving them more pricing power. Airline union contracts require airlines to furlough junior workers first.
About 17,000 workers at Delta, which had more than 91,000 employees in 2019, opted for buyouts and over 45,000 are taking varying short-term unpaid leaves.
The deadline for Southwest and United employees to accept voluntary departure packages is Wednesday. American is expected to roll out packages for its employees when it sends furlough notifications this week.

One alert stems from the widest spread since 2004 between the Cboe NDX Volatility Index, a measure of implied equity swings for the Nasdaq-100, and the counterpart so-called “fear gauge” for the S&P 500. Another comes from unusual simultaneous gains in the technology index and the NDX recently.
This kind of pronounced shift in the relationship between the two volatility indexes tends to correspond with absolute and relative underperformance of the Nasdaq 100, particularly over three months, according to Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG LLC.
The surge in megacap technology firms led the stimulus-fueled U.S. equity rally from March’s lows, a climb that weathered lingering concerns about the longer term economic impact of rising Covid-19 cases. The Nasdaq-100 is up 22% so far this year, while the S&P 500 is still down 1%, and the question now is whether technology stocks will maintain their leadership.
At one point on July 13, the Nasdaq-100 was up 1% while the Cboe NDX Volatility Index climbed 8% -- a situation which had never happened before, according to Jason Goepfert, president of Sundial Capital Research Inc.
The fact that options traders are pricing in higher volatility despite record highs for the Nasdaq is among reasons for “caution,” Goepfert wrote in a note, as is the reversal that eventually left the technology measure in the red on Monday.
Tallbacken Capital Advisors LLC Chief Executive Officer Michael Purves recommends hedges using put options on the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund following the recent gains in the sector.
Investors may be guilty of “near-term complacency” ahead of the second-quarter earnings seasons, Purves wrote in a note.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set open higher Wednesday, boosted by positive news about a potential Covid-19 vaccine as well as strong earnings from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
At 8 AM ET (1200 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 42 points, or 1.3%, higher, and Nasdaq Futures up 65 points, or 0.6%. The Dow Futures contract rose 517 points, or 2%, trying to extend a three-day winning streak.
U.S. biotech firm  Moderna  's  (NASDAQ:MRNA) experimental Covid-19 vaccine was declared safe and generated “robust” immune responses in all 45 volunteers taking part in a study, according to early-stage human trial results published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Tuesday.
The vaccine ""is more than a show stopper. It's the ultimate recession stopper,"" said Stephen Innes, markets strategist at AxiCorp.
Travel stocks have bounced strongly as hopes of a prompt vaccine delivery brings the idea of normalcy closer.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), Carnival (NYSE:CUK),  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Cruises and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) all posted gains of over 8%.
This optimism has overshadowed lingering Sino-U.S. tensions, with U.S. President Donald Trump signing - as expected - an order to end preferential economic treatment for Hong Kong. Confidence that the U.S.-China trade deal won't break down completely was bolstered on Tuesday by news of China's biggest ever purchase of U.S. corn.
In earnings news, Goldman Sachs stunned the market with its best trading results in years. Revenue was up 41% more than a year ago and the firm’s second highest quarterly revenue ever, with investment banking revenue a record $2.66 billion. Its stock rose 4% in premarket trade.
The bank set aside $1.59 billion for potential credit losses due to the coronavirus, a big figure but one that pales alongside the combined $28 billion rival banks JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) had set aside Tuesday. 
There’s a lot of U.S. economic data later Wednesday, with industrial production and manufacturing output due at 9:15 AM ET. That’ll come after weekly data on mortgage applications at 7 AM and the New York Empire State manufacturing index at 8:30 AM.
Oil prices pushed higher Wednesday, helped by a sharp fall in U.S. crude inventories of 8.3 million barrels, according to data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute. Official numbers from the Energy Information Administration are due later Wednesday.
The main focus of attention will be a meeting of OPEC’s technical staff, which is set to advise on whether the cartel and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, should extend output cuts of 9.7 million barrels per day that end in July or ease them to 7.7 million barrels per day.

Goldman announced earnings per share of $6.26 on revenue of $13.30 billion, the second-highest quarterly revenue it has ever posted. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of only $3.9 on revenue of $9.7 billion. The potential for an upside surprise had been evident after two of Goldman's biggest rivals, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), both posted blowout quarters for fixed-income trading on Tuesday. 
Goldman said its fixed-income division posted its best quarterly revenue in nine years at $4.24 billion, while equities trading generated $2.94 billion, the highest in 11 years. Group revenue was up 41% from a year earlier. However, earnings were lower because of a $945 million litigation cost.
Compared to JPMorgan and Citi, Goldman has a relatively small book of corporate loans at risk from the wave of bankruptcies caused by the pandemic. It still recorded provisions against possible loan losses of $1.59 billion, up from $214 million a year earlier and $937 million in the first quarter. 
Traditional retail and commercial lenders are finding things tougher, however.  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) on Tuesday swung to its first quarterly loss in nearly a decade, thanks to over $8 billion of provisions.
On Wednesday, PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) had reported it swung to an underlying net loss of $744 million after taking $2.7 billion in charges for actual or potential loan losses. The bank’s net interest margin also fell 32 basis points to 2.52% due to the Federal Reserve’s series of interest rate cuts at the start of the pandemic.
PNC’s bottom line looked a lot healthier due to a $4.4 billion gain on the sale of its stake in asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) during the quarter.
US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) likewise said its net profit fell some 62% on the year to $689 million owing to a $1.74 billion provision for bad loans. Charge-offs rose to $437 million.
Goldman Sachs's report follows an earnings beat by JPMorgan on Tuesday, who reported EPS of $1.38 on revenue of $33.82 billion, compared to forecasts for EPS of $1.19 on revenue of $30.41 billion.
UnitedHealth had beaten expectations on Wednesday with second quarter EPS of $7.12 on revenue of $62.14B, compared to forecast for EPS of $5.18 on revenue of $63.34B.

(Reuters) -  Moderna  Inc's (O:MRNA) shares rose 17% on Wednesday after a small-scale study showed its experimental COVID-19 vaccine produced high levels of virus-killing antibodies, bolstering hopes the shot could prove effective in later stages of testing. 
Wall Street analysts said data from 45 healthy trial volunteers suggested the vaccine could protect against the virus infection, and generate blockbuster sales if it proves to work in larger trials. 
The early-stage trial data, however, is not a definite conclusion the shot could work in humans. 
""Assuming a price of $50-100 per vaccine could equate to revenues of $12.5 billion to $25 billion,"" said Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) analyst Edward Tenthoff. 
No serious side effects were reported in the ongoing study, but more than half of the volunteers reported mild or moderate reactions such as fatigue, headache, chills, muscle aches or pain at the injection site.
""It is difficult to know how this will ultimately translate to clinical outcomes, but we find these results to be encouraging on the surface,"" said J.P. Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov.
Moderna was among the first drugmakers to start testing a coronavirus vaccine in humans, and is due to start late-stage trials later this month. 
Data from potential vaccine candidates has swayed the broader market and U.S. stock futures were higher on Wednesday.
Moderna's shares were up 17.3% at $88 before the opening bell. 
It expects to deliver about 500 million doses a year, and possibly, up to $1 billion doses per year starting in 2021. 
The vaccine, mRNA-1273, uses a technology that has not yet yielded an approved product till date. Other drugmakers such as AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN) and BioNTech <2UAy.F> are also racing to get a viable and safe vaccine on the market.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Quarterly profits at Handelsbanken (ST:SHBa) and SEB (ST:SEBa) fell less than expected as the Swedish banks coped with the economic hit from the COVID-19 pandemic, although SEB saw a spike in provisions for bad loans. 
Nordic banks are the first in Europe to report second quarter earnings and so far have defied gloomy predictions, with Norway's DNB also topping forecasts.
""The bank's credit quality remains good,"" Handelsbanken said on Wednesday, adding loan losses in the quarter were the lowest in years. ""Household lending, household deposits and corporate deposits continued to exhibit stable growth."" 
Its second-quarter net profit fell to 3.96 billion crowns ($436 million) from 4.22 billion a year earlier, beating analysts' mean forecast of 3.34 billion.
SEB's net profit also fell less than expected, as income from its trading arm offset credit loss provisions and a fine for inadequate money laundering controls.
Net profit at SEB, Sweden's top corporate bank, fell to 3.5 billion crowns from 4.9 billion a year earlier, but beat analysts' mean forecast of 3.2 billion.
SEB said it would not appeal against a 1 billion crown fine from Sweden's financial regulator for failures in anti-money laundering controls in the Baltics, though it added it did not agree with parts of the watchdog's decision.
SEB's CEO Johan Torgeby said on a conference call that the bank was not, as far as he knew, under investigation in the United States, in relation to the Baltic ""dirty money"" scandal which has rocked rivals  Swedbank  (ST:SWEDa) and Danish lender  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE). Swedbank and Danske Bank are under scrutiny from U.S. authorities.
SEB's interest income, which includes income from mortgages, increased 6% to 6.05 billion crowns.
CREDIT AND THE CORONAVIRUS 
Analysts are generally expecting banks to see a jump in bad loans as the pandemic plunges economies into recession.
Loan losses for Handelsbanken were 97 million crowns, better than 435 million a year earlier and much lower than the 1.02 billion loss projected by analysts.
""This credit positive result provides a strong indication that Handelsbanken will continue to demonstrate the strength of its asset quality during this downturn,"" said Louise Lundberg, a senior risk officer at rating agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO).
The losses were ""significantly lower than most Nordic and European peers and reflective of the bank’s track record"", she added. 
SEB, however, saw loan losses surge to 2.7 billion crowns from 386 million a year ago, worse than analysts' mean forecast of 1.7 billion.
CEO Johan Torgeby said SEB was sticking with its forecast for credit losses of 6 billion crowns this year, nearly triple the level for 2019. 
Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Robin Rane said he did not expect investors to buy into SEB as its performance was driven by its trading arm, ""which was a given due to strong market conditions"". 
Rane added that although Handelsbanken's low credit losses stood out, performance in other parts of the core business was relatively weak.
Handelsbanken shares were down 1.6% and SEB's were 2% lower as of 1107 GMT. 

Handelsbanken's net interest income, which includes income from mortgages, fell 5% to 7.6 billion crowns, missing analysts' forecast of 8.2 billion.

1510,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 07:16AM ET</span>",Special Report: Drug cartel ‘narco-antennas’ make life dangerous for Mexico’s cell tower repairmen,"By Julia Love
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The young technician shut off the electricity at a cellular tower in rural Mexico to begin some routine maintenance.
Within 10 minutes, he had company: three armed men dressed in fatigues emblazoned with the logo of a major drug cartel.
The traffickers had a particular interest in that tower, owned by Boston-based American Tower Corp (N:AMT), which rents space to carriers on its thousands of cellular sites in Mexico. The cartel had installed its own antennas on the structure to support their two-way radios, but the contractor had unwittingly blacked out the shadowy network. 
The visitors let him off with a warning.
""I was so nervous... Seeing them armed in front of you, you don't know how to react,"" the worker told Reuters, recalling the 2018 encounter. ""Little by little, you learn how to coexist with them, how to address them, how to make them see that you don't represent a threat.""
The contractor had disrupted a small link in a vast criminal network that spans much of Mexico. In addition to high-end encrypted cell phones and popular messaging apps, traffickers still rely heavily on two-way radios like the ones police and firefighters use to coordinate their teams on the ground, six law enforcement experts on both sides of the border told Reuters.
Traffickers often erect their own radio antennas in rural areas. They also install so-called parasite antennas on existing cell towers, layering their criminal communications network on top of the official one. By piggybacking on telecom companies' infrastructure, cartels save money and evade detection since their own towers are more easily spotted and torn down, law enforcement experts said.
The practice has been widely acknowledged by telecom companies and Mexican officials for years. The problem persists because the government has made inconsistent efforts to take it on, and because companies have little recourse to stop it, experts on law enforcement and Mexican society said.
""There is a sense of powerlessness"" in Mexico, said Duncan Wood, director of the Wilson Center’s Mexico Institute in Washington. He said companies feel they ""cannot respond to issues like this because (they) are afraid of the consequences from groups that essentially enjoy impunity.""
Mexico's Defense Ministry said it provides security for federal agencies that request its help in dismantling ""parasitic equipment"" installed by cartels on cell towers.
The nation's Attorney General's office did not respond to a request for comment about criminal activity at these sites. The Federal Telecommunications Institute, Mexico's telecom and broadcasting regulator, said its compliance unit had not received reports of parasite antennas from any companies under its jurisdiction. 
Reuters has provided the first in-depth account of how traffickers exploit Mexico's telecom infrastructure and the toll it takes on workers. The news organization interviewed 14 current and former telecom workers about the interactions that they and their colleagues have had with criminal groups at cell towers.
Twelve of them said they had seen parasite antennas on towers belonging to  Telesites SAB de CV  (MX:SITESB1), a tower rental company in which the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim is a major shareholder; as well as American Tower, U.S. carrier AT&T Corp, Spain's  Telefonica  SA (MC:TEF) and Mexico's Axtel SAB de CV (MX:AXTELCPO). 
Reuters is omitting the technicians' names, details of where they work and most names of cartels they encounter for the workers' protection. Two technicians shared texts they exchanged with colleagues regarding on-the-job run-ins with organized crime at the cell towers, and one of them shared a photo of an illicit device he discovered in the course of his work. The incidents the 12 workers recounted occurred between 2015 and 2020 in several Mexican states.
Most of the technicians said they encounter the devices, known colloquially as narco-antennas, just a few times a year. But one engineer who spoke with Reuters estimated that parasite antennas are present on roughly 20% of towers where his firm works, while another said about 30% of his sites had them when local criminals were particularly active in his area in 2018.
Their No. 1 rule when discovering cartel equipment on a tower is simple: Don't touch it.
Dealing with gangsters in person is trickier, they said, requiring diplomacy and a cool head. Some said their interactions have been cordial, bordering on friendly. Others said they have been threatened, detained and at times fearful for their lives.
The traffickers ""convey their superiority, ...it's like when someone wants to mark their territory,"" one technician said. ""I can't get nervous because they pick up on when someone is secure and when someone is very afraid.""
'SECURITY' PAYMENTS
Cartels and other criminal groups sometimes demand telecom workers pay ""security payments"" or ""quotas"" in order to perform maintenance on towers and other tasks, according to five contract laborers who have worked on projects involving  America Movil  (NYSE:AMX) SAB de CV (MX:AMXL), Slim's telecommunications firm, as well as American Tower and AT&T.
These people said the best strategy is to be polite, stay calm and pay up immediately. Those costs get passed along to their employers; laborers for subcontractors said their firms often charge the big telecom companies higher rates for working in dicey areas.
A spokesman for America Movil and Telesites declined to comment. Axtel, which sold some of its telecom towers in 2017, said it had not received any reports of incidents on its remaining infrastructure. AT&T said that ""under no circumstances"" does it ""tolerate or authorize payments outside of those established by law.""
An American Tower spokesman said ""we have not received any credible reports"" of parasite antennas or other cartel activities at the company's Mexican sites. He said the firm alerts local authorities immediately if a site is vandalized, and that ""the safety of those who work on our towers, as well as the towers' continued secure operation, are our top priorities.""
Guillermo Ramos, Telefonica's director of security in Mexico, said the company has not received any reports of parasite antennas over at least the past year.
Narco-antennas are just one aspect of telecom companies' headaches in Mexico. Criminals raid their infrastructure for batteries and copper cables to resell on the black market, executives in the sector told Reuters.
Stories like this are unfolding in industries across Mexico as criminal groups branch out far beyond drugs. Cartels have siphoned millions of dollars' worth of fuel from Mexican state oil company Petróleos Mexicanos or Pemex in recent years; they steal cargo and pilfer lumber. The tentacles of organized crime extend even into Mexico's avocado growing regions, where gangs extort farmers and hijack loads of the green fruit. 
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office in 2018 advocating a softer approach to his predecessors' war on drugs with the motto ""hugs, not bullets."" The cartels' encroachment on legitimate businesses did not start on his watch. But the change in strategy has left companies with nowhere to turn, said Mike Vigil, a former chief of international operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
""Lopez Obrador has sent a message to all of Mexico, including the private sector... that he doesn't want a confrontational situation with the cartels,"" Vigil said. ""Telecom companies are caught between a rock and a hard spot.""
Lopez Obrador's office did not respond to requests for comment. The president previously has insisted that Mexico must tackle poverty and other factors that drive crime, in addition to using law enforcement.
""We must continue confronting organized crime... There is no longer protection for anyone, as there was before,"" Lopez Obrador said in early June. ""We are committed to achieving peace and we have made progress in combating, in reducing, crime.""
AN OLD-SCHOOL TOOL
Radios are an indispensable tool for cartels and part of their lore. One classic narco-ballad or ""corrido"" celebrating the notorious Zetas syndicate depicts members speaking over their two-way handsets.
When it comes to communicating in real-time with large groups, radio is tough to beat. These networks are often encrypted and, unlike cellular networks, the location of someone using a radio can't easily be pinpointed, said Paul Craine, a former director of the DEA's operations in Mexico and Central America.
A vast web of antennas is necessary to power those networks, and Mexico's thousands of cellular towers, many tucked away in rural areas, provide ready-made places to install them. Craine said he consistently observed cartels latching onto cellular towers while working in Mexico from 2012 to 2018.
To a trained eye, cartel equipment sticks out like a sore thumb. At the foot of the tower, criminals place a base station, which generates the radio waves, often tucked into a suitcase or picnic cooler for protection from the sun, according to Craine and the technicians who spoke with Reuters. Higher up they install parasite antennas to project the signal.
Gangs typically don't bother with camouflage. The Zetas are particularly brash, Craine said. He recalled seeing coolers emblazoned with their logo: the letter Z. A former engineer for Huawei Technologies Co, the Chinese telecom vendor, told Reuters that one of the workers he supervised sent him a photo of a device on a Telesites tower in early 2018 with a sign that read: ""This antenna belongs to the Zetas. If any problems arise, please call…,"" followed by a phone number.
Cesar Funes, a vice president of institutional relations for Huawei in Latin America, said he had not received any reports of parasite antennas. Telesites declined to comment.
The equipment persists on companies' networks, industry executives and law enforcement experts said, due to the difficulty of rooting out the devices across far-flung towers, and the risks that removal might pose to engineers in the field, many of whom don't report them out of fear.
Telecom companies quietly have acknowledged the cartels' presence in meetings with Mexican government officials. Gerardo Sanchez Henkel, a former director of compliance for telecom regulator IFT, told Reuters he discussed the issue of parasite antennas regularly in meetings with companies before leaving government in late 2015.
The IFT said it did not know whether Sanchez Henkel had discussed the issue with companies during his time in government. 
Marco Galvan, who was a senior director for telecom trade group GSMA in Mexico until February, said companies often lamented theft and the presence of unauthorized devices on their towers.
""It was an issue that was frequently cited by all the operators as something that inhibited investment,"" he said.
The National Association of Telecommunications (ANATEL), a trade group representing players including America Movil, AT&T and Telefonica, said companies it surveyed reported 62 parasite antennas from 2017 through mid-2018, the most current data available. Nearly 3,000 batteries were stolen from cell towers over the same period, it said.
ANATEL CEO Gabriel Szekely said he had no more information to provide on the phenomenon. He told the Mexican newspaper Reforma in 2018 it was clear that criminal groups were capitalizing on what companies had built.
""Suddenly you find devices that are not yours, they belong to organized crime,"" Szekely told Reforma. ""And there are places where they do not even let you in to maintain your own facilities.""
'GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT'
In the worst criminal hot spots, maintaining towers often comes at a price.
The five telecom workers who told Reuters that they or their colleagues had been forced to pay up said those encounters typically involved groups of armed men confronting them at the towers. The workers are sometimes unsure of exactly who they are dealing with. In some parts of rural Mexico, self-defense organizations have emerged to fill the vacuum left by the state, with these vigilantes often running elaborate extortion schemes to fund their operations, security analysts said.
Two people who work for an AT&T subcontractor said there are a number of towers where they routinely pay 500 to 1,000 pesos ($22.34 to $44.67) any day they want to perform maintenance. One of the people estimated the number of towers at 11. 
Reuters could not independently confirm those payments. 
Sometimes the demands are larger. In 2017, a group demanded a payment of about $1,000 from subcontractors working on a large project for America Movil involving multiple towers, according to an engineer who was involved. The criminals called a representative of Huawei, which was overseeing the job, to escalate the threat, the person said.
The engineer said the criminal group was courteous throughout the negotiations, addressing workers as ""usted,"" a Spanish pronoun that conveys respect. The telecom crew had no trouble after they paid.
""It was a gentleman's agreement,"" the engineer said.
America Movil declined to comment. Reuters could not independently confirm the payment.
That worker said Huawei pays subcontractors more to work in high-risk areas, which enabled the crew to recover what it paid. He showed Reuters a copy of a contract that included an ""allowance for site in dangerous city."" Two other subcontractors told Reuters that allowance has helped them cover the cost of extortion payments. 
Funes, the Huawei executive, denied the company pays criminal groups for access to its sites, and said Huawei does not permit subcontractors to do so either. He said the company sometimes pays higher rates in smaller markets where it is more difficult to find engineers. 
A spokesman for Huawei said the company could not comment on specific allowances, citing the confidentiality of its contracts with suppliers and employees. 
""We will never pay anything that is (beyond) the scope of the contract,"" Funes said.
RULES FOR SURVIVAL
Technicians who work in dangerous parts of Mexico say making nice with drug traffickers is a crucial part of the job.
One subcontractor said traffickers stick close to his crews to ensure workers don't touch cartel antennas, and to be certain they are not enemies who have come to spy on them.
""You work with a narco-escort,"" the subcontractor said.
Cartels have kidnapped technicians doing maintenance on cellular towers to make them fix their networks, people working in the sector said. The technicians usually are released after a few days, if not sooner. Still, those who spoke with Reuters said they live in fear of being forced by traffickers to do such work, lest they be killed for knowing too much, or become targets of authorities or rival criminal groups for being complicit. Whenever possible, they said, they downplay their expertise.
After traumatic run-ins with cartels, some technicians refuse to go into the field or have left the industry entirely, people working in the sector said.
One subcontractor estimated that 10 workers, primarily new recruits, quit his company over the past year due to security concerns.
Even old hands can run into trouble. In 2016, a technician working for an America Movil supplier learned his colleagues had been turned away from a site in a cartel stronghold.
Determined to finish the job, the engineer headed to the tower alone. He was quickly surrounded by five men armed with long guns and dressed in clothing bearing the cartel's initials. They forced him into their vehicle and took him to a house in town, where their boss was waiting.
The engineer said he reverted to his security training, resolving not to show fear. When the cartel boss complained that his antennas had been failing, the captive seized an opening.
""It's in all our interest that the tower is working,"" he recalls saying. ""Just let us work, and we won't interfere with your equipment… On the contrary, we'll check it for you.""
The cartel agreed, driving the engineer back to the tower. He said he re-established service at the tower and made a perfunctory check of the illicit antennas. He tried to head off any requests for additional help, saying he was a supervisor whose technical skills were rusty.
Throughout the encounter, the engineer maintained his composure. But when he returned to his hotel room that evening, he said his body shook with such force that he thought he might be having a breakdown.
""In the moment, I was fine, I just trusted in God,"" he said. ""My nerves got me afterwards.""
The young technician who accidentally disrupted a cartel's communications at an American Tower site told Reuters he knows the risk he's taking. But he said he has a family to support and earns a premium for working in a territory that many peers wouldn't touch.
After a few years working the area, he said he has established a rapport with gang members, who often let him pass to the job site with little more than a wave hello.

He has learned from his early mistake. Now, before he cuts the power, he first connects any parasite antennas to a generator to ensure the cartel's network keeps humming.

1514,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>",South African e-commerce is a COVID-fired market of risk and reward,"By Nqobile Dludla
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Like many of her compatriots, Kubashnee Moodley made her first foray into online shopping during South Africa's coronavirus lockdown. She is not a satisfied customer.
The 42-year-old business management coach was once charged for a parcel she never received and also had groceries delivered to her Johannesburg home after dark. ""I was not going to risk going to the gate ... especially with crime so high,"" she said.
Moodley's experience encapsulates the challenging situation facing the e-commerce sector in Africa's most advanced economy.
Having long lagged behind much of the world in terms of e-commerce, South African retailers and delivery start-ups have been doing a roaring trade online as consumers shy away from shops during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the likes of Pick n Pay (J:PIKJ), Checkers and OneDayOnly experiencing an explosion in demand.
But this post-COVID boom is straining the capacity of even the largest retailers, leaving some customers complaining of long wait times and poor service.
The ability to alleviate those growing pains will dictate which companies emerge as e-commerce leaders and which will be left behind.
Factors such as fear of parcel theft, online fraud and high mobile data costs have long hindered South African e-commerce growth, experts say.
Global e-commerce leviathan Amazon (O:AMZN) does not operate in the economy of 58 million consumers, partly because of the cost and challenges of setting up the required infrastructure, analysts say. And African giant Jumia <4JMAy.DE> (N:JMIA) only launched in South Africa this year.
Amazon, the vast majority of whose customers have to rely on cross-border shopping at its 16 websites around the world, declined to comment.
ONLINE LAGGARD
E-commerce accounted for only 1.6%, or $1.2 billion, of South African retail sales in 2019, according to London-based market research firm Euromonitor International. In the United States, the figure is 14.8%. Even Kenya shops more online than its larger neighbour.
However, Euromonitor expects sales to double this year while Nielsen South Africa's retail lead analyst Gareth Paterson predicts up to 200% growth in online food purchases.
A survey conducted by Visa (NYSE:V) found that 64% of consumers in South Africa bought groceries online for the first time because of the coronavirus outbreak and that 53% made their first online purchase from a pharmacy.
When lockdown restrictions imposed in late March were loosened in May, market researcher Urban Studies found that only 50-70% of customers returned to shopping centres.
""This was the quantum shift,"" said Anthony Thunstrom, chief executive of clothing and homeware retailer TFG (J:TFGJ). ""We probably advanced two to three years in terms of online demand because of COVID-19.""
Nikki Lincoln, a 34-year-old communications specialist, thought shopping online would spare her the ""unnecessary risk"" of going out during the pandemic.
""Woolworths has closed off online deliveries for my area, so I can't shop there at all. And Pick n Pay has such a long waiting time you might as well just go to the shop,"" she said, naming two of South Africa's leading supermarket chains.
CAPACITY BOOST
Woolworths (J:WHLJ) said that home delivery suspensions were temporary, resulting from an employee testing positive for the virus, but acknowledged that increased demand had caused delays.
In April it launched a drive-through click-and-collect service, boosting its online capacity by 50%.
When the lockdown began, Pick n Pay partnered with Bottles, an alcohol delivery app that expanded into groceries with the promise of same-day service.
""Our enhancements last year to create a stronger online operation ... enabled us to expand our offer in response to the demand for online shopping. Our team rapidly increased its capacity and reach and met the needs of many new customers,"" Jessica Knight, head of online at Pick n Pay, said without commenting specifically on delays.
Sixty60 - a grocery delivery app run by Shoprite's (J:SHPJ) Checkers supermarkets - backed away from hourly dispatching, opting instead for same-day delivery. It is now expanding its delivery area weekly.
Companies hoping to compete, therefore, are quickly pumping money into their e-commerce offerings even as they feel the pain of a pandemic-induced economic downturn.
Grocery delivery business Zulzi was forced to limit trading to two hours a day for two weeks after shoppers overwhelmed its app, but it has since quadrupled the number of shoppers and drivers it employs and doubled its customer care staff.
It is now processing 2,000 orders a day - five times 2019 levels - and has done a year's worth of turnover in the past two months.
TFG, the brands of which include @home, Foschini and Markham, plans to raise 3.95 billion rand ($234.2 million) this month, partly to bolster its e-commerce business.

1516,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>",Gaps in Canadian surveillance technology spark concerns about traders working from home,"By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - The shift to Canadian traders working from home is putting the systems used to monitor their activity to the test, with some experts saying the technology needs to be more robust to secure against unauthorized activity or possible insider trading.
The Bank of Canada warned in May the move to remote work could leave financial institutions more exposed to operational vulnerabilities, including increased challenges to trade surveillance from changing trading patterns. The central bank declined to comment for this story.
So far, banks and the trading regulator have not significantly changed their surveillance systems, and little suspicious activity has come to light since most traders began working remotely in March.
But some warn of risks.
""More time is needed to detect any issues or malfeasance with work from home,"" said Marius Zoican, assistant professor of finance at the University of Toronto. The trading volatility seen at some points during the crisis, combined with a surge in retail trading, adds ""noise to any 'signal' regulators might be looking for."" The risks are higher for less-heavily-scrutinized securities like fixed income and other over-the-counter trading, according to Richard Carleton, chief executive of the Canadian Securities Exchange, which only hosts equities.
""Banks' technology is sufficient to do trading, order reception, order execution"" remotely, Zoican said.
But without the added security of trading-floor cameras and on-site supervisors, there are gaps with remote trading, he said. Exemptions offered by the regulator, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC), including relief from in-person audits, identity checks and reporting deadlines, could also delay detection.
The technology could fall short in areas including determining whether a particular trader is the one carrying out trades, and instances of insider trading, Zoican said.
Surveillance systems should include key-stroke recording, and firms' proprietary information should exist solely on the cloud, said Chris Ford, Canada chief executive of financial services-focused management consultancy Capco.
IIROC hopes the changes wrought by the pandemic will ""yield lessons"" for the future, but such discussion is premature, a spokeswoman said, indicating changes are not on the horizon. Commercial banks have also maintained their systems.
""The physical presence of a supervisor on the trading floor has now been replaced by a person ... working with teams on a regular basis remotely,"" said David Barrons, head of trading business management at Toronto-Dominion Bank.
""All the other surveillance that we've done before has not changed.""
CRACKS
Royal Bank of Canada, the nation's biggest bank, has deployed secure laptops with surveillance technology and communication equipment, said Bruce Ross, group head of technology and operations at the lender. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said its trading teams are supported by ""sophisticated trade surveillance technology and the expertise of our compliance teams."" Nasdaq's surveillance software, which IIROC uses, functions the same when traders work from home as on trading floors, a spokesman said.
But the technology does not record keystrokes or activity off the software, he said.
Bank of Nova Scotia declined to comment. Bank of Montreal did not respond to a request for comment.
Former IIROC executive Wendy Rudd, now on the board of industry group Canadian Regulatory Technology Association (CRTA), said while technology exists to bridge the gaps, smaller firms may not know of it, and legacy systems could hinder adoption at larger companies.
""The shift has been so quick, the regulatory and compliance sides have had to evolve on the fly,"" said Bryden Teich, portfolio manager at Avenue Investment Management, which executes trades through one of the major banks.
""Will stuff fall through the cracks? Yes. But it's a heavily regulated industry and there are things in place to safeguard the system.""
The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), which oversees IIROC, will introduce a post-trade market analysis platform this fall complementing IIROC's live surveillance technology. Replacing its current system, it will ""provide increased efficiency in the analysis and investigation stages by automating several processes,"" a CSA spokeswoman said.
But it will initially only cover equities trading.
While IIROC requires firms using its relief measures to have alternatives, it lets them determine what those are.
""Canadian regulators are not that prescriptive,"" said CRTA co-founder Donna Bales.
""If they were, you can have machine-readable rules,"" she added. ""There are movements within some of the other global regulators to move toward more prescriptive rules in machine-readable format.""

1519,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Italy Keeps the Show on the Road With Atlantia Solution,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The saga over  Atlantia  SpA (MI:ATL), the company whose shoddy maintenance of Italy’s highways led to the fatal collapse of a bridge in Genoa two years ago, appears to be drawing to a close, and while it isn’t a full-blown happy ending for the current generation of shareholders, it does at least avoid the worst-case scenario.
Atlantia stock rose over 20% in Milan by mid-morning on Wednesday after the announcement that a consortium led by state-owned bank CDP will buy a majority stake in Autostrade, the Atlantia unit that runs the relevant concession.
According to Reuters, a second phase will see Autostrade spun off from the group and listed, although Atlantia shareholders will receive shares in the new company. They will be heavily diluted, but not expropriated. 
Emotional arguments over the justice of that solution aside, the immediate consequence of this is that Atlantia will not collapse under the weight of its debts, which need the cash flows of Autostrade to service them.
More importantly for Italian assets broadly, it signals that the Italian model, in which the state rewards a small number of private players for taking vast and often unfunded liabilities off its balance sheet, is still intact - if only because the country still hasn't found any better alternative. The one certainty out of the solution announced on Wednesday is that the debts of Autostrade, and the implicit financing needs of the country’s road arteries for the next decades, are kept out of the public accounts, allowing Italy to preserve the appearance of state solvency for longer.
The need for such creativity has been accentuated by the current debate over the EU’s new recovery fund, which signals a groundbreaking expansion of direct grants to individual member states.
Italy is poised to be one of the biggest recipients of such grants, but the negotiations are being held up by Dutch, Austrian and Scandinavian objections to pouring money into what they see as a bottomless pit. A messy bankruptcy of Autostrade would have made it much harder for the Italian government to persuade its frugal neighbors that it can be trusted to use future grants wisely. 
And so one messy compromise – which allows the Benetton family, Atlantia’s largest shareholder, to continue enjoying profits from a state monopoly – paves the way for another at EU level. That compromise may or may not come at this week’s summit meeting. If the recovery fund can be agreed, then Italy can look forward to a more favorable assessment of its longer-term solvency, which would improve its chances of attracting long-term investment. That state of grace is still only a distant possibility, but – at least for now – the show has been kept on the road."

LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - World shares climbed towards a four-month high on Wednesday with the euro and oil in tow, as hopes for a coronavirus vaccine offset rising tensions between the United States and China.
Asia had a choppy session after more barbs between Beijing and Washington over Hong Kong, but near 1% gains for London (FTSE), Frankfurt (GDAXI), Paris <.FCHE> and Milan (FTMIB) early on and a rise in Wall Street futures blew away any caution.
An experimental vaccine for COVID-19 produced by the U.S. company  Moderna  (O:MRNA) provoked safe immune responses in all 45 healthy volunteers, an early-stage study showed on Tuesday.
Uncertainty remained over how quickly an effective and rapidly available vaccine could be found, said David Miller, investment director at Quilter Cheviot Investment Management, but there was a supportive backdrop for markets.
""This is all against the background of very low interest rates,"" he said. ""What really matters, though, is consumer confidence. I think we are all going to remain fairly wary,"" he said.
Hopes for progress on the European Union's 750 billion-euro COVID recovery fund this week had the euro above $1.1430 (EUR=) for the first time since March. It also pushed down Italy and Spain's bond market borrowing costs. [.EU][/FRX][GVD/EUR]
Overnight, Chinese shares fell 1.3% (CSI300) and Hong Kong (HSI) was flat, after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered an end to Hong Kong's special status under U.S. law to punish China for its ""oppressive actions"" against the former British colony.
That prompted a retaliatory warning from China. Japan's Nikkei (N225) and Australia's benchmark index remained upbeat, though, finishing up 1.6% and 1.9%, respectively. E-mini futures for the S&P 500  were up 0.8%.
China's foreign ministry said Beijing would impose retaliatory sanctions against U.S. individuals and entities in response to a law targeting banks doing business with Chinese officials.
""Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs and no foreign country has the right to interfere,"" the ministry said. 
EURO BOOST
The dollar was on the defensive, particularly against risk-sensitive currencies, following the news of progress in vaccine development. 
The euro (EUR=EBS) rose as high as $1.1445, its strongest since March 10 and not far off its peak so far this year of $1.1495. 
The single currency has been helped by hopes the EU would agree at its summit later this week on a financing package that limited the economic damage from the pandemic.
The yen was little changed at 107.21 per dollar , off a two-week high of 106.635. The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady, as expected, though it warned that uncertainty over the economic outlook was ""extremely high"" due to various risks, including rising coronavirus infections in Tokyo.
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar pared gains to be last up 0.2% at $0.6990 .

Oil prices rose after a drop in U.S. crude inventories and before a OPEC video conference on production plans later in the day. Brent crude (LCOc1) futures were up 24 cents at $43.14 a barrel. U.S. crude (CLc1) futures rose 22 cents to $40.50 a barrel. [O/R]

1521,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 05:30AM ET</span>",UK financial job vacancies shrink by 60% in second quarter: data,"LONDON (Reuters) - The volume of UK financial sector job vacancies dropped by 60% in the quarter to end-June, data on Wednesday showed, as the COVID-19 pandemic inflicted fresh injury to a labour market already reeling from restructuring and Brexit.
The latest Morgan McKinley Spring London Employment Monitor, which details hiring trends across Britain's financial industry, showed the number of job-seekers fell by almost a third in the three month period from April, with available jobs plunging by 72% year-on-year in that month alone.
The latest figures follow a rapid slowdown in hiring seen in March, when the number of available jobs dropped by 38% compared with February.
The early part of the April-June quarter was dominated by government-imposed lockdowns to stem the novel coronavirus outbreak and there were tentative signs of job market activity resuming towards the end of the period.
But financial services, which has historically contributed around 10% of the UK's total economic output and employs 1 in 14 people across Britain, was already in the midst of critical change before the virus outbreak sent the global economy into a tailspin.
Major banks including HSBC (L:HSBA) have now resumed plans to axe jobs after postponing layoffs at the height of the pandemic.
Hakan Enver, Managing Director at Morgan McKinley UK, said some professionals were taking advantage of more relaxed home-working environments to assess career opportunities, particularly after a bounce in the average salary boost by moving from one job to another.
During April, the average salary change plunged to a record low of 6%, after the government lockdown on March 23 crushed productivity and triggered an immediate cost-cutting drive across the sector.
This did jump back up to 22% in May, after workforces had settled into home-working routines and confidence began to rally in line with falls in infection rate and unprecedented government action to support both businesses and consumers.
The average rise in salary of those moving from one job to another ended the quarter at 13%, compared to an average over the last 18 months of 16.9%, Morgan McKinley UK said.
In a further sign of optimism, the number of job vacancies available increased by 72% in June, with employers showing willingness to invest in talent to drive their recovery and future growth.
""The ability to pivot and adapt to major infrastructure change stands as a hopeful mark of survivor potential,"" Envers said. 

""This will not likely be possible without finding and retaining talent. Companies with an eye on strategic goals in these areas may want to take advantage of a buyer's market.""

1522,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 05:09AM ET</span>",Markets Walk Dangerous Tightrope Before U.S. Stimulus Expires,"(Bloomberg) -- The remarkable rebound in U.S. equities from the depths of the Covid-19 crisis in March faces a fresh test in coming weeks, with the American economy set for a withdrawal of a key stimulus support.
The average unemployment benefit for Americans put out of work will tumble by more than 60% at the end of July, hobbling the incomes of millions of laid off workers -- many of whom may not be able to return to their jobs given the renewed shutdowns now affecting swathes of the economy from California to Florida.
Stocks have proven resilient to plenty of bumps lately, from the surge in numbers of Americans infected with the coronavirus to a sharp escalation in U.S.-China tensions. The more risk-sensitive bond market has seen bouts of anxiety that have repeatedly pushed Treasury yields to record lows.
Now both contend with an impending fiscal cliff, with the political wrangling between Republicans and Democrats on a package expected to exceed $1 trillion just beginning.
“We’re getting into a second phase of people being laid off now that are going to be permanent or long term at the same time that benefits are set to go away,” said Thomas Graff, a portfolio manager in Baltimore at Brown Advisory, which oversees $80 billion. “That’s a major risk to the markets and nascent economic recovery.”
The legislative package is arguably nowhere near so critical to markets as the $700 billion financial bailout that was initially rejected by Congress in the depths of the Great Recession in September 2008 -- an error that saw the S&P 500 Index crash almost 9% in a day. But the assumption of the eventual passage of another stimulus bill has helped investors bear through another rough earnings season, and the rally could prove vulnerable if the bet proves wrong.
Second Half
With the S&P 500 up almost 43% from its March 23 low, there’s plenty hanging on a second-half economic rebound in the U.S. that could be endangered by a political impasse over the stimulus.
Uncertainty can already be seen in the bond market, where the yield curve has flattened, with the spread of longer-dated notes over shorter-term ones shrinking in the past month.
Complete failure to renew the added unemployment benefits would pose a 3 to 5 percentage-point hit to growth in the third quarter, according to  Deutsche Bank  AG (NYSE:DB). Also critical for renewed growth will be aid for state and local governments, whose spending accounted for more than a tenth of the economy last year and whose revenues have been decimated by the current recession.
On both counts, Republicans are pushing back against House Democrats who passed a $3.5 trillion bill back in May that was ignored by the Senate. The White House and some congressional Republicans argue the extra payments for people getting unemployment benefits serves as a disincentive to returning to work. Republicans have also raised objections about state aid, which some argue could be used for spending unrelated to the Covid-19 crisis.
Deal Prospects
The slow legislative pace makes it unlikely a deal is reached by month-end, something market participants have at least partly discounted. Senate Republicans plan to start discussing a draft bill in the middle of next week, just days before the unemployment benefits run out, with votes in subsequent weeks. But with unemployment above 10% and jobless claims climbing by more than 1 million a week, many households will be forced to curb spending as they await help.
In the end, economists at banks including Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). have predicted a partial extension of the extra unemployment payouts.
“The market is essentially trading on the idea that it will get done,” said John Velis, a strategist at Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK). “Volatility will certainly creep back” if Washington fails to act expeditiously, he said.
Failure to make progress by the time of a scheduled Aug. 10 break could trigger a response not only in asset prices but also concerns at the central bank. The Federal Reserve has proved the ultimate backstop for markets this year, with its credit and liquidity programs helping prevent a deeper economic collapse, along with the biggest-ever 50-day rally in American equities.
“How this plays out when Congress returns from the July recess will have significant bearing on the Fed’s strategy,” said Brett Ryan, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank in New York.
Senate lawmakers return to work July 20.

(Reuters) - European shares rebounded on Wednesday from losses in the previous session following reports of progress in developing a COVID-19 vaccine, but a mixed bag of quarterly earnings reports capped gains.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.9%, with growth-sensitive sectors such as travel & leisure (SXTP), miners (SXPP) and industrial companies (SXNP) leading gains.
Market sentiment got a boost after U.S. biotech firm  Moderna  Inc's (O:MRNA) experimental vaccine for COVID-19 showed it was safe and provoked immune responses in an ongoing early-stage study.
""We have quite an optimistic mood in the market based on not-too-bad earnings reports and the forward-looking optimism about a vaccine,"" UniCredit's lead equity sector strategist Christian Stocker said.
""This is why cyclical stocks are up today.""
As Europe Inc starts churning out trading updates that are expected to show a more than 50% dive, on average, in second-quarter profits, investors are keen to see whether the market bounce back can be sustained.
Swedish telecom operator  Tele2  AB (ST:TEL2b) gained 3.7% as it reaffirmed its 2020 earnings outlook and plans for an extra shareholder payout.
The world's largest fish farmer Mowi ASA (OL:MOWI) jumped 6.4% as harvest volumes beat its own forecast. Shares in peer Salmar (OL:SALM) rose 3%.
The top gainer on the STOXX 600 was  Atlantia  SpA (MI:ATL), which shot up 22.5% after the Italian infrastructure group and its unit Autostrade made the government new offers to settle their long-running dispute.
Under the offer, Italy's state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) will take a majority stake in Autostrade and the company will be spun off and listed.
Hopes were high among investors heading into a EU summit later this week that leaders will agree on a recovery fund of 750 billion euros for pandemic-hammered economies. 
The European Central Bank also starts a two-day meeting although no major announcements are expected when it concludes on Thursday.
Semiconductor equipment maker ASML Holding NV (AS:ASML) slipped 0.6% as it reported quarterly profit below estimates, but forecast overall growth for 2020.
Swedish bank SEB AB (ST:SEBa) fell 2.4% after reporting a smaller-than-expected fall in net quarterly profit, but credit loss provisions surged. Handelsbanken AB (ST:SHBa) also dropped 1.6%.

In UK, fashion brand  Burberry  Group (L:BRBY) declined 5.5% as it warned second-quarter revenue will remain impacted by the pandemic, but ASOS (L:ASOS) rose 2.8% as it forecast annual profit towards the top end of expectations.

1524,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 04:55AM ET</span>",Delisting surges in China as Beijing adopts 'survival of the fittest' approach,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Having begun delisting 26 companies so far this year, China's securities regulator is set to remove a record number of firms from the stock exchange, heeding a message from Vice Premier Liu He to ensure the ""survival of the fittest"".
Liu reinforced the urgency to weed out bad companies from the stock market at a meeting of the State Council on Saturday, heralding a change in approach for the regulator, which had only delisted 110 companies between 2001 and 2018.
China has introduced a U.S.-style system to make listing easier for Shenzhen's start-up board ChiNext. The system was first adopted by Shanghai's tech-focused STAR Market.
""If you widen the entrance, you need to widen the exit too,"" said Tang Zhehui, partner of accounting firm EY, commenting on the need to streamline delisting too. 
The change should also improve China's investment culture, as in the past speculators would buy up moribund listed companies in the expectation that they would be saved by white knights and never be delisted, he added.
Among the 26 companies that Refinitiv data shows are in the process of being delisted are former high performers like Leshi (SZ:300104), an Internet information service business, as well as some fraudulent ones. 
""Some listed companies deteriorate due to changes in economic environment or mismanagement,"" said Zizheng Wang, Shanghai-based portfolio manager at UBS Asset Management.
""If you eliminate them, the market would evolve, and become healthier.""
Terence Lin, senior partner at Shanghai-based boutique investment bank TRSD Capital, said China's regulator had been far less rigorous than its U.S. counterpart.
""In the U.S., if you forge books, or fail to submit filings, you will be kicked out. Rules are very tough,"" Lin said.
""But in China, a lot of such companies remain listed, and many, many retail investors become victims.""
That could change, as Chinese regulators strengthen delisting rules. 

In a major move targeting so-called ""garbage"" companies, the Shanghai Stock Exchange will remove ""special treatment"" (ST) shares from its stock benchmark next week. A stock is labeled ""ST"" after regulators flag that it was at risk of being delisted or involved ""investment risks"".

TOKYO/BEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201) on Wednesday unveiled the Ariya - an electric SUV and its first all-new global model in five years - hoping it will symbolize its road to recovery after more than a year of scandal and a precipitous decline into earnings losses.
But initial sales plans for the Ariya are modest, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, an indication that the vehicle will do little to lift Nissan's bottom line.
Featuring Nissan's latest self-driving technologies, the Ariya has a driving range comparable to Tesla models and will sell from around 5 million yen ($47,000). That makes it more upscale than the X-Trail SUV, Nissan's top-selling global model known as the Rogue in North America.
""We were under orders from management not to make any compromises with this model as it represents where the company stands today and will lead to the Nissan of the future,"" Hikaru Nakajima, Ariya's chief engineer, told reporters this week. 
In a market dominated by Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and amid increasing competition from other automakers launching and planning their own electric SUVs, Nissan plans to sell just 30,000 for the model's first full year of global sales, two sources said. 
""It's a bit underwhelming,"" said one source who was involved in the product's development, referring to the sales target.
""Is this going to be a vehicle that brings a halo effect to the brand or not?"" the source said.
Sales of the Ariya will begin in Japan from mid-2021. Sales in the United States, Europe and China will come later but Nissan has not disclosed a timeline.
A third person said the automaker plans to produce 40,000 units in Japan in 2021, eventually ramping up annual production to 100,000. It will also build the model in China, two people said. 
By comparison, the X-Trail and Rogue together sold more than half a million units in Nissan's key markets last year, while Tesla's electric Model 3 sedan notched up sales of more than 300,000.
The sources were not authorised to speak with media and spoke on condition of anonymity. A Nissan spokeswoman declined to comment on sales and production targets.
NEW LOGO
Focused on expanding in emerging markets, Nissan let its vehicle portfolio age but the strategy has tarnished the automaker's brand and hurt sales. Those problems have been compounded by the ouster of former CEO Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 over allegations of financial misconduct, charges he denies.
In addition to being Nissan's first all-new model in five years, the Ariya is its first brand-new EV in a decade after the Leaf hatchback which made its mark as the world's first mass-market electric vehicle.
The Ariya is also the first vehicle to sport Nissan's revamped logo, which uses a flatter, thinner typeface and a skinnier circular emblem. 
Koji Endo, head of equity research at SBI Securities, said the Ariya had been positioned to show what Nissan can do in terms of design and technology rather than for volume sales, and that Nissan's aim was to use this to draw customers to upcoming fresh versions of high-volume models.
""Nissan wants to send a message to the industry that it is a company that can still compete on technology and R&D capability, and develop high-spec cars,"" he said.
The Ariya will go head to head with the Model Y SUV crossover, which Tesla began delivering in March and starts at around $50,000, as well as Ford's (N:F) Mustang Mach-E SUV which is due out later this year and is also expected to be priced around $50,000.
The long-range version of the Ariya will be able to travel up to 610 kilometres on a single charge, Nissan estimates. That is longer than the Model Y's 505 kilometres.

1529,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 03:30AM ET</span>",SMIC's Shanghai listing tests if money alone can bring chip dominance to China,"By Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's biggest chipmaker SMIC is set to follow its staggering $6.6 billion share sale with its Shanghai market debut on Thursday, just as Sino-U.S. tension widens the chasm it wants to cross to reach global leader TSMC, industry insiders said.
Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) (HK:0981) has found itself in the slipstream of a government drive to develop an independent chip industry. Its Hong Kong stock price has surged three-fold since March as investors bought into sentiment accompanying its listing plans.
Its second-biggest shareholder, the state-backed China Integrated Circuit Industry Investor Fund, signed up as the largest strategic investor of the offering which, by Monday close, had attracted 566 times as much money from retail investors as shares available.
However, SMIC's global aspirations fall under the shadow of tense Sino-U.S. relations, punctuated by tech import tariffs and coloured by a U.S. boycott of China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] on security grounds, which threatens business between the telecom equipment maker and suppliers such as SMIC.
Even if SMIC acquired technology in its race to catch Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) (TW:2330), the 20-year-old firm lacks the intellectual property and process know-how to win top customers for at least a decade, experts said.
Its capital spending could more than double this year from last at $4.7 billion, S&P Global analysts estimated - just a third of TSMC's forecast spend.
""The listing is a blessing and a curse,"" said Mark Li, who tracks the semiconductor industry at Bernstein Research.
""They need the money to compete against TSMC, but they are competing against very strong competitors with a better reputation, and getting real returns for investors will be more difficult than it seems.""
SMIC did not respond to requests for comment.
AMBITION
Targets outlined in its share-sale prospectus make Shanghai-based SMIC an outlier among peers in the chip-making business, experts said, given TSMC's technological dominance makes catching up prohibitively expensive.
Of the 46.3 billion yuan ($6.6 billion) proceeds, SMIC plans to spend 40% building a plant making 12-inch silicon wafers to produce chips with 14 and 7 nanometre technology. That would make it capable of taking high-end chip orders from the likes of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Huawei chip unit HiSilicon.
Global Foundries and United Microelectronics, peers of comparable size, said they do not intend to develop 7 nanometre tech. Rather than aiming for such cutting-edge chips, those rivals upgraded lines and specialised in niche offerings.
""That's no accident, because they don't have the Chinese state backing that SMIC does,"" said Doug Fuller, who researches China's chip sector at the City University of Hong Kong.
""It's less exciting from a techno-nationalist perspective but perhaps a better commercial decision.""
HUAWEI HURDLE
Of immediate risk are U.S. restrictions on firms using U.S. technology and markets that do business with Huawei.
SMIC earns up to 20% of sales from HiSilicon, showed Bernstein Research data. It also relies on equipment from Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), LAM Research, KLA, ASML and others in the United States or allied countries for which there is no Chinese substitute.
""Without those tools, it'll be almost impossible commercially to move production forward,"" said Li. ""They'll probably be stuck with 14 nanometre, and can't move to 7 nanometre without unbearable costs.""
KNOW-HOW
SMIC also lacks production know-how, experts said, both at the high end and when scaling up at the low end, given how manufacturing involves secretive fine-tuning with chip designers and equipment makers.
As a late-mover, SMIC has struggled to match TSMC in yield, or the number of working chips per a batch, industry insiders said.
A former Unisoc vice-president said the Chinese phone processor designer ordered roughly 50,000 prototype 3G chips from SMIC in 2015 with 40 nanometre technology - introduced by TSMC seven years earlier.
The chips, produced in batches of 2,500, kept coming out cracked, the ex-executive told Reuters.
""The yields were all over the place from wafer to wafer, and they had no idea how to fix it. Meanwhile we were doing 500,000 chips a day at our peak with TSMC.""
Unisoc did not respond to a request for comment.

The company, owned by Genting Singapore Ltd (SI:GENS), did not disclose how many jobs will be lost, but the local Straits Times newspaper said the cuts were ""significant"".
Resorts World Sentosa employs 12,500 and its facilities, spread over 49 hectares, encompasses a hotel, a casino and a Universal Studios theme park among other attractions .
""We have made the difficult decision to implement a one-off workforce rationalisation,"" it said in a statement.
Singapore's economy plunged into recession in the second quarter, shrinking a record 41% from the previous quarter, data showed on Tuesday, putting it on track for its deepest slump ever.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - More than 2,500 mobile games were removed from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s China app store in the first week of July, four times as many in the same period in June, after Apple closed a loophole to comply with Chinese licence requirements, data from SensorTower showed.
Apple had given publishers of revenue-generating games a deadline of end-June to submit a government-issued licence number that allows them to make in-app purchases, a requirement that Android-based app stores in China have long had. It was not clear why Apple had allowed the loophole to exist for so long. 
Notable games removed from China's App Store in July so far include Supercell's farming hit ""Hay Day"", ""Nonstop Chuck Norris"" from Flaregames and ""Solitaire"" from Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), according to SensorTower. 
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
""It's possible these games will be available again in future, however, but have been gone from the storefront for more than five days,"" said Randy Nelson, head of Mobile Insights at SensorTower.
The app-analytics firm was not able to determine each game's individual reason for removal, but the sharp tick up was notable, he added. 
The games removed in the first seven days of July had generated a combined $34.7 million in lifetime gross revenue in China, and had accumulated more than 133 million downloads in the country.
China has tightened its control over the world's largest video-game market in recent years and online games seeking to monetise often face a lengthy approval process to obtain a licence. 

In February, video game ""Plague Inc"", which surged in popularity amid the coronavirus outbreak, was removed from Apple's China app store after regulators said it contained illegal content. The game did not have a proper licence and analysts say it was unlikely to get one.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open higher Wednesday, with investors buoyed by optimism about a coronavirus vaccine as well as the chance a key EU summit will lead to more stimulus.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.7% higher, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 1%, while CAC 40 futures in France gained 1.1%.
Helping the positive tone Wednesday was the news that the first Covid-19 vaccine tested in people has shown early promising results.
U.S. biotech firm  Moderna  's  (NASDAQ:MRNA) experimental Covid-19 vaccine was declared safe and generated “robust” immune responses in all 45 volunteers taking part in the study, according to early-stage human trial results published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Tuesday.
“This does not mean that it may lead to a vaccine in the end, but it is an important step towards finding a vaccine,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note.
.However, Japan’s capital Tokyo raised its warning level to the highest level, and three U.S. states reported new record daily deaths from the pandemic.
That said, there are hopes the European Union could agree at its summit later this week on a rescue financing package that will limit the economic damage to the bloc.
Additionally, the European Central Bank is set to meet Thursday, but isn't expexted to ease its policy any further this time.
In corporate news,  Svenska Handelsbanken  (ST:SHBa) posted a 6.1% drop in second-quarter net profit as lower interest rates dented income, but the profit decline was smaller than expected thanks to lower costs and a sharp fall in credit losses.
U.K. luxury group  Burberry  (LON:BRBY) said it expects sales for the six months through September to be down around 15%-20% from a year earlier, despite a solid recovery in demand since April.
TomTom (AS:TOM2) posted a net loss for the second quarter of 2020, but the Dutch navigational-technologies company added its operational revenue was on track to recover from the lows it experienced in April due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Oil prices pushed higher Wednesday, helped by a sharp fall in U.S. crude inventories of 8.3 million barrels in the week to July 10, according to data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute. Official numbers from the Energy Information Administration are due later Wednesday.
The so-called OPEC+ bloc is set to decide whether to extend output cuts of 9.7 million barrels per day that end in July or ease them to 7.7 million barrels per day.
At 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $40.48 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.3% to $43.03.

1534,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 02:00AM ET</span>",Electric-Car Subsidies Make Renaults Free in Germany,"(Bloomberg) --
Car buyers in Europe can now get their hands on a brand-new electric vehicle for less than the typical cost of a mobile-phone contract. Thanks to newly generous subsidies, some are even free.
Shoppers have swarmed virtual showrooms in Germany and France -- the region’s two largest passenger-car markets -- after their national governments boosted electric-vehicle incentives to stimulate demand. Their purchase subsidies are now among the most favorable in the world, according to BloombergNEF.
The state support is allowing Autohaus Koenig, a dealership chain with more than 50 locations across Germany, to advertise a lease for the battery-powered  Renault  (PA:RENA) Zoe that is entirely covered by subsidies. In the 20 days since it put the offer online, roughly 3,000 people have inquired and about 300 have signed contracts.
“If we had more sales staff, we would have sold even more,” said Wolfgang Huber, head of electric-car sales for the dealer in Berlin, who published a Facebook post asking customers to be patient. “We did expect an increase in sales with the subsidies, but this run really struck us.”
Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Emmanuel Macron have sought to soften the coronavirus pandemic’s blow to the badly hit car sector. Sales in Europe have recovered more slowly in Europe than in China or North America, pressuring policy makers to support major sources of employment and economic activity.
In France, sales of Renault’s Zoe model are on track to double this year even as demand for gasoline vehicles has cratered. And in the Netherlands, where the city of Amsterdam is banning non-electric cars from 2030, a 10 million-euro ($11.4 million) fund to support EV purchases was used up in just eight days this month.
“There are a lot of attractive offers right now because of higher subsidies, and that’s boosting demand,” said Aleksandra O’Donovan, an analyst with BloombergNEF. “The EU is pushing toward decarbonizing transport, and the coronavirus crisis has allowed them to accelerate that.”
Germany’s subsidies of as much as 9,000 euros per electric vehicle have boosted sales for Carfellows, a German auto-trading website, about tenfold.
“This is a golden moment for us,” said Rainer Westdoerp, a spokesman for the Berlin-based startup, which on Wednesday will start offering leases of Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) AG’s battery-powered Smart EQ for 9.90 euros a month.
Carfellows took down a similar offer for the Smart model in June after about 1,000 customers reached out within three days and the automaker couldn’t supply cars fast enough, Westdoerp said.
While the best deals -- including Carfellows’s Smart offering -- are usually for buyers of company cars because of perks including tax and risk rebates, private drivers in Germany can still lease an electric car from the site for as little as 39 euros a month. In France, where the government raised subsidies to 7,000 euros per car this year, customers can lease the Zoe from 79 euros a month.
Buyers will have to read the fine print, as some offers come with additional one-time fees or down payments. And not everyone in Europe is spending more to speed up EV adoption, with the U.K. and Belgium recently cutting aid. China had planned to end its subsidies this year but extended them to 2022 in response to the pandemic.
But in general, the picture looks attractive for European buyers as the continent is home to eight of the nine countries with the largest national purchasing-subsidies, according to BNEF.
Governments will have to weigh carefully when to let those subsidies run out to avoid sales falling off a cliff. But there will come a time when that won’t be a concern anymore, O’Donovan said.
“The decreasing price of batteries suggests that EVs should be cheaper to buy than gasoline cars from the mid-2020s,” she said. “Once that happens, the market will accelerate even without subsidies.”

1536,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 01:09AM ET</span>",Another European Capital Is Joining the Anti-Airbnb Drive,"(Bloomberg) -- Budapest is preparing to follow other popular tourist destinations that have sought to rein in short-term apartment rentals, which fuel property prices and feed a raucous party district in the heart of the Hungarian capital.
With over 10,000 Airbnb listings in 2018, Budapest relies on the industry more than almost any other major European city. It now would join cities such as Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam and Madrid in imposing stricter terms on such rentals as residents fight to reclaim urban neighborhoods from tourists.
Hungarian lawmakers on Tuesday approved legislation that opens the way for municipalities to cap the number of days annually proprietors can rent out Airbnb-style apartments. The capital’s party district also passed new regulations making it tougher for establishments to stay open past midnight.
The proliferation of low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Easyjet helped make the city a favorite for long weekend trips in Europe, so much so that officials and residents now complain of “over-tourism.” The boom has made short-term rentals so lucrative that entire residential buildings have morphed into mini-hotels in the downtown area.
“We need comprehensive regulation following the example of Amsterdam, Berlin or London that limit the period when entire apartments can function as hotels,” said Budapest Mayor Gergely Karacsony. He said rents in the capital’s downtown are now “out of reach even for a middle-class family.”
Housing Squeeze
The Airbnb market’s share of overnight stays in Budapest reached 20% in 2018, one of the highest among major European cities, according to a Colliers International report. That’s led to a housing squeeze and soaring long-term rental and real-estate prices. The city’s property prices rose 16% in the first quarter from a year earlier, the second-fastest pace among 150 major cities in the world, according to a Knight Frank report.
Any curbs may benefit a booming hotel industry, which added 1,120 new rooms in 2019, triple the previous year’s pace but still a fraction of the 3,560 rooms in the pipeline. Of that, 75% was forecast for delivery in 2020, at least before the virus hit, according to CBRE. Investors include Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s family and closest business allies.
The most likely areas to face a crackdown include the city center, including the area dubbed the “party district” that encompasses the former Jewish ghetto that is now dominated by so-called ruin bars.
Popular with tourists and locals alike, the boom gave dilapidated buildings a new lease on life and boosted the art and restaurant scene. But residents and officials have focused on the trash, noise and crime, including drugs and prostitution, that have accompanied the area’s transformation.
‘Pure Hell’
“It was pure hell to live there,” said Dora Garai, head of a group representing locals, who said she used to live in the building facing Fogas, one of the area’s most popular venues, a labynthine complex of two converted buildings that includes serveral bars, dance floors and gardens. She’s since moved to the outer part of the same district, no longer within earshot of the party scene.
After years of fielding complaints from residents, the council this year approved a “quiet code” that will come into effect this summer. It bans establishments staying open past midnight unless they meet certain criteria, including having equipment that limits the noise level and security to ensure patrons don’t drink outside.
For bars and clubs, the timing couldn’t be worse after the virus all but wiped out the first half of the year as flights were grounded and Budapest went into a lockdown for several months.
At Hivatal, a tiny bar whose terrace space is usually overflowing with mostly locals, owners put up the “For Sale” sign after the new regulation was published.
No Tourists
“The timing isn’t great as there are no foreign tourists right now and we had no revenue for the past three months,” said Zsofia Komuves, one of the owners.
At the same time, she conceded that some new regulation was needed and it just needed fine-tuning so that bars like hers wouldn’t go out of business. After talking with the municipality, she said she remained hopeful that a compromise can be reached.
“We are not going to kill the party district,” said Peter Niedermuller, the recently elected mayor of the seventh district. “But we need some changes because people living in the district cannot sleep at night.”

The decision marks a step forward for Texas as it vies with Oklahoma to attract a new factory to build Tesla's Y sport utility vehicles and cybertrucks. 
A majority of commissioners in Travis County voted in favor of providing the electric carmaker with a tax rebate worth at least $14.7 million. 
That brings the total amount of tax rebates to nearly $65 million after the Del Valle school district, which includes the proposed factory site, approved a $50 million incentive on Thursday.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The electric carmaker only has a single vehicle manufacturing plant in California and has said it wants to start building a large second plant in the southwestern United States as early as the third quarter of this year..
Commissioners in favor of the agreement decided to move forward after a Tesla representative said executives had met with the governor of a rival state, without naming the state.
The city of Tulsa in Oklahoma has campaigned for Tesla to build the plant there.
Tesla has asked Travis County for an 80% rebate on its property taxes for 10 years, worth $14.7 million, as well as a 65% rebate for the next 10 years after that.

Tesla said the factory would create 5,000 jobs, mostly low-skilled. The average annual salary would be roughly $47,000, an income considered low by the county's health and human services division.

1540,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 08:15PM ET</span>",Crunch time for Apple in fight against $15 billion EU tax order,"By Foo Yun Chee and Padraic Halpin
BRUSSELS/DUBLIN (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s clash with EU competition regulators comes to a head on Wednesday as Europe's second-highest court rules on whether it has to pay 13 billion euros ($15 billion) in Irish back taxes, a key part of the EU's crackdown against sweetheart tax deals.
In its order four years ago, the European Commission said Apple benefited from illegal state aid via two Irish tax rulings that artificially reduced its tax burden for over two decades - to as low as 0.005% in 2014.
Defeat for European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager could weaken or delay pending cases against Ikea's and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE)'s deals with the Netherlands, as well as Huhtamaki's agreement with Luxembourg.
Vestager, who has made the tax crackdown a centrepiece of her time in office, saw the same court last year overturn her demand for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) to pay up to 30 million euros in Dutch back taxes. In another case, the court also threw out her ruling against a Belgian tax scheme for 39 multinationals. 
The Apple dispute is seen by some analysts as a lose-lose situation for Ireland, which has appealed against the Commission's order alongside the iPhone maker. 
While 14 billion euros - including interest - would go a long way to plugging the coronavirus-shaped hole in the state's finances, Dublin is seeking to protect a low tax regime that has attracted 250,000 multinational employers.
If Ireland's appeal succeeds, the government will be ridiculed by opposition parties for not taking the cash, which could cover at least half of a budget deficit forecast to balloon to as much as 10% of GDP this year.
Should Ireland lose, the government will be castigated by the same politicians for launching the appeal. A ruling in favour of the Commission could also raise questions about the application of Ireland's tax code at a sensitive time, when new global rules for taxing digital giants are being debated.
Defeat could also hurt Ireland's ability to attract investment, although the promotional blitz undertaken after the Commission's 2016 decision appears to have worked. The numbers employed by multinationals like Apple, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have grown by 25%, accounting for one in ten Irish workers.
For Apple, defeat would be a blow, but manageable given its cash holdings topped $190 billion at the end of its fiscal second quarter. 

The cases are T-778/16 Ireland v Commission and T-892/16 Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe v Commission. The defeated side can appeal on points of law to the EU Court of Justice, Europe's highest court.

In the Moderna study, the neutralizing antibody levels produced were equivalent to the upper half of what’s seen in patients who get infected with the virus and recover, according to the results published Tuesday. The Moderna vaccine is one of the farthest along for Covid-19.
The after-hours surge came after a volatile two days of trading. After briefly reaching the highest levels since the Covid-19 swoon in March, the S&P 500 reversed to end Monday down 1%. Then Tuesday, after a series of swings, the benchmark finished the day up 1.3%.
The Nasdaq 100 closed Tuesday’s cash trading session up 0.8% to mark the first time since March that the tech-heavy gauge posted back-to-back reversals of at least 2% in opposite directions. Before this week, clusters of big contrasting reversals all occurred during bear markets.
The late day surge brought SPY, the ETF tracking the S&P 500, to $322 a share -- close to the level reached on June 8 that has acted as solid resistance.
With a health-care crisis at the heart of the financial crisis and recession, investors are scrutinizing every piece of data on Covid-19 or high-frequency metrics on the recovery. The Moderna news fits on the positive side of the ledger.
“I’d classify the last few days as discount the bad and amplify the good,” said Max Gokhman, Pacific Life Fund Advisors’ head of asset allocation. “The Moderna news is positive and there’s no doubt that a proven vaccine is a major positive catalyst, so in keeping with the overall sentiment it makes sense that the markets would rally on the news.”
Still he added: “But also let’s be clear that the news we got is about positive progress, not any definitive proof of viability.”

1544,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 05:55PM ET</span>",BHP faces first step in $6.3 billion UK claim over Brazil dam failure,"By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - More than 200,000 Brazilian people and groups will next week kick off a 5 billion-pound ($6.3 billion) lawsuit against Anglo-Australian miner BHP in Britain over a 2015 dam failure that led to Brazil's worst environmental disaster.
The group claim, one of the largest in British legal history, has been brought on behalf of Brazilian individuals, businesses, churches, organisations, municipalities and indigenous people and will open in Manchester on July 22. 
An initial, eight-day hearing will establish whether the case can be heard in Britain, although the judge is expected to reserve judgment until later in the year. If successful, further trials are expected to determine liability and quantify damages.
BHP spokesman Neil Burrows said the claim did not belong in Britain because it duplicated proceedings in Brazil and the ongoing work of the Renova Foundation, an entity created by the miner and its partners to manage reparations and repairs.
The collapse of the Fundao tailings dam, which stored mining waste and is owned by the Samarco joint venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining company Vale, killed 19 and spilled roughly 40 million cubic metres of toxic sludge into communities, the Rio Doce river and Atlantic Ocean 650 km away.
Claimants allege BHP, the world's largest miner by market value, ignored safety warnings as the dam's capacity was repeatedly increased by raising its height - and disregarded cracks that pointed to early signs of rupture.
""The public companies at the top of the BHP group structure, which we firmly believe bear ultimate responsibility for the disaster, have until now been insulated from its consequences within the Brazilian legal system,"" said Tom Goodhead, a partner at law firm PGMBM, which represents the claimants.

Goodhead said Brazilian environmental law had a long reach and imposed strict liability for environmental damage.

1546,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 05:10PM ET</span>","Moderna Phase one results show coronavirus vaccine safe, induces immune response","By Julie Steenhuysen
CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Moderna  Inc's (O:MRNA) experimental vaccine for COVID-19 showed it was safe and provoked immune responses in all 45 healthy volunteers in an ongoing early-stage study, U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday.
No study volunteers experienced a serious side effect, but more than half reported mild or moderate reactions such as fatigue, headache, chills, muscle aches or pain at the injection site.
These were more likely to occur after the second dose and in people who got the highest dose, the team reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Moderna was the first to start human testing of a vaccine for the novel coronavirus on March 16, some 66 days after the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
Experts say a vaccine is needed to put an end to the pandemic that has sickened millions and caused nearly 575,000 deaths worldwide.
""The world urgently needs vaccines to protect against COVID-19,"" said Dr Lisa Jackson of Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle and lead author of the study.
The federal government is supporting Moderna's vaccine with nearly half a billion dollars and has chosen it as one of the first to enter large-scale human trials. A successful vaccine could be a turning point for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna, which has never had a licensed product.
Moderna's shot, mRNA-1273, uses ribonucleic acid (RNA) - a chemical messenger that contains instructions for making proteins. When injected into people, the vaccine instructs cells to make proteins that mimic the outer surface of the coronavirus, which the body recognizes as a foreign invader, and mounts an immune response against.
The results released on Tuesday involved three doses of the vaccine, tested in groups of 15 volunteers aged 18-55 who got two shots, 28 days apart. The groups tested 25, 100 or 250 micrograms of the vaccine.
The team reported that individuals who got two doses of the vaccine had high levels of virus-killing neutralizing antibodies that exceeded the average levels seen in people who had recovered from COVID-19.
Adverse events after the second dose occurred in seven of the 13 volunteers who got the 25-microgram dose, all 15 participants who received the 100 microgram dose and all 14 who got the 250 microgram dose. In the highest-dose group, three patients had severe reactions such as fever, chills, headache or nausea. One of these had a fever of 103.28 Fahrenheit (39.6 C). 
""We didn't see any events that are characterized as serious adverse events,"" Jackson said, referring to reactions that require hospitalization or result in death. 
In June, Moderna said it selected the 100-microgram dose for its late-stage study to minimize adverse reactions. 
At that dose, Moderna said the company is on track to deliver about 500 million doses per year, and possibly up to 1 billion doses per year, starting in 2021, from the company's internal U.S. manufacturing site and strategic collaboration with Swiss drugmaker Lonza (S:LONN).
""It's a good first step,"" said Dr William Schaffner, a vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who was not involved in the study.
""There's nothing here that would inhibit one from going ahead to the Phase 2/Phase 3 trials,"" he said. ""A little fatigue and headache and myalgia (muscle pain) and pain at the injection site is a small price to pay for protection against COVID-19.""

In April, Moderna expanded the Phase 1 trial to include adults over 55, who are more at risk of serious disease, with the aim of enrolling 120 volunteers. Moderna said it will follow study volunteers for a year after the second shot, to look for side effects and check how long immunity lasts.

(Reuters) - Wall Street surged on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending more than 2% higher as investors bought energy and materials stocks and looked beyond a recent rise in coronavirus cases.
The S&P 500 energy, materials and industrial indexes jumped more than 2%, while health, technology and consumer staples each rose more than 1%.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) slipped 0.6%. It and other recently strong performing technology and growth stocks, including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), recovered from deeper losses, giving the Nasdaq a last minute spurt.

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co, the largest U.S. lender, rose 0.6% after it posted a smaller-than-expected 51% drop in second-quarter profit. 
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co tumbled 4.6% after booking a quarterly loss for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) dropped 3.9% after it reported a steep fall in quarterly profit.
The S&P 500 banks index dropped 1.2% as the three banks set aside a combined $28 billion to cover potential losses on loans to borrowers hurt by the coronavirus pandemic.
Wall Street has reclaimed most of its coronavirus-driven losses since March as a raft of monetary and fiscal stimulus and upbeat economic data raised hopes of a swift post-pandemic recovery.
But a recent record surge in COVID-19 cases and new business restrictions, particularly in California, has again raised uncertainty about how it may take for the economy to recover.

 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc jumped 4.5% after it said it plans to start a late-stage clinical trial for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate on or around July 27.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.92-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.63-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

(Reuters) - Massachusetts on Tuesday followed California in suing Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) over allegedly misclassifying their drivers as independent contractors instead of employees entitled to extensive benefits.
The complaint filed in Suffolk Superior Court claims Uber and Lyft violate state minimum wage, hour and sick time laws.
""Uber and Lyft have built their billion-dollar businesses while denying their drivers basic employee protections and benefits for years,” Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement.
Uber and Lyft argue that the vast majority of their drivers enjoy the flexibility that comes with on-demand work, and a recent analysis by Cornell University of Seattle driver data supplied by the companies showed that some 75% of drivers work fewer than 20 hours.
Massachusetts' lawsuit comes roughly two months after California filed a similar complaint, accusing Uber and Lyft of evading workplace protections and withholding worker benefits under a new state law intended to protect workers in the so-called gig economy.
California has asked a court to compel the companies to comply with the law.
Massachusetts is also seeking a court order declaring that ride-hail drivers are employees. But unlike in California, the Massachusetts labor laws the companies are alleged to violate went into effect in 2004.
""This (coronavirus) crisis has really shown that we need to do everything possible to support these workers, especially those providing an essential service,"" Healey said at a news conference when asked why her office waited until now to file the lawsuit.
Uber in a statement said it would contest the action in court and said it stood ready with Massachusetts to modernize laws that allow for new worker protections while maintaining flexibility.

Lyft in a statement said the lawsuit threatens to eliminate work for more than 50,000 people in Massachusetts as drivers would not automatically be hired as employees.

Investing.com – Wall Street ended strongly Tuesday as a rebound in tech and the start of earnings season overshadowed rising Covid cases.       
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 2.13%, the S&P 500 gained 1.34%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.94%.
Tech turned positive as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) eased from the lows of the day.
The rebound in tech arrived even as cases continued to rise, though there was reason for optimism in California were cases rose by 7,346, compared with an 8,358 increase a day earlier, stoking investor hopes that infections in the state could be flattening. California had announced a day earlier that it would be shutting down all indoor activity, leading to sell-off across stocks on Monday.  
Coronavirus cases nationwide totaled 3.43 million, with 138,000 dead so far.
Investor attention was also fixed on the start of earnings season. 
Financials ended slightly higher following mixed earnings from banks as JPMorgan and  Citigroup  beat consensus estimates thanks to strong trading revenue, while  Wells Fargo  cut its dividend by 80% and reported its first-quarter loss in more than a decade.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) ended up 0.56%, while Citigroup (NYSE:C) was down 3.93%, and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) fell 4.55%.
The quarterly results provided investors with further insight into the impact from the pandemic on lending activity, as the trio of banks collectively socked away nearly $28 billion to fortify themselves for a potential wave of bad loans.
Energy was the biggest gainer on the day, as oil prices remained steady despite ongoing concerns about the strength of the recovery in crude demand.

1550,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 04:26PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: 3 Things to Watch for July 15,"By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com  -- The Dow rallied to close up Tuesday, led by  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), to reach its highest in more than two weeks.
Covid cases in California -- where all indoor activity was shut down Monday -- may be close to peaking, which boosted risk sentiment and triggered a recovery in tech stocks.   
Bank earnings came in mixed, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) beating consensus estimates thanks to strong trading revenue, and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) cutting its dividend by 80% and reporting its first quarterly loss in more than a decade. The three banks socked away nearly $28 billion to fortify themselves for a potential wave of bad loans.
Energy was a big driver of gains, ahead of an OPEC+ meeting and EIA crude oil inventories. 
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow: 
1. Show Us the Money
Earnings out Wednesday include UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
UnitedHealth reports before the open. Earnings per share is expected at $5.18, versus $3.60 in the same quarter a year earlier. Revenue for the period is forecast to come in at $63 billion versus $61 billion a year earlier. Shares are trading near an all-time high. 
Goldman Sachs also reports before the open. Revenue is forecast at $9.7 billion, versus $9.5 billion a year earlier. Analysts see EPS at $3.90, versus $5.81 a year earlier. The stock is up 56% since hitting a 2020 low in March. 
2. Slick Like Oil
OPEC+ meets Wednesday, and there is speculation that a rollback in production cuts is coming, even as the U.S. shuts back down again with Covid cases raging.   
In April, the Saudis led a push that saw the 23-producer OPEC+ alliance, that includes Russia and other non-members of the group, cut output by 9.7 million barrels a day, as Covid-19 triggered a collapse in oil demand.
Riyadh and most participants in the coalition now support a loosening of the curbs by 2 million barrels a day to 7.7 million barrels a day, said officials speaking on conditions of anonymity to reporters.   
Ahead of the Wednesday meeting, OPEC said it saw 2020 oil demand falling by around 8.9 million barrels a day versus a June forecast for a fall of around 9 million barrels a day. But it added that in 2021, it expects oil demand to partially recover from this year's drop, rising by 7 million barrels a day. 
The EIA also reports crude oil inventories on Wednesday, with an expected draw of 2.1 million barrels, compared to last week’s 5.6 million-barrel spike.
3. Fed Beige Book out
Ahead of the Fed’s Beige Book coming out Wednesday, Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said the Fed should begin to pivot to offering an accommodative policy framework amid increasing Covid cases. “The recovery is likely to face headwinds even if the downside risks do not materialize, and a second wave would magnify that challenge,” she said. “Fiscal support will remain vital.”
Robert Kaplan, Dallas Fed president, reiterated on CNBC that wearing masks will help economic growth.

1552,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 04:21PM ET</span>",Virus worries and FOMO drive options bets on surging tech giants,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Options investors are ramping up bets on some of this year's biggest winners, including Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), even as they turn cautious on the wider market amid a resurgent U.S. coronavirus outbreak.
Investors are betting that tech-related stocks will remain comparatively resilient to the coronavirus-fueled economic disruptions that have battered sectors such as retail and travel, despite growing concerns about stretched valuations following steep rallies.
Analysts also see another factor driving the momentum stocks: fear of missing out, or FOMO.
The rocket-like rise of such stocks has driven year-to-date gains for the S&P 500 technology (SPLRCT), consumer discretionary (SPLRCD) and communication services (SPLRCL) sectors, though the broader S&P 500 (SPX) benchmark index remains negative for the year. Amazon is a component of the consumer discretionary index, and Netflix is a component of the communication services index.
""The flight to safety is in tech,"" said Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets. ""These tend to be the names that are insulated from the fact that everyone is quarantined.""
Fears of further economic fallout from the coronavirus mounted on Monday as California reinstituted restrictions on businesses and the state's two largest public school districts announced instruction would be online-only when school resumes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq toggled between gains and losses Tuesday, a day after falling 2.1%, its biggest percentage loss in more than two weeks.
But the purchase of bullish call options in tech-related names hasn't been dampened. For instance, demand for calls versus bearish put options - a measure called skew - on Tesla currently stands near historic extremes, even after the stock has rallied more than 300% from its March lows. Tesla's 30-day skew is negative, at -15.2%, according to Trade Alert, meaning that prices for calls have surged past those for equivalent puts.
Skew in Amazon, Netflix, Twitter and other momentum stocks has also been negative in the past week. By contrast, skew on the S&P 500 shows a growing bias toward puts.
""You have almost a perfect storm,"" said Matt Amberson, principal at options analytics firm ORATS. ""There's a little bit of institutional worry, but retail (investors) ... are bullish.""
Still, there are plenty of concerns about technology stocks. Fund managers in a recent BofA Global Research survey said buying tech stocks was the market's ""most crowded"" trade for a third straight month.
In addition, some strategists believe the sharp run-up could make tech-related shares more vulnerable should the companies' growth outlooks fall short of investors' hopes. The second-quarter earnings season began in earnest on Tuesday as several major U.S. banks reported results.
After the recent rally, many tech-related shares have ""the type of valuation where you would want to take profits,"" said Oliver Pursche, president at Bronson Meadows Capital Management.
Indeed, the forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500, at 22.1, according to Refinitiv, is at its highest level since the dot-com boom two decades ago.
Some investors have chosen to bet on stocks that are outside the technology sector but may be positioned to benefit from a nascent economic recovery. Skew has dipped for several companies seen as being among the greatest beneficiaries of an economic recovery, including  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL).
Other recent call buyers include investors who want exposure to potential gains but are hesitant to buy stocks at current prices, said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group, a trend he said has occurred in tech-related names such as Tesla and  Shopify Inc  (TO:SHOP) (N:SHOP).

""We're seeing a FOMO phenomenon being priced in,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration plans to soon scrap a 2013 agreement between U.S. and Chinese auditing authorities, a senior State Department official said, a move that could foreshadow a broader crackdown on U.S.-listed Chinese firms under fire for sidestepping American disclosure rules. 
The deal, which set up a process for a U.S. auditing watchdog to seek documents in enforcement cases against Chinese auditors, was initially welcomed as a breakthrough in U.S. efforts to gain access to closely guarded Chinese financial information and bestowed a mark of legitimacy on Chinese regulators.
But the watchdog, known as the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), has long complained of China's failure to grant requests, meaning scant insight into audits of Chinese firms that trade on U.S. exchanges.
The lack of transparency has prompted administration officials to lay the groundwork to exit the deal soon, according to Keith Krach, undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, in a sign the PCAOB will give up on efforts to secure information from the Chinese. 
""The action is imminent,"" Krach said on Monday in an emailed response to questions. ""This is a National Security issue because we cannot continue to afford  to put American  shareholders  at  risk, to put  American  companies at a disadvantage and  allow our preeminence of being the gold standard for financial markets to erode.""
One other administration official and three former White House officials said terminating the memorandum of understanding was under consideration, adding that the White House was involved with the discussions.
The White House declined to comment, while the PCAOB did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
China's Foreign Ministry, in a reply to Reuters, said abolishing the memorandum of understanding would not help improve the supervision of listed companies in the United States and would damage the interests of investors.
It said China hoped U.S. regulatory authorities would carry out fair exchanges and consultation with their Chinese counterparts to protect investors.
It was not clear when or how the administration would revoke the agreement, which requires 30-day notice by either party, and its termination would not directly threaten the listed status of Chinese companies that trade on U.S. exchanges. Among some of the bigger Chinese companies trading in the United States are  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) and Baidu Inc. (O:BIDU). 
But discussions about revoking it are a sign of growing frustration by U.S. authorities over a lack of disclosure by Chinese companies widely held by U.S. investors that could lead to a more direct crackdown. It also comes amid rising U.S.-China tensions over Beijing's handling of the coronavirus and its move to curb freedoms in the former British colony of Hong Kong. 
In May, the administration successfully pressured an independent board that oversees a $40 billion international pension fund for federal employees to halt plans to track an index that includes Chinese companies, citing “risks to investors resulting from inadequate investor disclosures and protections under Chinese law.” 
In early June, President Donald Trump assigned a group of officials including Jay Clayton, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the PCAOB, to recommend measures within 60 days to protect U.S investors ""from the failure of the Chinese government to allow PCAOB-registered audit firms to comply with United States securities laws.""
'LONG OVERDUE'
Last week, PCAOB Chairman William Duhnke said he saw ""no prospects"" of being able to properly do its job overseeing disclosures and preventing accounting fraud in China.
Pressure is also mounting from Congress, with the Republican-led Senate passing a bill that, if approved by the Democratic-led House of Representatives and signed into law, would bar securities of any foreign company from being listed on any U.S. securities exchange if it has failed to comply with the PCAOB’s audits for three years in a row.
Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a China hardliner, said it was ""long overdue"" for the administration to take ""decisive action"" on the issue as the Senate has. 
""In addition to terminating this MOU, which allows Chinese companies to openly defy U.S. laws and regulations for financial transparency and accountability, we must address the Chinese Communist Party's exploitation of U.S. capital markets, which is a clear and ongoing risk to U.S. economic and national security,"" he said in a statement to Reuters. 
But some U.S. investors have raised concerns that such moves by Congress could shut them out of high-yield investment opportunities that would remain open to investors in other countries. 
China itself may have helped prompt the latest campaign by Washington to flex its muscle on audits by amending a securities law in March to ban any Chinese person from sharing any securities-related document with regulators overseas without approval from the securities regulatory authority under the state council.
But the limits of the MOU were visible from long before, according to industry figures. The agreement, which is not legally binding, does not allow the PCAOB to conduct inspections of Chinese accounting firms and explicitly permits each side to deny document requests if they violate domestic law or the national interest. 

""The MOU represents a gaping hole in U.S. investor protections, while providing the framework for systemic Chinese fraud,"" said Kyle Bass, a hedge fund manager and vocal critic of China. ""It's unconscionable that the United States continues to allow Chinese companies raising trillions of dollars from U.S. investors to avoid complying with basic U.S. securities and audit standards.”

The U.S.-based company will also divest its canine ear infection treatment product Osurnia and Bayer (OTC:BAYRY)'s feline dewormer Profender to address competition concerns about its acquisition of the German firm's veterinary drugs unit. 
The Competition Bureau said Elanco and Bayer's (DE:BAYGn) animal health unit were each other's closest rivals in several Canadian markets and a potential combination would result in a substantial decrease in competition.
It added that Elanco could not buy Bayer's other poultry insecticides with darkling beetle coverage for 10 years and significant interest in any such product for two years without providing an advance notice to the Bureau.
Bayer's CropScience unit has the Canadian distribution rights to its poultry insecticides Tempo, Credo, QuickBayt and Annihilator Polyzone.

Elanco last month secured European Union antitrust clearance to buy Bayer's veterinary drugs unit after pledging to sell some products to address competition concerns regarding the deal.

ROME (Reuters) - Investors and unions signalled risks ahead of an Italian cabinet meeting late on Tuesday that was expected to consider whether to strip  Atlantia  of its toll road licence following a bridge disaster in 2018. 
Fondazione CRT, which owns nearly 5% in Atlantia (MI:ATL), and a key foreign shareholder in motorway unit Autostrade per l'Italia warned that the government could scare off foreign investors if it revoked Autostrade's licence. 
Employees and small savers would bear the brunt of the government decisions, the investors and unions said. 
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has made clear he believes Autostrade should lose its licence over management failures leading to the collapse of a bridge it operated in the northern city of Genoa. Forty-three people were killed. 
But Conte's fragile coalition government has split over the issue, with some ministers concerned that ditching the concession could trigger a costly legal battle for an already heavily indebted Italian state. 
Neither officials nor company executives could say whether a final ruling would emerge after the cabinet meeting, which was pushed back to 10 p.m. (2000 GMT) from Tuesday morning. 
An Atlantia board meeting on Tuesday morning ended with no decisions, a source close to the matter said. Another source said the board would reconvene on Wednesday morning. The battle over Autostrade, which operates around 3,000 kilometres (1,850 miles) of Italy's highway network, has become intensely political, much of it focusing on the role of the powerful Benetton family, Atlantia's biggest shareholders. 
The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement has been determined to drive the Benettons out of motorways, creating tensions with its coalition partners, who fear a possible hefty compensation claim. 
There has also been concern in the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) and the centrist Italia Viva group over the impact on jobs and the running of the motorways, as well as possible financial market disruptions, if Autostrade is forced to default on some 10 billion euros of debt. 
A key foreign investor in Autostrade told Reuters the company had met all government requests with its last offer tabled on Saturday. 
""There is a very strong proposal on the table and if the government wants to send the company into default it would be a scandal,"" the investor said. 
""We are very worried about the fate of Atlantia's more than 10,000 direct employees and another 10,000 in the supply chain,"" the CISL trade union said in a statement. 

Earlier on Tuesday, Benetton holding company Chairman Gianni Mion said Conte's position on the issue was understandable given the tragedy surrounding the Morandi bridge collapse but the family hoped for a ""fair"" solution.

1557,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 03:18PM ET</span>",China Calls U.K. Ban on Huawei ‘Disappointing and Wrong’,"(Bloomberg) -- U.K.’s ban on Huawei Technologies Co. from its next-generation mobile networks got a swift response from China.
Liu Xiaoming, China’s envoy to Britain, called the decision “disappointing and wrong,” and said it had become “questionable whether the U.K. can provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from other countries.”
Under the blueprint agreed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, operators will not be able to add any new Huawei components to their 5G networks after Dec. 31 this year. All equipment made by the Shenzhen-based company that’s already installed will need to be removed from 5G infrastructure by 2027.
The announcement was a reversal of the position set out by Johnson’s government less than six months ago, and represents a diplomatic victory for Donald Trump, who initially failed to persuade the U.K. to block the company from its networks, but then imposed fresh sanctions against Huawei that forced the retreat. Other countries may now follow.
Trump’s National Security Adviser Robert C. O’Brien, in Paris to discuss China with his European counterparts, welcomed the announcement, saying it “reflects a growing international consensus that Huawei and other untrusted vendors pose a threat to national security, as they remain beholden to the Chinese Communist Party.”
But it is a further blow to British relations with China, which has warned Johnson will face “consequences” if the U.K. treats it as a “hostile partner.” Tensions have grown recently over China’s new security law in Hong Kong, a former British colony, and the handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
‘Confidence Vital’
Johnson, his senior ministers and top security chiefs signed off on the plan at a meeting of the National Security Council on Tuesday morning. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden later set out the details in Parliament. While 5G will be “transformative” for the U.K., “confidence in the security and resilience of the infrastructure it is built upon” is vital, he said.
Ministers also warned operators to stop buying Huawei gear for their fixed full-fiber broadband networks. The government will consult with industry on a timetable for the tighter regime on fixed networks, but said it is expected to come into force within two years.
U.K. Carriers’ High-Cost Estimates on Huawei Ban Raise Doubts
The ban on Huawei will cost U.K. operators as much as 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) to implement, and will delay the rollout of 5G networks by between two and three years, the government said.
BT Group (LON:BT) Plc and Three UK, owned by CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd., rely on Huawei more than other suppliers for their 5G networks, but BT said in a post-market statement it won’t need to pay more than the 500 million pounds it had already budgeted to comply with the less-strict Huawei cap the U.K. government imposed back in January. The company’s shares rose as much as 4%, making them the best-performing stock in the FTSE 100 Index on Tuesday.
A spokesman for  Vodafone  Group (LON:VOD) Plc, which uses Huawei for about a third of its 4G antennas in the U.K., said the company was “disappointed” and that the rollout of 5G would be delayed.
Lobbying Failed
Throughout 2019, the Trump administration lobbied the U.K. to block Huawei from its networks. In January, that effort seemed to have failed, when Johnson’s government announced only a cap on how much technology the Chinese company could supply.
But Trump still had another card to play. In May, the U.S. banned Huawei from sourcing microchips that use American technology. That forced British officials to reassess their view of the security and sustainability of using the company’s equipment in 5G networks.
Britain’s move could prompt Canada to bar Huawei from its 5G networks, and focuses attention on Germany, where pressure is growing in the legislature to act against the company, said James Lewis, director of the technology policy program at the Center for Strategic & International Studies in Washington.
“It’s a win for the Trump administration,” Lewis said in an interview. “They had a plan. They carried it out. And that contributed to this.”
Even without the sanctions move, Johnson might have struggled. Conservative lawmakers were convinced he was underestimating the threat posed by China, and were determined to block Huawei from 5G networks. In a symbolic vote in March they cut Johnson’s parliamentary majority from 80 to 24. Since then the U.K. has gone into lockdown as a result of coronavirus and the confrontation over Hong Kong has escalated, increasing concerns about China.
U.K. Does a U-Turn on China, Forced Into an Uneven Fight
Even after Tuesday’s climbdown, some Conservatives wanted more. Iain Duncan Smith said that while he welcomed the decision, the government should shorten the seven-year timetable. “Let us bring it forward to five and let’s do it quickly,” he told Parliament. His colleague, Bob Seely, said in a statement he too wanted the government to move faster.
Huawei said it is disappointed by the ban and called on ministers to reconsider. “U.K. revenues are less than 1% of Huawei’s global revenues,” Executive Vice President Jeremy Thompson told Bloomberg TV. But he added that “U.K. decisions tend to have a wider impact than just the geography bound by the U.K.”

1558,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 02:40PM ET</span>",Wanted: signs of V-shaped recovery in earnings reports,"By Julien Ponthus and Joice Alves
LONDON (Reuters) - Equity investors are no longer losing sleep over the short-term hit to company earnings from coronavirus lockdowns, instead they are looking for early evidence to support the V-shaped recovery narrative that has lifted stocks out of their mid-March crash.
As Europe Inc starts churning out trading updates expected to show a more than 50% dive on average in second-quarter profits, many investors are keen to see whether the market bounce back can be sustained. 
European stocks have on average risen a whopping 36% from March 16 lows sending their valuations soaring to over 17 times their projected annual profits, well above the historic average of 14 according to Refinitiv data, indicating investors are happy paying a premium to buy stocks despite the uncertainty. 
Many companies pulled their guidance during the peak of the coronavirus crisis, leaving investors in the dark for the rest of the year, prompting them to write off the first-half of 2020.
""One of the things that we're watching for most closely is those companies that did withdraw guidance, do they now feel that they have enough visibility to return (to) giving guidance"", said Sunil Krishnan, head of multi-asset funds at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors.""
Flying blind into the earnings season, investors are eager to get a concrete sense of how companies are coping on the ground. 
""We will be looking at what are the trends in terms of demand, what are the trends in terms of companies' ability to preserve cash during this lockdown"", said Kasper Elmgreen, head of equities at Europe's top asset manager Amundi with 1.53 trillion euros ($604.4 billion) in assets under management.
Rather than basing an investment decision on a company's earnings beating consensus, investors say they will focus on the outlook provided in press releases, press conferences and analyst presentations. 
UBS analysts also stressed the importance of improved visibility. 
""What is more important ... is how the corporate sector views the outlook, the strength of the recovery in regions that have already exited lockdown and what impact the government measures are having on costs,"" they said in a note.
Last week, SAP (DE:SAPG) said its revenues rose 2% with business activity gradually improving in the second quarter. Shares in the German software maker, which kept its full year outlook, rose 6% on the day to a record high.
Mercedes Benz maker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn),  Unilever  (L:ULVR) and Philips (AS:PHG) are some of the big European blue-chips reporting earnings next week.
The latest data from Refinitiv on July 14 showed analysts expect on average profits from companies listed on the pan-European STOXX 600 to fall 56.2% year-on-year in the second-quarter.
For a graphic on Europe valuations:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdpxrbzdpx/Pasted%20image%201594732142989.png
Market mavens however believe there is a big margin for error in second-quarter estimates, given analysts in many cases had no precise outlook to factor into their estimates.
They argue there is a greater chance of companies beating market estimates during the quarter as the dire expectations were set at the height of the coronavirus crisis, but a spike in economic activity in June should have helped lessen the blow.
""We are convinced that the extraordinary fiscal plan implemented worldwide will help earnings to recover quicker than market and analyst expectations and will reinforce the V-shaped recovery in the coming months,"" Guilhem Savry, head of macro and dynamic allocation at asset manager Unigestion said in a note to clients.
While Refinitiv consensus points to earnings quickly starting to grow again from the first quarter of 2021 by 36.8%, it's in part due to the easy comparison in January-March 2020 when profits slumped 38.2%.
At best earnings are expected to go back to pre-coronavirus levels by 2022.

Investing.com – Wall Street turned positive Tuesday, as signs Covid-19 cases in California could be nearing a peak boosted risk sentiment and triggered a recovery in tech stocks.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.39%, the S&P 500 gained 0.82%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.46%.
Cases in California rose by 7,346, compared with an 8,358 increase a day earlier, stoking investor hopes that infection in the state could be flattening. The update comes a day after California shut down all indoor inactivity.   
Tech pared some losses as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) eased from the lows of the day.
The move off lows in the broader market comes as banks kicked off the earnings season. 
Financials held slim gains following mixed earnings from banks as JPMorgan and  Citigroup  beat consensus estimates, thanks to strong trading revenue, while  Wells Fargo  cut its dividend by 80% and reported its first-quarter loss in more than a decade.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) was flat, while Citigroup (NYSE:C) was down more than 3%, and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) fell 5.4%.
The quarterly results provided investors with further insight into the impact from the pandemic on lending activity, as the trio of banks collectively socked away nearly $28 billion to fortify themselves for a potential wave of bad loans.
Elsewhere, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) fell 2.4% after reporting a wider than expected loss and warning that it would be more than two years before the company sees a sustainable recovery.
The start of the earnings season comes as coronavirus cases totalled 3.43 million nationwide, with 138,000 dead so far, stoking investor worries that more states will be forced to roll back reopening measures.
Energy was the biggest gainer on the day, as oil prices remained steady despite ongoing concerns about the strength of the recovery in crude demand.
""There is a lot of concern that if more states begin to shut back down over Covid concerns, that could affect gasoline demand and thus the demand for ethanol,"" said Tomm Pfitzenmaier of Summit Commodity Brokerage.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), up 1.2%, held onto slim gains after Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) lifted its price on the stock to a Street high of $2,322 citing the electric automaker's first-mover advantage."

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) will tell investors on Thursday how home-bound audiences and a lack of live sports have boosted its membership rolls even as streaming competition rises to unprecedented levels.
Shares of the online video pioneer, trading close to an all-time high at $517.94 on Tuesday, have jumped more than 73% since mid-March when much of the world was urged to stay home to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. During the same time, the S&P 500 has gained 32.7%.
In April, Netflix wowed Wall Street by reporting twice the number of expected signups for the first quarter, bringing its worldwide total to 182.9 million customers. The company tried to lower expectations by stressing that the pandemic-related boost likely would fade later. 
Industry analysts still expect robust growth for April through June. The average forecast for new paying customers is 8.1 million globally, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Netflix has forecast 7.5 million customers for the period, which included the release of ""Space Force,"" ""Too Hot to Handle,"" a Jerry Seinfeld comedy special and a new season of ""Money Heist.""
At the same time, movie theaters were closed and major sports leagues canceled live competitions. 
Consumers did, however, have several streaming options. Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Disney+ came online in November, and AT&T Inc launched HBO Max in May.
Netflix boosters believe any pandemic lift will help cement the company's long-term position.
""Investment in high-quality episodic content across all genres and films likely ensures the top spot in the living room over time,"" Cowen & Co analyst John Blackledge wrote in a research note.
One challenge, however, is that the coronavirus has halted many film and TV productions. Investors will look for an update from April, when Netflix said it had enough programming for 2020 and part of 2021. 

Twenty-eight analysts rate Netflix ""buy"" or ""strong buy,"" while 10 say ""hold"" and five recommend selling the stock.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) expects its third-quarter revenue and flight capacity to be around 20% to 25% of last summer, with demand stalling amid a surge in COVID-19 cases and a sustainable industry recovery more than two years away.
""We're at a stall right now,"" Chief Executive Ed Bastian said on Tuesday.
Leisure demand that built up over June for travel to places like Las Vegas, Florida or New York has suffered due to fresh infections and quarantines, while growing to some mountain and international destinations.
Business demand will lag by 12 to 18 months as companies await a COVID-19 vaccine before feeling they can safely put employees back on the road, Bastian said, noting the realization that video calls can sometimes be more efficient.
That doesn't mean business travel will disappear, but 2019 volumes may not return at scale.
""The number of trips that the average road warrior takes I'm sure is going to come down in certain cases,"" he told analysts. 
Shares were down 3.1%.
Delta cut the flights it planned to add in August to 500 from 1,000 as outbreaks accelerate.
The pandemic has forced airlines globally to park planes, cut costs and raise capital to stem losses.
Atlanta-based Delta stuck to its target to halt a daily cash burn, which hit $100 million at the start of the crisis but slowed to $27 million in June, this year though Bastian warned it will hinge on demand, which remains choppy and uncertain.
It sees the July burn rate steady at $27 million a day, with improvements as people feel more comfortable traveling.
Delta, the first U.S. airline to report quarterly results, posted a $2.8 billion adjusted net loss, or $4.43 per share, for the second quarter as passenger revenue plummeted 94% during a season that some analysts call the worst in aviation history.
It had $15.7 billion in liquidity at the end of June and has not decided whether to take a $4.6 billion secured loan under the CARES Act as it eyes other financing involving similar collateral.
It already received $5.4 billion in taxpayer funds to cover payroll through September.
Large U.S. airlines have warned of furloughs in October when the stimulus runs out, but Bastian said he hoped to avoid furloughs after more than 17,000 employees opted for buyouts.
Over 45,000 employees have taken varying short-term leaves.
LIMITED SEATING
Delta may continue blocking middle seats beyond September thanks to demand for comfort but warned it cannot make money filling only 60% of its planes.
""You can't raise prices high enough, particularly when your competition isn't blocking middle seats and has a lot more supply out there,"" Bastian said.
Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) too is limiting seating capacity through September, but rivals American Airlines (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) have added thousands of flights with all seats for sale on hopes of picking up leisure summer demand.
Delta is more geared toward business travel, but Bastian said its SkyMiles loyalty data showed business customers traveling for personal reasons and willing to pay a premium.
Delta, which had been expanding aggressively through international partnerships, wrote down $1.1 billion against its recent LATAM Airlines (SN:LTM) investment and $770 million against Grupo AeroMexico (MX:AEROMEX) after their Chapter 11 filings.

It also booked a $200 million charge against its stake in British airline Virgin Atlantic, which on Tuesday agreed to a private-only rescue deal.

(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co customers canceled orders for 355 of its 737 MAX jets in the first half of 2020, the U.S. planemaker said on Tuesday, as the damage done by the jet's grounding and the coronavirus crisis to the airline industry continued to mount. 
The planemaker, which has now been striving to get its once best-selling MAX planes back in the air for more than a year after two fatal crashes led to its grounding, said airlines and leasing companies canceled another 60 orders for the jet last month.
Deliveries in the first half of the year also sank by 71% to just 70 planes as customers canceled or deferred shipments due to the collapse in air travel from coronavirus-led travel restrictions.
Deliveries are financially important to planemakers because airlines pay most of the purchase price when they actually receive the aircraft.
Boeing said it handed over 10 aircraft in June, up from four planes in May, and six jets in April. 
The June cancellations came from aircraft-leasing firms, including U.S.-based Aviation Capital, Dublin-based Avolon and Singapore's BOC Aviation, which respectively scrubbed 5, 17 and 30 orders for the 737 MAX.
Romanian carrier Blue Air also canceled six 737 MAX orders, with another two 737 MAX orders halted by unidentified customers. 
On the plus side, FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) booked an order for a 767 freighter, taking Boeing's gross orders for the year to 59 planes as of the end of June.
After adjusting for jets ordered in previous years but unlikely to be delivered currently, Boeing has now lost 784 net orders this year, rising from a loss of 602 net orders as of May end.

Boeing's shares were up about 1% at $177.24 in afternoon trading. The stock has fallen about 46% this year, compared with a 2% decline in the S&P 500 index.

1566,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 01:20PM ET</span>",Wall Street banks see trading-revenue renaissance ending soon,"By Imani Moise and Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Big swings in stock and bond markets since March have helped big Wall Street banks weather the coronavirus downturn better than they otherwise might have, but their trading-revenue gains are unlikely to last.
On Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) reported upticks of 77% and 48% in quarterly markets revenue, respectively - far better than what many analysts had predicted. It was the second consecutive period of major trading increases, as investors reacted to a changing portrait of how severe the pandemic might be, as well as government stimulus programs to prop up economies and markets.
But markets are likely to be much less bountiful for bank income statements in the months ahead, executives said.
""Assume it is going to fall in half,"" JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on a conference call. ""We don't assume we have these unbelievable trading results going forward.""
Similarly, Citigroup expects the mega-gains it has seen in its markets business, particularly bond trading, to ""normalize"" in the second half of the year, Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said.
In the first half, trading generated $13.4 billion in revenue for Citigroup. That was about one-third of total revenue, up from one-quarter in the first six months of 2019.
At JPMorgan, trading accounted for $18.7 billion in revenue through June, representing about 30% of total revenue, up from 22% in the comparable period last year.
Analysts expect similar trends at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and Bank of America (N:BAC) when they report results later this week. However, they are not putting much weight behind such a volatile business line - especially as banks are preparing for a wave of pandemic-fueled loan losses.
""No one is expecting trading to sustain anywhere near these levels,"" Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr said.
The trading-revenue renaissance, brief as it may be, follows a decade of structural and regulatory changes that made the business far less profitable for banks.
It has been a strange turnaround to celebrate, since it coincides with a global pandemic that has so far killed at least 572,945 people, and crippled parts of the economy.

1569,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 12:55PM ET</span>","BlackRock cast tougher climate votes, environmentalists want more","By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) released figures showing it took a tougher stance on climate matters in the springtime proxy season, though it drew criticism from environmentalists claiming the top asset manager failed to back up its recent emphasis on the area.
BlackRock of New York said in a report on Tuesday that it voted against management at 53 companies worldwide, most of them energy companies, for ""lack of progress"" on climate concerns during the 2020 proxy season, and warned another 191 companies to take faster action.
A BlackRock spokesman said via email its critical voting at 53 companies compared to critical votes it cast at six companies in 2019, indicating a tougher overall approach.
With some $7 trillion under management BlackRock wields much influence on Corporate America's boardrooms. Under pressure from clients and activists, BlackRock had said it would put a new focus on climate change concerns after supporting shareholder resolutions on the topic only about 10% of the time in the past.
Tuesday's numbers included votes that BlackRock cast for resolutions and against directors, breaking with management recommendations, and was not directly comparable to the 10% figure. 
Of the 53 companies, 37 were energy companies with a market capitalization of $408 billion, BlackRock said.
In its report BlackRock cited votes like those it cast against directors at ExxonMobil Corp (N:XOM) this year, which were previously disclosed, for reasons including ""Exxon’s failure to have clear, long-term greenhouse gas reduction targets.""
Ben Cushing, a representative of U.S. environmental group Sierra Club, said BlackRock should have voted critically more often rather than giving out warnings.

""BlackRock took only baby steps forward by voting the right way on a fraction of the climate tests on the table, and claiming that stronger action is on the way,"" Cushing said via email.

1570,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 12:36PM ET</span>","Traders Set Record Bets on Amazon, Chinese Stocks Jumping Higher","(Bloomberg) -- Beneath the surface of the highest-flying stock markets in the world, animal spirits keep rampaging like rarely seen before.
Even as tech investors pause for breath after powering U.S. benchmarks from Covid lows, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). is still seeing historic demand for call contracts so bullish they only have an estimated one-in-ten chance of paying off.
With the company’s shares up 66% this year, traders are bidding up the price of options that have it jumping another 50% in the next three months. Contracts betting on the online retailer to reach $4,600 by October were among the most-traded calls for that expiry month on Monday.
The speculative frenzy is a similar story for  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. -- all signs that options traders see value in wagering that the biggest stock winners will keep winning.
Fresh risk appetite is on display in another momentum-driven market eliciting cheers and fears on Wall Street. Demand for bullish contracts on a $3.5 billion China exchange-traded fund has jumped by the most ever in the wake of that country’s euphoric stock rally, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG.
With potential losses capped at the amount paid for call options, many investors see little risk in shelling out for bets on more windfall gains.
“It’s all FOMO related,” Susquehanna’s derivatives strategist Chris Murphy wrote in an email. “Skeptical about buying after a rally but don’t want to miss out on further upside.”
In Amazon stock trading, the implied volatility of way out-of-the-money calls has surged to a record relative to at-the-money contracts -- a sign of outsize bullish demand in a key corner of the derivatives market.
Traders are also chasing fresh upside in Chinese equities after the country’s influential state media stoked bullish enthusiasm. Call skew, a measure of the implied volatility of calls versus puts, has jumped by a record for BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).’s iShares China Large-Cap ETF, or FXI, according to Credit Suisse.
“The last time we saw such a dramatic bid for upside calls was in April 2015, after FXI surged 24% in a month, leading to an euphoric chase in the options market,” Mandy Xu, equity derivatives strategist, wrote in a note. “Unfortunately, the rally proved to be short-lived, with FXI falling 3% in the month after and over 20% in the following three months.”
With Monday’s reversal in the mega caps and technical momentum measures stretched, there are good reasons for caution. One measure of implied volatility for the Nasdaq 100 index, derived from call and put contracts, has climbed by 8 points in the past week even as the benchmark has advanced.
Still, with the put-call ratio for the tech gauge on Friday slumping to the lowest since March, speculative mania seems to be overshadowing hedging activity.
“This appears to be true upside panic/FOMO ahead of earnings this month,” Murphy wrote in a note.

1572,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 12:10PM ET</span>","Crowded trade, high valuations: why investors worry about tech stocks","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some investors are getting increasingly worried about the outlook for technology and big growth stocks after a massive rally which has pushed the Nasdaq Composite index to record highs despite the coronavirus-inflicted economic damage.
Few can complain about the performance of the S&P 500 Growth index, whose components range from Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) to medical device maker ResMed Inc and is up more than 10% for the year to date while the broad S&P 500 remains down 2% over the same time. Instead, investors say the popularity of tech and growth stocks at a time of global economic uncertainty has left their valuations stretched and primed them for a decline.
""Yesterday was a first warning shot for growth stocks and it might take a few weeks for the trade to come undone. Watch for Nasdaq volatility to be compressed as risk is priced out with common sense,"" said Sebastien Galy, a senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management, referring to a technology sell-off late Monday. ""The clock is ticking, significant prudence is warranted.""
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5% early Tuesday, while the broad S&P 500 posted small gains, marking the second consecutive day that the Nasdaq underperformed the overall market.
Overall, 74% of global fund managers are long tech stocks, making it the most-crowded trade in the multi-decade history of the Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Fund Manager survey.
Such lopsided trades often result in subsequent underperformance, a Reuters analysis found. The ""best short is tech stocks given positioning and stretched performance,"" analysts at the firm noted in a report. 
Further economic shutdowns in California, which has seen a surge in coronavirus cases, could also weigh on tech and growth stocks, said Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell.
""California is specifically a tech haven, so this is going to have a disproportionate effect on tech stocks,"" Campbell says. ""That is the home of American tech, if that spreads further, if lockdown restrictions get tighter in California, then this will eventually get a knock-on effect on those big tech firms.""
An increase in inflation-adjusted interest rates should benefit value stocks at the expense of popular companies such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, said billionaire investor Bill Gross. 
""Value stocks, versus growth stocks, should be an investor's preference in the near-term future,"" Gross wrote.

1574,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 11:54AM ET</span>",U.S. Banks Signal No V Recovery With Provisions Near 2008 Record,"(Bloomberg) -- Swift action from the Federal Reserve and U.S. government staved off a pandemic-led spike in missed loan payments. The message from the nation’s biggest banks: It’s coming.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. set aside almost $28 billion for bad loans in the second quarter, a mark only surpassed by the last three months of 2008, during the depths of the financial crisis. The total was higher than analysts had expected, with all three lenders saying their economic outlook had deteriorated as the coronavirus continues to rage through the U.S.
Even as unemployment surged, stimulus programs have helped individuals stay current on debts and many have taken advantage of payment-deferral options from banks. JPMorgan said delinquencies in its biggest consumer loan categories were down or unchanged from a year earlier, and a majority of credit-card and mortgage customers who got deferrals had still made payments.
“This is not a normal recession. The recessionary part of this you’re going to see down the road,” JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said Tuesday. “You will see the effect of this recession. You’re just not going to see it right away because of all the stimulus.”
For Wells Fargo, the biggest loan-loss provision in its history led to the bank’s first net loss since 2008 and an 80% cut to its dividend. JPMorgan and Citigroup’s trading desks seized on huge market swings to deliver record quarters, helping those firms maintain profitability.JPMorgan traders shattered their previous revenue record by more than $2 billion, while Citigroup’s 68% jump in fixed-income revenue beat even the most optimistic analyst estimates. The biggest Wall Street firms, after years of questions about whether their trading businesses were permanently broken, have benefited from a roller-coaster 2020. After the pandemic drove stocks into the fastest bear market ever in March, the S&P 500 mounted one of the biggest rallies in nine decades, boosted by stimulus measures and optimism over a swift economic rebound.
But even buoyant markets couldn’t halt the pain from the new economic reality prompted by the U.S.’s failure to contain the spread of coronavirus in ways other nations have. JPMorgan now expects the unemployment rate to remain above 10% for all of 2020, and fall only to 7.7% by the end of next year.
The second-quarter provisions bring the three banks’ 2020 total to $47 billion, more than those firms set aside in the last three years combined. Shares of all three companies slipped Tuesday with Wells Fargo down as much as 8.2% in the first hour of trading.
The pessimism of banks’ forecasts stands in stark relief to the predictions coming out of Washington. The White House has touted a sharp economic bounce, and said it’s intact even as the virus surges again and threatens new waves of lockdowns.
“I don’t see an interruption to the V-shaped recovery,” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Fox News on Monday. “If there is one, I’ll be honest and factful about it. But at the moment, with our fingers crossed and some prayers, I think we’re on track for a very strong second half of the year, probably still 20% growth plus.”The strains have yet to show on the consumer side. Citigroup’s non-accrual consumer loans fell 7% from a year earlier. JPMorgan’s total net charge-offs were almost half what was expected.
“It’s fair to say right now, given where we are in the crisis, that the relationship between the business cycle and the health of the business sector and the health of the household sector is broken,” JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said.
Loans to companies have started to sour. Wells Fargo’s nonperforming assets jumped 22% from the first quarter, largely driven by loans to the oil and gas and commercial real estate industries. The bank boosted its reserve for credit losses by $8.4 billion in the period, with more than three-quarters of the increase coming on the commercial side. Citigroup said its roughly $3.5 billion boost to wholesale lending reserves was partly driven by a slew of credit-rating downgrades.
“There’s significantly more reserves against non-investment grade names,” Citigroup CFO Mark Mason said. “Within that non-investment grade bucket, we’ve seen a lot of further downgrades.”
Still, the banks’ provisions are more about future pain than anything in current results. New accounting rules have pushed lenders to do more forecasting and try to get ahead of losses before they appear. The three banks increased their reserves by $23 billion, $7 billion more than the previous record.
“We’re just guessing,” Dimon said. “We are prepared for the worst case. We simply don’t know.”

1575,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 11:36AM ET</span>","UK to purge Huawei from 5G by end of 2027, siding with Trump over China","By Paul Sandle and Guy Faulconbridge
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered Huawei equipment to be purged completely from Britain's 5G network by the end of 2027, risking the ire of China by signalling that the world's biggest telecoms equipment maker is not welcome in the West.
As Britain prepares to cast off from the European Union, fears over the security of Huawei have forced Johnson to choose between global rivals the United States and China. 
He had been under intense pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, while Beijing had warned London, which has sought to court China in recent years, that billions in investment would be at risk if it sided with Washington.
Reversing a January decision to allow Huawei to supply up to 35% of the non-core 5G network, Johnson banned British telecoms operators from buying any 5G equipment from Huawei by year-end and gave them seven years to rip out existing gear. 
""This has not been an easy decision, but it is the right one for the UK telecoms networks, for our national security and our economy, both now and indeed in the long run,"" digital minister Oliver Dowden told parliament. 
""By the time of the next election, we will have implemented in law an irreversible path for the complete removal of Huawei equipment from our 5G networks."" 
The reason given for the about-turn was the impact of new U.S. sanctions on chip technology, which Britain's National Cyber Security Centre, part of the GCHQ eavesdropping agency, had told ministers meant Huawei was not a reliable supplier.
Tuesday's decision will delay the roll-out of 5G -- cast as the nervous system of the future economy -- by two to three years, and add costs of up to 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion).
The Dec. 31, 2027 deadline will please British telecoms operators such as BT (L:BT),  Vodafone  (L:VOD) and Three (HK:0215), which had feared they would be forced to spend billions of pounds to rip out Huawei equipment much faster.
Shares in BT, Britain's biggest mobile operator, rose 4%.
5G PROXY WAR?
Hanging up on Huawei marks an end to what former Prime Minister David Cameron cast as a ""golden era"" of ties which saw Britain pushed as Europe's top destination for Chinese capital.
But London has been dismayed by a crackdown in Hong Kong and the perception China did not tell the whole truth over the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Huawei [HWT.UL] said the decision was more about U.S. trade policy than security. 
""It threatens to move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital divide,"" a spokesman said.
In what some have compared to the Cold War antagonism with the Soviet Union, the United States is worried that 5G dominance could lead towards Chinese technological supremacy.
After Australia first raised alarms about the risk of 5G being hijacked by a hostile state, the West has become steadily more worried about Huawei. https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/huawei-usa-campaign
The United States calls the company an agent of the Chinese Communist state -- a view widely supported in Johnson's own Conservative Party. Huawei denies it spies for China and says the United States wants to frustrate its growth because no U.S. company offers the same technology at a competitive price.
HUAWEI ALTERNATIVE?
British ministers say the rise to global dominance of Huawei, founded in 1987 by a former People's Liberation Army engineer, has caught the West off-guard.
Dowden said Britain was working with its intelligence allies to foster a group of rivals to Huawei, naming firms from Finland, Sweden, South Korea and Japan.
""The first thing we need to do is ensure that we protect the other two vendors in this market, so Nokia (HE:NOKIA), and Ericsson (ST:ERICb),"" Dowden said. ""Secondly we need to get new suppliers in, that starts with Samsung (KS:005930), and it starts with NEC (T:6701).""
Nokia and Ericsson said they stood ready to replace Huawei gear. 
By allowing Huawei's equipment to remain in the 5G network until end-2027 and in older mobile networks, Johnson stopped short of demands from some lawmakers for a ban in four years. 
China has said targeting its technology flagship would have far-reaching ramifications, and its ambassador to London warned last week that a U-turn on Huawei would send a bad message to other Chinese businesses.

Chinese imports to Britain doubled in the 15 years to 2018, to about 9% of all goods imported, worth 43 billion pounds.

1576,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 11:32AM ET</span>",Mohawk Industries Subpoenaed on Allegedly Fabricated Sales,"By Christiana SciaudoneInvesting.com --  Mohawk Industries  (NYSE:MHK) dropped 4% after the company disclosed that it has been subpoenaed by the SEC and the U.S. Attorney, ahead of an investor lawsuit filed days later.
The flooring maker received the subpoenas on June 25 from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on “topics similar” to those in a June 29 investor complaint filed against Mohawk and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Lorberbaum.
The complaint alleges that Mohawk engaged in fabricating revenues by attempting delivery to customers that were closed and recognizing these attempts as sales. The lawsuit also accused the company of reporting higher operating margins and maintaining significant inventory that was not salable. It alleges that the company valued certain inventory improperly or improperly delivered inventory with knowledge that it was defective and customers would return it.
Shares are down 45% in 2020. Mohawk has six buy ratings, two holds and five sells, according to data compiled by Investing.com.
Mohawk said the company intends to vigorously defend itself in the lawsuit, and that it is well-positioned with a strong balance sheet and limited debt after recently issuing more than $1 billion of long term bonds.
On July 1, Robbins LLP, a shareholder rights law firm, said it was investigating the company for fabricating revenue."
1577,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 11:18AM ET</span>",Fee War Hit Its Limit With Fund That Paid You to Invest,"(Bloomberg) -- The wave of cost-cutting that has been sweeping the more than $6 trillion global market for exchange-traded funds for the past two years may finally have reached its limit.
In the space of a few weeks, the first and only fund that paid people to invest has switched to a new owner and started to charge, while one of the few “zero-fee” ETFs has been shut down completely.
The two products were unrelated, but the twin events look like confirmation of what many in the industry have long believed: The fee war could only go so far. Now they’re preparing for what they hope will be a new era that places more value on strategy and returns than on price point.
“ETFs have come to a new stage of development where the fee war is only part of the story,” said Linda Zhang, chief executive officer of Purview Investments in New York. “The next phase of the story is who is able to provide better performing products, net of fee.”
If that happens it’ll be a sea change for the passive industry.
Faced with an increasingly competitive landscape -- at last count there were roughly 2,200 ETFs in the U.S. alone -- issuers have been slashing expense ratios amid the desperate fight to lure assets.
While it left plenty of experts wondering how they were making money and fretting potential hidden costs, for investors it should have been a dream come true.
Alongside cuts to trading commissions it meant even the smallest among them could buy an ETF through their favorite broker for peanuts then pay nothing for its annual management fee. Yet it seems not many took advantage.
Salt Financial made headlines last year by releasing the Salt Low TruBeta U.S. Market ETF (LSLT) which would temporarily pay investors, with holders receiving 50 cents for every $1,000 -- until it grew to $100 million or April 2020 when a $2.90 management fee could kick in.
The ETF never managed to raise more than about $12 million, and the issuer announced last month that the fund -- along with another Salt product, the Salt High TruBeta U.S. Market ETF (SLT) -- would be acquired by Pacer Advisors. It started charging the $2.90 fee in May.
“Even though it worked in the sense that it raised assets, it didn’t raise them enough for us to feel that being in the retail business made sense,” said Alfred Eskandar, co-founder and president of Salt Financial, which still supplies the indexes for LSLT and SLT. “People are starting to see through that, they’re realizing it’s about quality, it’s about the uniqueness of the strategy, it’s about performance.”
The market turmoil caused by the coronavirus may have accelerated that trend, as traders navigate the extreme volatility and seek out investments that can thrive in what could be a new economic era.
Michael Venuto, chief investment officer of Toroso Investments, points to the outperformance of some thematic funds and actively managed offerings like the Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) as the latest craze occupying investor attention.
“The fee war for beta is pretty much over,” he said. “We’ve seen a lot of people that are done with the fee war and are now interested in, ‘what can I buy that will do better than the market?’”
That’s not to say Venuto thinks zero-fee is dead. Last year, he helped Social Finance Inc., an online lender known as SoFi, unveil two funds without fees, the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) and the SoFi Next 500 ETF (SFYX).
SFY currently has $95 million in assets and SFYX has $11 million. Venuto says the tactic was more for the benefit of SoFi’s existing investors than to attract new ones, and will continue indefinitely for the two products.
In Australia, a different picture: The Pinnacle aShares Dynamic Cash Fund Managed Fund (Z3RO) was a money-market like fund aiming to pay above the official interest rate without management fees. The fund was suspended last month with A$4 million ($2.7 million) in assets, less than a year after its launch.
In a statement to the Australian stock exchange, Pinnacle Fund Services Ltd. said it considers it unlikely the fund “will reach sufficient scale to be economically viable.”
If zero-fee funds did disappear, it wouldn’t necessarily signal a rich new era of profits for ETF issuers. Industry competition remains fierce, especially between giant asset managers like BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). and Vanguard Group, the two largest players.
Just last month, BlackRock lowered the cost on its biggest ETF, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) to match a Vanguard Group rival. For Ben Johnson, co-head of passive strategy at Morningstar Inc., it’s like rival gas stations on the same strip, each trying to undercut the other on an identical product.
“At some point you can’t go any lower,” Johnson said. “When you draw near to that zero bound, the incremental gain to the end investors doesn’t mean a whole heck of a lot.”

Meanwhile, plenty of other issuers are nipping at their heels, seeking to steal some of that dominant market share.
BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) recently launched the first zero-fee bond fund, the BNY Mellon Core Bond ETF (BKAG) as well as another zero-fee product tracking big American companies, the BNY Mellon US Large Cap Core Equity ETF (BKLC).
Their success may ultimately depend more on the funds than on their fees, however.

Tesla can appeal the ruling.
The case was brought by Germany's Wettbewerbszentrale, an industry sponsored body tasked with policing anti-competitive practices. 
The Munich court agreed with the industry body's assessment and banned Tesla Germany from including ""full potential for autonomous driving"" and ""Autopilot inclusive"" in its German advertising materials.
It said such claims amounted to misleading business practices, adding that the average buyer might be given the impression that the car could drive without human intervention and might suggest such a system was now legal on German roads.
Tesla's autopilot system has drawn criticism from regulators, including from the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States, saying it lacks safeguards.
Concerns have grown about assistance systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches with little or no human intervention, tempting drivers to neglect their obligation to be in control of their vehicles at all times.
Tesla has said it has informed customers that its automated driver assistance technology did not amount to a fully autonomous driving system.
A spokeswoman for Tesla Germany was not immediately available to comment on Tuesday's ruling.
Tesla's Chief Executive Elon Musk said this month the electric car manufacturer was close to making its cars capable of automated driving without any need for driver input, so-called Level 5 autonomy.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three of the largest U.S. banks said on Tuesday they had set aside a whopping $28 billion for loan losses, in a stark reminder that much of the economic pain from the coronavirus pandemic is still to come.
Borrowers have been propped up by trillions of dollars in government and bank assistance, cheap credit and loan forbearance programs, but some of that support is going away, and banks said they fear losses will spike. 
""The consumers' incomes are up, savings are up and home prices up,"" said JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co CEO Jamie Dimon said on a call with journalists. ""The recessionary part"" will come later, he said.
JPMorgan and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) each reported huge second-quarter profit declines on Tuesday, while  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co posted its first loss since 2008. 
Banks with big Wall Street businesses were able to offset their loan woes with huge gains in capital markets revenue, particularly trading. The rough results were almost entirely due to loan-loss provisions.
The unprecedented government aid programs have created a disconnect between the financial markets and the economy, such that financial conditions look sunny, but could turn upside down quickly if the temporary assistance expires.
Executives warned that there is still a lot of guesswork involved. Under new accounting rules, lenders have to reserve for the entire life of a loan upfront. That would be tricky under normal circumstances, but when a deadly virus is hitting the economy in unpredictable waves, it is especially hard to say how long the downturn might last.
More than 13 million people have been infected by the disease globally and at least 572,945 have died since the outbreak began in early December. 
To prevent its spread, governments across the world have imposed varying degrees of lockdowns, causing widespread business closures, layoffs and retractions in spending. 
(GRAPHIC: https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-MAP/0100B59S39E/index.html)
The U.S. unemployment rate hit 11.1% in June while gross domestic product (GDP) fell 5% during the first quarter, according to government data. 
JPMorgan is assuming unemployment will remain in the double-digits through the first half of 2021, while Citigroup expects GDP to fall by more than 35% before recovering, executives said.
The biggest lending concerns center on credit cards, which tend to be riskier and, unlike mortgages or auto loans, do not have any collateral for a bank to recoup if a borrower defaults.
The business has not yet seen major upheaval. Although spending declined because of lockdowns, borrowers used stimulus checks to stay current or pay off debt. 
Citigroup, one of the biggest card lenders in the world, saw delinquency and default rates decline in the second quarter.
Wall Street businesses did well, however. JPMorgan's bond-trading business reported a 99% increase in revenue, while Citigroup's rose 68%. 
That bodes well for  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), which announce results later this week.
Wells Fargo does not have a large investment bank, and is still dealing with the aftermath of a sales scandal that erupted in 2016. Its $2.4 billion quarterly loss was much larger than analysts had expected, and the bank expects things to get worse.
""Our view of the length and severity of the economic downturn has deteriorated considerably,"" said CEO Charlie Scharf.

(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co beat Wall Street estimates for profit in the second quarter due to a surge in trading revenue, while it set aside a record $10.5 billion to brace for rising defaults as the United States slides into one of the worst recessions in decades.
The biggest U.S. lender's loan loss provision reflects the damage wreaked by the coronavirus pandemic, but its performance in markets bodes well for trading powerhouses Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), both of which report later this week.
JPMorgan's trading revenue surged 77% in a quarter that saw record-breaking volumes in financial markets. Bond trading alone generated $7.3 billion in revenue as central banks bought billions more in government paper under the huge stimulus programs to deal with the pandemic.
While executives had indicated that Wall Street trading desks would set records in the quarter, the jump was well beyond expectations.
The bank's shares rose 2.2% as both profit and revenue beat Refinitiv's consensus estimates, but the reserve build of $8.9 billion painted a grim picture for future quarters.
Chief Executive Jamie Dimon warned this was not a normal recession and that the tell-tale signs of a downturn may only be visible early next year.
""The consumer's incomes are up, savings are up and home prices are up. The recessionary part will come later,"" Dimon said.
The bank is now expecting double-digit unemployment in the United States through the first half of 2021, but warned that it may not have much visibility into the damage it is dealing with.
""Compared to the first quarter, our reserve build now assumes a more protracted downturn ... as we prepare and reserve for something worse than our base case,"" Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said in a media call.
Dimon also said the bank would continue to pay dividend unless ""the economic situation deteriorates materially and significantly"". However, the lender suspended share buybacks at least through the end of the third quarter.
RECORD LOAN LOSSES
The scale of expected loan losses at JPMorgan, America's largest bank by assets and one of the biggest in the world, is a major barometer of the health of the U.S. economy, as the pandemic drives up unemployment and puts pressure on businesses.
The loan-loss provision was a record for the bank, and came on a day when  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) also set aside their biggest credit loss provisions since the 2008-09 financial crisis.
A new accounting rule requires banks to take provisions now if a borrower may default at any point during the agreement, even if that is months or years away.
The bank's net income fell to $4.69 billion, or $1.38 per share, in the quarter ended June 30, ahead of analysts' lowered estimates of $1.04 per share. Revenue rose 15% to $33.8 billion, also beating estimates.
Net interest margin fell to 1.99% from 2.37% in the first quarter. Trading revenue surged to $11.3 billion.

Apart from trading, the bank's commercial banking and asset & wealth management units also reported higher numbers compared to the year-ago period.

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co posted its first quarterly loss since the 2008 financial crash on Tuesday as the coronavirus crisis forced it to set aside $9.57 billion to cover potential loan losses and slash its dividend, derailing efforts to recover from a sales scandal.
The bank's earnings have suffered since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic as it does not have a strong capital markets business to lean on like its Wall Street peers.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co beat Wall Street estimates for profit in the second quarter as trading revenue surged, even as it set aside a record $10.5 billion to brace for rising defaults, while  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) posted a 73% drop in profit.
Wells Fargo reported a net loss of $2.4 billion, or 66 cents per share, for the second quarter ended June 30, compared with a profit of $6.2 billion, or $1.30 per share, in the year-earlier period. 
Analysts had expected Wells Fargo to report a loss of 20 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data. 
""We are anticipating weak results for Wells; these were awful,"" Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders said. 
""This will be the toughest quarter for the banking industry since the financial crisis in 2008, and Wells results will be the worst of the bunch as the Fed's asset cap makes an already challenging environment even more difficult,"" he added. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve has placed an asset cap on Wells Fargo as a penalty for its misdeeds.
Wells Fargo also reported an operating loss of $1.2 billion, mainly due to customer remediation accruals, suggesting that the sales scandal was still hurting the bank and its results.
Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf promised changes to improve the bank's performance and said while the hit from the pandemic was unprecedented, its franchise should perform better.
""We are extremely disappointed in both our second quarter results and our intent to reduce our dividend. Our view of the length and severity of the economic downturn has deteriorated considerably from the assumptions used last quarter,"" Scharf said.
U.S. lenders began building up reserves in the first quarter to cover defaults from consumers and companies as the COVID-19 pandemic slammed the brakes on the economy, but with cases again surging, the scale of the likely losses remains anyone's guess. 
Wells Fargo set aside $9.57 billion in credit loss provisions, up from $503 million a year earlier.

The San Francisco-based bank also cut its dividend for the third quarter to 10 cents per share from 51 cents previously to reflect the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent curbs on bank dividends.

Investing.com --U.S. stocks opened lower on Tuesday as the country’s biggest banks took a massive hit in their second-quarter earnings from the coronavirus pandemic.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) reported provisions against actual or possible credit losses of just under $28 billion in the quarter, reflecting the huge wave of corporate and personal insolvencies that followed the imposition of lockdowns across the country in the spring.
JPMorgan and Citigroup stock fell 0.5% and 2.2% respectively, although the losses were cushioned by the fact that their markets divisions – notably their bond traders – reaped windfall profits from a flight to safe assets by clients in April and May. Wells Fargo stock, by contrast, fell 7.5% owing to the lack of any such counterweight.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 50 points, or 0.2% at 26,035 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was down less than 0.1%.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock also fell 2.9% after the company warned that it will take more than two years to see a sustainable recovery in air travel.
The results of the first three big banks to report also pulled other financial stocks lower:  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) stock lost 1.7% while Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock fell 1.6%.
Christopher Smart, chief strategist at the Barings Investment Institute, said in e-mailed comments that, even though the market may avoid another rout, it can't carry on defying gravity forever.
""The logic is that good news is good news and bad news is good news,"" Smart said with a nod to how investors jump on any sign of an economic rebound, but interpret bad news as a herald of still more fiscal and monetary stimulus. ""The 'pandemic put' won't last forever.""
Elsewhere, Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) stock fell 4% after UBS cut the streaming compay's rating, saying the market was now overestimating its ability to contain costs and monetize its content. UBS also cut Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock to hold from buy. It fell 3.0%.
U.S. crude oil futures also fell Tuesday on what was interpreted by another sign of potential weakness in U.S. demand in the near term. Both stocks and oil had already fallen sharply in late trading on Monday after California reversed much of its economic reopening in an attempt to stem the surge of coronavirus infections, but oil had stabilized overnight on the back of data showing record buying by Chinese importers in June.

“Is it time to redeploy capital after an amazing run? Resoundingly, we think the answer is NO,” Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) analyst Alexander Potter wrote in a note. “In our view, Tesla is the most consequential company in the mobility ecosystem, and this is unlikely to change in the next decade.”
Potter lifted his price target to $2,322, the highest among the 30 analyst targets tracked by Bloomberg, from $939, a target he’s held since April. The new price target implies another 55% of upside over the next 12 months.
Tesla gained 4.2% to $1,560 in premarket trading, setting it up to erase Monday’s 3.1% dip. No stranger to volatility, the stock has been on a relentless rally, more than tripling since the start of the year and advancing 60% in the past month alone. That compares to a 21% gain in the high-flying Nasdaq 100 for the year, or 9.7% in the past month.
The reasons behind the gains aren’t always clear. Improving operations and profitability, a potential for “game-changing” battery technology at an upcoming event, short covering and a potential inclusion in the S&P 500 Index have all helped push the price higher.
The surge has added $202.3 billion to its market value -- or more than Exxon (NYSE:XOM) Mobil’s entire market cap these days -- and propelled it to displace  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp. as the world’s biggest carmaker by stock value. An average of 17.7 million shares have traded hands daily since the beginning of the year, more than double the activity in the same period last year.
Much of the trading has come from retail investors clamoring to get into the growing electric vehicle space. On the Robinhood trading app, more than 40,000 accounts took positions in Tesla in a single four-hour span on Monday. It was the 10th most popular stock on the platform.
Still, not everyone is cheering the run. The stock last week was poised to cross $20 billion in short interest bets, the first to do so, according to data from S3 Partners. Amid the rally, the skeptics have suffered more than $18 billion in mark-to-market losses, including $4.1 billion in losses in July alone.
“If Tesla’s stock price continues to trend upward, we expect even more short covering as mark-to-market losses accumulate,” S3 said in its July 9 report.

The New York-based bank reported a profit of $1.32 billion, or 50 cents per share, for the three months ended June 30, down from $4.8 billion, or $1.95 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 5% to $19.77 billion. Analysts on average had estimated $19.12 billion in revenue and earnings of 28 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data.
The largest U.S. banks have so far stashed away more than $52 billion to prepare for potential losses this year as the economy heads into one of its worst recessions in decades.
So far Citi, the third largest credit card issuer in the United States, has offered forbearance on 2 million credit card accounts representing 6% of balances, the bank said. 
Total loans fell marginally to $685 billion. 
End of period deposits, however, surged 18% to $1.23 trillion at Citi as stimulus programs left consumers and corporate clients with more cash to help them ride out the economic consequences of the pandemic. 
Trading fees, a bright spot for many banks in financial markets' roller-coaster ride since February, helped offset rock-bottom interest rates that make it harder for banks to earn money on lending, with bond trading revenues up 68%. 
Net interest income, or the difference between what a bank pays for deposits and earns from loans, was down 7%.
Another source of support was an increase in fees from follow-on issues and new debt issuance as companies looked to shore up their financial position to weather the COVID-19 pandemic. Investment banking revenue rose 37% year-over-year. 

Shares of the lender were up 1.5% in premarket trading.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Bill Gross is predicting that value stocks like  IBM  (N:IBM) and  Altria Group  (N:MO) are likely to fare better than growth stocks like Apple (O:AAPL) or Amazon.com (O:AMZN) in the near term, due to a correlation with real interest rates.
U.S. real yields - which adjust for inflation - have been declining in response to the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary actions over the past few months to limit the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. The yield on the 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS)  has been trading with a negative yield since late March and is now minus 0.803%, near an all-time-low. 
Gross, who co-founded Pacific Investment Management Company, then spent four years at Janus Henderson before leaving in 2019 to manage his own money, said that the reason that the ""Fab 5 stocks"" and growth stocks in general had done ""so fabulously well"" centers on falling real interest rates that ""are still reaching historic lows."" Gross is referring to a clutch of high-performing stocks: Amazon, Facebook (O:FB), Apple, Netflix (O:NFLX) and Google's parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL), according to his spokesperson. 
The yields of TIPS are highly correlated with growth stocks, but have far less of an effect on the prices of traditional value stocks, he wrote. 
The future price disparity of Microsoft (O:MSFT), Apple and Amazon ""is subject to an ongoing decline in real rates, which to my mind, have seen their best days,"" Gross said. ""Value stocks, versus growth stocks, should be an investor's preference in the near-term future,"" he writes.
Gross said that as well as IBM and Altria, he likes stocks such as midstream company Enterprise Products Partners (N:EPD) and pharmaceutical giant AbbVie (N:ABBV).

At current levels, “investor fears seem to have disappeared and the current stock price increasingly reflects many of the long-term business moat dynamics,” he wrote. While the company’s long-term narrative remains intact, “we would rather be constructive at levels when a mix of potential subscriber volatility, FCF dynamics & competition are better reflected in the share price.”
UBS is not the only firm to grow somewhat cautious about Netflix at current levels. Wedbush reiterated its underperform rating on Tuesday, warning that despite a tailwind from shelter-in-place orders, “we expect content spending to trigger substantial cash burn for many years.” The firm raised its price target to $220 from $198, but warned that “competition for both content and subscribers may slow growth and limit the potential for price increases.”
Recently, Rosenblatt Securities wrote that it “struggle[s] to see the upside” from current levels given “uncertainty over how [long] this favorable environment will last.” Imperial Capital downgraded the stock last week.
Currently, the average price target on Netflix shares stands near $476, implying downside of about 10% from current levels.

1596,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 07:40AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Higher as JPM Beats; Dow Futures Up 157 Points,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to edge higher at the open Tuesday, rebounding slightly after Monday’s late drop, helped by trading numbers from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). However, trading is likely to be cautious trading given a flare-up in Sino-U.S. tensions, new coronavirus restrictions and fresh corporate earnings.
At 07:40 AM ET (1140 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 13 points, or 0.4%, higher, Nasdaq Futures up 48 points, or 0.5%. The Dow Futures contract rose 157 points, or 0.6%.
There remains a degree of optimism surrounding this upcoming earnings season, despite FactSet estimating that S&P 500 companies overall will post a 10% decline in revenue and a 45% drop in earnings in the quarter. 
With this in mind, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock climbed 2.4% premarket after posting record trading revenue in its second quarter, even though its net profit fell by nearly half from a year ago due to a mammoth $10.8 billion charge for provisions against bad loans.
Rivals  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) are also set to reporting second-quarter results before the opening bell.
On Monday, the S&P 500 closed 0.9% lower, the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended flat, giving up early gains after California moved to shut down all indoor business activities.  
The move by the most populous U.S. state came as the recent surge in the spread of the virus across hotspots, also including Florida, Arizona, and Texas, took the total U.S. infections to just under 3.4 million with around 135,000 deaths nationwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Adding to the reasons to be cautious was increased tension between China and the U.S., the globe’s two economic powerhouses. The cause of the latest war of words was over China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, which the U.S. described as “unlawful”.
China said Tuesday it would impose sanctions on  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), after the U.S. approved a possible $620 million deal for Taiwan to buy parts to refurbish defensive missiles made by the company.
Troubled airline Delta reported a $3.9 billion adjusted net loss in the quarter, including taking a $3.2 billion hit from Covid-19 related expenses, and warned a sustainable recovery in air traffic could take two years.
The main economic data release Tuesday will be the consumer price index for June, due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Analysts expect CPI to rise 0.5% in June and notch a gain of 0.6% on the year. Core CPI is seen rising 1.1% year-over-year.
Oil prices weakened sharply on the Californian news, ahead of a meeting of OPEC’s technical staff on Tuesday and Wednesday. The meeting is expected to recommend the group and its allies, including Russia, stick with the current plan to taper its record supply cut of 9.7 million barrels per day to 7.7 million barrels a day from August.
American Petroleum Institute inventory data are also due later. At 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% lower at $39.73 a barrel, while Brent fell 0.7% to $42.41.
Gold futures fell 0.9% to $1,798.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1378, up 0.3%."

In comparison, the company reported a net profit of 524 million yuan (75 million dollars) in the same period last year.
China asked cinemas across the country to shut down in late January to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. While the pandemic is seen to be mostly under control in China they have remained shut, for much longer than many people had expected.
""All the more than 600 cinemas of Wanda Film in China have been closed since Jan. 23, and the ones overseas also suspended business after the end of March,"" Wanda Film said in the statement.
Detective Chinatown 3, a film whose top investor is Wanda Film, was originally scheduled to be shown in cinemas in January during the Lunar New Year. However it has yet to be released due to the shutdowns.
Meanwhile, the production of some of its other films has also been delayed.
""Operating income dropped by a big margin compared with the same period last year,"" the company said, blaming fixed costs such as salaries and rent.
China is the second-largest film market in the world, after the United States. China's box office took in a record 64.3 billion yuan in 2019, up 5.4% on the year.

1598,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>",Carnival Cruise Lines Looks to Raise Another $1 Billion in Debt,"(Bloomberg) -- Cruise ship operator Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp. is back in the debt markets this week, adding around $1 billion to the nearly $7 billion it’s borrowed since the coronavirus pandemic devastated the international tourism trade.
The world’s largest cruise group is selling bonds to international investors in both euros and U.S. dollars, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public yet.
The deal will come at a price. Early discussions with potential investors have suggested yields of around 10.5% on the euro debt and 11% on the dollar portion, according to one of the people. But that’s marginally cheaper than the 11.9% yield on a bond offering in April, before a sustained recovery in credit markets.
The once mighty international tourism industry is among the worst hit of the Covid-19 pandemic. Cruise operators such as Carnival have been left with the huge overheads that come with operating fleets of ships when revenues have collapsed. The firm said last week that it expects to burn through $650 million of cash every month through to the end of the year.
Those costs have made the company a regular user of the international credit market as a source of funds since the pandemic took hold. Its latest offering comes less than a month after it raised $2.8 billion of loans in dollars and euros. It also sold $4 billion in bonds in April.
The notes being marketed this week are secured against its ships but are junior ranking to the loans and bonds raised earlier this year, according to the people familiar with the matter. That means investors who buy the new debt will get paid after those that bought into the earlier offerings if the company runs into trouble.

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) are leading the latest bond transaction.
Carnival shares rose about 1% in pre-market U.S. trading on Tuesday. While still down 70% for the year, the stock has gained around 80% since Carnival completed its last bond sale.

1599,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 07:03AM ET</span>",Delta Air Lines Reports Large Q2 Loss; Traffic Recovery Two Years Away,"Investing.com - Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) said a sustainable recovery in air traffic was still two years away Tuesday, after reporting a very weak second quarter that reflected the unprecedented impact of the Covid-19 outbreak,
The airline reported an adjusted loss per share of $4.43 for the June 2020 quarter on adjusted revenue of $1.2 billion, the lowest revenue level since the mid 1980s.
At 7:20 AM ET (1120 GMT), Delta's stock fell 2.2%, adding to losses of over 50% from the beginning of the year.
“A $3.9 billion adjusted pre-tax loss for the June quarter on a more than $11 billion decline in revenue over last year, illustrates the truly staggering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business,” said Ed Bastian, Delta’s chief executive officer.
“Given the combined effects of the pandemic and associated financial impact on the global economy, we continue to believe that it will be more than two years before we see a sustainable recovery.”
The costs related to the Covid-19 outbreak totaled $3,2 billion in the second quarter alone.
More positively, Delta ended the June quarter 2020 with $15.7 billion in liquidity, cutting its daily cash burn to an average of $27 million for the month of June, a 70 percent decline from levels in late March. This means it has sufficient liquidity at the current burn rate to last for 19 months without having to raise additional cash. Around one-third of that liquidity is in the form of grants and loans under the CARES Act.
Delta said last month that it expected to cut its average daily cash outflow to about $40 million by the end of June, from about $100 million at March 31, so it's ahead of that aim. The carrier added that it wanted to reduce cash burn to zero by year-end.
Bastian also said that the airline may be able to avoid involuntary furloughs in the fall after receiving interest from many thousands of its employees for early exit deals.

1601,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 06:55AM ET</span>",JPMorgan Q2 Beats Expectations Despite Surge in Provisions,"Investing.com - JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said its net profit fell by nearly half in the second quarter, due to a mammoth $10.8 billion charge for provisions against bad loans that was partially offset by a surge in revenue at its bond and equities trading operations.
Revenue and earnings per share both exceeded analysts’ forecasts however, prompting the stock to rise 4.3% in its initial response in premarket trading. It subsequently pared gains to be up 2.1% by 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT).
""“Despite some recent positive macroeconomic data and significant, decisive government action, we still face much uncertainty regarding the future path of the economy,"" CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement. ""However, we are prepared for all eventualities as our fortress balance sheet allows us to remain a port in the storm.""
Net profit fell to $4.69 billion, or $1.38 a share, from $9.56 billion in the second quarter of last year. But that was still better than a consensus forecast of $1.13 a share. Revenue, meanwhile, came in at $33.82 billion, up 17% from a year earlier and more than 10% above expectations.
The U.S.'s largest bank said it had built reserves of $4.6 billion on its wholesale loans, and $4.4 billion on its consumer loans, mostly in respect of credit card debt. That reflects the surge in corporate bankruptcies and individual unemployment that followed the extreme lockdown measures imposed across the U.S. in the quarter - a pattern that's likely to be reflected in all the earnings reports of the nation's banks in the next couple of weeks.
The charge against consumer loans pushed JPMorgan's main street operations to a loss of $176 million in the quarter, with net revenue falling 26% as the Federal Reserve's lower interest rates compressed deposit margins.
The results were, however, rescued by a strong performance from the markets division, where revenue rose 77% from a year earlier. Investment banking revenue also grew 46%, allowing the corporate and investment bank as a whole to post a 33% rise in revenue and $5.46 billion of profit.
The same pattern was evident in the results of  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), which also reported on Tuesday morning. Citi's earnings per share fell 74% to 50c, but that was better than the 36c expected largely because the bank's bond-trading desk delivered a 68% rise in revenue on the year, as its clients fled for the safety of fixed-income assets.
The safety net provided by markets and investment banking was conspicuously missing from  Wells Fargo  's update, released some minutes after JPMorgan's. The California-based bank swung to a net loss of $2.4 billion after building $8.4 billion in provisions against bad loans. It also wrote off another $1.1 billion in bad loans, bringing the total charge to $9.6 billion.
Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) also said it will cut its dividend by some 80% to 10c a share, a couple of weeks after the Federal Reserve moved to tighten bank payouts to ensure that their balance sheets stay strong enough to withstand the wave of personal and corporate insolvencies that the pandemic has started.
Citigroup's total provisions and credit losses rose to $7.81 billion. That brought the total provisions against potential and actual loan losses announced by three banks Monday to some $27.8 billion.
Wells Fargo stock was down 3.8% in premarket trading by 8:15 AM ET, while Citigroup's was up 1.6%.

Among factors boosting European assets is Europe's relative success in gradually reopening its economy and the European Union's proposed 750 billion euro recovery fund to help countries deal with the fallout from the coronavirus crisis.
Investors' allocation to euro zone equities increased 9 percentage point to net 16% overweight, the largest increase in net weighting of any region this month. A net 44% of the 210 investors surveyed between Jun 2-9 said the euro was cheap.

The Nasdaq index <.NDAX>, home to the world's largest tech stocks, has been setting record highs even as COVID-19 has been spreading fast in the United States.
Though risk assets had been rising since the record selloff in March, ""sentiment remains cautious"" with cash levels rising to 4.9% from 4.7%, BofA added.
""Wall Street's $24 trillion rally yet to elicit 'greed'.""
The bank said it expects stock markets to remain choppy during summer, recommeding selling when the S&P 500 (SPX) goes above 3,250 points and buying when it falls below 2,950.
Investors saw a coronavirus second wave as the biggest ""tail risk"" for the fourth month running with just 14% of them expecting a ""V""-shaped economic recovery versus 44% expecting a ""U"", and 30% a ""W"".
A V-shaped recovery is when a plunge in growth is followed by an equally sharp recovery; U-shaped is when recovery takes more than a couple of quarters; and W-shaped refers to a double-dip in growth.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Aspen (J:APNJ) has offered to cut prices by an average of 73% for six off-patent cancer drugs, EU antitrust regulators said on Tuesday, a move that could help the South African pharmaceutical company avoid a potentially hefty fine.
The European Commission opened an investigation into Aspen in 2017 following concerns it may have charged excessive prices for drugs critical in treating patients suffering from certain types of life-threatening cancer, such as leukaemia and multiple myeloma.
Aspen's price cuts will cover all of Europe except for Italy, which imposed a five million euro ($5.68 million) fine on the company in 2016 for price hikes of up to 1,500% for some drugs.
The European Commission, the EU executive, said it would seek feedback from interested parties before deciding whether to accept the company's offer.
""The proposed commitments aim at bringing to an end Aspen's suspected excessive pricing conduct with respect to its six off-patent cancer medicines, which the Commission suspects to constitute an abuse of a dominant position,"" the Commission said in a statement.
It said Aspen's proposal would lead to an immediate price cut in its net prices to below 2012 levels for most of the drugs, guarantee supply and involve a 10-year price ceiling.
The price cuts would apply retroactively from Oct. 1, 2019, when Aspen first submitted its concessions to regulators.
Under its antitrust settlement procedures, accepting the offer would mean no fines and no acknowledgement of wrongdoing. Sanctions can amount to 10% of a company's global turnover.

1604,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>",Tech Versus the Rest Dominates Trading Debate Ahead of Earnings,"(Bloomberg) -- Trading ideas are stacking up for what’s set to be a difficult second-quarter earnings season featuring a wide variation in performance due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Stocks have surged from March’s lows despite the bleakest profit outlook since the global financial crisis, with S&P 500 earnings expected to drop about 44%. Megacap technology firms led the stimulus-fueled rally and a key debate is whether they will keep that role as the earnings picture becomes clearer.
“For all but a fortunate few -- notably among the FAANGs -- the earnings numbers will be abysmal,” Tan Kai Xian, a statistician and U.S. analyst at Gavekal Research, wrote in a note, using a common acronym for big tech stocks. But there’s a “reasonable prospect” of brighter estimates and positive second-half surprises, which would support stock prices, he said.
Here’s a rundown of some recent thinking going into the earnings season:
Performance Reversal
Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG LLC, raises the prospect of leaders and laggards swapping roles, after stocks such as eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). rallied 20% or more from a June 8 peak in the S&P 500, while companies like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). fell more than 10% over the period.
“We view earnings season as a potential catalyst for performance reversion,” he wrote in a note, while also adding that “if 2020 has taught us anything, it is that anything can happen -- and probably will.”
Tech Risk?
Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Wealth Management, flags the possibility that disappointing earnings and guidance from technology companies may be an “underappreciated” risk. Investors should consider adding gold, corporate credit and non-U.S. stocks to portfolios that are overweight the S&P 500, she wrote in a note.
Options
Amy Wu Silverman, derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets, sees an opportunity for investors to use the current high premiums in call options in their favor. Specifically, she recommends call spreads on Amazon and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). -- a strategy that involves both buying and selling the bullish options but with different strike prices -- as a way to profit from further modest gains in their stock prices.
Long Financials
Evercore ISI strategists led by Dennis DeBusschere have recommended going long financials into the earnings season because “there’s upside potential for a battered-down sector that’s priced in negative headlines already.”
Industrials
Stuart Kaiser, head of equity derivatives research at UBS Securities LLC, recommends call options on the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund to position for upside in earnings, as the firm’s “big data” analysis shows revenue for industrials above consensus heading into the reporting season.

LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Global stocks slipped on Tuesday, oil sagged and a safety bid supported the dollar as simmering Sino-U.S. tensions and new coronavirus restrictions in California kept a lid on investor optimism with earnings season getting underway.
MSCI's All-Country World Index edged down 0.4%, after touching a 20-week high on Monday. The pan-European STOXX 600 opened 1.5% lower and was heading for its worst day in 14 sessions after technology stocks dropped 3.4%. This followed a slump a day earlier in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.
One of the gainers was German meal-kit delivery firm Hellofresh, which added 4.3% as it raised its full-year revenue forecast.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.9%. Chinese stocks were down despite better-than-expected trade numbers. The U.S. dollar firmed marginally.
The moves followed a selloff on Wall Street after California Governor Gavin Newsom ordered bars closed and restaurants and movie theatres to cease indoor operations.
S&P 500 futures were 0.5% stronger after the index lost 0.9% on Monday.
Tension grew between Washington and Beijing after the United States rejected China's disputed claims to offshore resources in most of the South China Sea.
The Trump Administration also plans to scrap a 2013 auditing agreement that could foreshadow a broader crackdown on U.S.-listed Chinese firms.
""It's not just the tempo which is picking up, but the aspect of so many areas being pulled in to the dispute,"" said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics at Mizuho Bank in Singapore.
""Last time it was really about the bottom line,"" he said, adding that what had primarily been a trade dispute is now much broader, making a resolution less likely and the next moves less predictable.
The Shanghai index fell 0.7% despite official figures showing Chinese exports and imports topped forecasts in June, while China continued to buy significant amounts of commodities including iron ore.
The return of restrictions in California also has markets on edge about whether the coronavirus can wreak more economic harm. Global infections have surged by a million in five days, and top 13 million.

Oil prices, a proxy for global energy consumption and growth expectations, reflected the concerns. U.S crude futures fell 1.5% to $39.52 per barrel and Brent futures fell 1.3% to $42.16 per barrel. 
Investors sought out the safety of eurozone government bonds. Most yields were about 2-3 basis points lower, with Germany's 10-year Bund yield, the region's benchmark, dropping 2.5 bps to -0.43%.
There are also signs of an interruption to the steady flow of better-than-expected economic data. On Tuesday, data showed Singapore entered recession last month, with the economy contracting 41.2% for the quarter, worse than the 37.4% analysts had forecast.
Currency markets hemmed the dollar in a tight range. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar index was last up 0.1% at 96.662. The euro was down 0.1% against the dollar at $1.1331. 
Currencies exposed to global trade sentiment such as the Australian dollar and China's offshore yuan were down.
Focus shifts later to U.S. earnings, with JP Morgan,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) due to report on Tuesday to a market already looking ahead to 2021 and beyond.
""It's really about 2021 -- 2020 is over,"" said fund manager Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Funds Management in Sydney, where earnings season properly begins next month.

1607,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>",Tech selloff spreads to Europe as virus fears mount,"By Sruthi Shankar
(Reuters) - European stocks were hit by a selloff in technology shares on Tuesday, after a drop overnight on Wall Street following fears of new coronavirus restrictions and a flare-up in U.S.-China tensions.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 1.3%, with technology stocks dropping 3.2%, on course for their biggest one-day selloff in over a month.
Shares in SAP SE (DE:SAPG), ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) NV, Prosus (OTC:PROSF) NV and Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) Technologies AG fell about 4%, tracking overnight declines in U.S. tech majors on worries that another lockdown in California to contain a surge of coronavirus infections may slow a U.S. economic recovery.
""California is a tech haven, so this is going to have a disproportionate effect on tech stocks,"" said Connor Campbell, markets analyst at SpreadEx.
Those fears also persisted in Asia with Hong Kong set to impose strict social distancing measures from Tuesday. The number of coronavirus infections around the world hit 13 million on Monday, according to a Reuters tally, climbing by a million in just five days.
""Markets are nervous about the trajectory of the economy,"" said Paul Danis, chief global strategist at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin (OTC:BDNHF). ""I suspect that we are going to have a wobble which will slow the pace of economic improvement, but it is not going to outright derail it.""
Germany's ZEW research institute said the outlook for Europe's largest economy remains largely unchanged in July versus the previous month.
The ZEW economic sentiment index was at 59.3 points in July after climbing to 63.4 points in June.
Meanwhile, Washington on Monday rejected China's disputed claims to offshore resources in the South China Sea, a move that Beijing criticised as inciting tensions in the region.
German meal-kit delivery firm Hellofresh SE gained 0.3% as it raised its full-year revenue forecast, while industrial technology group Hexagon AB jumped 4.9% after forecasting second-quarter profit above market expectations.
Norwegian oil firm Aker BP (NYSE:BP) ASA fell 3.4% as crude prices fell, but the company beat second-quarter pre-tax profit expectations.

The world's biggest watchmaker Swatch Group (SIX:UHR) AG edged lower as it reported its first ever half-year loss, but Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek said he looked forward to a quick rebound from the pandemic.

1608,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 05:36AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Ocado, HelloFresh Live up to Expectations","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- While it’s the big U.S. banks that will steal the headlines with their earnings today, the focus on Tuesday morning in Europe has been on a question that will be a recurring theme over the next two weeks: are tech companies delivering fast enough to justify their sky-high valuations?
The steam had already gone out of the sector’s rally overnight after California reversed much of its economic reopening in response to a surge in coronavirus deaths and infections, the clearest signal yet that the U.S. is paying the price for not taking the threat of Covid-19 seriously enough.
The mood was further darkened by UBS cutting its recommendation on music-streaming giant Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) – a rare example of European leadership in tech – arguing that the market is overestimating its ability to keep a lid on costs and monetize its content. (UBS also downgraded Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to neutral from buy on valuation grounds).
So with valuations across the board suddenly under pressure, the reaction of HelloFresh (DE:HFGG) stock to the German meal kit provider’s second-quarter earnings is reasonably reassuring: it declined only 1.0% by mid-morning in Frankfurt, modestly outperforming the Stoxx 600, which fell 1.2%, and clearly performing the Tech DAX, which was down 2.7%.
HelloFresh said its adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter would be around 50% higher than the implied market consensus of 97 million euros. With the third quarter also off to a solid start – thanks not least to its business in the U.S., which accounts for nearly half of its users – the company raised its full-year forecast for revenue growth to between 55% and 70% from a prior range of 40% to 55%. It also raised the midpoint of its EBITDA margin range to 9% from 8% previously.
Ocado (LON:OCDO), the U.K. company whose technology powers online grocery shopping, also managed to live up to expectations with a 27% rise in revenue and a sharp narrowing of its pretax loss to 40.6 million pounds, thanks largely to a strong performance from its retail joint venture with Marks and Spencer (LON:MKS). Ocado shares, which have risen 57% this year, gave up only 1.2%.
In contrast to HelloFresh, Ocado wasn’t able to upgrade its outlook the year, partly because it has to start recognizing the heavy costs of its international partnerships later in the year.
In a quarter where outlooks may count for more than realized figures, that was enough to stop any major profit-taking, but not enough for it to buck the broader negative trend on Tuesday.  Ocado shares underperformed the FTSE 100 slightly, as strong Chinese data supported mining and energy stocks, keeping the U.K. benchmark's decline to only 0.4%.

1609,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>",Eni to Exit Traditional Oil Refineries in Next Decade,"(Bloomberg) -- The coronavirus pandemic will accelerate  ENI  (MI:ENI) SpA's (NYSE:E) pivot away from conventional refineries to investing in greener facilities.
“Instead of slowing down, we see Covid as a reason to accelerate the transition to low-carbon energy,” Chief Executive Officer Claudio Descalzi said in an interview with Bloomberg Monday.
In February, Eni set tougher climate goals, in which the Italian energy giant pledged to slash net emissions by 80% by 2050. Less than two weeks later, Italy became the first European country to impose a lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Country after country followed, sending oil demand and prices tumbling to record-lows.
While consumption of gasoline and diesel in the country is now recovering, Eni’s biorefineries haven’t been affected by the pandemic. Its two plants -- Venice and Gela -- were the only ones in its refining system that did not reduce production during Italy’s lockdown as they “worked very well,” Descalzi said.
Along with its European peers, Eni slashed spending plans and cut a 400 million-euro ($455 million) share buyback, but has so far left its dividend intact. Investors and analysts have questioned how European oil majors will pay for the energy transition they’re promising, as renewables typically have lower returns than oil and gas projects.
Bio-Returns
Descalzi remains optimistic. Biorefineries have an internal rate of return of 15%, which is “not bad” compared with upstream, he said. Originally, the company had planned to fund its new renewables projects with free cash flow from oil above $50 to $60 a barrel. Following the pandemic’s impact on prices, the company is now looking for new ways to finance projects. While securing capital for green projects will be different, “access to funds will be easier.”
Eni plans to spend 4.9 billion euros between 2020 and 2023. With oil at around $40 a barrel, “we won’t cut low-carbon spend, instead we will be cutting oil and gas” capex by 35% to 40% this year, Descalzi said.
The CEO expects Eni will exceed its initial climate ambition, saying the company will now “match Europe’s goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, across Scope 1, 2, and 3.” This would cover emissions from its own operations as well from the use of its products by customers.
Beyond converting refineries into biorefineries, the company will look to divestments as part of its emissions-reduction plan. Eni expects to sell marginal activities in some countries including “maybe the U.S.”

The U.S. weapons maker is the main contractor for a $620 million upgrade package for Taiwan's Patriot surface-to-air missiles, which the U.S. government approved last week.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian called on the United States to stop selling weapons to Taiwan to ""avoid further harming Sino-U.S. ties and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait"".
""In order to safeguard the country's interests, China has decided to take necessary steps, and put sanctions on the main contractor for this sale, Lockheed Martin,"" Zhao told reporters, without giving details.
The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The United States, like most countries, has no official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but is bound by law to provide the democratic island with the means to defend itself.
China has announced similar sanctions before on U.S. companies for Taiwan arms sales, though it is unclear what form they have taken.
The United States has long had an arms embargo on China.
The government in Taiwan has welcomed the missile upgrade. It is bolstering its defences for what it sees as increasingly threatening moves by Beijing, such as its regular air force and naval exercises near Taiwan.
Taiwan Defence Minister Yen Teh-fa, visiting troops during the annual Han Kuang military exercise, said they needed to be strong in the face of ""all sorts of threats and provocations"" from China.
""This tells our people and the Communists that we have the confidence and ability to protect our people and homeland, and defend the country's security,"" his ministry cited him as saying.

While Taiwan's military is well-trained and well-equipped with mostly U.S.-made hardware, China has huge numerical superiority and is adding advanced equipment of its own such as stealth fighters and new ballistic missiles.

Officials met Tesla Vice-president Tao Lin to discuss ""accelerating projects"", Chongqing's Liangjiang New Area said in a Wechat social media post.
It said government official Duan Chenggang welcomed Tao's visit to ""promote cooperation"", without providing further details. 
The official China Securities Journal newspaper, citing unidentified sources, said cooperation could involve the establishment of sales and maintenance centres rather than factories. 
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company opened a plant in Shanghai last year, its first outside the United States, with the backing of the city's government. 
It is building Model 3 electric sedans there and has sold almost 30,000 units in the past three months.
Tesla is currently weighing up a decision to build a $1.1 billion assembly plant in the United States which could create 20,000 jobs and has stoked competition between sites on the short list.
With investors betting Tesla could show a quarterly profit in its July 22 report and potentially join the S&P 500 index (SPX), Tesla is now the world's most valuable automaker, followed by Toyota (T:7203) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).

The Finnish firm hopes the software will help it in its battle against Huawei and Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) for next wave of 5G orders as the technology should allow carriers to save on costs.
""This solution will save the telecommunications industry potentially tens of billions of euros in site engineering and re-visit costs,"" Nokia said in a statement. 
Nokia said the software upgrade was available immediately for about one million radio stations, growing to 3.1 million by the end of the year and to over 5 million in 2021.
""By upgrading existing radio elements via software, Nokia is helping to streamline the process of refarming 4G spectrum into 5G,"" the company said. 

Last week, Nokia became the first major telecoms equipment maker to commit to adding open interfaces in its products, a trend that will give software a central role in future mobile networks.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - India's auto sales volume will take another 3-4 years to reach 2018 levels, an industry body executive said on Tuesday, as the coronavirus-induced lockdown hurt monthly revenue and increased pressure on a sector already reeling from poor demand.
The pandemic-related disruption to the supply chain comes at a time when India's auto industry was already facing a slowdown in demand and government rules to adopt tougher emission standards forced carmakers to hike prices, driving customers away.
India's passenger vehicle sales rose 3% to 3.37 million units in fiscal 2018-19, but fell by 18% a year later due to weak demand and the onset of the pandemic.
The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), an industry body, said domestic car and SUV sales slumped 50% in June from last year, while sales of two wheelers - widely seen as an indicator of the health of the rural economy - fell 39%.
The rapid spread of the coronavirus and subsequent nationwide lockdown forced several automakers to suspend manufacturing and report zero sales in April, worsening the situation for the sector.
""Production has been slow to pick up due to supply chain disruption and weak demand,"" said Rajan Wadhera, president, SIAM.
 Maruti Suzuki India  (NS:MRTI), which sells one in every two cars in India, sold 51,274 passenger vehicles in June, down 50% from a year ago, while Hyundai Motor India posted a 49% slump, according to SIAM data.
India, the world's second-most populous country, is slowly limping out of the lockdown while COVID-19 cases continue to rise while some cities are being sent back indoors.
The country's Nifty auto index (NIFTYAUTO), which tumbled nearly 11% in 2019, crashed over 31% in March as India entered a lockdown. The sub-index was trading 2.25% lower on Tuesday, amid a 1.5% fall in Indian equities.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply lower Tuesday, with weak U.K. economic data adding to concerns about the U.S. economy after California reversed much of its reopening in response to rising Covid-19 cases.
At 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.8% lower and the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 1%. France was on holiday, celebrating Bastille Day.
The British economy grew 1.8% in May, a slight rebound after the deep fall caused by the coronavirus shutdown, but much weaker than the expansion of 5.5% widely expected.
“Despite the reopening of construction and manufacturing, the U.K.'s May GDP figures were underwhelming to say the least,” said analyst James Smith at ING in a research note. “Admittedly this is 'old news' now, and we should see a sharper rebound in June and July. But it does serve as a reminder that economic recovery from Covid-19 is going to be very protracted.” 
In corporate news, HelloFresh (DE:HFGG) stock rose 4% as the German meal kit provider reported a surge in demand during the lockdown period. 
Staying with food, U.K. online retailer Ocado (LON:OCDO) stock fell 3.7% despite reporting 27% growth in revenue and a narrower pretax loss in its first-half report. The stock has almost doubled in value since early March.
Elsewhere, industrial technology group Hexagon (ST:HEXAb) jumped 5% after forecasting second-quarter profit above market expectations.
The Covid-19 virus continues to wreak havoc. The total number of cases has climbed over 13 million cases globally, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, surging by a million in five days.
In the U.S., the most populous state California reshuttered bars and ordered restaurants and movie theaters to cease indoor operations. The move is the clearest signal yet that the world’s economic driver will have to reimpose economically damaging measures to bring the spread of the virus back under control. 
Eyes will turn later in the session to the start of the U.S. earnings season, with big banks beginning to report second-quarter results. FactSet expects S&P 500 companies in general to report a 10% drop in revenue and a 45% drop in earnings in the quarter.
Oil prices weakened sharply on the Californian news, ahead of a meeting of OPEC’s technical staff on Tuesday and Wednesday. The meeting is expected to recommend the group and its allies, including Russia, stick with the current plan to taper its record supply cut of 9.7 million barrels per day to 7.7 million barrels a day from August.
American Petroleum Institute inventory data are also due later. At 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2% lower at $39.30 a barrel, while Brent fell 1.6% to $42.03.

That comes as investors seeking havens pile into the U.K’s debt, driving down rates. Meanwhile, shorter-dated Japanese bonds have been backstopped by the country’s central bank, keeping yields steady.
The moves are the latest sign that European debt markets may be undergoing “Japanification,” a world of low yields, tepid inflation and little volatility.

The Chinext Index plunged as much as 3.5% Tuesday before paring the decline to 1.1% at the close. The gauge, where a 10% daily cap on individual stock moves will soon double, was up more than 60% this year and near the most overbought on record. Overseas investors sold a record $2.5 billion of China stocks Tuesday.
This month’s stock rally in China has pushed the value of the country’s market to almost $10 trillion, a level that marked the top of the equity bubble five years ago. Similarities between now and then have started to displease policy makers, who have since last week taken steps to rein in equities. Plans from two state-backed funds to sell shares were announced late Monday, following similar moves last week.
“The recent wave of stake reductions by big funds is a signal that China wants the market to cool down a bit,” said Dai Ming, a fund manager at Hengsheng Asset Management Co. Policy makers want “to see a slow bull market that matches the pace of the economic recovery,” he added.
The total value of China’s domestic equities has climbed to $9.7 trillion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of Monday. The figure briefly rose above $10 trillion for the first time in June 2015, as investors piled into the nation’s equities using borrowed funds, before collapsing to below $5 trillion less than three months later. This time round, leverage is again greasing the rally. Margin debt rose for a 11th session on Monday, hitting 1.33 trillion yuan.
Foreign investors dumped a net 17.4 billion yuan of China stocks on Tuesday, the most ever. The previous record was 14.7 billion yuan set on March 13.
The massive amount of Chinese shares that will soon be available for sale for the first time could also encourage some profit-taking. Expiring this quarter are a record 1.35 trillion yuan worth of lockups that prevent early investors and controlling shareholders from disposing of their allocated shares, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Group analysts wrote in a note dated Monday.
July alone will mark the biggest month for unlocks since 2015 at 597 billion yuan, Jefferies added.
Rising tensions with the U.S. added a gloomier tone to global markets, after the Trump administration rejected China’s expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea, reversing a previous policy of not taking sides in such disputes.
Naura Technology Group Co. and Wangfujing Group Co. fell at least 3.8% after saying state-backed funds would sell some holdings.

1618,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 03:05AM ET</span>",Hedge fund manager Singh calls Trump's handling of coronavirus 'an incredible gift',"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus outbreak early this year was ""an incredible gift"" for investors because it kept markets stable long enough for some to protect their portfolios, Axon Capital co-founder Dinakar Singh told investors this month.
Trump has justified his public assurances that the virus will quickly go away by arguing he needs to be ""a cheerleader"" for the United States to avoid creating ""havoc and shock."" The United States has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus infections and deaths in the world.
""We simply never believed 'what happens in China stays in China,'"" Singh wrote in a letter to investors last week that was seen by Reuters. ""Trump talking down COVID-19 risk gave investors an incredible gift -- it kept markets resilient much longer than they should have, and enabled us to ensure our portfolio was sensibly positioned.""
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Axon, a 15-year-old hedge fund which oversees roughly $1 billion, gained 24.3% in the first half of the year, thanks to bets on technology giants, managed-care stocks and Japanese companies, according to the letter. In the last days Axon extended gains and is now up 30%.
Axon is among a small number of firms beating the average hedge fund, which lost 3.5% in the first half, according to Hedge Fund Research data.
Singh said he was able to ""bulk up"" some hedges early in the year by ""adding some volatility protection."" That weighed on ""performance in January and early February, but has helped ever since.""
The novel coronavirus first emerged in China last December. The first U.S. case, in Washington state, was reported in mid-January, and through late February U.S. cases reported remained low. During that period Wall Street stocks continued to rally, with the Nasdaq and the Dow posting record highs on Feb. 19.
And after the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX), the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) and the Nasdaq (IXIC) all suffered double-digit declines in the first quarter, all three marked their biggest quarterly percentage gains in more than two decades in the second quarter.
The S&P was still down on the year at the close of the first half, but the Dow and the Nasdaq both closed out the period higher.
For Axon, bets on Google owner Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), health insurers  Centene  (N:CNC) and Humana (N:HUM), medical equipment maker Olympus (T:7733), and short bets against retailers, including Gap (N:GPS) and Kohls (N:KSS), all paid off. Olympus is up 20.66% this year. 
A former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) stock picker, Singh founded Axon with capital from private-equity firm TPG in 2005. The fund's assets peaked at $13 billion in 2008.

After the stock market's plunge in March and subsequent recovery, Singh now worries about a rise in interest rates. ""All investors should think seriously about buying 'protection' against structural rise in interest rates,"" he wrote.

Earlier Tuesday, China reported positive customs data, an encouraging sign that the world’s second largest economy is recovering from the damage caused by the Covid-19 virus. Chinese exports and imports benefited from some countries loosening lockdown measures, and the resultant uptick in economic activity. 
The British economy also grew 1.8% in May, only a slight rebound after the deep fall caused by the shutdown from the coronavirus pandemic. Analysts had predicted an expansion of 5.5%. 
U.K. industrial production was still down 20% year-on-year in May, and manufacturing output down 22.8% on the year.

In corporate news, Swatch Group (SIX:UHR) said Tuesday that it swung to a loss during the first half of the year due to the closure of most of its stores during the coronavirus pandemic. U.K. online food retailer Ocado (LON:OCDO) meanwhile reported 27% growth in revenue and a narrower pretax loss in its first-half report.
Eyes will turn later in the session to the start of the U.S. earnings season, with big banks beginning to report second-quarter results. The expectations are that they will show weakness along with the broader market because of Covid-19 shutdowns, which dominated much of the quarter.
Oil prices weakened sharply Tuesday, amid worries for the recovery of crude demand as California, the most populous U.S. state, ordered a new lockdown on businesses to combat the resurgence of the Covid-19 virus. 
This comes ahead of a meeting of OPEC’s technical staff, on Tuesday and Wednesday, who are expected to recommend the group and its allies, including Russia, stick with the current plan to taper its record supply cut of 9.7 million barrels per day to 7.7 million barrels per day from August through December.
The market will also be closely watching data on oil inventories due later on Tuesday from the American Petroleum Institute and on Wednesday from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
At 2:15 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2% lower at $39.29 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.4% to $42.14.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,801.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1340, flat on the day.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and its Chinese joint venture partner SAIC Motor (SS:600104) plan to invest 4.13 billion yuan ($590 million) to revamp their car plants in Shanghai to make new Audi sedans, according to a government document seen by Reuters.
SAIC Volkswagen, the joint venture (JV) of Wolfsburg-based automaker and China's biggest automaker, currently only sells cars under the Volkswagen and Skoda marques. Audi is Volkswagen's luxury car unit.
With the revamp at its Shanghai plants, the JV is aiming for an annual manufacturing capacity of 60,000 Audi (DE:NSUG) A7L sedans and 60,000 new Volkswagen sport-utility vehicles. The total capacity at the plants will remain unchanged. 
The revamp, expected to be done by the end 2020, comes as demand for luxury cars in China remained firm even as sales in the world's biggest auto market slumped over the past two years.
SAIC Chairman Chen Hong has previously said the JV plans to roll out the first Audi product in early 2022.
The Audi manufacturing will also use printing facilities at the JV's newly built MEB platform, a Volkswagen platform that enables efficient production of various electric vehicle models.
Volkswagen hopes to start production based on its MEB platform in Shanghai from the fourth quarter and has sought government nod for production of its electric ID.4 vehicles.
Audi China said its project with SAIC was proceeding according to plan, without giving any more details. SAIC did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
SAIC Volkswagen's sales fell 37% from a year ago to 577,385 vehicles in the first half of 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic hit demand in China, while total industry sales fell 17%. The JV sold 2 million cars last year.
Audi also has a long-term collaboration with FAW Group [SASACJ.UL] in China to build all its cars in the northeastern city of Changchun and southern city of Foshan.

China introduced a U.S-style IPO system to the ChiNext a month ago, as part of efforts to reform the country's stock markets and channel much-needed capital to innovative start-ups as the world's second-largest economy recovers from the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.
Three companies - Beijing FengShangShiJi Culture Media Co, Contec Medical Systems Co and LD Intelligent Technology - have met the conditions for IPOs on the ChiNext board of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, the exchange said in a statement late on Monday.
The first batch of companies listing under the new system are widely expected to debut in August.
Under the new, registration-based listing system for ChiNext, the Shenzhen exchange vets IPO applications based on disclosure rules. Companies wanting to go public no longer need approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission.
The ChiNext reform is modelled on rules used by Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market launched last July. In addition to simplifying the listing process, the reform also gives market forces greater role in pricing shares.

Nearly 300 companies are lining up to conduct IPOs on ChiNext, according to exchange data.

On Monday night, local authorities said visitors arriving from the special administrative region of Macau would no longer have to undergo a 14-day quarantine period in the neighbouring coastal province of Guangdong.
Analysts said the measure, which comes into effect on July 15, was the first step towards normalisation in the former Portuguese colony, as the border between mainland China has been effectively shut down since late March.
""We expect demand from Guangdong can recover quickly to 70% of normal levels, assuming visas resume reasonably soon,"" DS Kim, an analyst at J.P. Morgan in Hong Kong said. 
Visitors must have tested negative for coronavirus in the previous seven days and must hold green health codes of Macau and Guangdong.

Shares of Hong Kong listed casino stocks including  Wynn Macau  (HK:1128) and  MGM China  (HK:2282) rose between 6%-11% on Monday morning, outperforming the benchmark Hong Kong index (HSI) which was down 0.7%.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were down in Tuesday morning, halting the previous day’s rally as investors digest the incessant climb in COVID-19 cases.
There are over 13 million cases globally as of July 14, according to Johns Hopkins University data. A World Health Organization (WHO) official warned on Monday that things will not return to normal “for the foreseeable future” as the virus continues to spread.
California’s governor Gavin Newsom announced a retreat from the state’s re-opening plan and re-imposed lockdown measures on Monday.
“The U.S. continues to report fresh highs of daily new infections. However, the seriousness of the disease is falling. Hospitalization rates...has trended down since April,” said Kim Mundy with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) in Sydney, in an analyst note. “The upshot is the surge in infections does not give the full story. And it suggests the U.S. is learning to live with the disease.”
Meanwhile, Hong Kong imposed its strictest social distancing measures to date as the number of cases rises in the city, where 41 cases were reported on Monday.
But some investors painted a gloomier picture, as they expect a correction to the equity market’s recent weeks-long rally.
“There is a risk that the divergence between a gloomy economic outlook and unexpectedly strong returns from equity markets is reconciled by some pull-back in asset prices rather than a surge in economic optimism,” Chris Iggo, chief investment officer for core investments at AXA Investment Managers, warned in a note. “There is a case for caution.”
Meanwhile, tensions between the U.S. and China continue to simmer after U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo’s statement on Monday rejecting Chinese claims in the South China Sea. Pompeo issued his statement after China’s recent military exercises in the contested waters around the South China Sea’s Paracel Islands.
China hit back on Tuesday morning, rejecting the U.S. statement and calling Pompeo’s accusations of China bullying its neighbors “completely unjustified”.
The South China Sea is the latest addition to a list of differences between the two countries, with the list also encompassing trade and the national security laws enacted in Hong Kong earlier in the month.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.55% by 10:26 PM ET (3:36 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.17%. China is expected to release trade data for June later in the day, with a second batch, including GDP figures, due on Thursday.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid by 1.42%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.87% and South Korea’s KOSPI is down 0.41%
Down Under, the ASX 200 fell 0.55%. Some Australian states are re-imposing lockdowns as fears spread of an outbreak in Sydney. The outbreak in the country’s most populous city follows a second wave in Melbourne, which is currently on day seven of a second lockdown."

The Mumbai-based conglomerate, controlled by billionaire Pallonji Mistry and his family, plans to use shares of unit companies as collateral against the borrowings, said one of the people, asking not to be identified as the discussions are private.
The group is resorting to structured loans from the Canadian private-equity fund after its plans to sell assets ranging from solar power plants to toll roads got delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, the person said. It has about $950 million of debt due by 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Negotiations are at an early stage and may not lead to any deals, the people said. Representatives for Brookfield and the privately-held Shapoorji Pallonji Group declined to comment.
Founded in 1865, the Shapoorji Pallonji group built some of Mumbai’s landmarks, including the Reserve Bank of India building. With businesses spanning infrastructure and home appliances, it is still better placed than most of its corporate peers, with total revenue of $7 billion for the year ended March 2019.
The group was earlier in discussions to borrow as much as $1 billion using part of its Tata Sons Ltd. stake as collateral, Bloomberg News reported in March. The Mistry’s family owns an 18% stake in Tata Sons.

Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4), as Petrobras is formally known, said considerable improvement in its governance following the so-called Operation Car Wash corruption probe led KLP to declare Petrobras as eligible for investment.
KLP did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Operation Car Wash uncovered Brazil's largest-ever corruption scheme in which hundreds of politicians and businesspeople were implicated in exchanging bribes for public contracts with Petrobras.
In a 2016 statement announcing its exclusion of Petrobras from its portfolios, KLP said it had 33.74 million NOK ($3.57 million) invested in Petrobras shortly before the decision was made.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Healthcare services company Mednax's (N:MD) stock price closed up nearly 4% on Monday after its founder and chief executive and several board members were replaced, half a year after activist investor Starboard Value began pressing for change.
Mark Ordan, who had been CEO at real estate company Quality Care Properties, was tapped to replace Roger Medel, who founded Mednax, valued at $1.5 billion, four decades ago, the company said.
The company also appointed five new directors to replace five who agreed to resign from the 11-member group.
Gavin Molinelli, a partner at Starboard, the hedge fund that owns nearly 10% of Mednax, will become a board observer. He will receive all materials for directors, be permitted to attend and participate but not vote at meetings, as part of the settlement agreed between the hedge fund and the company.
Starboard raised its stake to 9.9% from 9.6%, having purchased more shares two months ago. Starboard paid an average $22.64 per share for its investment. Mednax's stock price closed at $18.32 on Monday and it has dropped 36.5% since January.
Starboard and Mednax reached a settlement before investors would have voted on the hedge fund's slate of directors. It originally nominated eight directors, including Jeffrey Smith, who runs Starboard, and Molinelli.
The hedge fund had pushed for Mednax to sell pieces or the entire company and the company said in June that it plans to sell its Mednax Radiology Solutions business.
Starboard has been among the industry's busiest and most powerful activist investors in winning more board seats than all others, usually through settlements.

CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) may be able to avoid involuntary furloughs in the fall after receiving interest from more than 15,000 employees for early buyout packages, one person with knowledge of the matter said, even as other U.S. airlines are sounding the alarm on jobs.
Atlanta-based Delta is among large U.S. airlines that have been trying to encourage workers to leave voluntarily before a government ban on forced job cuts expires on Sept. 30, when they warn they must shrink given depressed demand in the coronavirus pandemic.
The deadline for most Delta employees to accept early departure or early retirement packages was Monday.
Delta, which is due to present second-quarter results on Tuesday, declined to comment.
Because labor contracts require airlines to furlough in reverse order of seniority, those that can encourage more senior people to leave could have generally lower labor costs as they brace for a slow rebound.
Other U.S. airlines have warned that furloughs are likely, with United Airlines sending warnings to about 45% of its frontline workers last week.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) was preparing to send warnings - coupled with early exit packages to encourage voluntary departures - this week, people familiar with the matter said.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Chief Executive Gary Kelly told employees on Monday that he was concerned about the impact of a recent rise in COVID-19 cases and quarantines on already-weak travel demand and said passenger numbers would need to triple by the end of the year to prevent job cuts.
""Although furloughs and layoffs remain our very last resort, we can’t rule them out as a possibility obviously in this very bad environment,"" Kelly said in a message to employees reviewed by Reuters. He added that a spike in cases and travel restrictions ""aren’t positive developments for our business, and we are concerned about the impact on already weak travel demand.""
Southwest and United employees have until July 15 to apply for early exits.
According to labor rules, airlines must give employees 60 days' notice of potential furloughs. Not everyone who receives a notification will be let go.
Airlines are grappling with overstaffing and burning millions of dollars of cash each day, even as they face pressure to limit passengers on flights to allow for social distancing.

JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp said Monday it will extend blocking middle seats on larger airplanes and aisle seats on smaller aircraft for flights through Sept. 8. American and United are again booking flights to capacity, but informing customers if their flights will be full.

The Financial Times newspaper first reported the findings from a court filing, which was made public Monday. 
Bridgewater Associates had started the case against two former employees, Zachary Squire and Lawrence Minicone, with the claim that they breached their contracts and misappropriated trade secrets.
The hedge fund, founded by billionaire Ray Dalio, was found to have ""filed its claims in reckless disregard of its own internal records, and in order to support its allegations of access to trade secrets, manufactured false evidence,"" court documents made public on Monday showed.
""We conclude that Claimant [Bridgewater] did not have a reasonable basis for filing its claims of misappropriation of trade secrets or disclosure of confidential information as to Squire or Minicone,"" according to the documents, which quoted the findings of a panel of three arbitrators of the American Arbitration Association.
The hedge fund failed to identify the alleged trade secrets with specificity, the panel's findings showed.
Bridgewater Associates also accused the two former employees of unfair competition after they founded a hedge fund themselves, a charge which the arbitrators said was brought in ""bad faith.""
Squire was not immediately available for comment. 
Bridgewater Associates, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday, managed $138 billion in assets as of April. 

The hedge fund co-founded by Squire and Minicone, Tekmerion Capital Management, has about $60 million in assets under management.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended lower on Monday, pulled down by Amazon, Microsoft and other recent big-name leaders of Wall Street's recent rally.
The S&P 500 dipped after briefly touching its highest level since Feb. 25. The index has rebounded over 40% since mid-March, even as COVID-19 infections rose rapidly in Arizona, California and Texas and about 35 other states.
Stocks that outperformed in recent months, including Amazon (O:AMZN), Microsoft (O:MSFT), Nvidia (O:NVDA) and Facebook (O:FB), ended down more than 2% after gaining earlier in the day. 
Selling accelerated after California Governor Gavin Newsom ordered a massive retrenchment of the state’s reopening, shutting bars and banning indoor restaurant dining statewide and closing churches, gyms and hair salons in hardest-hit counties.
""The rally's been driven by a handful of names. You've had headlines about COVID and layoffs and the economy. It's finally caught up with these names everybody's been hiding in,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut. 
Tesla (O:TSLA) dropped 3.1% after surging 16% earlier in the session. The electric car maker's stock has been on a blistering rally over the past two weeks as investors bet the electric car maker could report a quarterly profit and potentially join the S&P 500.
Shares of German biotech firm BioNTech (O:BNTX) jumped over 10% and  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) climbed 4% as two of their experimental coronavirus vaccines received the U.S. FDA's ""fast track"" designation.
Merger news also perked up investors as chipmaker  Analog Devices  Inc (O:ADI) announced a $21 billion deal to buy rival Maxim Integrated Products Inc (O:MXIM), sending its stock 8% higher. Analog shares fell 5.8%.
PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP) gained 0.3% after it said it benefited from a surge in at-home consumption of salty snacks such as Fritos and Cheetos during lockdowns.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street's fear gauge, closed at its highest level since June 26. Its 4.9-point gain for the session was its largest since June 11.
Investors are bracing for what could be the sharpest drop in quarterly earnings for S&P 500 firms since the financial crisis, according to IBES Refinitiv data. Results from big banks will be in focus this week.

The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 2.13%, to 10,390.84.
The S&P 500 technology index (SPLRCT) fell 2.12%, leading declines.
Recent economic data has strengthened belief that the stimulus-pumped U.S. economy is on the road to recovery, helping investors look past a recent spike in U.S. infections.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.56-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.11-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

(Reuters) - Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) ended down 3.1% on Monday, tapping the brakes on a rally that has boosted the electric car maker's stock by over 40% in two weeks.
Shares of Tesla surged 16% early in the session before joining a sell-off along with other big-name Nasdaq stocks, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) , Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) , that have outperformed in recent months.
With investors betting Tesla could show a quarterly profit in its July 22 report and potentially join the S&P 500 index, traders at one point on Monday paid $1,794.99 per share, a premium of almost $300 over Tesla's previous closing price.
Only the second daily decline for Tesla in 10 sessions came after the company on Saturday cut the price of its Model Y sport utility vehicle by $3,000, just four months after its launch, as it tries to maintain sales momentum in the COVID-19 pandemic.
Higher-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries, announced earlier this month, have some analysts and investors expecting the company will show a profit in its quarterly report. That would mark Tesla's first cumulative four-quarter profit, a key requirement for it to be added to the S&P 500.

With its market capitalization now at $277 billion, Tesla would be among the most valuable companies ever added to the S&P 500, and it would be more valuable than 95% of the index's existing components. Adding Tesla to the S&P 500 would have a major impact on investment funds that track the index, forcing them to buy tens of billions of dollars worth of Tesla's stock.
Since late June, demand for bullish call options on Tesla shares has been greater than demand for protective put options, which traders warn is a sign of exuberance.

Tesla on Friday set its annual shareholder meeting for Sept. 22 at its Fremont factory in California. The same day would also be ""Battery Day,"" when Tesla it is expected to reveal significant advances in battery technology.

1639,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 05:20PM ET</span>",Electric car maker Fisker to go public through SPAC deal at $2.9 billion valuation,"By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - Electric car maker Fisker will go public through a merger with a blank-check company backed by alternative investment manager Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc at a valuation of $2.9 billion, the companies said on Monday.
Reuters reported last week that the special-purpose acquisition company,  Spartan Energy Acquisition  Corp (N:SPAQ_u), was leading a bidding war among blank-check companies for Fisker. A blank-check company is a shell company that raises money through an IPO to buy an operating company, typically within two years.
SPACs have been behind some of the most high-profile public listings of the last 12 months, including electric-vehicle startup Nikola Corp, which went public last month, as investors place bets on which startup will be the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
Nikola shares are up more than 60% since their debut, and Tesla shares have more than quadrupled this year. Chinese electric SUV maker Li Auto last week filed for a U.S. IPO.
""In electrification, we could have played in buses or trucks, but the car part is a very fast-growing market,"" Geoffrey Strong, chairman and chief executive of Spartan and the co-head of infrastructure and natural resources at Apollo, told Reuters.
""While there is room for several brands, we think that Fisker and Tesla will be at the forefront of the pure-play car and SUV segment of the EV market in the years ahead.” 
The Fisker deal, expected to close in the fourth quarter, will provide Fisker with $1 billion in gross proceeds, including $500 million of funds from existing and new investors such as AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB) and BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). 
The proceeds will be used to bring the company's Fisker Ocean SUV to market in late 2022. 
Fisker Chief Executive Henrik Fisker, a one-time Aston Martin designer who launched his latest company in Los Angeles in 2016, said he chose Apollo after talking to a number of SPACs because of its strong financial brand, global reach and experienced management. 
""We're obviously very excited about getting full financing all the way to start of production,"" he said in a telephone interview.
Fisker said the startup is in talks with other companies, including  Magna International  (NYSE:MGA), about building the SUV. Magna declined to comment. Fisker also is talking with other automakers about using their hardware, including vehicle platforms, motors, battery packs, air conditioning, and other parts, while Fisker focuses on design, software and the consumer digital experience. 
""It's really not smart for any EV startup to try and make their own factory,"" he said. ""We're using more the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) model, where somebody else manufactures their phones."" 
In slides presented to investors, Fisker and Spartan said they are in talks to build the SUV on Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) MEB electric vehicle platform to speed the vehicle to market and save on development costs. They also said the manufacturing strategy could include a European factory. 
Fisker also has a memorandum of understanding for Cox Automotive to handle Fisker's vehicle repairs, logistics and warehousing, Fisker said. Cox had no immediate comment.

His previous automotive venture, Fisker Automotive, filed for bankruptcy in 2013 after burning through $1.4 billion in private investments and taxpayer-funded loans.

1640,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 04:45PM ET</span>",Free pizza and a 75-foot statue of Musk: the battle for the next Tesla plant,"By Tina Bellon and Andrea Shalal
(Reuters) - Tulsa, Oklahoma, is an oil-industry town with a 75-foot (23 m) statue called ""The Golden Driller."" 
Austin, Texas, is a progressive city in a conservative state with a thriving software industry and a ""Keep Austin Weird"" counterculture image. 
These two very different towns have one thing in common: They are both on the short list to land a $1.1 billion vehicle assembly plant for Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) - and up to 20,000 new jobs. 
With a decision expected within a few weeks, the Austin-versus-Tulsa contest is heating up as Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, stoke a bidding war over tax breaks and other concessions that would reduce the factory's cost. 
Travis County, home to Austin, is expected to vote this week on a portion of ten-year tax rebates totaling more than $65 million. The company told Texas officials the new plant would create at least 5,000 jobs, while Oklahoma officials were told about the creation of at least 7,000 jobs in the near term and up to 20,000 positions down the line.
But some Austin residents have told officials they are skeptical about subsidizing what is now the world's most valuable auto company, after previously turning away Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
""Instead of focusing to get people a living wage ... you're giving tax breaks to a company that's worth billions. It makes no sense,"" Silvia Zuvieta-Rodriguez, a student at the University of Texas, told officials at a recent county hearing.
Tesla in public filings with Travis County said local and state tax incentives “serve a critical role” in getting the new factory under way and successfully compete against longstanding industry rivals. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment for this story. 
In Oklahoma, Tesla fever is on full display.
That Golden Driller statue? It was recently repainted by a local Tesla fan club to look something like Musk, sporting a Tesla logo on its chest and a belt buckle emblazoned with the company's name.
Musk himself flew in on July 3 to visit the undeveloped site overlooking Tulsa that would house the new factory, which would build Model Y sport utility vehicles and Tesla's futuristic Cybertruck. Musk met with the state's governor under a white tent in the sweltering summer heat, according to pictures posted on Twitter by Oklahoma's governor, Kevin Stitt.
Oklahoma officials were scheduled to make their pitch to dozens of senior Tesla executives in a Zoom call on Monday afternoon.
""The response here continues to be overwhelming,"" said Oklahoma Commerce Secretary Sean Kouplen. ""In the time that we're in, having something positive to hold on to or grab is really making a difference.""
Even local retailers have caught the Tesla bug. Kouplen's children came home the other day with a photo of a special Tesla-themed snow-cone sold by a local store, and a Tulsa pizzeria has promised to give out free pies to all Tesla employees. 
Tulsa, once known as the ""Oil Capital of the World,"" is trying to remake its image with a $1 billion renovation of its downtown, including hip coffeehouses, raft races, jazz clubs and efforts to attract white-collar workers who can work remotely.
A new video featuring testimonials from engineers who recently relocated to Tulsa has been viewed 200,000 times, including by Musk, according to Oklahoma officials. 
Several websites attempting to appeal to Tesla have sprung up. One, called ""Big F*cking Field,"" purports to be in the voice of a plot of land and includes humorously fake endorsements by the likes of Thomas Edison. 
""We were the original oil boom town in the '20s and it's a cool way of saying something is changing,"" said Jacob Johnson, the creator of the websites and a Tulsa-based digital marketing executive.
In its search for a new plant site, Tesla short-listed eight central U.S. states and received incentive packages from many others, but only Tulsa and Travis County remain in the running. The company told Texas officials its plant would create more than 5,000 mainly low-skilled jobs at an average salary of $47,000. 
Oklahoma has signed a nondisclosure agreement about its incentives package, but Kouplen claimed the bid was not only competitive but better in parts than Travis County's. It includes business and personal tax breaks, most of which were already guaranteed under state law, which meant they would not require the kinds of public votes that have been delayed several times in Austin.
Details on the Travis County tax breaks emerged only during public hearings and it remains unclear whether the state of Texas would provide additional incentives. Governor Greg Abbott's office did not respond to requests for comment.
Squeezing states for incentives is not new to the auto industry. Tesla itself received some $1.4 billion in incentives to build a battery plant in Nevada in 2014 and Alabama attracted German carmaker Mercedes-Benz (DE:DAIGn) with a $253 million package in the 1990s.

Those outlays now pale compared with the wealth of Musk, who is in reach of a payday potentially worth $1.8 billion as the company's stock rally continues. Tesla shares have more than quadrupled so far this year as the company increased vehicle sales and is expected to return a second-quarter profit.

1641,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 04:26PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: 3 Things to Watch for July 14,"By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Until late Monday afternoon, it looked as though the optimists were beating the pessimists. Then everything changed.
Stocks tumbled after spending most of the day moving up on good news about possible vaccines to combat Covid-19. The turn came after California's governor ordered indoor activities, such as bars, restaurants, movie theaters and museums, to close back down amid rising virus outbreaks in the Golden State.
Earlier, two of California's biggest public school districts announced plans for online-only school starting next month.
Uncertainty about how quickly the economy can rebound from Covid-19 shutdowns has been a dark cloud following stocks, though in the past few weeks, investors took any good news as a chance to push stocks higher, especially technology companies. But on Monday, FAANG stocks came under pressure, with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) paring gains after jumping more than 3% earlier.
Still, technology has been the undisputed sector leader this year, repeating a pattern it has set for the last few years. Big bank earnings kick off on Tuesday, and investors will get data on consumer prices.
Here are three things that could affect the market tomorrow:
1. Technology Still the Undisputed Winner, Even in Pandemic
As of the close on Friday, information technology was the best-performing S&P 500sector this year, up 18% while most other sectors were in the red, according to data from Fidelity. Only two others, consumer discretionary (up 14%) and communications services (up 5.9%) were positive.
On the negative side, energy was worst-hit, down 40.7% this year as the shutdowns because of the pandemic eliminated demand for oil and gasoline products. Financials are also badly hit, down 23% this year, while industrials are down 16%.
Investors continue to put faith in technology stocks while staying wary of companies more closely tied to the successful reopening of the economy, and if that is any indication, the signs are bearish. Overall, the S&P is down 1.4%.
2. Big Bank Earnings on Tuesday
Big banks begin reporting second quarter results on Tuesday, and expectations are that they will show weakness along with the broader market because of Covid-19 shutdowns, which dominated much of the quarter.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) reports second quarter results on Tuesday morning before the opening bell. Analysts tracked by Investing.com are looking for EPS to be down more than 50%, to $1.19 on revenue of $30 billion, which would be up about 5% from last year's second quarter.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) is expected to report EPS of 89 cents on revenue of $18.7 billion, and  Wells Fargo  & Company (NYSE:WFC) is expected to report a loss of 10 cents a share on revenue of $18.3 billion.
Banks have been forced to hold back on share buybacks over concern that credit quality will weaken and result in eventual losses.
3. Consumer Price Data Expected to Show Rise
Data on consumer prices will come out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT) on Tuesday. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect CPI to rise 0.5% in June and notch a gain of 0.6% over last year's June. Core CPI is seen rising 1.1% year-over-year.
While gasoline prices at the pump fell during the lockdown periods, crude oil has regained much of its losses and is now trading near $40 a barrel. Demand continues to be spotty, judging by the rising inventories of U.S. crude reported in recent weeks.
Anecdotally, consumers have seen prices for food products rise, even if they did save some money from lower gas prices and staying home during the lockdowns.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Six major investors in Leaf Group (NYSE:LEAF), pushing for the ouster of the content company's chief, said on Monday his strong ties with a board member compromised a recent strategic review of the operator of online brands.
""The so-called independent review of strategic alternatives at Leaf Group was ... tainted before it ever began in earnest,"" the group wrote to Leaf's board.
The group, which owns over 40% of Leaf's stock, said Chief Executive Sean Moriarty ""had undue influence over the strategic process,"" and that the board ""apparently concealed the conflict of interest from shareholders.""
The group, which started its push to replace Moriarty in late June, includes Osmium Partners, PEAK6 Investments, Boyle Capital Opportunity Fund, Oak Management Corp, Generation Partners II LLC and Spectrum Equity Investors.
Leaf did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
This is the investors' second letter to Leaf's board within four days. They are also demanding a new slate of directors, annual board elections, and the sale of Leaf's media and marketplace assets.
Last year Osmium pushed for Leaf, which operates online brands including LIVESTRONG.COM, to consider an immediate sale of the company.
Monday's letter said Leaf last year appointed Charles Baker to the board and tapped him to oversee a strategic review committee. Later in 2019, Baker was named chief financial officer at Eventbrite (NYSE:EB) where Moriarty serves on the board and oversees the compensation committee.
""It is simply impossible for shareholders to believe Mr. Baker would not heavily weigh the skewed input of Mr. Moriarty, an executive with a desire to continue earning millions every year from his CEO role at a stand-alone Leaf Group,"" Monday's letter said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The fried chicken chain KFC has closed dining rooms in corporate-owned stores in Florida because of the escalation in coronavirus cases in the state, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
The letter, from KFC U.S. Chief Operating Officer Monica Rothgery to franchisees on Monday, said its own Florida restaurants would operate only drive-thru and suggested owner-operators consider doing the same in ""hot spots"" where new cases are surging, including Arizona, California, Florida and Texas.
KFC is a unit of Yum! Brands (N:YUM). The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Florida recorded more than 12,600 new coronavirus cases on Monday, its second-highest daily total since the outbreak began, coinciding with the state's attempt to revive tourism and attract visitors to the recently reopened Disney World.
Top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci attributed the current surge in coronavirus cases to the United States' not having shut down completely to snuff out outbreaks of the disease and specifically called out the four states where cases are increasing sharply.
With restaurants among the hardest-hit sectors economically, some independent restaurants and smaller chains have sought to reopen dining rooms as quickly as allowed, with extra safety measures in place.
But fast food giants have not been in such a rush because their drive-thru sales have mostly made up for lost walk-in business during the pandemic.
Customer transactions at major quick-service chains were 9% lower in the week ended July 5 compared with the same period the previous year. That is an improvement over the 13% year-over-year drop from the prior week, data provider The NPD Group Inc said on Monday.
By contrast, full-service sit-down restaurants still had 30% fewer transactions than the previous year, NPD found.

Earlier this month, McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) delayed reopening dining rooms as a number of states enacted new restrictions, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The new round includes investors such as TSG Consumer Partners and IVP, and brings the seven-year-old online brokerage's total fundraise to $600 million in a span of two months.
The funding round is widely being seen as a precursor to an initial public offering (IPO), according to analysts tracking the company, which has benefited from a surge in day trading, driven by consumers stuck at home during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Some traders and analysts have attributed rallies of between 300% and 500% in stocks of bankrupt or soon-to-be-bankrupt companies such as Hertz, Chesapeake, Whiting and JC Penney (OTC:JCPNQ) to retail investors using Robinhood, which has more than 10 million users.
The company, however, has been criticized for not doing enough to moderate excesses that even led to a suicide. 
Last month, Robinhood said it may make it harder to qualify to do sophisticated options trading on its platform and would improve its user interface. 
The Menlo Park, California-based startup has also experienced several outages since early March, particularly on days of high trading volumes.

(Reuters) - Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd, the blank check company backed by billionaire investor Bill Ackman, has increased the size of its initial public offering by $1 billion to $4 billion, the largest ever IPO by a special purpose acquisition company.
The firm plans to go public with 200 million units at $20 each, according to a regulatory filing on Monday.
A SPAC uses IPO proceeds and borrowed funds to acquire a company, typically within two years. Investors are not notified in advance which company a SPAC will buy. 
Ackman, whose New York-based hedge fund manages more than $10 billion in assets, may ultimately have $7 billion to invest.
In the filing, Ackman said (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811882/000119312520191638/d930055ds1a.htm) the company will seek to acquire a venture capital-backed firm that he called a ""mature unicorn"" which has chosen to remain private.
Reuters first reported Ackman's plans in June.
Ackman, best known as an activist shareholder who calls for changes at companies, was also a co-sponsor of Justice Holding Inc, a SPAC which acquired restaurant chain Burger King for $1.4 billion in cash in 2012.
Ackman's latest vehicle will handily beat out former  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) executive Michael Klein's Churchill Capital III Corp , which raised $1.1 billion in February, to become the largest ever SPAC.
Churchill Capital late on Sunday agreed to take healthcare payment solutions provider Multiplan Inc public in an $11 billion deal.

Ackman is looking to list the SPAC's shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""PSTH.U"".

1662,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 11:09AM ET</span>",Billions Flow Into Quant ETFs Behaving Just Like the S&P 500,"(Bloomberg) -- The near $1 trillion chunk of exchange-traded funds known as smart beta has got a problem: Some of the most popular don’t seem that smart.
More than $14 billion this year has flooded into five of these quant strategies, which are wrapped up in an ETF in a bid to blend active and passive investing. Yet about $5 billion of this went to funds that barely deviate from the stock market, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The smart-beta products with the purest exposures to systematic factors actually lost cash.
The implications of this multi-year trend could be major for an industry that’s swelled to a fifth of America’s $4.4 trillion ETF market. Legions of investors may not be getting the diversification they’re paying for, while those who are sour on the smartest funds as key strategies misfire.
It highlights the headwinds providers face as they struggle to convince investors to ditch cap-weighted benchmarks and adopt next-generation products.
“The flows basically show investors are hesitant to take on large concentrated bets,” said Athanasios Psarofagis, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s a balance between picking a product that’s more true to the craft versus what’s easier to fit into a portfolio.”
Born from the work of Nobel laureates and pitched by the biggest firms on Wall Street, smart-beta funds are an attempt to capture potential excess returns by following academically proven quantitative strategies.
Where index ETFs weight companies by their market capitalization, a smart-beta version would typically select and weight constituents based on factors such as profit growth or relative cheapness.
Yet most watered-down funds -- those behaving most like the stock market overall and with a portfolio least representative of their factor -- have lured $40 billion over the past three years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Their most-pure peers, which tend to be more volatile but offer larger factor exposures, netted just $7 billion.
One reason: It’s becoming ever-more painful for advisers and allocators to deviate from major benchmarks.
For instance, a few mega-cap tech companies increasingly dominate the S&P 500, helping the latter beat value and small-cap indexes by at least 50 percentage points over the past decade. The trend intensified this year as fears over the economic impact from the coronavirus spurred investors to take refuge in large growth stocks.
“Investors want a different experience than a cap-weighted approach, but they also don’t want to deviate too much from the market,” said Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA Research’s head of ETF and mutual fund research. “From an adviser’s perspective, it’s a lot harder to explain why something that’s intended to be a better investment experience than a cheap, market-weighted product underperforms so much.”
Of course, even the purest ETFs can’t exactly mimic the academic portfolios that inspired them. The original models envisaged by Nobel Laureate Eugene Fama and Kenneth French are meant to have both long and short positions, but that’s pricey and more complex to implement, so smart-beta ETFs usually take a long-only approach.
Either way, several major factors have struggled in 2020, according to market-neutral Bloomberg indexes. Value is down almost 8%, while momentum shares and dividend payers are barely changed.
For factor advocates, underperformance is par for the course. The strategies are intended to work over very long time horizons, and lengthy periods lagging the market should be expected, though even the most loyal quants are voicing concern at the protracted bout of pain for factors such as value.
That’s partly why purer factor ETFs have struggled to lure more money -- deviation from benchmarks has generally not been rewarded since the last crisis.
Double Edged
Meanwhile, methodology can have a major impact on performance even when two strategies track the same investing style. The average one-year performance gap between the best- and worst-performing value ETFs is 16 percentage points, says Psarofagis at Bloomberg Intelligence.
For example, the $48 billion Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) uses five measures to identify about 330 cheap large-cap stocks. The $101 million Alpha Architect U.S. Quantitative Value ETF (QVAL) includes mid caps and only holds about 40-50 shares selected by a proprietary multiple.
The latter naturally looks very different from any equity benchmark, and has also dropped twice as much as VTV over the past year.
The way Alpha Architect founder Wes Gray sees it: His firm’s funds are like a concentrated detergent that investors can dilute however they want. They might deviate more from the benchmark, but that’s necessary if investors want to capture factor premiums.
“If you believe in academic research, if you think it makes sense, we’re going to be the way you capture it in its purest form possible,” he said. “That’s a double-edged sword obviously.”
Some watering down may be inevitable -- or even desirable from clients’ perspective.
“Advisors and institutions are oftentimes tied to how much tracking error they can take,” said Psarofagis. “So they naturally have to gravitate to the watered-down products that are easier to slip into a core allocation.”
Still, the degree to which long-only funds are acting like the broader market is striking. The 10 largest smart-beta ETFs all have a one-year correlation with the S&P 500 of at least 0.97, with 1 denoting perfect synchronicity.
The phenomenon is not limited to the exchange-traded market. An academic paper published last month studied smart beta across both ETFs and mutual funds and concluded that about a third of products are essentially market-index funds, and even argued that their names are misleading.
To a practitioner, that might sound harsh.
Many would argue academic research can’t be directly translated into products, and even Fama-French models have come under fire in recent years amid persistent underperformance. And with the pandemic whiplashing systematic trades, diversification is harder to find. Evercore ISI analysis last week showed macro forces were driving 78% of the moves in the S&P 500.
Ultimately then, investors would be wise to make sure they’re not paying a premium for products that in practice can act like a cap-weighted index tracker.
“The extra fees investors are paying for these funds should justify the extra factor exposures they’re getting,” said Vitali Kalesnik, head of equity research at Research Affiliates LLC, a smart-beta pioneer.

LONDON (Reuters) - Rating agency S&P Global cut its emerging market growth forecasts on Monday, predicting a 4.7% slump on average this year due to the coronavirus and warned that all countries would be left with permanent scars too.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Monday, as the feeding frenzy in tech stocks pushed the Nasdaq Composite to yet another record high, despite continuing signs that the coronavirus pandemic threatens to lurch completely out of control in the U.S.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the NASDAQ Composite was up 1.2% at 10,745 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were both up 0.8%, the Dow posting a gain of 208 points to 26,279.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock - again - was at the center of some of the most intense buying, rising 11.3% to another new record on speculation that another quarter of profitability will see it included in the S&P 500, forcing all the passively-managed funds benchmarked to the index into buying it. S&P regularly rebalances its index, and Tesla is clearly the biggest stock in the U.S. not included in it, but four straight quarters of profits is only one of many criteria the index provider insists on.
Tesla has now rallied 83% in the last month alone, mainly on the back of such speculation, which is taking place increasingly through the options market. However, the company is still having to discount sharply to shift inventory: it announced a 6% cut in the price of its new Model Y crossover at the weekend, only three months after debuting the model.
Elsewhere, Maxim Integrated Products (NASDAQ:MXIM) stock rose 13.4% to a new record higher after agreeing to be bought by  Analog Devices  (NASDAQ:ADI), a rival maker of semiconductors, in a deal that values the combined company at around $70 billion. 
United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock fell 5.0% and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock fell 2.9% as a succession of negative headlines about the pandemic dented hopes for a quick recovery in air travel. The U.S. posted over 60,000 new cases for the third straight day on Sunday, according to Johns Hopkins data. 
The broader market was underpinned ahead of the upcoming earnings season by a note from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in which the investment bank raised its full-year earnings estimate for S&P 500 stocks by just under 5%. However, it cautioned that outlooks would be more important than historical earnings figures through June - a period that the market has already tried to write off in its memory. 
The first major U.S. company to report - PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP),- delivered earnings that were slightly ahead of forecasts but pointedly declined to give a financial outlook for the rest of the year, citing pandemic-related uncertainty. It still promised $7.5 billion of shareholder payouts this year, of which $2 billion would be in the form of share buybacks - but didn't indicate whether or how much it would have to borrow to do this. 
Elsewhere, U.S. crude oil futures drifted 1.0% lower on the prospect of OPEC and its allies loosening their output restraint pact. Shale producer  Parsley Energy 's (NYSE:PE) stock fell 3.5% after CEO Matt Gallagher he thought U.S. oil output may never recover its pre-pandemic levels."

Major theater operators in the United States have laid off thousands of employees and borrowed funds to stay afloat amid weeks-long lockdowns, which may be extended as infections continue to surge.
AMC, the world's largest movie theater operator, said the deal with a group that holds about 73% of its $2.3 billion in senior subordinated bonds would reduce its total debt by between $460 million and $630 million.
The company added it had raised $300 million in new first lien financing, helping its shares rise more than 5% in premarket trading. 
AMC in June had delayed the opening of its theaters to the end of this month as Hollywood puts off movie releases due to surging coronavirus cases, while major markets such as Los Angeles pause on deciding when theaters can reopen.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google on Monday said it would spend around $10 billion in India over the next five to seven years through equity investments and tie-ups, marking its biggest commitment to a key growth market.
The investments will be done through a so-called digitization fund, highlighting Google's focus on the rapid pace of growth of apps and software platforms in India, one of the world's biggest internet services markets.
""We'll do this through a mix of equity investments, partnerships, and operational, infrastructure and ecosystem investments,"" Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, said on a webcast during an annual ""Google for India"" event.
""This is a reflection of our confidence in the future of India and its digital economy.""
The new $10 billion investment was the largest Google had done in India, Pichai said.
""We're particularly focused on making sure the internet expands beyond English and other vernacular languages. That's an important angle we've looked at,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
Google wants to bolster the growth of internet in India, which currently has over 500 million active users, and help get another 500 million people online, Pichai said. 
Beyond investments via the fund, Google, would also focus on areas like artificial intelligence and education in India, he added.
Google has already made some direct and indirect investments in Indian startups such as local delivery app Dunzo.
Indian-born Pichai joined Google in 2004, and is widely credited for making the Chrome browser. He replaced company co-founder Larry Page as CEO of parent Alphabet Inc last year.

The U.S. tech group, whose Android mobile operating system powers a bulk of India's roughly 500 million smartphones, will continue to work with manufacturers to build low-cost devices so that more and more people can access the internet, another Google executive said.

1674,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 08:54AM ET</span>","Italian Banks Most Exposed to Virus-Hit Sectors, Risking Capital","(Bloomberg) -- Italian banks have the highest portion of loans to industries suffering the most from the coronavirus pandemic, making their capital buffers more vulnerable to any deterioration in asset quality.
Credito Emiliano SpA, Banco BPM SpA, BPER Banca SpA and Unione di Banche Italiane SpA top the list of more than 100 European banks exposed to industries badly hurt by the crisis, according to a research conducted by Eric Dor, director of economic studies at the IESEG School of Management in Lille, France.
“Loans to depressed sectors by several Italian banks are more than four times larger than their CET1 equity, so their capital would be wiped out if 25% of their loans default,” Dor said in a phone interview. The sectors suffering the most are wholesale and retail trade, construction, manufacturing, accommodation and food service, as well as transportation and storage, according to the research.
A 10% depreciation of the loans to the vulnerable sectors would hit capital ratios very hard at Credito Emiliano, Banco BPM, BPER, and UBI, according to the research, which cites data from the European Banking Authority.
RCI in France, Bankinter SA in Spain,  Piraeus Bank SA  (OTC:BPIRY), Eurobank SA and Alpha Bank AE in Greece and Hamburg Commercial Bank in Germany are the most exposed in their respective countries.
While some of the banks are protected by fairly high capital levels, some have a much smaller margin of error. Those include Credito Emiliano, Banco BPM, BPER Banca, Bankinter and Piraeus Bank, according to the research.
“Some banks may need to be recapitalized in such a scenario, but I think this is a manageable situation, because most of the largest lenders are well capitalized after the cleanups of recent years, and are able to face a big increase of loan loss provisions,” Dor said.

The new bottle, developed in partnership with venture management company Pilot Lite, will be made from wood pulp that meets food grade standards and is fully recyclable, the Guinness and Tanqueray Gin maker said. 
Diageo and Pilot Lite have launched a sustainable packaging company called Pulpex Ltd to develop the paper bottle and collaborate on research and development.
Pulpex will also create branded paper-bottles in non-competing categories for companies including Lipton team maker Unilever (NYSE:UL) Plc and soda maker PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), which are also expected to launch next year. 
Consumer product companies have come under increased scrutiny for the amount of plastic they use in packaging food and other household items. In Europe, for example, 8.2 million tonnes of plastic were used to package food and drink in 2018, according to ING analysts.

Diageo uses less than 5% of plastic in its total packaging, but along with Unilever and PepsiCo, has set targets to reduce and recycle plastic in their packaging as part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals program by 2025.

AL AIN, United Arab Emirates (Reuters) - Aerospace supplier Strata Manufacturing, a key player in efforts by oil producer Abu Dhabi to diversify into high-tech manufacturing, is chasing new income at a time of uncertainty about demand for plane parts.
Strata was set up a decade ago by Abu Dhabi's sovereign investment fund Mubadala in the oasis city of Al Ain with ambitions to become a top-three player in advanced composite materials.
It won contracts from Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) to supply parts for wide-body jets, such as those ordered in large numbers by Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways, in what many in the industry saw as a quid pro quo.
But with aviation in crisis over the pandemic, Strata is pursuing non-aerospace manufacturing - starting with personal protective equipment (PPE) that is in high demand due to the coronavirus itself.
It has begun manufacturing N95 masks in partnership with Honeywell (N:HON), initially for entities in Abu Dhabi, part of the United Arab Emirates.
""We are an agile company. We want to ensure we keep a close eye on the future,"" Chief Executive Ismail Ali Abdulla told Reuters. ""We want to ensure there are opportunities ... in adjacent markets.""
Strata sprang out of the desert in 2009 as part of efforts to broaden the economy and support local employment in a country mostly populated by foreigners. Its workforce is 60% Emirati, mostly women. (https://reut.rs/3j7LSme) 
Abdulla declined to discuss financial performance but said Strata was staying within a budget agreed with Mubadala.
Strata builds parts for Airbus A330, A350 and Boeing 787 jets and the future Boeing 777X. A further line for A380 parts is to be removed after Airbus axed the superjumbo.
Plunging forecasts for long-haul travel are reflected on the shop floor, where around a dozen female workers were assembling N95 masks during a visit by Reuters. 
Few other workers were present, which the company ascribed to shift patterns as part of pandemic health measures.
Strata aims to renew its Airbus and Boeing contracts and is in talks with Swiss planemaker Pilatus. Abdulla warned that planemakers could cut back on business with suppliers as their own output slows due to the pandemic - while insisting there would ultimately be a future in aerospace for Strata.

""Our industry is not short-term or medium-term,"" he said. ""The fundamentals of the industry are very strong on the long-term.""

The auto industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, which shut factories and showrooms forcing traditional carmakers to seek deeper cuts. 
Daimler had already said in November, before the pandemic started, that it would cut at least 10,000 jobs worldwide over the following three years, following peers as they cut costs to invest in electric vehicles while grappling with weakening sales.
The owner of the Mercedes-Benz brand had stuck with a pledge at the time to avoid forced redundancies at its German workforce until 2029.
Daimler board member Wilfried Porth told Stuttgarter Zeitung over the weekend, however, that more than 15,000 workers would now have to take a buyout or retire to avoid forced layoffs.
The works council for Daimler said on Monday it was aware of the seriousness of the situation.
""The tone of our discussion is getting rougher and is putting our cooperation to the test,"" it said. 
Daimler managed to come through a crisis in the past, the works council said, adding it had always found a way forward, and did not expect the situation to be any different this time around. 

Daimler reiterated on Monday the company wanted to avoid forced redundancies, but for this to happen the carmaker needed to find alternative ways of cutting costs.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Monday, with investors optimistic over the approach of company earnings and economic data, despite the continuing unabated growth of coronavirus cases.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 25 points, or 0.8%, higher, Nasdaq Futures up 99 points, or 0.9%. The Dow Futures contract rose 230 points, or 0.9%. These cash indexes are currently on two-week win streaks. 
U.S. equity markets have posted strong gains since the depths of March, helped by better-than-expected economic data and extraordinary fiscal and monetary aid from the U.S. authorities.
With this in mind, confidence surrounds this upcoming earnings season, despite the S&P 500 index being expected to report second-quarter earnings some 45% below the numbers seen in the same quarter last year.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has become a little more optimistic on earnings prospects this year, lifting its baseline forecast for S&P 500 earnings per share in 2020 to $115, up from a prior estimate of $110. 
That said, “given the heightened investor focus on the earnings outlook in 2021 and 2022, we expect management commentary will prove more valuable than backward-looking results,” Goldman strategists wrote in a note Friday.
This optimism persists despite the Covid-19 virus continuing to claim victims - the state of Florida registered over 15,000 new cases on Sunday, more than hard-hit New York state at the peak of its crisis in April.
The U.S. has reported more than 60,000 new cases daily for three days in a row now, bringing the national total to more than 3 million cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) are all set to report on Tuesday, while  Pepsico  (NASDAQ:PEP) got the ball rolling Monday. Pepsico declined to give a financial outlook for the year, but its reassurance on shareholder payouts helped lift the stock 2.1% in premarket trading.
Wednesday sees Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of New York (NYSE:BK) report, while Thursday has Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Economic data are thin on the ground Monday, but U.S. consumer inflation figures for June are due on Tuesday while retail sales, a key gauge of consumption, are released on Thursday.
Oil prices have drifted lower Monday, ahead of a meeting of OPEC’s technical staff on Tuesday and Wednesday, who are expected to recommend sticking to the timeline for restoring supply to the world market as demand recovers. 
The group, known as OPEC+ and primarily made up of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia, is due to restore 2 million of the 9.7 million barrels withheld from the end of July.
“If the group decides to ease cuts from August 1, this should not lead to a change in views on the market, with most assuming that OPEC+ would start easing cuts by this stage already. However continuing deeper cuts would be more of a surprise,” said analysts  at ING, in a research note.
At 7:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% lower at $39.88 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.6% to $42.56.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.7% to $1,813.95/oz, set for its fifth straight weekly gain. EUR/USD traded at 1.1337, up 0.4%.

1683,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 05:49AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Novacyt Starts to Deliver,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Anyone looking for a straw in the wind about the upcoming earnings season could do worse than look at the first-half update from Anglo-French biotech company Novacyt (LON:NCYT).
The stock has risen over 2,000% so far this year, blossoming from a micro-cap into a small-cap, having been early to the party for developing a diagnostic test for Covid-19.
As was to be expected, the stock went hyperbolic during the height of the panic as the virus swept across Europe and the north-east U.S., but subsided as the market narrative turned to one of stimulus, recovery and reopening. As of Friday’s close, it had lost some 50% from its April peak.
But as the narrative around the pandemic develops, so does the investment case. With the World Health Organization declaring a new daily record high for global infections of over 230,000 at the weekend, with the virus evidently out of control in much of the U.S. and the emerging world, and with the remainder of the world hyper-sensitized to the risks of renewed outbreaks, it's clear that the demand for Covid-19 diagnostic tests is here to stay for the foreseeable future.
As such, the news that Novacyt’s revenue rose 10-fold in the first half of the year to 72.4 million euros was arguably one of the less interesting elements of its release. Over one-third of those revenues – 25.4 million euros in all – was delivered in June, which shows how strong momentum is going into the third quarter (bear in mind that the U.S. was still in full reopening mode at the end of June).
“It is a sad fact that as of 11 July 2020, the number of global cases is more than 12.7 million, an increase of 69% compared to 11 June 2020,” the company said (our italics).
The company also noted that it now has “a major distribution agreement for its COVID-19 test with a new global strategic partner” in the U.S., a market that is “delivering significant sales growth.”  
No wonder the company was confident to predict “significant ongoing demand for COVID-19 testing well into 2021.”
Even so, the company’s guidance for the rest of the year seems intriguingly restrained, promising only an unspecified increase versus the first half that hints at some short-term bottlenecks in scaling up.
Novacyt said it expects second-half revenue “to be greater than the first half of the year and margins to be at least at a similar level.”
The corollary of this is, it said, is greater cash generation. So much greater, in fact, that it’s also hinting at going shopping. Novacyt said it’s “reviewing its capital allocation policy to enhance and accelerate long-term value creation through its three-pillar strategy of organic, R&D and acquisitive growth.”
It gave no hint as to whether it might need extra capital to satisfy those ambitions. However, given that the rest of the industry is hardly standing still when it comes to Covid, management couldn’t be blamed for trying to force the pace of growth a bit.
Novacyt stock rose as much as 7% on the news initially, paring gains to trade up 2.1% by 5:45 AM ET (0945 GMT)."

The video games industry was caught up in the #MeToo movement in June after several women spoke about abuse and discrimination on Twitter.
Ubisoft said on Saturday the group's chief creative officer, the managing director of its Canadian studios and global head of human resources had resigned from their positions, effective immediately. 
None of them immediately responded to requests for comment sent via their LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profiles. 
Ubisoft said late Sunday that Yves Guillemot, the group's co-founder and chief executive, would take on the chief creative officer role on an interim basis and that it would revamp the ""way in which the creative teams collaborate.""
""Ubisoft has fallen short in its obligation to guarantee a safe and inclusive workplace environment for its employees,"" Guillemot said in a statement.
Analysts said the departures, and potential litigation, could weigh on the company's sales.

Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts said in a note to investors that ""more reports may emerge, with stakeholders potentially holding top management responsible, and potential financial implications including disrupted production and litigations"".

LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - World shares were approaching a five-month peak and the dollar slipped on Monday as investors wagered the earnings season would see most companies beat forecasts given expectations had been lowered by coronavirus lockdowns.
The U.S. earnings season kicks off this week with major Wall Street banks JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) reporting on Tuesday. It's expected to be the second-biggest quarterly earnings drop since 1968, according to Refinitiv data.
""There's a view that the bar has been set pretty low for them to report the almost obligatory 'better than expected' results - the absence of forward guidance from many firms notwithstanding,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.8% as Chinese stocks jumped 2.1% on Monday. Japan's Nikkei gained 2.2% and South Korea 1.7%.
The optimism carried over to Europe, where stocks rose 1%, even as the U.S. on Friday slapped additional duties of 25% on French luxury goods valued at $1.3 billion, in a tit-for-tat response to France's digital services tax.
MSCI's All-Country World Index was just shy of hitting Feb. 26 highs. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 ticked 0.5% higher despite record new cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. over the weekend, a divergence that shows no sign of stopping.
""Ongoing grim U.S. COVID-19 infection news continues to be summarily ignored in favour of ongoing optimism regarding the time-line for the discovery and rapid roll-out of an effective vaccine and/or more policy support for asset prices and the U.S. economy,"" Attrill said.
The risk-on rally saw the U.S. dollar dip 0.2% against a basket of major currencies after three straight weeks of losses.
The euro, meanwhile, rose 0.2% to $1.132 to maintain its slow uptrend since late last month. Looming large for the common currency was a planned EU summit on July 17-18, where leaders need to bridge gaps on long-term budget and economic stimulus plans. [FRX/]

Safe-haven German yields rose slightly, and Italy's 10-year yield hit the highest level in over a week at 1.33% in early trade as investors bagged profits after the recent rush to safety cooled.
Yields on U.S. 10-year notes came close to record lows last week at 0.569% and were last at 0.63%.
Super-low rates have in turn been a boon for non-yielding gold which hit a near nine-year high after five straight weeks of gains. The metal was last at $1,807 an ounce, just off a $1,817.17 top.

1686,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>","Alibaba's Jack Ma sells $8.2 billion worth shares, stake dips to 4.8%: filing","SHANGHAI (Reuters) -  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd co-founder Jack Ma has cut his stake in the company over the past year to 4.8% from 6.2%, cashing out around $8.2 billion at its current share price, the firm's annual filing released on Friday showed.
The divestment comes as Ma retired as the Chinese e-commerce company's executive chairman in September and pulled back from formal business roles to focus on philanthropy.
Alibaba did not disclose the average selling price of his divestment. Its share price has risen around 40% since Ma reported his 6.2% holding in the company a year ago.
The stock's stellar performance has been helped by forecast-beating earnings growth, even as China's economy sharply slows, as more people shop online for essentials due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai also reduced his stake in the company over the same period, to 1.6% from 2.2%. The offloaded shares were worth $3.3 billion as of Friday.
Both Ma and Tsai have been steadily less involved in Alibaba's regular operations since Daniel Zhang was announced as Ma's successor as company chairman. He assumed that role formally in September 2019.
Throughout this year, the two have donated millions of units of personal protective equipment (PPE) via their individual charity arms to hospitals worldwide to help fight the spread of COVID-19.
An April 2019 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission stated that Ma would plan to sell up to 21 million shares within one year to support his philanthropic efforts.

(This story corrects Jack Ma's share sale to $8.2 bln, his original stake to 6.2%, Tsai's sale to $3.3 bln and his original stake to 2.2%.)

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Monday, with investors looking at the possibility of more stimulus as the new earnings season kicks off.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 1.2%. 
France will unveil “massive” support for youth employment this week and a new broad stimulus plan including tax cuts for companies at the end of August, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Monday.
This comes ahead of Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting as well as the gathering of the 27 European Union leaders later this week to negotiate the seven-year EU budget and the creation of a 750 billion euro stimulus fund.
Earnings season for the second quarter gets underway this week. In the U.S., major banks, including  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), are due to report by Friday, while in Europe, numbers from microchip equipment maker ASML (AS:ASML), miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) and telecom equipment firm Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) are also due.
Elsewhere,  G4S  (CSE:G4S) stock soared 8.5% after the security firm said its first-half earnings will be ""significantly"" above market expectations.
Novacyt (LON:NCYT) stock rose 2.4% after the company reported booming sales of its Covid-19 test.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) stock gained 1.1% on a report that the Swiss banking giant could cut ""hundreds"" of jobs as part of a new savings program.
However,  Ubisoft  Entertainment (PA:UBIP) stock dropped 8.1% after the video games maker company announced a shakeup due to allegations of misconduct and inappropriate behavior. Boohoo (LON:BOOH) shares slumped 13% after Standard Life Aberdeen sold two thirds of its holding in the fast fashion retailer after what it said was an 'inadequate' response to claims that it used sweatshop labor in its supply chain. 
Helping Monday’s positive tone was the decision of Fitch rating agency late Friday to confirm Italy's credit rating, with a stable outlook. 
However, the durability of this recovery has been put in doubt by the resurgence of the Covid-19 virus. The World Health Organization reported a record 230,370 new cases in 24 hours on Sunday, with the U.S. state of Florida reporting an increase of more than 15,000 new cases in 24 hours, a record for any state, surpassing the peak hit by New York in April.
Oil prices have drifted lower Monday, ahead of a meeting of OPEC’s technical staff on Tuesday and Wednesday, who are expected to recommend sticking to the timeline for restoring supply to the world market as demand recovers. 
The group is due to restore 2 million of the 9.7 million barrels withheld from the end of July.
At 3:55 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $40.05 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.1% to $42.77.

In a seven-minute video released on Sunday, Suncity founder Alvin Chau rejected social media posts that appeared in recent days alleging the firm was unable to cover customers' financial deposits and that mainland Chinese authorities had information about its VIP customers.
Chau said the VIP club's total fiscal reserves stood at HK$10.58 billion ($1.37 billion) while cash flow used in daily operations was HK$18.6 billion. The group additionally has HK$16.5 billion in two Macau banks, he said.
""We have the capability and enough capital to offset any bad debts and chip deposits of all clients. I would like to reiterate that Suncity is a very stable financial platform.""
As Chau spoke, the video showed images of letters dated July and bearing Suncity's name beneath the letterheads of two of China's biggest banks.
Suncity has never received any requests from mainland or overseas authorities demanding customer information and, contrary to online speculation, there has been no leak of any data, he said.
""Suncity has completely abided by the law in operating tourism and gaming businesses in Macau,"" Chau said, adding that no employees are stationed in or participate in any gaming related businesses in the mainland.
Casino gambling is illegal in China outside Macau's special administrative region.
Last July, Suncity was singled out by state-backed Chinese media which attacked online gaming activities for causing what it described as great harm to China's social economic order. Suncity last year said it did not operate any online gaming.
Suncity's publicly listed entity in Hong Kong, Suncity Group Holdings Ltd (HK:1383), does not include its junket operations. Junket operators are go-betweens who bring high rollers to play at casinos, extending them credit and collecting on their debts.
Chau also denied speculation that Suncity was subsidising Hong Kong ""rioters"" with the group having ""wholehearted devotion to the motherland"".

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open higher Monday, with investors looking at the possibility of more stimulus as the new earnings season kicks off.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 1.1% higher. CAC 40 futures in France were up 1.4%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.6%.
Stock markets around the globe have bounced strongly since the depths of March, helped by better-than-expected economic data and large levels of fiscal and monetary aid from central banks and governments alike.
However, the durability of this recovery has been put in doubt by the resurgence of the Covid-19 virus. The World Health Organization reported a record 230,370 new cases in 24 hours on Sunday, with the U.S. state of Florida reporting an increase of more than 15,000 new cases in 24 hours, a record for any state, surpassing the peak hit by New York in April.
With this in mind, attention this week will focus on the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday and then the get-together of European Union leaders, on July 17-18, to discuss, among other things, the proposed 750 billion-euro recovery fund for economies hit hardest by Covid-19.
Helping Monday’s positive tone was the decision of Fitch rating agency late Friday to confirm Italy's credit rating, with a stable outlook. 
“Fitch clearly indicated that ECB's PEPP is a key driver for the low financing costs and as such also a backstop for the fiscal position,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note.
The U.S. corporate earning season will start this week, with Europe to follow in earnest next week, providing another window to assess the scale of the damage as well as the recovery, from the pandemic.

1693,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 01:00AM ET</span>","Goldman Boosts S&P 500 Earnings Outlook, Says Focus on Guidance","(Bloomberg) --  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). has become a little more optimistic on earnings prospects for the S&P 500 Index this year but stressed that management commentary from companies is going to be important to gauging the outlook.
Goldman’s baseline forecast for S&P 500 earnings per share in 2020 is $115, up from a prior estimate of $110. The firm maintained its outlook for 2021 at $170 -- 4% above 2019’s realized level -- and made a prediction of $188 for 2022.
“Given the heightened investor focus on the earnings outlook in 2021 and 2022, we expect management commentary will prove more valuable than backward-looking results,” strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note July 10, ahead of the start of the second-quarter reporting season.
Equities globally are trading at close to the highest levels since February, putting the focus on whether the profit outlook will back up bullishness fueled by central bank and fiscal policy support. In the U.S., a swathe of companies have yet to provide concrete guidance on the impact of the pandemic.
Investors are likely to look “below the surface of aggregate results to better understand the earnings impact of shutdowns and how quickly earnings can recover as the world reopens,” Goldman also wrote.
Overall second-quarter results are likely to mask a wide dispersion by sector, according to Goldman. The strategists expect losses in energy and consumer discretionary shares, and a weak quarter from financials. They see more robust performance from utilities and technology companies.
The firm said its projections for S&P 500 profits are below consensus for 2020, but above for 2021 and 2022. Regulation, infrastructure and trade policy are among the risks for the forecasts, the strategists said.
Goldman reiterated the U.S. election in November is likely to create additional uncertainty for earnings, after saying some weeks ago that tax proposals that might be enacted under Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden could sink 2021 earnings per share to $150 from the current estimate of $170.
In the latest note, the strategists said large fiscal expansion could provide a tailwind to earnings and pointed to Biden’s proposals along those lines. Goldman has also suggested hedging for a potential delay in election results.

The Papua New Guinea (PNG)-focused oil and gas company will record a non-cash, pre-tax charge of between $360 million and $400 million in its half-year results that would not impact its cash earnings, it said in a statement to the stock exchange.
A strategic review found that a number of assets in PNG were now of low priority either due to lower prospectivity or less than optimum project economics, Oil Search said, and as a result, would not be currently pursued.
Given gas supply uncertainty due to the recent suspension of mining activities at the PNG-based Porgera project, Oil Search's Hides gas-to-electricity operation that supplies power to the project would be fully written off.
Porgera is a gold mine run jointly run by Canada's Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) and China's Zijin Mining, currently shut down due to a dispute with the PNG government over the country's refusal to extend a mining lease to the companies.

Spreads on corporate bonds need to be higher to compensate for the credit risk, Saurabh Bhatia, head of fixed income at DSP Investment, which manages 772 billion rupees ($10.3 billion) worth of assets in India, said in a telephone interview. “We remain overweight in sovereign bonds,” he said.
India’s central bank is keeping the doors open for more easing after it started using unconventional cash measures in late March to guard against the economic impact of Covid-19. Premiums on 10-year company debt over sovereign bonds have narrowed after the Reserve Bank of India funded banks’ purchases of 1.13 trillion rupees of corporate bonds and cut benchmark interest rates to the lowest level since at least 2000.
Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) Asset Management Co. also recommends avoiding higher-risk India credit because the world’s-biggest lockdown has significantly weakened the debt-servicing capacity of many companies. This wariness among investment funds is clouding the outlook for bolstering finances even amid the stimulus supported buying of riskier and short-term debt from Indian lenders.
RBI Buys So Many Dollars That It Ends Up Helping Bond Market
“We are building more duration in our portfolio and for that are now buying government bonds maturing in seven to 12 years rather than six to nine years we bought until last fortnight,” said DSP Investment’s Bhatia.
The yield gap between top-rated 10-year corporate bonds and similar-maturity government debt has been tightening since late May, after the RBI cut rates and pledged to take more measures. The spreads are at a two-month low of 82 basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
A slump in demand due to the pandemic “could create a negative spiral in the economy and hence in the loan and bond markets,” Pankaj Pathak, a fixed-income fund manager at Quantum, wrote in a research note last week. “We see the risk of a higher amount of rating downgrades and defaults in the next two years.”

1698,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 12, 2020 08:27PM ET</span>","After 133% Rally, SoftBank Investors Bet There’s More to Come","(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son has delivered a clear response to critics who thought the twin disasters of WeWork and the coronavirus would bring down his empire: not just yet.
The Japanese technology giant’s shares have more than doubled from their March low, propelled by buybacks and improving market conditions for its portfolio companies. SoftBank bonds, which traded at less than 65 cents on the dollar in March, have recovered to near par. Son, 62, has seen his own net worth soar to $20 billion, the highest since the Bloomberg Billionaires Index began tracking his wealth.
Plenty of investors remain skeptical of SoftBank and Son himself. Still, multiple factors suggest more room for short-term gains: Earnings are set to recover from last quarter’s record loss, shorts are under pressure to cover losing bets by buying shares and SoftBank’s share buybacks of as much as 2.5 trillion yen ($23.4 billion) are just getting started.
“The share price can still double,” said Richard Kaye, Japan equity analyst and portfolio manager at Comgest Asset Management, which holds a $60 million stake in SoftBank. There has been too much focus on WeWork, he says, and not enough on the “eight or nine things that have gone very right.”
Son has made a career out of confounding his doubters. After backing hundreds of startups during the dot-com boom, Son lost a record $70 billion as almost all those companies failed, leaving SoftBank’s future in doubt. Yet he slashed costs and survived. In 2006, he acquired the Japan unit of  Vodafone  Group (LON:VOD) Plc in a widely panned $15 billion deal that few thought would pay off. Son turned the business around, in part by persuading Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s Steve Jobs to give him exclusive rights to the iPhone in Japan.
Yet the past year proved the Japanese entrepreneur’s most challenging in decades. After refocusing SoftBank on technology investments with the $100 billion Vision Fund, several startups he had backed ran into trouble, culminating with WeWork’s disastrous flop. The coronavirus pummeled SoftBank’s investments in the so-called sharing economy, businesses built on people splitting the use of cars, rooms and offices. Credit default swaps, the cost of insuring against default, spiked to the highest level in a decade.
Son had a lifeline this time around, however, that he lacked during the dot-com bust: his stake in Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. worth more than $150 billion that could be sold for cash at any time. In March, just days after a record plunge in its shares, SoftBank said it would sell 4.5 trillion yen in assets. That has helped fund a record pace of stock buybacks this year -- and they’re far from over.
SoftBank has announced three buybacks this year, completing only one of them, a 500 billion yen program announced March 13. While that was wrapped up June 15, the company has already announced two separate programs totaling 1 trillion yen -- a further 1 trillion yen has been promised, but not yet committed.
SoftBank’s pattern of buying its shares is also significant. In line with Tokyo Stock Exchange guidelines, buybacks stopped for five days before the fiscal year-end in March. In April, having bought every day that month, buybacks suddenly paused for an entire month, during which SoftBank announced earnings. Ahead of that halt, however, the amount bought each day surged to triple the usual amount for five consecutive days. Many of these days saw outsize moves in SoftBank stock -- rising by 5.2% one day, and 6.9% on another. With earnings just over a month away, the current pace may increase in a similar pattern.
SoftBank said it would follow stock exchange guidelines for repurchases, without providing any more detail.
At the same time, margin sales on the Tokyo Stock Exchange are at the highest level since December 2012, according to data from the bourse. Sales on margin, a type of short-selling, represent bets against the company -- which many investors had also tried in 2012 following the announcement of its Sprint Corp. acquisition.
But those who bet against it eight years ago lost out -- in the first six months of 2013, as margin sales dropped, the stock more than doubled. History might repeat itself. If the upward pressure from the buybacks is sustained, that could force shorts to cover their positions, sending the stock even higher.
“The shorts got this one wrong,” said Ikuo Mitsui, a fund manager at Aizawa Securities Co. “Going forward there’s likely to be more short-covering which will make it harder for the share price to drop.”
In recent months, Son has argued the key metric for SoftBank investors shouldn’t be profit or revenue but shareholder value, specifically the equity value of the company’s holdings minus its net debt. “You should look at shareholder value, how much gain or a loss the company recorded, because we are an investment company,” he said earlier this year.
In fact, SoftBank has taken to providing its own daily calculation of what its shares should be worth, based on its equity holdings of Alibaba, T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc. and the domestic wireless operator SoftBank Corp. As of Friday, shareholder value stood at 13,230 yen, according to SoftBank, more than twice its share price even after the run-up of more than 130% from its March low.
SoftBank has benefited from a rebound in its portfolio of companies, particularly Alibaba. The e-commerce giant hit record after record this year, with its market valuation pushing past $700 billion. Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc., a key Vision Fund investment, has more than doubled since its mid-March trough.
The macroeconomic environment is also improved in recent months. Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts including Atul Goyal wrote in a May report that the Federal Reserve support of the U.S. market is a boon for SoftBank. With the Fed backstop for investment grade and high-yield bond market, they write, “a lot of that excess money supply and liquidity is likely to flow to higher-yielding investments.”
There are signs that SoftBank’s portfolio of startups will face an improved reception as they look to go public. Online home-insurance provider Lemonade Inc., one of Son’s investments, more than doubled after its initial public offering this month.
The company’s debt has also recovered. SoftBank’s 6.875% perpetual dollar bonds plunged in March to as low as 64 cents on the dollar and have since recovered to around par on Thursday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
”SoftBank executing on its asset sale target is a positive for the credit,” CreditSights analyst Mary Pollock said.
On Thursday, SMBC Nikko analyst Satoru Kikuchi raised his price target for SoftBank, using a sum-of-the-parts model that lifted his valuation 11% to 7,000 yen.
Risks -- and skeptics -- remain. A surge in virus cases in the U.S. could still break the Fed’s magic spell over the markets, while the U.S.-China trade war could disrupt business and upend companies like Alibaba. Investors also fret that Son will be tempted to bail out troubled portfolio companies, like he did with WeWork.
Kiyoshi Ishigane, chief fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Kokusai Asset Management Co. in Tokyo says he personally wouldn’t suggest going overweight on SoftBank given how fast the stock has risen over the past couple of months.
But for Son’s fans, the inscrutable billionaire has pulled off yet another escape from the abyss.
“As the market starts to realize the strength of SoftBank’s position,” said Comgest’s Kaye, “there will be a proper reassessment of SoftBank’s share price.”

1699,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2020 05:25PM ET</span>",Tesla slashes Model Y SUV price as pandemic weighs on auto sector,"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) cut the price of its sport utility vehicle Model Y by $3,000, just four months after its launch, as the U.S. electric carmaker seeks to maintain sales momentum in the COVID-19 pandemic.
The reduction follows price cuts in May on Tesla's Model 3, Model X and Model S.
The company headed by Elon Musk this month posted a smaller-than-expected fall in car deliveries in the second quarter, resilient results despite the pandemic that hit the global auto industry.
The Model Y now starts at $49,990, down nearly 6% from its previous price of $52,990, according to the carmaker's website. 
Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
The company started deliveries of the Model Y in March, promising a much-awaited crossover that will face competition from European carmakers like Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) rolling out their own electric rivals.

In April, Tesla had said the Model Y was already profitable, marking the first time in the company's 17-year history that one of its new vehicles turned a profit in its first quarter.
