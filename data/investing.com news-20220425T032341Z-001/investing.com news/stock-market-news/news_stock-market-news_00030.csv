Investing.com -- At last - a corporate news story that has nothing to do with Covid-19!
Sadly, it’s not a good one. German payments company Wirecard (DE:WDIG) - a darling of retail investors for years and a rare example of a German startup success on an exchange dominated by 20th century stalwarts -  has failed to banish accusations of improper accounting - principally by the Financial Times - that have dogged it for the last three years.
Wirecard stock fell as much as 22% in early trading in Frankfurt, before retracing to be down only 17.5%, after a special audit by KPMG concluded that it couldn’t validate the company’s accounts for 2016-2018 because it hadn’t received all the information that it considered necessary.  As a result, Wirecard has also been forced to postpone the publication of its annual accounts for 2019, which was scheduled for Thursday.
Wirecard, as usual, front-ran the bad news with its own (much more positive) spin.
“Incriminating evidence for the public allegations of balance sheet forgery has not been identified,” it said in a statement on its website. “With respect to all four areas of the audit - Third Party Acquiring business (TPA), Merchant Cash Advance (MCA)/Digital Lending as well as the business activities in India and Singapore -  no significant findings have been made, which would require an adjustment of the annual accounts 2016-2018.”
KPMG, however, said that it couldn't be sure that Wirecard had given it all the information necessary for its investigation.
“A final declaration of completeness was asked for by us but was, however, not provided by the management by the end of our investigation on April 27,” the accountants said. They also accused the company of taking months to provide the information they had asked for. 
“As a result, we cannot say definitively that these documents and information are complete, correct and free of contradiction,"" KPMG said. ""Similarly, we cannot judge whether all the information and evidence relevant to our judgment have been made accessible. In that regard, we cannot rule out that we would have come to a different conclusion with additional information and documents.”
As for validating the last three years’ accounts, KPMG noted that its mandate had been restricted to examining specific documents and matters related to them. As such, it said, the audit “cannot endorse the correctness of published accounts in general.”
Wirecard retorted that it couldn’t provide the data KPMG wanted because it was the property of third parties, so it provided its own numbers instead.
The investigation included, but was not limited to, allegations by the Financial Times that Wirecard used a Dubai-based entity, Al Alam Solutions, to inflate sales and profit figures. Wirecard, which initially sued the FT in response, has called the claims “nonsense”.
For the most part, investors have been happy to take the Aschheim-based company’s word over the FT’s, buying into a narrative that the allegations are just the expression of envious Anglo-Saxons in league with evil short-sellers.
However, the stock’s reaction on Tuesday suggests something may have shifted in perceptions. The glaring difference between KPMG’s conclusions and the company’s spin is not a good look, and investors don’t like being told that they cannot trust their own eyes, even by someone who has made them rich.
The news leaves the stock effectively where it was two years ago, and down 45% from its 2018 peak.

On Monday the airline published the full details of a plan that may help it survive the coronavirus outbreak, if creditors and shareholders give it a green light. 
""The revised proposal to the bondholders reflects that the company continues to make progress with its other stakeholders,"" Norwegian Air said in a statement.
If the swap is not approved, Norwegian has said, the company would run out of cash by mid-May. It has grounded 95% of its fleet, leaving just seven aircraft in operation.
Among the changes, Norwegian Air proposes to convert 50% of the value of two of the bonds into shares, rather than 60% as first proposed, and 80% of the value of a third bond into shares, rather than 85% as first proposed.

Bondholders will vote on the proposals on Thursday. If they approve the terms, the proposal is then put to a vote to shareholders on Monday.

2,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 05:25AM ET</span>","Another day, another 20% plunge in WTI oil","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Another big fall in oil prices dragged hordes of petrocurrencies under on Tuesday but even an HSBC warning of mounting bad credit and a near 80% plunge in  BP  (LON:BP)'s profits could not keep stock markets down for long.
There was some relatively good news to go with the bad and ugly numbers.
Plans to ease major economies out of coronavirus lockdowns were continuing, UBS lifted European banks 4% with reassuring earnings, while Italy's bonds recovered further after it had dodged a damaging credit rating downgrade on Friday. 
Oil was total carnage though. U.S. WTI (CLc1), which went negative last week, dived 20% in Europe after a scramble by the United States Oil Fund (USO) (P:USO), the largest oil-focused U.S. exchange-traded product, to shift its holdings had underscored the dwindling capacity to store excess supply.
Benchmark brent Brent (LCOc1) was down a more manageable 4.7% but it was still below $19 a barrel which is miles beyond where even the most efficient producer countries can balance their national finances. 
Petrocurrencies were hit too. Canada's dollar  and the Norweigen crown  were both around 0.2% lower, Russia's rouble  was down nearly 0.4%, while Brazil's record low real  and Indonesia's rupiah  had both tumbled 1% overnight. 
""Normally, a lower oil price disproportionately boosts consumer sentiment. However, the storage problem is due to reduced oil demand - if you are not putting petrol in your car, you will not notice the price,"" UBS Chief Economist Paul Donavan said.
""The good news is that the money saved by not buying petrol now may be spent later in the economic bounceback.""
Away from wild oil, there were signs that the market volatility triggered by the rapid spread of the coronavirus over the last few months was easing 
The U.S. stock market's so-called fear gauge, the VIX (VIX), was at its lowest in a month and the U.S. dollar was a tad softer against other major currencies (=USD) at 107.055 yen per dollar  and $1.08697 against the euro (EUR=EBS). 
MARKETS BUILD ON FEDROCK
Markets are looking for any forward guidance from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which meets later on Tuesday and is due to issue a statement on Wednesday. The European Central Bank then meets on Thursday. 
The Fed has led the global monetary policy response to the coronavirus pandemic by cutting interest rates to zero and aggressively buying bonds and corporate credit - a programme it extended overnight to include municipal debt of smaller U.S. cities.
Analysts said it was unlikely that the Fed would make further major policy moves, given the scope and depth of recent action to counter the economic damage caused by COVID-19.
Sweden's central bank had opted not to take its interest rates back into negative territory on Tuesday, sending its currency up 0.5% and to its highest in over a month. (EURSEK=D3) 
""The major central banks are at comparatively expansionary levels. All of them have beefed up asset purchases as much as they could. All of them are close to or even at the minimum lower interest rate bound,"" wrote Thu Lan Nguyen, an analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). 
""They are likely to remain there for the foreseeable future, which would point towards relatively stable exchange rates."" 
The ECB has had less room to manoeuvre on rates and announced an enormous bond-buying program. Still, bickering and indecision over a eurozone rescue package has some in the market expecting deeper action still, perhaps as soon as Thursday.
That has seen the euro left behind as expectations for an economic recovery from the pandemic has pressured the U.S. dollar and driven a rally in riskier currencies such as the Australian dollar.
Still, the fresh fall in oil put the brakes on the charging Aussie , which had climbed more than 1% earlier and has recovered nearly a fifth from a 17-year low struck last month.

Elsewhere the pound  rose 0.3% to $1.2456, having earlier been pressured after Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned it was too dangerous to relax a strict lockdown in Britain.

3,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 05:10AM ET</span>",Tesla's Musk nears $750 million options payday ahead of results,"By Noel Randewich
OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk is on the cusp of a roughly $750 million payday as the electric carmaker's stock recovers from a slump caused by the coronavirus, which led the company to close its factories and furlough workers.
Shares of Tesla surged 10% on Monday ahead of the company's quarterly report this week, and in anticipation it could soon reopen its Fremont, California, plant after it was shuttered because of the pandemic. 
Monday's rally put Tesla's market capitalization at $145 billion. Importantly for Musk, its stock market value reached a six-month average of $96 billion. Hitting a six-month average of $100 billion would trigger the vesting of the first of 12 tranches of options granted to the billionaire to buy Tesla stock as part of his two-year-old pay package.
Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 1.69 million Tesla shares at $350.02 each. Taking Monday's Tesla closing stock price of $798.75 as an example, Musk could sell those shares for a profit of $758 million.
Graphic - Elon Musk's options payout: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpweexwpw/Musk%20payout.gif
Musk receives no salary or cash bonus, only options that vest based on Tesla's market cap and milestones for revenue and profit growth. Musk has already hit a growth target necessary for the first options to vest. 
A full payoff for Musk, who is also the majority owner and CEO of the SpaceX rocket maker, would surpass anything previously granted to U.S. executives. 
When Tesla unveiled Musk’s package in 2018, it said he could theoretically reap as much as $55.8 billion if no new shares were issued. However, Tesla has since issued shares to compensate employees, and last year it sold $2.7 billion in shares and convertible bonds.
The potential payout for Musk comes after Tesla said this month it would furlough all non-essential workers and implement salary cuts during a shutdown of its U.S. production facilities because of the coronavirus outbreak. The pandemic has slashed U.S. demand for cars and forced several other automakers to also furlough U.S. workers.
Tesla's quarterly report after the bell on Wednesday will show the damage done to global demand by the pandemic and the extent to which a recovery from the coronavirus in China, and a return to production at its Shanghai plant, are helping the U.S. carmaker. 
Investors will also focus on Tesla's cash burn related to its interrupted manufacturing and sales, and on Musk's expectations for consumer demand in a potential long-term global recession, Baird analyst Ben Kallo wrote in a client note last week. The closure of the Fremont plant came just as Tesla was increasing production of its new Model Y sport utility vehicle.
Analysts on average expect March quarter revenue to jump 30% to $5.9 billion, according to Refinitiv. That consensus revenue estimate is down from $6.7 billion at the start of February. Analysts on average expect a non-GAAP loss of 36 cents per share. 
When shareholders approved Musk's pay package, Tesla was valued at about $53 billion and it faced a cash crunch, production delays and increasing competition from rivals. The pay deal was viewed as massively ambitious because it implied the company's value could grow as much as ten-fold in 10 years, and its potentially huge size led some shareholders to oppose it. 
Tesla's market capitalization since then has expanded to nearly three times the combined values of General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F). 

Musk's subsequent options tranches would vest at $50 billion increments of Tesla market capitalization over the agreement's 10-year period, with the billionaire earning the full package if Tesla's market capitalization reaches $650 billion and the high tech vehicle maker achieves several revenue and profit targets.

4,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 05:05AM ET</span>",Bayer faces second investor reckoning over glyphosate litigation,"By Ludwig Burger and Patricia Weiss
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer (DE:BAYGn) on Tuesday faces its second annual investor reckoning over its handling of a wave of U.S. lawsuits claiming its glyphosate-based weedkillers cause cancer.
Criticism from investors at this year's annual shareholders' meeting - held in a virtual format with gatherings banned due to the coronavirus - will likely be less scathing than it was in 2019.
Bayer shares have plunged by about a third since August 2018, when the company lost the first U.S. lawsuit claiming Roundup - acquired via the $63 billion takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) - causes cancer. 
At last year's meeting, Bayer's top management was handed an unprecedented show of shareholder disapproval with a 55.5 percent majority of shareholders voting against ratifying the executive board's business conduct.
Such a vote, which prominently wraps up every German AGM, has no bearing on management's liability or tenure but it is treated as a key gauge of investor sentiment.
Bayer reacted by stepping up efforts to settle the claims and appointing a veteran litigation lawyer to advise the supervisory board.
""We also took to heart the disappointing voting results at last year’s Annual Stockholders’ Meeting. We ... took on board the criticisms expressed and worked to improve,"" Chief Executive Werner Baumann said in prepared remarks addressing investors online on Tuesday.
In the run-up to the event, leading shareholder advisory firm ISS recommended a vote in favour of management and the supervisory board, seeing no evidence that fiduciary duties were breached in 2019.
Glass Lewis, another major proxy advisor, has said investors should abstain because Roundup proceedings were still pending.
Mutual fund firm Deka Investment, one of Bayer's largest German shareholders, said it would give management a vote of approval this time because Bayer had reacted to investor criticism. Deka had given them a thumbs-down last year.
""But with this vote we make an urgent call to bring clarity soon in the matter of litigation,"" said Ingo Speich, Deka's head of sustainability and corporate governance. 
Bayer on March 27 became the first German company to announce a move to hold its AGM online shortly after the German government laid the ground for such a switch.
Shareholders were only able to hand in written question in advance and are stripped of the opportunity to voice their views on management in front of fellow investors as is the norm in a regular meeting. 
The AGM will also see the retirement of Chairman Werner Wenning, who strongly supported CEO Werner Baumann's pursuit of Monsanto. He will be succeeded by Norbert Winkeljohann, a former executive at audit and consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.

Bayer on Monday said the economic downturn and the need to preserve cash means it is taking a tougher stance in talks to settle claims over glyphosate, even as its earnings rose.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese automakers saw a 34% fall in global vehicle sales in March when the coronavirus outbreak began to spread globally, and face a further tumble in the coming months. 
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), Nissan Motor Co (T:7201), Honda Motor Co (T:7267) and the country's four other major automakers posted retail sales of around 1.82 million cars worldwide, down from around 2.77 million a year earlier.

For the financial year ended March, their combined global sales fell 7.3% to 26.5 million vehicles, their lowest in 4 years, Reuters calculations showed based on individual automaker sales figures announced on Tuesday.

6,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 04:40AM ET</span>","BP hikes debt, keeps dividend as coronavirus hammers profits","By Ron Bousso and Shadia Nasralla
LONDON (Reuters) -  BP 's (L:BP) first-quarter profit tumbled by two thirds and its debt climbed to its highest in at least five years as the coronavirus crisis hammered oil demand, but the energy major kept its dividend despite warning of exceptional uncertainty.
London-based BP said it expected significantly lower refining margins in the second quarter when global restrictions on movement to halt the spread of the virus reached their peak, throttling consumption of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.
BP shares were down 2% at 0750 GMT, as analysts questioned whether sticking with the dividend and hiking debt was a prudent strategy. The broader European energy index (SXEP) fell 0.9%.
""I can see many reasons why this recovery will take longer and therefore I think we're in this for quite some time,"" Chief Executive Bernard Looney, who took over in February, told Reuters.
The company said oil and gas production faced ""significant uncertainties"" linked to tumbling oil demand and plunging prices, as well as due to a deal between OPEC, Russia and other producers to cut global supplies of crude by about 10%.
BP reported an underlying replacement cost profit, its definition of net income, of $800 million, beating the $710 million forecast by analysts in a company-provided poll. The company reported $2.4 billion profit a year earlier.
But BP, whose net debt climbed to its highest since at least 2015, kept its dividend of 10.5 cents per share and said it had repurchased shares worth $776 million in the quarter.
Stuart Joyner, equities analyst at Redburn, said BP's ""large rise in net debt overshadows (its) underlying earnings beat.""
""Whilst the quarterly dividend was maintained at 10.5 cents, serious questions remain over its affordability,"" he added.
Including inventory charges of $3.7 billion for oil it holds, the company reported a loss of $4.4 billion.

DIVIDEND QUESTION
BP has so far resisted cutting its dividend after raising it in February, even though some investors have said top oil and gas companies should consider reducing shareholder payouts.
Norway's Equinor became the first big oil firm to cut its dividend, reducing its first-quarter payout by two thirds and suspending a $5 billion share buyback.
BP, like its peers, responded to the 65% drop in oil prices in the first quarter by sharply reducing spending. The company slashed its 2020 budget by 25% to around $12 billion and reduced output at its U.S. shale operations.
Looney said BP aimed to reduce costs so it could generate profits and pay dividends at an oil price of $35 a barrel in 2021, down from a breakeven $56 a barrel in 2019. He said spending could be cut further next year.
Benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) slumped to its lowest in two decades this month and was trading around $19 on Tuesday.
""The key question at this point is how far BP is willing to push the balance sheet in order to protect its dividend,"" RBC wrote in a note, adding that it could end up spending the rest of 2020 and 2021 trying to pay down debt to reduce its gearing.
BP's debt rose to $51.4 billion in the first quarter and its debt-to-capital ratio, or gearing, rose to 36%, significantly higher than its target of keeping it below 30%.
BP held $32 billion in liquidity at the end of the first quarter after it raised extra funds.
Cash flow slumped to $1 billion in the quarter, the lowest in at least six years, compared with $5.3 billion last year.
BP's output in the quarter reached 2.58 million barrel of oil equivalent, excluding its stake in Russia's Rosneft, and 2.9% lower than a year earlier.
It secured an average price of $31.80 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter, a fifth less than a year ago.

Market researcher Kantar said that while April's growth was significantly lower than March's record growth of 20.6% when Britons were building-up stocks for the lockdown, sales were still 524 million pounds ($652 million) higher than they were in April 2019.
It said on average, UK households shopped only 14 times for groceries over the four weeks, a record low and down from 17 in more normal times.
But the drop in shopping trips was matched by a corresponding uplift in the amount spent on each visit to 26.02 pounds - the highest figure ever recorded by Kantar and 7 pounds greater than last year.
The researcher said online sales accounted for 10.2% of the total grocery market, having been about 7% prior to the crisis, with the greatest increase among older shoppers.
In the 12 week period to April 19 total grocery sales rose 9.1% year-on-year.
Market leader  Tesco 's (L:TSCO) sales were up 7.2%, with  Sainsbury 's (L:SBRY), Asda (N:WMT) and Morrisons (L:MRW) up 8.4%, 3.5% and 4.3% respectively.

Oil futures slumped Tuesday after the largest U.S. oil exchange-traded fund said it would sell all its front-month crude contracts to avoid further losses as prices collapse. This renewed decline in oil prices has put a dampener on optimism about the easing of coronavirus-related restrictions seen globally.

Aside from oil, bank earnings have dominated the news flow Tuesday, with the banking sector in the spotlight.
Shares in UBS (NYSE:UBS) climbed 3.9% after the Swiss banking giant reported a 40% increase in first-quarter net profit, as clients increased trading activity during market turmoil sparked by the coronavirus outbreak.

In economic news, French consumer confidence suffered its biggest ever monthly drop in April--falling to 95 from 103 in March, its lowest level since January 2019--amid the nationwide lockdown to contain the novel coronavirus.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) on Tuesday said it expected to post its first annual operating loss in 11 years as the Japanese automaker struggles to recover from plunging vehicle sales as the coronavirus pandemic has sapped demand for cars. 
In a statement, Japan's No. 2 automaker said that it expected an annual operating loss of as much as 45 billion yen ($419.7 million), down from a previous forecast announced in February for an operating profit of 85 billion yen. 
It expects to post a net loss of as much as 95 billion yen, compared with a previous forecast for 65 billion yen profit.
Nissan is bracing for its worst financial performance since the 2008 global financial crisis, when it posted an operating loss of 137.9 billion yen. 
""The company's performance has continued to decline, primarily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Nissan said in the statement, adding that it would delay announcing its annual financial results and restructuring plan to May 28. It had been scheduled for mid-May. 
""Nissan anticipates additional time to finalise the results and is currently reviewing the precise financial impact,"" the statement said.
Global automakers are bracing for a tumble in global vehicle sales, but even before the outbreak, Nissan's sales and profits had been slumping and it was burning through cash, forcing it to row back on an aggressive expansion plan pursued by ousted leader Carlos Ghosn. 
The pandemic has piled on pressure to renew efforts to downsize, and the company's management has become convinced that the company needs to be much smaller, arguing for a recovery plan that will likely cut 1 million cars from its annual sales target, Reuters reported earlier this month.
On Tuesday, the automaker announced that global car sales plunged 43% in March from a year ago, resulting in annual sales of 4.8 million units in the year that ended in March, its worst sales performance since 2011.

Falling sales have prompted the company to slash the number of cars it will produce in Japan in May by 78% from last year, Reuters reported on Monday.

The government has already made loans and a short-time work scheme available to the sector and leaders of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition have agreed to reduce sales tax on meals to 7% for a year, said Altmaier.
""As Economy Minister, I am saying if, contrary to expectations, it lasts a long time until a full opening is possible, we will have to reconsider aid, then we would need something like a rescue fund for gastronomy,"" he told ZDF television.
Germany has started to ease some restrictions, with some shops and factories now open, but most strict social distancing rules are still in place and Germans are required to wear protective face masks on public transport and in most shops.
The government has introduced a range of measures, including a 750 billion euro ($811.43 billion) stimulus package, to help Europe's biggest economy weather the predicted recession and is in talks with Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) about a rescue package for the airline.
Altmaier said he wanted restaurants and guest houses to open as soon as possible but that it must be safe and the priority was to ensure that the infection did not spread.

HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) -  HSBC Holdings  PLC (L:HSBA) on Tuesday warned of more earnings pain to come after first-quarter profit nearly halved as it boosted provisions against bad loans expected to rise amid the coronavirus pandemic.
HSBC also said the outbreak would mean sustained pressure on its revenues as customer activity declined and lower interest rates squeezed margins, while noting that increased fraudulent activity could lead to ""potentially significant"" credit losses.
The bleak update set out the scale of the problems facing Europe's biggest bank by assets as it grapples with corporate borrowers in crisis worldwide, plunging stock, oil and commodity prices as well as low interest rates and difficulty in cutting costs by laying off staff. 
Profit before tax came in at $3.2 billion for January-March, down from $6.2 billion a year ago and below an average analyst forecast of $3.7 billion compiled by the bank.
The bank increased its expected credit impairment charges by a hefty $2.4 billion to $3 billion due to the impact of COVID-19 and said total provisions for the year could range from $7 billion to $11 billion.
Quarterly results were also hit by weakening oil prices as well as ""a significant charge related to a corporate exposure in Singapore"", it said.
HSBC did not name the Singaporean company, but the lender is among leading creditors to Singapore oil trader Hin Leong Trading (Pte) Ltd, which sources have said is under court-appointed supervision to restructure billions of dollars in debt following the collapse of the oil price.
Hin Leong has declined to comment on its debt restructuring.
The London-headquartered bank plans to reduce its operating costs to try and mitigate the fall in revenue, leading to ""materially lower"" profitability in 2020 than last year, it added. 
Its Hong Kong shares (HK:0005) dropped 0.5% in the afternoon session after the results, giving up gains of nearly 2% earlier in the day. 
HSBC Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson told Reuters the bank expected a lower credit loss rate for rest of the year compared to the first quarter.
HSBC's sharply higher loan loss provisions follows similar moves by U.S. lenders this month, as banks brace for the impact of a global recession on their borrowers.
The top four U.S. banks set aside $14.2 billion in loan loss provisions, with sales and trading revenue from investment banking the only silver lining as frenzied markets worldwide drove up commissions.
European peer  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) last Thursday also reported a billion dollar increase in bad loan provisions, although that was cushioned by a bumper return from its trading arm. 
HSBC said last week it is pressing ahead with plans outlined in February to shift capital from underperforming businesses, reduce costs and strip out layers of management.

While many planned job redundancies have been paused to avoid disruption and leaving staff unable to find work elsewhere, Chief Executive Noel Quinn has cut some top level jobs and reshuffled others as he tries to prune HSBC's complicated management structure.

16,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 01:45AM ET</span>","Novartis posts first-quarter sales, profit beat as COVID-19 spurs prescriptions","ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker  Novartis  (S:NOVN) reported rising first-quarter sales and profit that beat analyst expectations and confirmed its 2020 targets as the coronavirus pandemic prompted patients to stock up on their prescriptions in advance.
""COVID-19 did result in increased forward purchasing by customers, including at the patient level, as some patients filled prescriptions to cover a longer period of time,"" Novartis said on Tuesday.
Core net income rose to $3.55 billion, from $2.8 billion in 2019 and compared to the average analyst forecast in a Refinitiv poll of $3.17 billion. Sales rose to $12.3 billion from $11.1 billion in the year-ago period, also above the poll average of $12 billion.
Net income rose 16% to $2.2 billion. The Basel-based company at this time still expects revenue to grow at a mid- to high-single-digit percentage rate, with core operating profit growth even faster at a high-single to low-double-digit rate.
Novartis said the new coronavirus epidemic did not disrupt its underlying operations, but that significant advance buying by patients concerned about access to their medicines helped boost revenue and profits significantly in the first three months of the year.

""Excluding COVID-19 related forward purchases, we estimate sales growth would have been approximately 9%,"" the company said, less than the 13% growth it reported at constant exchange rates.

It reported net profit of $1.595 billion. The bank had previously said it expected to report first-quarter net profit of around $1.5 billion, with strong operating performance across all its business divisions, even after accounting for the risk of higher defaults as a result of the virus. 
""Looking ahead, the range of possible outcomes remains very wide, and it is too early to make reliable predictions about the timing and shape of any potential economic recovery,"" Switzerland's largest lender said in a statement. ""The continued disciplined execution of our strategic plans will help to mitigate this.""
The bank recorded $268 million in credit loss expenses for the quarter, saying it was primarily exposed to credits related to its wealth management clients and within Switzerland and noting its credit book was ""of high quality"".
Cross-town rival  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) on Thursday posted a sevenfold increase in its credit loss provisions, as lenders globally brace for rising defaults due to the virus.

UBS's core business managing money for the world's wealthy saw invested assets decline sequentially to $2.339 trillion on the back of falling asset valuations, while revenues grew across all main lines, helping operating income rise 14%.

18,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 01:20AM ET</span>",Mirae Asset says sued after deadline miss on $5.8 billion Anbang U.S. hotels deal,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean asset manager Mirae Asset Global Investments has been sued over a $5.8 billion deal to buy 15 U.S. hotels from China's Anbang Insurance Group after missing a deadline for the deal's closing, a Mirae spokesman said on Tuesday. 
A consortium led by Mirae agreed last year to buy the hotels in U.S. cities, including in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, from Anbang, which had been selling down its overseas assets after the Chinese government took control of the troubled insurer in 2018. 
The Mirae spokesman said the deal was originally due to be closed by April 17 but has been delayed because certain conditions were not met by the seller.
He declined to give details of the conditions and said the Mirae consortium is still pursuing the deal and coordinating with the seller. 
The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that China's Dajia Insurance Group, which has taken over from Anbang the process of selling the 15-hotel portfolio, asked a Delaware court to compel Mirae to complete the purchase for $5.8 billion, citing a filing at the Delaware Court of Chancery.
Dajia Insurance Group is a new company formed to take over assets from Anbang. Dajia, which China has said will remain privately owned, did not immediately reply to Reuters' emailed request for comment.
It was not immediately clear if other members of the consortium, which is made up of Mirae affiliates and includes Mirae Asset Daewoo (KS:006800), were also sued. It was also not clear whether any damages were being sought. 
While the reasons behind the missed deadline on Mirae's deal are unclear, a growing number of mergers and acquisitions are in danger of collapsing or being delayed as the coronavirus pandemic impacts valuations and clouds the business outlook and funding prospects.
U.S. planemaker  Boeing Co  (N:BA) cancelled a $4.2 billion deal for Embraer SA's (SA:EMBR3) commercial aviation division over the weekend, prompting the Brazilian company to initiate arbitration.
Canada's convenience store chain  Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc  (TO:ATDb) shelved a $5.6 billion buyout of petrol station operator Caltex Australia Ltd (AX:CTX) last week as fuel demand plunges and it looks inward to get through the crisis.
Travel and tourism industries are one of the hardest hit by the pandemic, with hotels in affected regions seeing sharp declines in bookings, according to analysts and industry sources.

South Korean state-owned banks said last week they would provide up to 2.9 trillion won ($2.37 billion) in combined liquidity to support Korean Air Lines (KS:003490) and Asiana Airlines (KS:020560) as the travel industry reels from the coronavirus crisis.

20,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 12:45AM ET</span>","U.S. Stocks Don’t Need to Fall on Economic Damage, Goldman Says","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks may be able to look through a dismal earnings season or two, and the deepest economic contraction in modern history, according to analysis by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
That’s based on historical analysis that suggests equities price in macroeconomic performance over a two-year horizon. As long as projections are -- as they indeed are now -- for the economy to rebound after the current and coming period of pain, then stocks don’t need to fall, the Wall Street bank concluded.
“Investors usually discount at least the next two years of macroeconomic performance, suggesting markets may continue to look through bad news over the near term if it can reasonably be expected to reverse in the coming quarters,” Zach Pandl, co-head of global FX and EM strategy, wrote in a research note Monday.
Stocks have recovered globally over the past month as governments lay out plans to ease shutdowns to fight the Covid-19 outbreak. The S&P 500 is up 29% from its March 23 close, though remains 15% off the February record high.

To be sure, not all strategists share the optimism that a V-shaped economic course is on the cards.
“Economies will be operating well below capacity for an extended period, with unknown GDP/EPS impact,” UBS Group AG strategist Stuart Kaiser wrote in a note Monday. “Risk markets have moved past systemic risk and worst-case virus outcomes to now focus on the depth and duration of the economic shock.”
Goldman’s analysis used consensus GDP expectations as a guide. Early April, the expectation was for a 4% decline in U.S. gross domestic product, with an expansion of about 4% seen for 2021 and 3% for 2022, Pandl wrote. That marks an unusual pattern for a recession, when economists typically downgrade coming year expectations as well as current-year ones, he noted.
“Metrics that focus only on growth over the next one year (e.g., multiples based on next-12-month earnings expectations) will overstate current valuations, given the large rebound expected beyond this year,” Pandl wrote. “For similar reasons, more disappointing data over the near-term may not affect market pricing if activity is expected to snap back relatively quickly.”

About A$1.6 billion of the impairment charges are predominantly related to COVID-19 impacts, the country's second-largest lender said, while the remaining A$600 million relate to certain other individual provisions and net write-offs.
The impairments are in addition to provisions of A$1.43 billion after tax the lender announced earlier this month, mostly for an expected fine over accusations it enabled millions of illegal payments including between known child sex offenders. 
After Westpac's disclosure, two of the country's ""Big Four"" lenders have now detailed a hit to upcoming earnings, with No. 3 lender National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) making an A$1.22 billion provision in late-April. 
Australian banks, already counting the cost of years of financial misconduct through fines and refunds, are now bracing for an expected surge in bad debts as customers seek loan and payment deferrals due to the economic downturn triggered by virus containment measures.
The virus-related impairments were based on a number of assumptions, Westpac said, such as lower expected economic growth, higher unemployment and an expected fall in both residential and commercial property prices.
It also includes an assessment of additional stress that could emerge in various industries as a result of the outbreak, Westpac said.
""While impairment provisions have begun to increase, the extent of additional charges in subsequent periods will depend on the severity and duration of the decline in economic activity and the size and effectiveness of stimulus measures,"" it said. 

Westpac is set to announce results for the six months ending March 31 and its decision on an interim dividend payment on May 4.

26,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 27, 2020 07:45PM ET</span>","Debt Monetization Creeps Closer in Asia, Reshaping Bond Markets","(Bloomberg) -- Bank Indonesia is poised to buy sovereign bonds directly from the government on Tuesday, underscoring a massive shift that is playing out in Asia’s investment landscape.
From Jakarta to Wellington, policy makers are challenging taboos and creeping closer toward the monetization of government debt, taking matters into their own hands after the U.S. and Europe made the front running in crisis management a decade ago.
Global bond funds say the bold action from the region’s central banks can’t come soon enough, even as they worry about the longer-term risks, particularly in the region’s emerging markets.
International investors hold almost one-third of Indonesia’s sovereign debt and rely on India for its high yields. Their stakes are larger still in Australia and New Zealand, where they own about half of all government bonds.
“We need to have an exit strategy sometime down the road, but right now we need aggressive policy reaction and most Asian policy makers have been delivering,” said Jean-Charles Sambor, head of emerging-markets fixed-income at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management in London. “The issuance pipeline is more manageable in Asia than in other regions.”
As the coronavirus has spread from China to its neighbors and around the world this year, bond markets have been thrown into turmoil. Indonesia’s 10-year bond yield skyrocketed to 8.31% while yields on similarly-dated India securities have been buffeted as the government sells bonds at a record pace to fund stimulus. Yields in Australia and New Zealand have whipsawed as traders come to grips with quantitative easing.
“As an investor it’s fascinating to see how quickly things are changing,” said Neeraj Seth, head of Asian credit at BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). in Singapore “You really have to readjust your overall investment paradigm to match with that.”
Calculations by Bloomberg suggest that Bank Indonesia could end up holding 11% of the government’s debt, excluding bills, by the end of February next year, while the central banks of Australia and New Zealand are headed for 24% and 39%, respectively. The Reserve Bank of India looks poised to boost its ownership significantly from the present 15%.
The dangers lurking in these trends are already on display in Japan, where pioneering monetary policy makers have bought almost half the state’s colossal debt without reviving the nation’s economic fortunes.
Indonesia
Bank Indonesia broke the ice last week by purchasing Islamic bonds directly from the government at an auction. It will take another step into unknown territory if it buys regular sovereign debt at an auction on Tuesday.
BI’s purchases should boost market stability in the near term, according to Thu Ha Chow, a portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles Investments Asia in Singapore, which trimmed its Indonesia bond holdings earlier this year.
Foreign investors hold about 32% of the nation’s sovereign bonds, making them vulnerable to sharp moves when sentiment sours.
Chow said her concern is that risk premiums become distorted and global investors get crowded out by the central bank.
“Indonesia is effectively beginning to monetize their fiscal debt,” said Edward Ng, a portfolio manager at Nikko Asset Management Asia Ltd. in Singapore. “If left unsterilized and depending on the magnitude, [this] could lead to currency weakening and inflationary pressure at some point.”
BlackRock’s Seth expects any debt monetization in emerging Asian markets to be “balanced” and for yield curves to remain steep. For rates in Indonesia, the short end of the curve looks more attractive, he said.
India
The Reserve Bank of India currently buys bonds in the secondary market through announced operations to manage banking liquidity, and occasionally via anonymous purchases.
While it is banned from buying straight from the government, legislation passed in 2018 has an “escape clause” that allows the RBI to participate directly in primary auctions if the fiscal deficit is expected to be 0.5 percentage points above the targeted shortfall for the year.
With the federal government slated to borrow a record 7.8 trillion rupees ($102.5 billion) in the 12 months through March, there are prospects of a deficit blowout, which is fueling calls for the central bank to step up.
Governor Shaktikanta Das hasn’t taken a view yet on monetization of the government deficit, nor has the central bank participated in the primary government auctions, Cogencis news reported on Monday.
Investors are deeply concerned about how the market will absorb the supply and it is no surprise they aren’t looking to increase their allocations to Indian bonds, said Abhishek Kumar, the London-based head for emerging markets at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors.
“Governments will spend and the central banks will expand their balance sheets to fund that spending, that’s the global playbook we will witness in the coming months,” said Naveen Singh, head of fixed-income trading at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership in Mumbai. “There is no escape. The RBI will have to come out, sooner or later, with massive bond purchases to fight this unprecedented crisis at our doorstep.”
While India is trying to attract more overseas investors to help with its funding shortfall, this won’t come soon enough to cope with the strains caused by the coronavirus.
Uncertainties are so great that analysts are steering clear of estimating how much sovereign debt the RBI may take on.
New Zealand
Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Adrian Orr has said he’s open-minded about buying debt directly from the government.
While the country’s finance minister has downplayed the likelihood of this, the RBNZ is already gearing up to purchase NZ$33 billion ($20 billion) over a year in secondary markets.
“There’s a certain comfort from these kinds of statements from credible central banks -- the quality of the institution, or government and legislation matters a lot when you’re entering debt monetization territory,” said Hamish Pepper, fixed-income and currency strategist at Harbour Asset Management Ltd. in Wellington.
Speculation is growing that Orr may raise his buying target at the May policy meeting, which would push the RBNZ’s ownership level even higher than current estimates.
What would come after this is an open question, but it is not so long ago that even quantitative easing seemed unthinkable in New Zealand and Australia.
Australia
The Reserve Bank of Australia has been at pains to emphasize that it is only buying bonds in the secondary market, even as the government rolls out a historic A$130 billion rescue package to save jobs and businesses.
This hasn’t stopped it snapping up A$39.3 billion ($25 billion) of bonds since it embarked on QE last month, or about 7% of outstanding government debt.
None of this dissuades Julio Callegari, lead portfolio manager for local rates and FX in Asia at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management, from buying Australian bonds.
“The fiscal damage of this is quite large across the board, but in places like Australia their starting point is quite good,” Hong Kong-based Callegari said.
Australia’s record A$13 billion bond sale this month gave a clue to the nation’s ongoing appeal among debt investors. Funds tabled A$25.8 billion of bids to the Australian Office of Financial Management for the November 2024 security.
This leaves it in a relatively good position, like its neighbors, but with a delicate balancing act to perform in the months ahead.
“The key challenge for this kind experiment is the risk that people go ‘whoa, it’s too much, it’s too far in terms of debt monetization’. But truth is we’re in a place now where we’re still discussing how deep the recession is going to be” -- Callegari
* Note: Bloomberg’s projected sovereign debt-holdings by each central bank is based on their stated purchase plans, expected issuance and bond redemption over the period to February. For Indonesia, the forecast is based on the assumption that BI would buy a quarter of government bonds sold at auctions, the cap that was mentioned this month by its governor. The analysis excludes bills.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Thousands of plaintiffs who say that Johnson & Johnson's (N:JNJ) baby powder and talc products caused cancer can go forward with their claims, but face limits on what expert testimony will be allowed in trials after a Monday ruling by a New Jersey judge.
J&J faces more than 16,000-talc related lawsuits nationwide, the majority of which are pending before U.S. District Judge Freda Wolfson in New Jersey. The lawsuits allege that the company's talc products have been contaminated with asbestos and can cause ovarian cancer.

J&J said in a statement that Monday's decision ""is not a determination by the court on the validity of the plaintiffs' allegations."" It added that all verdicts against the company in talc lawsuits that had gone through the appeals process have been overturned.
The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company denies that its talc causes cancer, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown its talc to be safe and asbestos-free.
The ruling by Wolfson will allow plaintiffs to present expert testimony that J&J's talc products can cause cancer based on epidemiological studies. They will be allowed to testify that the link could be caused by contamination with asbestos and heavy metals.
Wolfson also ruled that the plaintiffs' experts cannot testify that inhaling talc can travel to the ovaries if inhaled, though they may say that it can reach the ovaries when used vaginally.
In so-called multidistrict litigations like the one before Wolfson, in which thousands of lawsuits are consolidated, a handful of cases are designated for early ""bellwether"" trials, which can help determine the strength of each side's case and aid in settlement. Testimony in such cases typically relies heavily on experts.
Several lawsuits against J&J over talc in state courts around the country have already gone to trial, including one in St. Louis, Missouri, involving 22 plaintiffs that produced a record $4.69 billion talc verdict against J&J in July 2018. The company is appealing the verdict.

In addition to the civil litigation, J&J faces a federal criminal investigation into how forthright it has been about its talc products' safety.

While sales growth across the third-quarter at both operations was largely in-line with what was seen in the first-half, momentum at Kmart had recently moderated while Target's sales faced a significant decline, the conglomerate said.
""Given the high degree of fixed occupancy costs, a sustained decline in sales momentum will have a material impact on the profitability of Kmart and Target,"" Wesfarmers added.

30,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2020 07:00PM ET</span>",Boeing says it will need to borrow more money on coronavirus fallout,"By David Shepardson and Allison Lampert
(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) will need to borrow more money over the next six months and does not expect to pay dividends again for years, as the U.S. planemaker wrestles with industry fallout from the coronavirus and the grounding of its 737 MAX jet, chief executive Dave Calhoun told shareholders on Monday. 
""We know we're going to have to borrow more money in the next six months in order to get through this really difficult moment, to provide the right liquidity to the supply chain that represents our industry,"" Calhoun said during the company's virtual annual general meeting. 
""Our first priority is going to be to pay that back, the principle and the interest that goes with it.""
Boeing would continue ordering parts and services from its suppliers to ensure the smaller companies have enough business to keep them afloat during the downturn, he said.
“We have to keep that flow of money going to the supply chain so that they have some predictability around how they operate.”
Boeing is trying to bring its 737 MAX jet back into service after two fatal crashes, even as the aviation industry slumps because of the coronavirus, which has dried up demand for passenger air travel.
Calhoun said Boeing expects it will take two to three years for travel to return to 2019 levels and an additional few years more for the industry's long-term trend growth to return.
Calhoun warned shareholders he is not confident Boeing will resume paying dividends in the medium-term. 
""That process could take three to five years... It's going to be a while before dividends come back."" 
The largest U.S. planemaker, which reports first-quarter earnings Wednesday, last month drew down its entire $13.8 billion credit line and suspended its dividend. Boeing's first- quarter deliveries were a third of the 149 seen a year earlier and the lowest since 1984 for the first quarter.
Boeing shares closed down 0.3% to $128.68.
NO EMBRAER DEAL
The company also canceled a $4.2 billion deal for Embraer SA's (SA:EMBR3) commercial aviation division over the weekend, prompting the Brazilian company to initiate arbitration.
Earlier in the meeting, Calhoun said the company's negotiation for Embraer's regional jet-making division was no longer helpful.
“We worked diligently for two years to finalize the transaction, but ultimately we could not come to a resolution around critical unsatisfied conditions for the deal,"" he said.
Boeing said it was confident of its legal right to terminate the agreement.
Industry sources have said Boeing was interested in Embraer mainly for access to lower-cost engineers and new manufacturing options, but it is now pondering cutting 10% of its workforce while also seeking U.S. federal help for the aerospace sector.
Boeing in March called for a ""minimum of $60 billion in access to public and private liquidity, including loan guarantees, for the aerospace manufacturing industry.” The company has not said if it will seek government loans or tap a $17 billion fund for national security-related companies.
Boeing also said on Monday it will resume 787 production in South Carolina next week after it resumed commercial airplane production last week in Washington state.
On Monday, shareholders also narrowly approved a measure backing a policy requiring an independent board chairman. Boeing has had a separate chairman and chief executive since October.
Boeing said each of the company’s 12 board nominees received a majority of votes from shareholders, though five directors got a significant number of no votes.
Two proxy advisers, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), had recommended that Boeing shareholders vote against key board members to show objections to the company’s handling of the 737 MAX crisis.

Calhoun did not repeat the company's long-standing timetable of a mid-year return to service approval by regulators for the 737 MAX that has been grounded since March 2019 after two crashes killed 346 people. Reuters reported last week a key certification test flight may not occur until late May or later. ""We remain confident in the MAX,"" Calhoun said.

LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan (N:JPM) is betting on a female banker to take the helm of its investment banking business in France as it seeks to bolster its leadership in one of Europe's hardest-hit markets from the coronavirus pandemic, two sources told Reuters. 
The Wall Street bank has snapped up  Citigroup 's (N:C) co-head of France investment banking, Maja Torun, to take on a similar job at its own franchise, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the matter is confidential.
JPMorgan and Citi declined to comment.
The move comes as big banks and corporate boardrooms in Europe are trying to fill the gender gap and open up more top jobs for women. 
JPMorgan kept a focus on diversity during its latest leadership reshuffling in February when it promoted two female bankers, Dorothee Blessing and Anu Aiyengar, to two power-sharing roles as co-head of EMEA investment banking and co-head of global M&A, respectively. 
In her new Paris-based role Torun will be part of a small circle of female banking leaders in the French capital which also includes  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP)' Sophie Javary, Goldman Sachs's Anne Bizien and Citi's Laurence Parisot. 
Her appointment comes with the challenge of a bleak economic environment, with France bracing for a series of rescue deals, nationalizations and restructurings in the coming months.
The French economy sank 6% in the first quarter of 2020 in its sharpest slowdown since World War Two.
The novel coronavirus has forced the country into a prolonged lockdown, paralyzing business activity and claiming more than 23,000 lives.
Torun, a specialist in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) who joined Citi in 2016 from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), will lead JPMorgan's efforts to win business from cash-strapped companies seeking help to stay afloat and fend off pressure from a growing number of activist investors in France.
She will fill a vacant role that will reunite her with a former Deutsche Bank colleague, Marc Pandraud, who has chaired JPMorgan's investment banking for France and Belgium since 2016.
Torun first met Pandraud at Merrill Lynch where they both worked before the financial crisis forced the bank into a rescue merger with Bank of America (N:BAC).
She then rose through the ranks quickly at Citi, winning the top job as the bank's co-head of France investment banking alongside Emmanuel Regniez in 2019 and leaving her mark after Citi topped up M&A league tables in France last year ahead of Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Torun, who holds an MBA from French business school INSEAD, is also set to join JPMorgan's France Management Committee.

Investing.com - Stocks started the week on a strong note today, shrugging off another dive in oil prices.
Technology earnings will be in the spotlight, with major names reporting after the bell tomorrow.
There will also be data on consumer sentiment and a measure of crude oil inventories at a time when storage has become a major issue.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Alphabet, AMD Set to Report
Technology will be front and center for earnings tomorrow, with Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices issuing numbers after the close of trading.
Analysts expect that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) earned $10.73 per share in the most recent quarter, with sales of about $41 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
BMO Capital Markets upgraded the stock to outperform from market perform at the end of last month, keeping its price target at $1,400.
Mega-cap stocks should fare well when the market rebounds and e-commerce gives the company an advantage, BMO said.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is expected to post a profit of 18 cents per share on revenue of about $1.8 billion.
2. Consumer Confidence Expected to Sink
More insight on the outlook of consumers arrives tomorrow.
The Conference Board will release its measure of consumer confidence at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
The consumer confidence index for April is expected to have dropped to 87.9 from 120 the month before, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
While that would be a sizable drop, the level would still be well above the all-time low in the 30s seen during the Financial Crisis.
3. API Inventories on Tap
Oil prices were back in the red today, sinking more than 20% on concerns about storage capacity for the front-month contract.
Tomorrow will bring more information on how much U.S. inventories are building up.
The American Petroleum Institute will report its measure of crude stockpiles after the market close tomorrow.
Last week the API reported a rise of about 13.2 million barrels in inventories."

38,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2020 04:58PM ET</span>",Europe restarts car factories amid uncertain demand,"By Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German carmaking giant Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) resumed production at its biggest factory on Monday as part of a broader industry drive to get back to work in Europe, where the coronavirus pandemic has hammered demand and pushed up inventory levels.
Encouraged by a fall in infection rates, Germany has eased lockdown rules and automakers are relying on the country's ability to trace and contain new coronavirus cases to safely restore operations in Europe's largest economy.
Volkswagen group, which also owns the Skoda, Audi, Bentley, Porsche and Seat brands, is resuming production at its plant in Wolfsburg, Germany, as well as at factories in Portugal, Spain, Russia, South Africa, and the Czech Republic this week.
Production capacity at Wolfsburg will be just 10%-15% to begin with, and will reach around 40% of pre-crisis levels after about a week, Andreas Tostmann, the VW brand's board member responsible for production, told Reuters.
""The restart of Europe's biggest car factory after weeks of standstill is an important symbol for our employees, our dealers, suppliers, the German economy and for Europe,"" he said.
Volkswagen's plans mirror moves by rivals  Renault  (PA:RENA),  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) to revive an industry crippled by dealership lockdowns and supply bottlenecks caused by restrictions to contain the pandemic. 
Fiat Chrysler has restarted Italian van production at its plant in Atessa and some other operations in the country, including preparatory works for upcoming hybrid and electric vehicles at Melfi and Turin's Mirafiori plants. 
Swedish truck maker AB Volvo (ST:VOLVb), whose brands include Mack and Renault trucks, is also looking to restart output, despite saying last week its net orders had turned negative since the end of March as customers cancelled more trucks than they ordered.
DEALERSHIPS 
With dealerships closed in Germany until last week, it is hard for executives to gauge the level of demand. LMC Automotive analysts see an uneven pattern across the globe. 
""We assume that light vehicle sales will bottom out in April in Europe and North America, but the recovery, while broadly V-shaped, is unlikely to be rapid in the subsequent months,"" they said.
Dealers might re-open next week in Italy.
""The point is not whether we open one week earlier or later. Most dealers have got huge stocks of cars now, we need to destock them before going back to buy from auto makers,"" said Plinio Vanini, chairman of Gruppo Autotorino, an Italian car dealer which sold over 29,000 new cars last year, with 1.2 billion euros in revenues. 
""We've got less ability to absorb new production now, especially given current estimates for a heavy market contraction this year"".
Demand is seen down 20–30% for 2020 overall, with China being the only exception, thanks to its ability to impose social restrictions more forcefully than in the rest of the world. But even in China, sales are seen down 12% this year, LMC said.
Carmakers have overhauled production methods to try to reassure workers about the safety of returning to the production line. 
Volvo cars is offering employees tests to check the oxygen levels in their blood, while  Hyundai Motor  Co's (KS:005380) South Korean workers are required to pass thermal cameras, which measure temperatures.
Even if Europe and Asia see economic activity gradually return, global demand will not rebound until the United States is able to restore confidence in its economy.
The United Auto Workers union cast doubt on plans by U.S. carmakers to resume production in early May, citing concerns about worker safety.
Hyundai ramped up domestic production after South Korea got a grip on the virus outbreak, only to find its cars were sitting in U.S. ports because of the hit to global demand.
In Wolfsburg, around 8,000 workers started building cars again on Monday, including the VW Golf. This week, 1,400 cars will be built, followed by 6,000 cars next week, VW said.
VW workers are being told to measure their temperature and to get changed into their overalls at home, to prevent crowding in factory changing rooms. 
Extra markings have been put on the factory floor so employees are able to keep at least 1.5 metres apart, and extra time is being provided for them to disinfect tools and surfaces. 
Volkswagen resumed producing components in Braunschweig, Kassel, Salzgitter and Hanover in Germany in early April. It restarted car manufacturing in Zwickau, Germany, and Bratislava, Slovakia, on April 20 and in Chemnitz, Germany, on April 23. 
From May 3, it plans to resume production in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in the United States.
Volkswagen is still working to whittle down inventory levels from before the crisis, it said, pinning its hopes on rekindled demand as lockdowns ease in many parts of Europe. 

The carmaker said around 70% of its dealerships in Germany had re-opened as of last week.

Investing.com – The Dow made a strong start to the week on Monday as the reopening of certain parts of the global economy lifted investor sentiment and triggered a rally in financials as U.S. bond yields surged.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.51%, or 359 points, the S&P 500 gained 1.47%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.11%.
Some states lifted lockdown restrictions over the weekend, with several others expected to follow suit over the coming days and weeks amid signs the Covid-19 outbreak, which has killed more than 50,000 nationwide, is flattening.
The move prompted investors to ditch safe havens in hope that the reopening will boost activity, triggering a jump in U.S. bond yields, which underpinned a rally in financials, mostly banking stocks.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) ended up more than 4%.
Energy also caught a bid, shrugging off a more-than-20% plunge in oil prices on rising fears over storage capacity at a time when the coronavirus pandemic continues to hurt demand.
But technology stocks lagged the broader move higher, even as several FAANG names are set to report earnings this week, with Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reporting tomorrow,  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reporting on Wednesday, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday.
Apple ended the day roughly flat after the tech giant said it was delaying a ramp-up of production by about a month amid the Covid-19 hit to consumer demand and supply chain operations.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), meanwhile, closed nearly 5% higher ahead of its quarterly numbers due Thursday after Mizuho upgraded the social media company to neutral from underperform on expectations that most of the coronavirus impact was priced in. 
General Motors (NYSE:GM) was up 2.5% even as the automaker suspended its dividend and share repurchase program in a bid to conserve cash.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, rallied nearly 10% with investors seemingly confident the company is set to deliver a strong quarterly report on Wednesday.

The 8-1 ruling authored by liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor paves the way for a significant one-time cash infusion for major companies such as  Humana Inc  (NYSE:HUM), Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) Inc and  Centene  (NYSE:CNC) Corp. The justices reversed a lower court's ruling that Congress had suspended the government's obligation to make such payments under the Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare.
Unlike other litigation involving Obamacare - long targeted by Republicans for repeal in Congress or invalidation through the courts - this case concerned only payments to insurers and did not directly challenge the law itself.
The Supreme Court in its next term, which starts in October, is set to hear a more politically freighted case concerning a bid by 20 Democratic-led states including California and New York to preserve Obamacare in the face of a challenge by Republican-led states backed by President Donald Trump's administration. [L1N2AV0MJ]
In Monday's ruling, the court sided with insurers that had argued that the lower court ruling would have let the government pull a ""bait-and-switch"" and withhold money the companies were promised. 
""The government should honor its obligations,"" Sotomayor wrote.
Justice Samuel Alito, one of the five conservative justices, was the sole dissenter, saying the court's ruling ""has the effect of providing a massive bailout for insurance companies that took a calculated risk and lost.""
Moda Health Plan Inc and other insurers that sued to try to compel the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make the payments have said the government was supposed to help them recover from early losses they suffered after the law was passed by Congress in 2010 and signed by Trump's Democratic predecessor Barack Obama.
The law has enabled millions of Americans who previously had no medical coverage to obtain insurance, including those with pre-existing medical conditions.
Other insurers involved in the case included Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, Maine Community Health Options and Land of Lincoln Mutual Health Insurance Company.
""We appreciate that today's Supreme Court 8-1 decision ensures that the federal government honors the obligations it made for services the private sector already delivered,"" said Matt Eyles, president of America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry group representing insurers. 
An HHS spokeswoman said officials were ""disappointed in the court's ruling.""
Payments would have come through the law's so-called risk corridor program designed to mitigate insurers' risks from 2014 to 2016, when they sold coverage to previously uninsured people through exchanges established under Obamacare.
Insurers that paid out significantly less in claims on policies sold through the exchanges than they took in from premiums provided some of their gains to the government. Insurers that paid out more were entitled to government compensation for part of their losses.
From 2015 through 2017, Congress passed legislation barring HHS from using general funds to pay the government's risk corridor obligations. Health insurers turned to federal courts to obtain the payments.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in 2018 that Congress effectively repealed its obligation to pay the insurers, prompting the insurers to appeal to the Supreme Court.

In a case directly challenging Obamacare, the Supreme Court in 2012 upheld the bulk of the law. Three years later, it rejected another challenge to it.

Barra's pay package included a salary of $2.1 million, stock awards worth $12.14 million, options worth more than $3.5 million and a performance award worth $2.73 million, according to the proxy. Her salary remained unchanged from 2018, while performance award was 38.7% lower from 2018.
Barra's total compensation package was valued at $21.63 million, below the $21.87 million she received in 2018. Barra, GM's chairman and CEO, was paid $21.96 million in 2017. 
GM said Barra's pay was 203 times that of the median company employee.
The company on Monday suspended its quarterly cash dividend on its common stock and its share buybacks to save cash in the face of the coronavirus crisis that has severely hurt global automobile sales.

GM, which has been forced to shut some production in North America along with other car makers, had also said last month that compensation of board members will be reduced by 20%, while executives will see a cut of 25% to 30%.

Investing.com – With Amazon set to report earnings in coming the days, Wall Street is upping its bets on a good quarter from the e-commerce giant.
But Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was down 1.3% in afternoon trading.
Ahead of its April 30 earnings report, Oppenheimer lifted its price target on Amazon by $300 to $2,700, with analysts estimating that Amazon's 175,000 employee additions represent a $75,000 increase to quarterly net online sales for each new hire.
In a sign that Amazon's e-commerce business is set for a solid quarter,  Target  (NYSE:TGT) reported 100% quarter-to-date digital sales growth, Oppenheimer said.
The upgrade adds to a string of bullish calls seen today, with SunTrust raising its price target on Amazon to $2,770 from $2,450 on hopes that the coronavirus-related jump in demand will boost top-line growth.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) also upped its price target on Amazon to $2,800 From $2,400 and Loop Capital raised its price target on the stock to $2,900 From $2,380.
But not everyone on Wall Street is backing Amazon.
Wall Street firm R5 Capital downgraded its rating on Amazon to sell from buy and cut its price target on the stock to $1,987 from $2,408, on concerns that slowing growth in its money-making businesses and rising costs will keep a lid on future revenue growth and profit.
Wedbush also flagged slowing growth in Amazon's cloud business, AWS, as a potential headwind, but remained bullish on the stock.
Wedbush updated its fiscal 2020 estimates on Amazon to reflect higher net product sales and physical store revenue, but said the top-line growth would be ""offset somewhat by lower expectations for net service sales and AWS growth, along with higher fulfillment costs."""
50,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 27, 2020 03:00PM ET</span>",Stocks -Wall Street Extends Gains as Economic Reopening Lifts Sentiment,"By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com – Wall Street rose on Monday, led by a jump in financials as the economic reopening stoked hopes that a widely-expected recession may be short-lived, prompting investors to up in their bullish bets on stocks.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.55%, or 367 points, the S&P 500 gained 1.53%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.16%.
With some states lifting lockdown restriction over the weekend, investors ditched safe havens in hope that the reopening will boost activity, triggering a jump in U.S. bond yields, which underpinned a rally in financials, mostly banking stocks.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) were up more than 4%.
Higher interest rates are seen as a boon for banks, boosting net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders.
Tech lagged the broader move higher, weighed by Apple after the tech giant said it was delaying a ramp-up of production by about a month, amid the Covid-19 hit to consumer demand and supply chain operations.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was roughly flat.
The labored move higher in broader tech comes as several FAANG names are set to release quarterly earnings later this week, with Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) set to report tomorrow, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reporting on Wednesday, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple on Thursday.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), meanwhile, jumped 4% ahead of its quarterly numbers due Thursday, after Mizuho upgraded the social media company to neutral from underperform on expectations that most of the coronavirus impact was priced in. 
General Motors (NYSE:GM) was up 1.5% even as the automaker suspended its dividend and share repurchase program in a bid to conserve cash.
Energy shrugged off a steep decline in oil prices on rising fears over storage capacity at a time when the coronavirus pandemic continued to hurt demand.
Also helping investor sentiment ahead of the open, the Bank of Japan launched further stimulus, tripling its holdings of corporate debt to 20 trillion yen, and pledging to carry out unlimited bond purchases to keep borrowing costs low and prop up its economy.
The move comes just a day ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting."
51,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 27, 2020 03:00PM ET</span>",Recovery Tracker Dials Up Faster Data to Gauge Depth of Downturn,"(Bloomberg) -- In just a matter of weeks the coronavirus pandemic slammed the brakes on the U.S. economy, leaving a streak of shuttered businesses and millions of jobless Americans in its wake.
A U.S. recession is all but officially underway. The speed at which the economy has ground to a halt has rendered much of the traditional economic data -- typically released with a lag of about a month -- outdated before it’s even published.
To fill the gap, Bloomberg economists Tom Orlik and Eliza Winger created a dashboard of high frequency, alternative and market-based indicators. Right now, the dashboard shows the depths of the downturn. In the weeks ahead -- as states move toward re-opening -- it should capture the strength of the recovery.
Many of the dashboard’s data points signal a deepening contraction. Others have shown slight improvement, flagging early hopes that some parts of the economy may be bottoming out.
The economic downturn was self-induced through government-ordered shutdowns aimed at protecting lives and mitigating the virus. That makes the number of new Covid-19 cases all the more important. While that figure has eased in consecutive weeks, it remains extremely elevated, and limited testing means the count almost certainly understates the true spread of the disease.

52,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>",DoubleLine's Gundlach sees U.S. stocks testing recent lows -CNBC interview,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. stock market has recovered because of the Federal Reserve's actions but a retest of the recent lows is possible, Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, said in a CNBC interview on Monday.
""I think we take out the low,"" the bond investor said. DoubleLine had about $148 billion in assets as of Dec. 31.
After their sharp bounce from recent lows, markets are looking quite tired and ""the sentiment shifts should have investors concerned,"" Gundlach said.
Gundlach said he has put on a bearish bet against the S&P 500 at the 2,863 level. On Monday, the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 1.38% at 2,875.93. The index is up 31% since touching a low of 2,191.86 on March 23.
While markets were cheering improved testing for the coronavirus and the reopening of the economy is a positive, ""many people don't understand the wide-ranging ramification of this societal shift that's going on,"" Gundlach said. ""I am certainly in the camp that we are not out of the woods."" 
The crash in U.S. crude prices in recent weeks has given fresh urgency to bearish voices, who say it sounds alarm bells for global growth and are bracing for a catastrophic collapse in asset prices.
""The market's pretty much recovered obviously because of the Fed,"" Gundlach said.
In recent months, the Fed has slashed rates to near zero, restarted bond purchases and rolled out an unprecedented range of programs to keep credit flowing and shore up business and household confidence, as the central bank tried to offset the economic hit from the coronavirus outbreak.
The Fed's actions may have led to over-valued assets, Gundlach warned. 
He singled out the iShares iBoxx Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (P:LQD), in particular, saying the ETF ""looks to be the most over-valued asset in the bond market.""

LQD is up about 23% since hitting a low on March 19, boosted by the Fed's move to buy corporate bonds through exchange-traded funds. On Monday the ETF was down 0.5%.

The investigation was linked to accusations brought by Austria's defence ministry in 2017, and its closure does not affect a broader criminal investigation of suspected bribery in the same deal that has been going on since 2011, a court spokeswoman said. 
The ministry triggered a new probe into Airbus and the Eurofighter consortium - which also includes Britain's BAE Systems (L:BAES) and Italy's Leonardo (MI:LDOF) - in February 2017, alleging that they had misled the state about the price, deliverability and equipment of the planes.
Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug GmbH, headquartered in Munich, coordinates the production of the aircraft.
Among other things, the ministry accused Airbus and the consortium of illegally charging nearly 10% of the purchase price for so-called offset deals, which involve work being given to local companies.
Airbus and the consortium had denied the accusations.
The court dismissed the ministry's accusations, the spokeswoman said. 
""The fraud investigation based on the defence ministry's statement of facts has been ended following requests by Airbus, Eurofighter and a former Airbus managing director,"" she said. 
The Austrian government's chief lawyer, Wolfgang Peschorn, said Austria would appeal. Airbus declined to comment.

Airbus has given its starkest assessment yet of damage from the crisis, telling the company's 135,000 employees to brace for potentially deeper job cuts as it grapples with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aerospace sector.
Earlier this month, the group said it would furlough some 3,000 French workers by tapping a government-backed scheme for four weeks.
""Airbus confirms it has agreed with its social partners to apply the government's Job Retention Scheme for approximately 3,200 production and production-support employees at its commercial aircraft site in Broughton,"" it said in a statement.
Britain's job retention scheme allows employers to furlough staff and claim cash grants up to 80% of wages, capped at 2,500 pounds per worker.
Airbus will top up gross salaries to bring pay up to 85-90% of pay, in accordance with an agreement signed with trade union representatives.
The deal affects the majority of the production and production support teams in Broughton, the north Wales factory which assembles wings. 
Furlough periods will be staggered, with all starting in the next three weeks and lasting for at least three weeks.
The move does not affect Airbus' 3,000 staff in Filton, western England, where wings are designed and supported.

Italy has said it would allow factories and building sites to reopen from May 4 as it prepares a staged end to Europe's longest coronavirus lockdown. However, some businesses deemed ""strategic"" and exporting companies were allowed to resume activity sooner to reduce the risk of being cut out of the production chain and losing business.
At the Atessa plant, all workers had their temperature tested at the entrance on Monday. 
Atessa, which is operated by Sevel, a 50-50 joint venture between Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and France's PSA (PA:PEUP), employs over 6,000 people with a pre-virus daily production of 1,200 units, making it Europe's largest van assembly plant.
FCA said production layouts and offices have been rearranged to allow for a greater distance between workers to comply with health and safety rules the automaker had agreed with unions. Most of the plant's employees were back at work on Monday, it said.
Among other measures, FCA has provided workers with personal safety kits, which included face masks, gloves and protective glasses, it said.
""We have been working daily with the Italian government and local authorities to prepare for a return to production in Italy, while ensuring there is no compromise to the safety of anyone working at any of our production facilities or offices,"" said FCA's chief operating officer for the EMEA region, Pietro Gorlier.
Some other European carmakers also restarted factories on Monday.
FCA halted its Italian operations in mid-March in response to Rome's lockdown rules, but also to falling demand.
Small sections of four other FCA plants in Italy restarted operations on Monday to supply parts to Atessa, the company added. 
FCA informed unions last week of its plans to restart in Atessa and other Italian sites.
The carmaker also on Monday resumed preparatory works at its Melfi plant in southern Italy for the final development of Jeep's new hybrid car, with an average of 750 workers a day expected this week, and at Turin's Mirafiori plant for its new electric 500 small car, with around 250 workers a day expected.

UNRAE, which represents foreign automakers in Italy, said on Monday it expected car registrations to plunge by up to 98% this month.

68,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2020 12:00PM ET</span>",Falcon Private bank could lose Swiss licence in wake of 1MDB case: sources,"By Oliver Hirt
ZURICH (Reuters) - Falcon Private Bank, a wealth manager that was at the centre of Malaysia's 1MDB scandal, could lose its Swiss banking licence by the end of the week, two sources close to the situation told Reuters. Swiss financial markets watchdog FINMA could withdraw the licence for the private bank owned by Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala Investment Company [MUDEV.UL] on the grounds that it has continuously failed to meet regulatory requirements, the sources said. ""Falcon employees are preparing to wind down the institute,"" one of the people said. A social plan for employees losing their jobs was also in the works.
Falcon, FINMA and Mubadala all declined to comment. 
Falcon gained global notoriety in 2015 after it was reported that investigators found nearly $700 million had been transferred from an account at the bank’s Singapore outpost to accounts in Malaysia linked to then Prime Minister Najib Razak.
Najib, now on trial for corruption in Malaysia, denies all charges against him. FINMA found in 2016 that Falcon had violated money-laundering regulations by failing to carry out adequate background checks into transactions and business relationships associated with state fund 1MDB which were booked in Switzerland, Singapore and Hong Kong.
The watchdog told Falcon it would lose its licence if there was any repetition of the offence. Swiss federal prosecutors also opened a criminal investigation, which is ongoing.
Mubadala has since looked but failed to find any buyers for the business. A takeover of the entire bank has become unrealistic, but Falcon is continuing to try to sell parts of its customer base, three people said. 
The bank, with headquarters in Zurich and other locations in Dubai and Luxembourg, is in talks with at least one interested party for such an asset deal whose outcome is uncertain.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) manager Walter Berchtold, who took over as Falcon boss in 2016, tried to build up business trading the cryptocurrency Bitcoin , but quarrelled with its then-owner International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC), which has since merged into Mubadala. 
He was succeeded in 2017 by Martin Keller, also a former Credit Suisse manager. With the help of the strategy consultant Boston Consulting Group, Keller tried again to rivitalise the bank's business, but also fought strong headwinds.
As key employees and customers left the bank, Falcon bled billions of assets under management, which now likely stand in the low- to mid-single digit billions of Swiss francs. The outflows also caused a drop in earnings.
In 2019 it became apparent that implementing the new strategy was no longer realistic, two of the insiders said. ""FINMA has given the bank three years to realign the business,"" one of the sources said. ""Apparently, it wasn't happy with what was achieved."" FINMA in October gave Falcon until the end of April, a deadline about to expire, one source said.

A separate probe by Singapore authorities over Falcon's involvement in the 1MDB scandal resulted in the wealth manager's being stripped of its local banking licence.

69,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2020 11:50AM ET</span>",Poland's LOT in talks to convert Boeing Dreamliners for freight,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish airline LOT is in talks with Boeing (N:BA) to modify its 787 Dreamliner jets into temporary cargo carriers, a LOT spokesman told Reuters, in a move that could help to narrow losses from the coronavirus crisis.
With passenger air travel virtually halted, airlines such as LOT are searching for alternative ways to generate revenue until demand picks up again.
""We are in talks with the aircraft manufacturer about ... adapting the passenger aircraft (Dreamliner) to cargo transport,"" Michal Czernicki told Reuters. 
""If we get approval and meet all safety requirements, we will become the first airline in the world that will adapt the Dreamliner for such transport.""
Boeing had no immediate comment.
Several airlines have redeployed passenger jets for cargo by removing some seats and filling passenger cabins with boxed freight. 
The move fills a gap left by the grounding of many of the world's passenger planes, whch usually carry about half of the world's air freight, with the rest in purpose-built freighters.
LOT, central Europe's biggest state-controlled airline, has spent the past month mainly bringing home Poles stranded abroad after Poland suspended inbound flights from March 15.
The airline transported some 54,000 people aboard these flights between March 15 and April 5, compared with abount 10 million passengers flown by LOT in 2019.
LOT is working on a rescue plan and is likely to need state aid, given that air traffic has been suspended, Minister of State Assets Jacek Sasin said this month.
The company, which operates 15 Dreamliners, is currently using some of the space in the jets to transport face masks, helmets and other medical supplies needed in Poland to help to contain the coronavirus outbreak.

Czernicki declined to comment on possible timing, what kind of cargo it would seek to transport or how long it would use the Dreamliners for such trips, emphasising that no final decisions have been taken and that such a move would depend on the demand for passenger and cargo services.

“To think that the economy is going to reaccelerate in the third quarter in a V-shaped recovery to the level where gross domestic product (GDP) was prior to the pandemic is unrealistic,” he wrote in a note published on April 26.
While governments are doing all they can to aid both businesses and individuals impacted by the virus shutdowns, Minerd said the help will likely be “insufficient, misdirected, and full of unintended consequences.” Many of the 26 million people who have applied for unemployment benefits over the past five weeks won’t be going back to work immediately even if the economy fully reopens, he added.
The unemployment rate could rise to as high as 30% and could still be in double digits by the end of the year, Minerd wrote. Consumer confidence, meanwhile, is set to take a massive hit as half of all Americans were unprepared to weather the storm, with less than $500 in savings.
“Few people will immediately go out and buy automobiles and return to movie theaters,” he said. “The damage to the household sector is so severe that it is going to impair living standards for most of the decade.”

71,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 27, 2020 11:36AM ET</span>",Oil ETF Wreaks Havoc on Crude Market in Wake of Sub-Zero Prices,"(Bloomberg) -- The United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO) LP again roiled oil markets as it unexpectedly starting selling all of its holdings of the most active West Texas Intermediate futures contract, triggering a massive swing in the price relationship between the June and July contracts.
The changes, detailed in a regulatory filing, are the latest in a series that have have wreaked havoc on crude prices. The fund said it’s moving its money to contracts spread between July 2020 and June 2021 due to new limits imposed upon it by regulators and its broker.
As the U.S. Oil Fund sold its June position, the contract plunged more than 25%, significantly widening the June-July spread, which has become a target for speculators. The fund appears to have come under heavy pressure from its broker, which it didn’t name, disclosing that in the future it will hold “significant portions of its portfolio in cash beyond what it has historically held in order to satisfy potential margin requirements.”
The ETF has changed its investment policy five times in the last two weeks. It also warned investors its valuation may deviate significantly from the underlying oil price, in effect acknowledging that it’s momentarily less focused on the price of WTI crude.
“While it is USO’s expectation that at some point in the future it will be able to return to primarily investing in the Benchmark Futures Contract or other similar futures contracts of the same tenor based on light, sweet crude oil, there can be no guarantee of when, if ever, that will occur,” it said in the filing, adding that USO investors “should expect that there will be continued deviations between the performance of USO’s investments and the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, and that USO may not be able to track the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract or meet its investment objective.”
Easy  Target  (NYSE:TGT)
The $3.6 billion exchange-traded fund, run by United States Commodity Funds LLC, will move its June position from Monday through April 30, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, each day roughly selling and buying one-third of its position. It also announced that it will move its contracts forward over a 10-day period beginning May 1, but didn’t disclose which will be affected. Previously, the fund typically rolled the contracts over four days.
In response to risk mitigation measures taken by its futures broker, the fund will invest approximately 30% of its portfolio in July contracts, 15% in August, 15% in September, 15% in October, 15% in December and 10% in June 2021.
The fund listed factors including “a change in regulator accountability levels and position limits” as part of its reasons for the shift. As a result it will now struggle to meet its own investment objectives, it said.
The discount between June WTI and the contract for December deepened sharply after the filing, reaching as low as $15.17 a barrel.
The long-only oil fund has in recent weeks become a magnet for retail investors looking for a bottom to the historic price rout that’s pushed oil futures in New York into negative territory for the first time in history. The knock-on effects have impacted retail investors everywhere. While USO was not holding the May contract when it plunged below zero, traders pointed to retail money as having caused large gyrations in the market.
But USO has quickly become a rich target for speculators that are able to take advantage of the moves by trading ahead of it, thanks to its detailed regulatory disclosures. By offering a detailed calendar and the exact contracts that’s selling and buying, it allows others to place financial bets ahead, profiting from time-spreads movements.
On Friday, the fund disclosed for the first time that it was ordered by CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) to make changes to its position.

73,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2020 11:25AM ET</span>",U.S. health insurers benefit as elective care cuts offset coronavirus costs,"By Manojna Maddipatla and Caroline Humer
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Americans delay elective surgeries and avoid doctors and hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic, healthcare spending declines have more than offset the added costs of COVID-19 care, insurance executives and experts say, boosting U.S. health insurer profits.
Those gains, however, could be short term, depending on how quickly the coronavirus outbreak subsides and healthcare business begins to return to something close to normal.
UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH), the largest U.S. health insurer, last week posted first-quarter earnings above Wall Street expectations and kept its profit forecast in place for 2020, despite an economy battered by massive layoffs and business shutdowns to slow the spread of the virus.
When Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) Inc,  Humana Inc  (NYSE:HUM) and  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) report their first-quarter results this week, Wall Street analysts expect a similar trend. CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), a pharmacy company that owns health insurer Aetna (NYSE:AET), reports in May.
""The costs from COVID-19 are going to be actually very small and more than outweighed by the deferral of elective procedures. The net impact is going to be positive for them,"" said Jeff Jonas, portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds. 
The new coronavirus has infected more than 875,000 in the United States and killed more than 50,000, according to Reuters tally. As of the middle of last week, about 150,000 people had been hospitalized, almost half of which were in New York, and more than 45,000 required intensive care, Evercore ISI analyst Michael Newshel said.
While extended hospital stays, particularly in intensive care units, can rack up massive bills for individuals, that pales compared to the savings from millions of Americans delaying care. Those savings also outpace the costs to insurers of waiving COVID-19 related co-pays, deductibles, tests and other care, which most insurers have agreed to waive.
Most of the country has been under stay-at-home orders, and many non-emergency care visits and elective procedures have been canceled to help hospitals manage the surge of coronavirus patients. 
The largest U.S. for-profit hospital operator, HCA (NYSE:HCA) Healthcare Inc, said it has seen a 70% drop in outpatient surgeries so far in April compared with a year ago, while inpatient admissions declined 30%. 
Federal authorities have said hospitals could resume more routine care as appropriate, as states begin to ease some social-distancing measures.
It is unclear how quickly that will happen. Much depends on how well contained the coronavirus outbreak is in a specific city or state. Hospitals will also need increased access to coronavirus testing and take additional precautions to help prevent transmission between staff and patients. 
In addition, as more than 26 million Americans have lost their jobs, some will also lose their health insurance or move to government insurance programs such as Medicaid or Obamacare plans, created by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). 
Some expect a gradual return of patients for conditions other than COVID-19 and treatments delayed by the public health emergency. UnitedHealth warned last week that medical costs would likely increase in the second half of the year.
UTILIZATION DROP
Health plans and employers who provide insurance have seen an overall decline in healthcare use of about 30% to 40% excluding COVID-19 patients, according to Tim Nimmer, the global chief actuary at Aon (NYSE:AON), a benefits company that advises large corporations and health plans.
""For each month that this goes on, we are expecting about 1.5% to 2% in annual costs to be reduced,"" Nimmer said. ""The number one issue is how long will this go on.""
Right now, that drop is outweighing the costs of patients with COVID-19, Nimmer said. Companies with younger, healthy employees are experiencing even less spending. 
Based on claims information it has reviewed, Aon said the cost of a hospitalized patient runs from $30,000 to $80,000 while a patient who goes to the hospital and is sent home runs up claims of around $1,500 to $2,500.
Some healthcare appointments that are canceled because of the pandemic will not return because people will decide not to have surgery, or will not need a sick visit, Nimmer said.
Health insurers could largely benefit this year from a more gradual resumption of discretionary and elective care, analysts agreed.
""It is unlikely that we will see healthcare volumes fully rebound or even close to fully rebound in the back half of the year relative to pre-crisis levels,"" said Stephens analyst Scott Fidel. That should continue to help UnitedHealth and other insurers possibly into the fourth quarter, he said.
RECESSION TO INCREASE MEDICAID RANKS
The gains, however, are likely short term. A wider economic collapse may push Americans into health plans that can be less profitable for insurers.
Florida Blue, part of the Blue Cross Blue Shield network, said it has seen a toll on people employed by small businesses hit hard by mandatory closures that prompted worker furloughs and layoffs. That has led people to move into its ACA government subsidized health plans in Florida.
""There's probably twice as much enrollment as we would have anticipated in the ACA,"" said Chief Executive Pat Geraghty, largely because they have lost coverage elsewhere.

A recession-related shift to less profitable Medicaid plans will have a longer lasting impact on health insurers like Blue Cross Blue Shield insurer Anthem than the temporary gains due to patients delaying non-emergency care, Jefferies analyst David Windley said in a client note last week. 
 Centene  (NYSE:CNC) Corp and Molina Healthcare Inc, which focus on Medicaid, are best positioned for a declining economy as people make the switch, he said. Gabelli's Jonas favors Centene in particular.
""They are probably going to gain a lot of membership in a recession given all the layoffs and job losses,"" he said.

74,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>",Italy wants to reopen. Businesses ask: where's the money?,"By Valentina Za, Stefano Bernabei and Andrea Mandala
AMELIA, Italy (Reuters) - When the COVID-19 pandemic forced Roberto Ferraro to shut the patisserie he runs in Amelia, a scenic hilltop town in central Italy, he had just rented out a new site to increase production of ice cream and start selling it abroad.
Ferraro would like to be preparing his business to reopen in the weeks to come, working out how to secure supplies and ensure social distancing among customers. Instead, the 51-year-old is devoting his time and energy to wading through the pile of documents he must file with banks to tap state-guaranteed loans. 
His struggles are just one example of how red tape is holding up the state aid needed to keep companies afloat in the euro zone's third-largest economy and a country that has suffered Europe's deadliest coronavirus outbreak.
""When can I get the money? The banks don't know. It depends - days, weeks, they don't know,"" Ferraro said. ""In March we paid electricity bills and wages even though the government had closed us down and, unlike supermarkets, we couldn't sell Easter cakes.""
Rome's problems getting money to businesses are reflected, to a greater or lesser degree, in other countries under coronavirus restrictions around the world, from the United Kingdom to the United States.
Italy, the first Western nation to shut down, is now in the vanguard of moves to cautiously reopen its economy. From May 4, shops like Ferraro's can provide takeaways, and they will fully restart from June 1. 
But the aid deployment figures so far are worrying for business leaders and politicians alike.
The government says debt guarantees made available by the state can unlock up to 740 billion euros ($803 billion) in funding for businesses which have been crippled by a seven-week lockdown.
So far just 3.1 billion euros in funds have been released, the Treasury said at the weekend. Of that, only 115 million euros are in the form of loans worth up to 25,000 euros fully secured by the state, which do not require banks to perform credit analyses on borrowers.
The financial stakes are higher for Italy than many others in Europe because its economy was faltering even before COVID-19, and the pandemic hit hardest in the northern industrial heartlands that generate a third of its output. 
If loan lifelines arrive too late for the 2.1 million firms which have been unable to operate, Rome will likely fail to prevent a raft of bankruptcies despite aid spending which is set to push public debt to 156% of GDP this year, economists say.
""One of the most controversial aspects of the measures is the impression the government gave that the money was just sitting there and all people had to do was turn up at their bank,"" said Salvo Politino, deputy president of business lobby Unimpresa.
The Italian Treasury declined to comment. 
Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri has rebuffed criticism over the liquidity measures, saying they are immediately effective and provide ""impressive firepower"".
RUM-SOAKED BABA
Before the pandemic, the popularity of Ferraro's rum-soaked ""baba"" cake whose secrets he had learnt in his native Naples, had allowed his business to expand without any bank debt in the five years since he opened. 
He is now applying for two different types of state- guaranteed loans, including a fully-guaranteed one. 
The rollout for such loans started last week, triggering a flood of complaints about bureaucracy and prompting banking lobby ABI to tell lenders to stop demanding unnecessary documents and to not ask borrowers to repay existing debts with the new loans.
That represents a big cultural shift for an industry that has spent most of the past decade sweeping balance sheets clean of unpaid loans after coming under fire from supervisors for lending too freely.
Ferraro, who declined to say how much he was seeking, said both banks he applied to had asked for his earnings statements for 2019 and 2018, which are not required under the government's decree. 
His experience echoes those of other businesses struggling to survive as Italy's economy sinks into its fourth recession in a decade, with an expected 8% contraction this year.
Mara Bartolini, 42, the owner of a gift store in Cremona, in the northern Lombardy region which has borne the brunt of the outbreak, said her bank had told her it may take two to four weeks to get the fully-guaranteed loan.
At the other end of Italy's boot, Michele Mandala has also been told to wait a month for the money he needs because he does not expect to be able to reopen his cinema theatre in the Sicilian town of Caltanissetta until after the summer.
'DIE OF THIRST'
Bank officials say they simply cannot cope with the workload after being hit by debt moratorium requests, which the Bank of Italy says amount so far to 1.3 million for more than 140 billion euros in loans.
The government fund that provides some of the guarantees on loans has advised banks to upload requests in bulk at nighttime, when online traffic slows.
Banks must assess creditworthiness, as they bear part of the risk, yet the COVID-19 crisis makes it hard to gauge the ability of borrowers to repay their debt.
Lenders say they face legal risk under Italian law because they can be held liable for credit abuse or aiding bankruptcy if a debtor defaults.
""The problem is that only drops are coming out of the government's liquidity tap,"" said Roberto Sambuco, a partner at leading financial advisory firm Vitale&Co.
Besides the 100% guarantee on the smaller loans, Italy provides a 90% guarantee on up to 800,000 euros, which can rise to 100% with co-insurance schemes. It guarantees between 70% and 90% of larger loans, depending on the size of the company.
Sambuco said the government had to modify the package to make the process more direct, like it is in France, the United States or in Switzerland where loans of up to 500,000 Swiss francs ($514,000) are fully guaranteed. 
""The risk that tens of thousands of firms may just die of thirst is significant. The situation is much more serious than measures put in place by the government can remedy.""
The ABI is, meanwhile, calling for a legal shield from prosecution at least for loans worth up to 100,000 euros.
HOW TO REPAY?
In a study by three of its economists, the Bank of Italy said direct state transfers, without an obligation for companies to pay them back, would be necessary.
The U.S. government is offering loans that can be forgiven if most of the money is used for payroll costs. Italy has also said it plans to introduce them but its public finances, already stretched to the limit, leave little room for manoeuvre. 
Sambuco said Rome would need help from the European Union and not just from the European Central Bank. ""Without the EU umbrella we don't have the necessary resources,"" he said. 
EU leaders agreed on Thursday to build a trillion-euro emergency fund to help the bloc recover from the pandemic but postponed any decision on divisive details until the summer.
Their jockeying is a world away from Ferraro in Amelia who, like many other businesses, faces having to take on loans with little idea of how the economy will fare.

""I'm venturing abroad, but those who are betting on Italy getting back on its feet, how are they going to repay all this debt two years from now if that recovery is nowhere to be seen?""

75,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>",Embraer takes Boeing to arbitration over failed deal as shares plummet,"By Marcelo Rochabrun
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) on Monday said it had begun an arbitration process against  Boeing Co  (N:BA), after the U.S. planemaker abruptly canceled a $4.2 billion deal over the weekend that was years in the making. 
Embraer shares fell as much as 16% in Sao Paulo to a more than 8-year low on news of the cancellation, suggesting investors had hoped until the last minute that the takeover agreement would not fall apart. 
The sudden collapse, triggered by a deadline that Boeing refused to extend, drew an irate response from Embraer on Saturday. 
But on Monday, when Embraer executives hosted a call with analysts, the angry rhetoric was largely absent. Embraer is in a delicate situation, having bet the future of the company on Boeing only to find itself now in isolation and without a Plan B, all while the coronavirus crisis ravages the travel industry.
Still, Embraer tried to reassure investors that it remains a solid company, although its CEO Francisco Gomes Neto acknowledged that 2020 will be a ""tough"" year and that 2021 ""will be worse than we had thought.""
He added that Embraer has been able to find $1 billion in cash savings for 2020, and that it has not suffered any aircraft order cancellations due to the coronavirus crisis. 
Gomes Neto declined to provide more details on the arbitration process and if it will be accompanied by a lawsuit in either a Brazilian or a U.S. court.
Embraer had hoped to sell 80% of its profitable commercial aviation unit to Boeing and benefit from the U.S. planemaker's marketing power to scale up sales of its E2 regional jets, which have been lauded for their fuel efficiency even as sales have lagged. It would then use Boeing's cash to wipe out all of its previous debt and pay a $1.6 billion dividend to shareholders. 
Boeing, meanwhile, was aiming to compete more directly with Airbus (PA:AIR) in the regional jets segment.

A former state-owned company, Embraer has a close relationship with the Brazilian government, which holds veto power over strategic decisions, while the company remains a top provider of military technology. 
""Maybe we'll begin new negotiations with a new company,"" Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro told reporters on Monday. Bolsonaro, a former army captain, had supported and approved of the Boeing deal even as others in the military remained suspicious that Boeing's involvement could affect Brazilian interests. 
Gomes Neto did not rule out a potential new sale to a different company, but declined to comment further. He joined Embraer only a year ago and was not a part of the executive team that drew up the deal with Boeing. 
Analysts have speculated that Chinese companies might be interested in buying Embraer's commercial aviation unit. But Bolsonaro and his inner circle have repeatedly attacked China over the coronavirus crisis, blaming it for the spread of the disease and creating a very public diplomatic spat. 
On Monday, UBS also suggested China may be interested in buying up Embraer's commercial planes. 
""We believe China still aspires to a global aerospace leadership position and, in our view, (Embraer) would bring both the talent for design and development,"" it said in a client note.

Berkshire said on Monday that Buffett, 89, and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 57, will be physically present to answer shareholder questions at the afternoon meeting, but other directors including Munger and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will be absent.
The meeting is normally part of a weekend of festive events that draws more than 40,000 people to Omaha, Nebraska, where Berkshire is based, but the coronavirus pandemic forced Berkshire to scrap those events and keep shareholders away.
Many Berkshire directors live far from Omaha, including Munger, 96, and Jain, 68.
Abel oversees Berkshire's non-insurance operating businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Dairy Queen ice cream, while Jain oversees insurance businesses such as the Geico auto insurer.
In past years, Munger has joined Buffett on the stage of a downtown Omaha arena to answer five hours of shareholder questions. Abel and Jain also fielded some questions last year.
Buffett and Abel will not be given this year's questions in advance, a policy Berkshire has long maintained.
They may be asked about how the pandemic has affected Berkshire, markets, the economy and Buffett's long-term outlook, and how and when Berkshire plans to spend its cash hoard, which totaled $128 billion as of Dec. 31.
Berkshire is also scheduled on Saturday morning to release first-quarter results.
While many operating businesses should be profitable, Berkshire will likely post a huge net loss because of unrealized losses on stock investments such as Bank of America (N:BAC) and the four largest U.S. airlines.
Buffett has long said quarterly investment gains and losses are usually meaningless, and investors should focus on Berkshire's operating results.
Munger told The Wall Street Journal this month that the pandemic will cause Berkshire to close a few small businesses.

The annual meeting will be streamed live on Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Finance.

Trump is scheduled to meet with ""industry representatives"" at 2 p.m.(1800 GMT), according to a schedule released by the White House.
A severe lack of U.S. medical supplies has hampered healthcare workers on the front lines treating coronavirus patients, leaving hospitals and states scrambling for protective gear.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also urged Americans to wear masks to help prevent the spread of the disease, but it has encouraged using homemade and other varieties to keep medical-grade ones available for first responders and healthcare workers.
Navarro also said the administration is focusing on protocols to keep U.S. factories in general open during the outbreak, including screening workers for potential cases.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Monday, as negative news surrounding Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) tempered hopes fanned by the partial easing of lockdown measures in New York and Europe.
By 10:10 AM ET (1410 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 173 points or 0.7% at 23,948 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.2%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock lagged the market, rising only 0.1%, after it was reported by the Wall Street Journal to be planning a delay of around one month in bringing this year's flagship iPhone models to market. The WSJ said supply chain disruption and the likelihood of subdued customer demand in the near term were responsible.
Elsewhere, General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock fell 0.7% after the company suspended its buyback program and quarterly dividend in an effort to preserve liquidity. GM, which like other carmakers is suffering from a steep decline in sales with many dealerships across the country closed, also said it had extended a $3.6 billion revolving credit facility.
Rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was up 8.1% at a two-month high after Bloomberg reported that it wants to restart its Fremont factory as early as this week. The facility has been shut for the last few weeks due to California's lockdown measures, and its failure to convince the authorities that it is an ""essential"" operation.
Global stocks were also supported by the Bank of Japan's announcement earlier in the day that it would increase its stimulus efforts, while there is also speculation that the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank will both announce fresh support measures at their policy meetings later in the week.
Conditions in the oil market continued to be a drag on stocks in general, however. as the front-month U.S. crude futures contract was crushed by more repositioning from the U.S. Oil ETF (NYSE:USO). The June contract for West Texas Intermediate fell by 25% to $12.63 a barrel, while the global benchmark Brent fell 7.5% to $22.96 a barrel. 
The crude price dragged down Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock by 6.0%, while Hess  (NYSE:HES) stock fell 2.5%. The two were the biggest customers of  Diamond Offshore  Drilling (NYSE:DO), which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at the weekend. 
Elsewhere, Boeing  (NYSE:BA) stock was down 1.7% after the plane-maker walked away from a $4.2 billion deal to buy the regional jet business of Brazil's Embraer. The Brazilian company has filed suit in an arbitration tribunal.

The blue-chip firms that are furloughing workers had a combined profit of 42 billion pounds ($52 billion) from 2014 to 2019, according to think tank the High Pay Centre, and have paid out 321 million pounds to their chief executives as well as 26 billion pounds in dividends.
Britain's Conservative government previously put a price tag of 42 billion on the pay scheme, which funds 80% of workers' wages, up to £2,500 a month, if they are put on leave, but has since extended the scheme for another month.
Hundreds of thousands of businesses are struggling to survive the widespread shutdowns caused by the outbreak, with some 140,000 British firms having applied for help with their wage bill under the government scheme.
""The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is a vital progressive measure to protect people's jobs and incomes at this critical time, but it's important to understand that it is a subsidy for businesses, as well as for workers,"" said Luke Hildyard, Director of the High Pay Centre.
The report follows questions in the United States about large companies who have the funds to ride out the crisis using government aid for their own financial interests and preventing it reaching small businesses that are in greater trouble.
At least 18% of FTSE 100 companies and 23% of mid-cap companies on the FTSE 250 index (FTMC) are benefiting from the scheme, according to the High Pay Centre research.
Corporate observers and consultants also expect investors to use the crisis to push down executive pay at listed firms and impose green and other new types of criteria on bonuses.
The study said the average pay for a FTSE-100 CEO was 3.6 million pounds in the last five years, which is enough to cover over 200 households' annual universal credit claims.
Some 37% of FTSE 100 companies have reduced executive pay, while 33% have withdrawn or withheld dividend payments. However only 13% have made cuts to executive bonuses.
British government budget forecasters this month said unemployment could rise as high as 10% with an extra 2 million people losing their jobs if a three-month lockdown was only slowly lifted over the next three months.

91,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2020 07:55AM ET</span>","GE's coronavirus troubles likely to hit power business, not just aviation","By Alwyn Scott and Rachit Vats
(Reuters) - Quarantines and lockdowns at large U.S. power plants are threatening to squeeze a multibillion-dollar slice of revenue that  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co is counting on to help lift profits.
Several major U.S. utilities with fleets of GE generators told Reuters they are halting or deferring maintenance, much of it handled by GE, because the work is not possible under social distancing restrictions. The work can be safely put off in part because coronavirus lockdowns have cut power demand, the utilities say.
Revenue from fixing power plants is increasingly important for GE now that the Boston-based conglomerate has slimmed down to aviation, power equipment and medical devices. Wall Street's concerns have focused on the aviation business, but when GE reports its first-quarter results on Wednesday, it may have to explain challenges to power as well.
""We have deferred routine maintenance activities to the limit possible at these facilities but are still performing the work needed to maintain reliability,"" Jim Hopson, a spokesman for the Tennessee Valley Authority, which operates across seven states, told Reuters. It operates a fleet of more than a dozen large GE-made natural gas turbines.
TVA is among five large U.S. utilities with more than 130 GE turbines interviewed by Reuters. All said they are putting off some maintenance work while performing critical jobs necessary for operation, compliance and safety.
GE declined to comment, citing a quiet period. The head of its gas power business said on April 3 that crews were working on projects with more than 60 customers worldwide. 
GE reported $3.6 billion in power-services revenue last quarter, second only to $5.4 billion in services revenue at its aviation unit. Maintenance of such equipment is typically provided under long-term contracts. Some bill by hours of plant or engine use. For others, accounting rules require work to be performed before GE can record revenue, industry experts said.
GE's once-high-flying aviation unit has been hit by the drop in air travel, adding to the toll from hundreds of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's grounded 737 MAX jetliners. A GE joint venture makes MAX engines.
""GE's financial performance will be severely impacted in 2020, as long-term service agreements have been a large source of revenue in GE's aviation and power divisions,"" said Kathy Hipple, a financial analyst at Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.
Sales of new power equipment also are at risk. ""Utilities are likely to be watching power demand carefully, and may postpone capital investments until they get greater visibility on demand for power,"" Hipple said.
Other issues are adding to GE's headwinds. Low interest rates have raised pension costs and liabilities for long-term-care insurance policies, which will hit GE at year-end. Falling oil prices have wiped out $1.4 billion in value from GE's stake in Baker Hughes Co since early March, money that would help GE pay down debt.
GE last month cut its profit forecast and warned cash outflows could hit $2 billion in the first quarter. 
Wall Street analysts expect GE to post 8 cents a share in profit for the first quarter, and have cut price targets for GE stock by nearly one-third since early March, to an average of $9.46, according to data from Refinitiv. 
GE's stock closed at $6.26 on Friday.
UP IN THE AIR
Maintenance deferrals do not pose immediate risk to electricity supplies, utilities and industry experts say. Lower demand cuts strain on equipment. New York City power demand is down by 21%, on average, the New York Independent System Operator said. California's demand fell as much as 7% during peaks since stay-at-home orders took effect last month. 
Dominion Energy Inc, which has about 15 large GE turbines, said it is deferring about 75% of its non-critical, scheduled maintenance, including large projects requiring hundreds of workers for a week or more. Some work is being canceled and other rescheduled.
""Some of it quite frankly is up in the air,"" said Chris Dibble, director of Dominion's power generation operations. ""We are not sure when we can start bringing people back en masse.""

 Entergy Corp  (NYSE:ETR), which has more than 20 large GE turbines, said it is postponing planned work that could affect power for hospitals and nursing homes. ""If the crew is not able to maintain adequate social distance, the job or task should be postponed,"" said Neal Kirby, an Entergy spokesman.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has offered to scrap its exclusivity deals with TV and modem makers to end an EU antitrust investigation and stave off a possible hefty fine.
Broadcom, which makes chips to power smartphones, computers and networking equipment and is a major supplier to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), found itself in EU competition enforcers' crosshairs over its deals with six companies to buy chips exclusively or almost exclusively from it.
That triggered an investigation in June last year and an order to stop such deals until the end of the probe on whether such practices were aimed at squeezing out rivals.
EU regulators have warned that the use of an interim order, the first in almost two decades, could happen more frequently against tech giants due to fast-moving markets.
Broadcom has now pledged not to offer incentives to TV and modem makers to encourage them to acquire more than 50% of their chips and modems from the company for their worldwide or European production.
Competition enforcers typically frown on contentious practices such as tying rebates or other benefits to exclusive or minimum-purchase requirements because these tend to thwart smaller rivals.
Broadcom said its offer addressed the Commission's concerns and it expected the investigation to close before the end of the year.
""In these uncertain times, we welcome the opportunity to avoid protracted litigation and to resolve the investigation without recognition of liability or the imposition of a fine,"" the company said in a statement.
The European Commission said it would now seek feedback before deciding whether to accept the offer which would be valid for five years and without a finding of infringement by the company.
Broadcom defended itself at a closed door hearing in August last year where participants included Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), MediaTek, Quantenna, a unit of ON Semiconductor and Humax.

It could face a fine of up to 10% of its global turnover if found guilty of breaching EU rules.

Alibaba removed Jiang, who oversaw the company's main online shopping divisions, from a partnership of 38 people, which appoints some Alibaba board members. It also demoted him to group vice president from group senior vice president, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters.
Alibaba declined to make Jiang available for interview and he did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The decision follows speculation on Chinese social media about Jiang's relationship with a prominent social media influencer, Zhang Dayi, and whether he had used his influence at Alibaba to ensure preferential treatment to merchants associated with  Ruhnn Holding Ltd  (O:RUHN), an e-commerce company where Zhang serves as Chief Marketing Officer.
A spokesman for Ruhnn declined to comment. A representative for Zhang did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Alibaba bought a stake in Ruhnn in 2016. Ruhnn went public last year.
In its internal investigation, Alibaba concluded that its investment in Ruhnn ""has nothing to do with Jiang Fan"" and that Ruhnn stores had not benefited from Jiang's influence, according to a note to all staff seen by the person. 
But the note also said that due to ""inappropriate handling of family affairs,"" Jiang had ""triggered a serious public opinion crisis which created a major impact on the company's reputation"", according to the memo. 
The online furore about Jiang comes as Alibaba recovers from the impact of the coronavirus, which saw deliveries temporarily come to a halt as the country went into a nation-wide, weeks-long state of semi-quarantine.
Jiang joined Alibaba in 2013 after selling his app analytics company Umeng to the e-commerce giant. He is credited with boosting Alibaba's transition away from the desktop and towards purchases on mobile phones. 

He was seen by some as a potential successor to current chairman Daniel Zhang, who took over Alibaba from Jack Ma formally in 2019.

The guidelines call for stores to have “robust” health and safety protocols in place, including sanitation and social-distancing procedures.
Measures include ensuring regular handwashing, use of gloves and face masks to protect customers and employees, in addition to limiting occupancy in some cases “to no more than 5 customers per 1,000 square feet of shopping space,” or half the national fire code requirement.
The retailers recommend that stores defer to governors on timing. States have been making those decisions by evaluating whether the number of new infections is declining and whether testing is adequate to prevent upticks in new cases.
“The governors have a difficult decision ahead of them,” RILA president Brian Dodge said in an interview. “We want to demonstrate to them that when they decide to restart the economy in their states that retailers are prepared” to keep their customers safe.
The retail trade group is adding to the growing number of industry voices seeking to influence how and when the government permits normal business to resume as the coronavirus shows signs of plateauing in some regions. Businesses and policy makers have struggled to coalesce around a single strategy to save the struggling U.S. economy and minimize the spread of the disease.
President Donald Trump earlier this month unveiled a reopening plan that puts most decisions in state hands. The president recommends that states document a “downward trajectory” in cases of coronavirus and flu-like illnesses for two weeks before beginning a three-phase process to curtail lockdown and social-distancing rules.
Under RILA’s proposal, all states should allow retailers’ warehouses to open so long as they follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s social-distancing, hygiene and sanitization guidelines. Many states have already adopted this policy, Dodge said, so that retailers can offer in-home delivery and curbside pickup.
The memo cites the need for “a fully functioning supply chain with all distribution centers operational,” rather than piecemeal reopenings, which could prevent goods in warehouses in locked-down states from moving to stores in states that have lifted their restrictions.
RILA said currently most distribution centers are open since federal guidelines call for treating them as essential. Some have been shut down in states where local orders conflicted with state directives or in states where warehouses didn’t house essential goods, including in Indiana, Missouri, Massachusetts, and Colorado, RILA said.
The first phase should also allow pickups and in-home deliveries, the memo said. These operations should allow a limited number of employees in stores that are closed to the public “to fulfill online orders and deliver purchases to customers who drive or walk up, observing appropriate social distancing,” according to the memo.
In the second phase, the memo from RILA and NRF said states could permit more stores to open while establishing safety guidelines, such as ensuring that employees stay six feet apart when practical, establishing special shopping hours for high-risk individuals, and limiting the number of customers in a store at the same time.
In the third and final phase, the states would eliminate pandemic-related shopping restrictions but stores would maintain certain cleanliness standards, such as requiring employees to wash their hands often and disinfecting high-trafficked spaces.
Dodge said the trade group based its proposed safety guidelines on existing state regulations, recommendations from the CDC, and safety measures that stores that have remained open already adopted.
Notably, RILA’s memo avoids some of the trickiest questions facing governors, such as how to coordinate store and school reopenings. If schools stay closed, stores that call workers back might find themselves short-staffed.
States have varied widely in their approach to determining when and under what circumstances normal business and social life can resume. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, one of the last governors to issue a statewide shutdown, on Friday allowed nail salons, hairdressers, bowling alleys and gyms to reopen. Kemp said shops must follow safety protocols, but some Democratic mayors -- and even Trump -- said he was moving too fast.
Other governors are emphasizing the need to conduct widespread testing to minimize a second round of infections. New York, for example, is building a “tracing army” with thousands of workers to track the origin of individual cases and reduce the virus’s spread so the state can focus on reopening, Governor Andrew Cuomo has said. The state is also working with neighboring New Jersey and Connecticut to increase testing.
Likewise, Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine said on Saturday that testing and isolating people who are positive will be “very very important” for reopening. She said the state will be “ready this week,” ahead of a partial reopening, and is planning to trace people who have come into contact with an infected person.
RILA isn’t the only trade group trying to shape states’ reopening plans. The Business Roundtable, which counts the chief executives of major U.S. companies as its members, has also urged a phased reopening, with the states coordinating with the federal government.
In an April 24 letter signed by Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, the group’s chairman, the roundtable suggested testing and health screening of employees in accordance with CDC guidance, and in some cases as a condition of entering the workplace.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has also issued a document it said was meant to spur discussion of such issues as employer liability over health privacy, securities litigation and safety issues.

98,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 27, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Higher; Fed Meeting and Tech Results Eyed,"By Peter Nurse    
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Monday, with investors buoyed by news of more stimulus and state reopenings ahead of a week dominated by central bank meetings and earnings from the big tech stocks.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 22 points, or 0.8%, higher, Nasdaq futures up 90 points, or 1%. The Dow futures contract rose 212 points, or 0.9%.
Wall Street is coming off its first losing week in three, and the Dow and S&P 500 cash indices are on track for the best month since October 2011, while the Nasdaq is set for its best month since April 2009.
Earlier Monday the Bank of Japan kicked off a week of central bank action by lifting the cap on its purchases of Japanese government bonds and boosting its purchases of commercial paper and bank loans.
This has raised confidence that the U.S. Federal Reserve, which finishes a two-day meeting on Wednesday, and the European Central Bank, which meets on Thursday, could offer up more stimulus to support economies hit by social distancing measures.
Elsewhere, more U.S. states are prepared to ease restrictions on commerce this week, despite worries about the extent of testing in place.
""I think as we begin to reopen the economy in May and June you're going to really see the economy bounce back in July, August, September,"" said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday. “We are putting in an unprecedented amount of fiscal relief into the economy.""
The corporate earnings season picks up pace this week, with around 30% of the S&P 500 index scheduled to report financial results in the week ahead.
While Monday is relatively quiet, tech giants Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) all report this week. Weak numbers in the first quarter are likely to be a small preview of what’s to come, but most investors will be looking for any guidance further ahead as dire results are already baked in. 
The oil market has slumped Monday, retreating from recent gains as traders fret that production cuts may not be enough to eradicate oversupply.
Baker Hughes reported on Friday that the rig count in the U.S. fell by 60, taking the total number to just 378, and falling quickly towards the lows seen in 2016. In addition, the ongoing oil price slump has ensnared another company as  Diamond Offshore  Drilling (NYSE:DO) filed for bankruptcy.
At 7 AM ET, U.S. crude traded 16% lower at $14.12 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 4% to $23.81.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,734.25/oz, while EUR/USD traded at $1.0850, up 0.3%.

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's top market regulator has launched an inspection into  Luckin Coffee  (O:LK), joining the country's securities watchdog in doing so as the coffee chain comes under scrutiny for fabricating millions of dollars worth of sales deals. 
Dozens of officers from the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) raided Luckin's main office in Beijing on Sunday, staying there from morning to evening that day, a source with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters. 
Luckin Coffee confirmed that it was being inspected by the SAMR in a post on its official Weibo account on Monday, saying that it was ""actively cooperating"" with the regulator, which was trying to understand the company's operating situation. It did not respond to requests from Reuters for further comment. 
The China Securities Regulatory Commission announced earlier this month that it would investigate claims of fraud at Luckin after it announced an internal investigation had shown its chief operating officer and other employees fabricated sales deals worth about 2.2 billion yuan ($310.77 million).
The source, and a second one that has been in touch with regulators, told Reuters the Chinese regulators, in particular the CSRC, were acting on a request by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to look into Luckin. 
The sources declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The SAMR, CSRC and U.S. SEC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Shares in Luckin, which aggressively pitched itself as a challenger to Starbucks (O:SBUX) in China, have plunged by more than 90% from their January high following the news. 
Bankers and investors have warned that Luckin's issues were likely to weigh on other Chinese companies considering a U.S. IPO - a group already affected by the trade tensions of 2019.

102,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 27, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Covid-19 Gives Way to Spring Fever - a Bit,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets are acting like they have survived the virus and want to go out and party.
In fairness, there’s plenty to be upbeat about after a weekend in which Standard & Poor’s held off from downgrading Italy,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) rushed to tell people that it actually made a profit in the quarter, and Europe’s largest car factory (and schools in Shanghai and Beijing) reopened.
Italy and Spain both mapped out their plans for easing restrictions on national life, the German, Dutch and French governments moved toward removing the tail risk of bankruptcy for Lufthansa and Air France-KLM and – most importantly - the death toll continued to fall across most of the continent.
Nor has any of the above dimmed speculation that the European Central Bank will also increase its attempts to support the region by expanding its bond purchase program at its policy meeting on Thursday.
By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 1.7% at 335.14. However, it still can’t get above 337, despite what is now its fourth attempt in the last two weeks. None of the big three indices on the continent have been able to push beyond their initial rebound highs at the end of last month and are on course to end April pretty much where they started it, even though Germany's comparative success in containing the disease has seen it outperform with a 9% rise.
Clearly, uncertainty over the course of the rest of the year is still sky-high. Deutsche Bank’s release raised as many questions as it answered. It bolstered loan loss provisions by 500 million euros ($504 million) and warned that “we see continued high demand for support from our clients in this challenging situation”  - whereby the word ""support"" covers a multitude of possibilities of varying severity.
News of government support for the airlines was, of course, welcome, but a look across the North Sea at Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC) suggests that it is no guarantee of a miracle for the present generation of shareholders. Conditionality is all, and there is no clarity yet on what conditions the French, German and Dutch states will extract for their help. Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary’s comments last week, however, that the packages will face legal challenge – irrespective of the broad political commitment to loosening state aid rules.
But for a more neutral view on the outlook for airlines, it may be best to look at their suppliers. Airbus (PA:AIR) stock was the biggest loser on the CAC 40 on Monday, falling 2.9%, after a leaked internal memo pointed to further cuts in production and jobs.
Chief executive Guillaume Faury told employees the company is ""bleeding cash at an unprecedented speed"" and that a recent drop of a third or more in production rates did not reflect the worst-case scenario and would be kept under review.
Both Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) are clearly preparing for long-term changes to their trajectories. Deutsche Bank, by contrast, said on Monday it expected the impacts of Covid-19 to be only temporary, at least as regards regulation and regulatory ratios. Both are due to post full results later this week.  With both, as with many others besides, certainty about the outlook will be too much to ask for."
103,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2020 05:35AM ET</span>","In cash-loving Japan, banks still busy despite coronavirus emergency","By Takashi Umekawa
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese retail customers' love affair with cash - and some extra free time while working at home - is keeping bank branches busy despite government calls for people to reduce contacts during the state of emergency to contain a coronavirus outbreak.
Japan does not have a mandatory lockdown, but Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared a state of emergency for seven prefectures including Tokyo on April 7, urging people to cut person-to-person contacts by 70% to 80% and work at home as much as possible.
The emergency was expanded nationwide on April 16.
But while many downtown areas have seen sharp declines in people traffic, the banking arms of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (T:8306) and  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial  Group Inc (T:8316) said total visitor numbers in April declined by just 10% and 15% respectively.
In some residential areas, branches have even seen an uptick. MUFG figures include ATMs, while SMFG numbers do not.
Japan has not seen the explosive outbreak of infections seen in many other countries, but had 13,444 confirmed cases and 373 deaths as of Monday, according to public broadcaster NHK.
A Japanese preference for cash, especially among its large ranks of elderly, appears to be one reason for the busy banks.
""Elderly people prefer cash. It's safer,"" said Hitoko Taki, 79, who visited an MUFG branch to withdraw her pension. ""I'm not very keen on 'cashless' whatever.""
Japan is one of the most cash-based economies in the advanced world, government statistics show, with its cashless ratio below 20% against 96% in South Korea and 66% in China.
Working at home has also given some employees time to slip out to the local bank branch.
""I have more free time now after my company introduced telework,"" said Kanoko Nakashima, 56, who visited the MUFG branch in Tokyo to get a new bank book after noticing her old one was filled up.
Many Japanese are wary of online banking, and prefer to keep transaction records in their paper bankbooks.
Japanese firms have expanded telework since the virus outbreak. About 40% of 1,158 employees surveyed by the NTT Data Institute of Management Consulting in April said their companies had introduced remote working, up from 18% in January.
Japan's three largest lenders - MUFG, SMFG and Mizuho - have all said they would keep their bank branches open as a vital part of social infrastructure.
The banks have taken measures against coronavirus infections, such as placing a plastic curtain at the counter and making staff wear a face guard while speaking to customers.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets rallied on Monday as the Bank of Japan added more stimulus to cushion the impact of the coronavirus and investors cheered news more countries were easing lockdowns, though the oil price took another tumble with storage running short.
The Bank of Japan matched market speculation by pledging to buy unlimited amounts of government bonds and sharply raising purchases of corporate and commercial debt, the latest in a raft of vast central bank stimulus plans that have helped propel a near 25% rally in global stock markets. 
The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank meet later in the week, with the latter likely to do more bond buying.
Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets, said while he expected both meetings to focus chiefly on implementing current commitments, ""there might well be tweaks... to their various purchase and liquidity programmes"". 
The Euro STOXX 600 rose 1.8%, following on from decent gains on Asian markets. Germany's DAX rose 2.37%, France's CAC 40 1.93% and Britain's FTSE 100 1.66%.
Wall Street also looked set to open higher, with S&P futures 0.7% ahead.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, rose 0.78%. The index is now up 25% from its low point on March 23, but is still some 22% off the highs in February before panic over the virus caused markets to tank.
Around 173 companies in the S&P 500 will report earnings this week, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT),  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), Ford,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX).
Analysts expect a 15% decline in S&P 500 first-quarter earnings, with profits for the energy sector estimated to have slumped more than 60%, raising fears of debt defaults.
The United States and European Union both release first-quarter economic growth numbers this week, while the U.S. will also unveil the influential ISM survey on manufacturing.
But not everyone thinks the current crop of data is as relevant for markets, which have recently shrugged off huge rises in U.S. jobless claims to focus on how quickly economies will rebound as government-imposed lockdowns are lifted.
""I don’t know why people pay so much attention to today’s data. We know it’s all bad. The new information will come in the summer,"" said Stephen Jen, co-founder of hedge fund Eurizon SLJ Capital.
He said the ""tug of war"" between those predicting a sharp v-shaped rebound and those expecting a slower recovery would not begin in earnest until May's data. 
More U.S. states prepared to ease restrictions on commerce this week despite health experts warning that there is still too little testing in place, while some European countries further eased their lockdowns. 
OIL DROPS, ITALY GETS REPRIEVE
Oil prices weakened sharply again and looked set for another volatile week. 
Crude prices have fallen in eight of the last nine weeks, with U.S. crude even trading below zero last week as demand collapsed due to the pandemic and supply cuts failed to keep up, leaving more oil than could be stored. 
U.S. crude slid $2.29 to $14.65, while Brent crude futures slipped $1.1 to $20.34 a barrel. 
Italian government bond yields dropped between 14 and 17 basis points after S&P Global late Friday left the country's credit rating in investment grade territory. 
Investors had feared the ratings agency would cut heavily-indebted Italy to 'junk'.
Benchmark German 10-year bond yields were little changed, while U.S. Treasury yields rose marginally.

The U.S. dollar dipped as the broader upbeat mood encouraged investors to move back into other currencies. The euro inched higher to $1.0833, while sterling gained 0.3% and the Japanese yen a similar amount.

Airlines UK, the industry's representative body, wrote to the finance minister requesting an extension of the scheme, which airlines including British Airways (L:ICAG) and easyJet (L:EZJ) have used to furlough workers. 
Under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, the government pays 80% of the wages of staff who are temporarily laid off, up to 2,500 pounds a month. 
Airlines, many of which have grounded the majority of their fleets, have used the scheme to avoid making staff redundant in the hope that when travel restrictions are eased and demand returns, they can restart operations. 
The scheme runs until the end of June, but the airlines want it to be extended ""to avoid aviation facing a cliff-edge post-June, whilst services are scaled-up"", Airlines UK said in its letter. 
Global industry body IATA has predicted a slow recovery in air travel and warned that many airlines could go out of business, with European traffic currently down by 90%. 
UK-based airline Virgin Atlantic continues to talk to the British government about a bailout package to help it survive.
Air travel faces a further headache as the government said it was considering the possibility of requiring passengers to go into quarantine for two weeks once they arrive in the UK. 
Asked about the extension of the job retention scheme for airlines, junior health minister Edward Argar told Sky News on Monday that he knew the finance minister Rishi Sunak was keeping the schemes under review.

""I know that the Chancellor is very, very aware of how important the airline industry is,"" he said.

The European benchmark ended with weekly losses on Friday, hit by the lack of details in a trillion-euro emergency fund agreed by the euro zone leaders. However, investors are pinning hopes on further stimulus expansion by the European Central Bank, which is scheduled to meet on Thursday.

Shares in Adidas (DE:ADSGn), however, fell 1.6% as it reported a 93% plunge in first-quarter profit, and warned of a deeper hit to second-quarter revenue as lockdowns forced it to close stores.

First-quarter operating profit fell to 65 million euros, well short of the 263 million expected by analysts.
Adidas said it had taken a hit of around 250 million euros on unsold stock in greater China, purchase order cancellations and higher bad debt provisions.
Sales fell 19% to 4.75 billion euros versus 4.85 billion forecast by analysts, Refinitiv Eikon data showed, and the company warned of a possible 40% fall in the seond quarter.
Adidas shares were down 1.2% in early trade and have fallen more than a third since the coronavirus pandemic started.
It said it could not provide an outlook for the year given the uncertainty over when closed stores might reopen.
Adidas said more than 70% of its stores were currently closed worldwide, with a 35% rise in e-commerce in the first quarter only partially offsetting that.
In the first three weeks of April, it said sales in China had continued to recover as stores reopened there.
Rival  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) last month beat estimates for its third quarter ended Feb. 29, with revenue up 5.1% as strong online demand offset lower sales in China.

Adidas said it had a cash position of 1.975 billion euros at March 31. It received approval for a 2.4 billion euro government-backed loan on April 14 to help it through the crisis and is reportedly planning a bond to replace it.

""We appeal to the federal government to closely link economic policy measures to overcome both the climate crisis and the coronavirus crisis,"" more than 60 companies said in letter, ahead of the Petersberg climate dialogue starting on Monday. 
The companies are concerned that environmental issues will be put on the backburner during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Car makers are already lobbying to prevent the announced tightening of emissions limits on cars, airlines for a waiver on jet fuel taxes, and the plastics industry for an appeal of the ban on some plastics products.
""The pandemic highlights the vulnerability of our globalized economic system to threats that are not limited to regions or industries,"" the appeal says. ""Climate change is a comparable challenge.""
As part of the initiative, Bernhard Osburg, head of ThyssenKrupp's steel unit, called for a climate economic stimulus programme, while Joerg Fuhrmann, Chief Executive at peer Salzgitter, said the state should encourage the replacement of coal with hydrogen in steelmaking. 
Markus Steilemann, head of plastics maker Covestro said: ""It is about making our economy more crisis-resistant and competitive with a view to a truly sustainable, climate-neutral future.""
The German BDI industry association said it was sticking to the European goal of climate neutrality, or net zero greenhouse gas emissions, in 2050, but warned that governments, companies and households will in future have reduced scope for investments. 

""The EU's Green Deal must therefore become a Smart Deal, in which growth, employment and ambitious climate protection targets are linked as efficiently as possible via an intelligent investment and relief package,"" said BDI deputy managing director Holger Loesch.

The pandemic has significantly slowed the mediation process, it said in a statement on Monday.
""The company will consider a deal only if it is financially reasonable and puts in place a mechanism to resolve potential future claims efficiently.

Silk EV on Monday told Reuters it has signed a memorandum of understanding with FAW to launch a joint venture in the state-owned automaker's hometown of Changchun, northern China, to make cars it has dubbed the S-series.
The plan was first reported on Friday by state media CCTV and Xinhua. FAW confirmed the CCTV report to Reuters.
Silk EV is a full auto solutions provider focused on the China auto market, its website showed.
It launched a company in Shanghai's free trade zone in April last year with registered capital of 1 million yuan ($141,281), showed a filing on the official National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System.
Hongqi, meaning Red Flag, was launched by FAW in 1958 and is widely regarded as a symbol of China's ruling Communist Party, with former leader Mao often seen riding in high-end black saloons.
It has undergone several revamps over the decades, falling out of favour in the 1980s and now enjoying a revival as the government promotes home-grown brands.

FAW aims for annual Hongqi sales to double to 200,000 vehicles this year and reach 1 million by the end of the decade. Its plans for the brand include having 21 models by 2025.

117,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 27, 2020 01:00AM ET</span>",Top India Energy Analyst Says Demand Issue Messes Up Forecasts,"(Bloomberg) -- While oil prices are hovering around historic lows, to predict how that will translate into profit at some major refiners in India has never been harder.
That’s because demand for fuels disrupted by global lockdowns has become extremely difficult to forecast, according to Aditya Suresh, Macquarie Capital Ltd.’s co-head of Asian energy research, who is the top-ranked analyst for India’s biggest refiner Reliance Industries Ltd., according to Bloomberg-compiled data.
“There is no clear answer that we expect energy demand to fall,” Suresh, who has been an energy analyst for 12 years, said. “It is all a demand-led problem of forecast because you just don’t know how bad it is and that has a significant impact on utilization rates and margin assumptions.”
Analysts globally across industries are having perhaps the most challenging time ever predicting stocks performance and corporate earnings. With a growing number of companies abandoning forward guidance, analysts have little to go by. That said, forecasting energy company profits is still easier than other sectors, such as cement and consumer, due to the availability of real-time indicators such as pricing data, Suresh said.
At 49.6%, refining was the biggest contributor to Reliance’s revenues at the end of 2019. Suresh has a neutral rating on Reliance with a price target of 1,135 rupees ($14.85) over the next 12 months, implying a 20% fall from Friday’s close.
Forecasting volumes for energy products relies a lot on clear estimates for global economic growth. However, the coronavirus pandemic has thrown all gross domestic product predictions into disarray, and a supply glut caused U.S. crude futures to crash below zero for the first time ever last week.
Suresh said early indications speak to a 30% drop in energy demand in India and globally.” Estimating a 60-70% drop in gasoline volumes so far this year and 20-30% fall in diesel’s, earnings for refiners will be substantially hit, according to him. Gasoline, jet fuel and diesel account for about two-thirds of Reliance’s product mix, the brokerage estimates.
“To have any kind of growth in earnings per share you have to have refining margins expanding for Reliance,” he said. His earnings per share estimate for Reliance for the year ending March 2021 is 79 rupees, lower than consensus of 82 rupees from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Reliance hasn’t scheduled a date for announcing earnings for the three months ending March.

120,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2020 10:15PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Investors to challenge Neiman Marcus bankruptcy loan, push for sale - sources","By Mike Spector, Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - An investor group that comprises investment firm Mudrick Capital Management LP and Daniel Loeb's hedge fund Third Point LLC plans to challenge a $600 million financing package that Neiman Marcus Group has lined up for its looming bankruptcy, and will push the U.S. department store operator to sell itself, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
Neiman Marcus is preparing to seek bankruptcy protection in a Dallas federal court as soon as Monday, the sources said. The debt-laden company's sales all but evaporated after the coronavirus outbreak forced it to temporarily shut all 43 of its Neiman Marcus locations, roughly two dozen Last Call stores and its two Bergdorf Goodman stores in New York. The location and timing of the bankruptcy filing had not been finalized as of Sunday, the sources cautioned.
Neiman Marcus declined to comment.
Mudrick submitted a $700 million proposal for so-called debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing to Neiman Marcus in recent days, the sources said. In addition to Third Point, hedge fund Fir Tree Partners is also likely to be part of the group proposing the financing, they said. 
Neiman Marcus plans to instead use a $600 million loan it spent weeks negotiating with creditors that include Pacific Investment Management Co, Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP and TPG's Sixth Street Partners, the sources said.
Neiman Marcus over the weekend was close to completing negotiations for that financing to help sustain its operations while it navigates bankruptcy proceedings, some of the sources said. The company's current plan calls for creditors to forgive most of the $5 billion in Neiman Marcus's debt in exchange for taking ownership of the retailer, the sources said.
The final approval of the company's financing rests with a bankruptcy judge. The investors behind the new proposed loan are preparing to challenge Neiman Marcus's $600 million financing package in court, in part by arguing that their fees are less expensive, according to the sources.
A key condition of the newly proposed $700 million loan is that Neiman Marcus must seek an outright sale while under bankruptcy protection, before attempting to reorganize its finances and operations, the sources said.
The investors behind the 11th-hour financing proposal view Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson's Bay Co as a logical buyer, and also expect other suitors to show an interest in Neiman Marcus, the sources said.
It is unclear whether Hudson's Bay, which has held unsuccessful talks to acquire Neiman Marcus in the past and completed a deal to go private last month, is currently in a position for a takeover of its rival. Hudson's Bay did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
If no credible bidder emerges, the proposed loan's terms call for Neiman Marcus to try to reorganize its debts and emerge from bankruptcy proceedings in slimmed-down form, according to the sources.
The investors behind the competing bankruptcy loans either declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
One feature of the newly proposed $700 million loan is that is sets aside $100 million to repay some existing lenders, the sources said. The lenders that would be repaid hold Neiman Marcus inventory and receivables as collateral that have declined in value while stores remain closed, one of the sources added. 
The competition for the bankruptcy financing to Neiman Marcus underscores the financial appeal of DIP loans for investors. They carry high interest rates, are repaid before other obligations, and usually carry strict terms that include milestones a company must meet. 
The lenders providing the $600 million financing package Neiman Marcus already has lined up hold the lion's share of the company's senior debt, presenting a hurdle for the newcomer investors attempting to persuade the retailer to accept their rival loan, some of the sources said. Still, the rival proposal could pressure existing bankruptcy lenders to alter some of their loan's terms, they said.
INCREASED COMPETITION
Some of Neiman Marcus's debt is the legacy of its $6 billion leveraged buyout in 2013 by its owners, private equity firm Ares Management Corp (N:ARES) and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB). Ares declined to comment. CPPIB did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Like other brick-and-mortar department store operators, Neiman Marcus struggled in recent years to compete with discount retail chains and a consumer shift to online shopping. Luxury e-commerce firms such as Yoox (MI:YNAP) Net-A-Porter Group and Farfetch Ltd have added to the competitive pressure facing Neiman Marcus.
The nearly 113-year-old company in March furloughed many of its roughly 14,000 employees. 
Other department store operators that have also had to close their stores are battling to avoid Neiman Marcus's fate.  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN) secured new financing by borrowing against some of their real estate.

J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JPN) is exploring a bankruptcy filing as a way to rework its unsustainable finances, Reuters reported earlier this month. J.C. Penney has said it has been in discussions with lenders since before the pandemic and that those discussions have become more important since it was forced to close stores.

121,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2020 09:00PM ET</span>","Investors bet on testing, treatments for restart of U.S. economy","By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - Investors are pinning their hopes for the reopening of the U.S. economy on the potential for wider availability of testing for COVID-19 cases and on drug trials for treatments of the deadly disease but said, until there is concrete progress in these areas, further stock market gains may be limited.
Much of the S&P 500's (SPX) almost 27% advance above its March 23 low has been due to hopes that massive U.S. fiscal and monetary support would dampen the economic blow from stay-at-home orders designed to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
But recently, the index has reacted to reports about trials and in particular Gilead Science's (O:GILD) remdesivir experimental treatment for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus. Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is designed to keep a virus from replicating and overwhelming a patient's immune system.
This volatility highlights investor impatience for indications of when state and Federal authorities might start to ease stay-at-home orders and get people back to work. 
So far there are no approved treatments or vaccines for the disease which has killed over 190,000 people globally, according to a Reuters tally. The disease has infected more than 928,000 people and killed more than 52,000 in the United States alone, according to the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
""Any sentiment around a therapy is really moving markets because it shapes expectations for a return to normalcy which would be needed to get an economic recovery started,"" said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, New Jersey.
The S&P added to gains on Friday after the lead investigator in a U.S. government trial of remdesivir told Reuters the trial may yield results as early as mid-May.
But on Thursday the index temporarily pared gains after a report Gilead's drug failed a trial the drugmaker itself deemed inconclusive because the study was ended early. On April 17 investors were encouraged after medical news publication STAT reported rapid improvements in COVID-19 patients in one hospital studying the drug.
While Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut is encouraged by the number of researchers working on coronavirus treatments, he is cautious about the stock market's near-term prospects.
""The only thing that pushes us above this range in a sustainable way is a therapeutic solution or a vaccine that allows us to return to the pre-crisis level of business,"" he said. ""I think we'll get a medical solution. The big question is the time frame. The longer it takes it becomes harder (for the economy) to snap back and rebound.""
While there are more than 70 vaccines in development for coronavirus, Manulife Investment Management's Steven Slaughter, who manages a roughly $3.5 billion dedicated healthcare fund said he expects development of a successful vaccine to take at least 12-18 months compared to the average vaccine development time of 5-7 years. 
Then it could be years before pharmaceutical companies can produce enough to vaccinate the world's entire population. 
But Slaughter is optimistic at least some treatment will be validated in trials in the next three to six months, and said this would give officials ""more latitude to restart the economy."" 
He said there are four main types of treatments being tested by companies including Gilead, Takeda Pharmaceutical (T:4502), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (O:REGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (O:ALXN) that all hold some promise. 
While treatments may not necessarily slow transmission of the disease, they could help doctors control the severity of infections, easing pressure on intensive care units (ICU).
""If we can take a patient that otherwise would've spend 2-3 weeks in an ICU bed out of that ICU bed in 2-3 days that has an enormous beneficial impact on our ability to handle outbreaks or to handle a potential second wave of infections,"" he said. 
In the meantime officials should at least look for greater availability of tests that can detect virus infections and for ways to track and trace people who might have been exposed, before easing lockdowns, some strategists said.
""What will be more critical will be the testing capacity and the efficacy of track and trace programmes,"" said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Management. Test developers include  Abbott Laboratories  (N:ABT) and Roche Holding (S:ROG).
Since much of the U.S. population has been told to stay at home and many businesses have been on pause since the middle of March, investors have already accounted for dismal earnings and a massive U.S. economic decline in the second quarter.
But recent S&P gains seem to imply a huge improvement in the economy in the third quarter, according to Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.

""There will be a vaccine and treatments for COVID-19 but people are underestimating the amount of time it takes for them to reach the market,"" said Tuz. ""If there are disappointments in three areas - vaccine, treatment and testing - we could back track some in the market.""

The world's largest online retailer has long faced scrutiny over how it polices counterfeits and allegedly unsafe products on its platform. Fakes have frustrated top labels like Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) and discouraged some from selling via Amazon at all.
Amazon said its pilot began early this year and included in-person appointments with prospective sellers. However, it switched exclusively to video conferencing in February because of social distancing requirements related to the highly contagious coronavirus, which has infected more than 2.9 million people globally.
The interview vetting, on top of other risk-screening performed by Amazon, has been piloted with more than 1,000 merchant applicants based in China, the United States, United Kingdom and Japan, Amazon said.

The extra scrutiny by Amazon could make it harder for some China-based sellers, who have registered multiple accounts using private internet networks or fake utility bills. China-based merchants accounted for 40% of the top 10,000 Amazon sellers in Europe, according to 2019 research from firm Marketplace Pulse.

PARIS (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) issued a bleak assessment of the impact of the coronavirus crisis, telling the company's 135,000 employees to brace for potentially deeper job cuts and warning its survival is at stake without immediate action.
In a letter to staff, Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said Airbus was ""bleeding cash at an unprecedented speed"" and that a recent drop of a third or more in production rates did not reflect the worst-case scenario and would be kept under review.
Airbus said it did not comment on internal communications.
The letter was sent to employees late on Friday, days before the company is due to give first-quarter results overshadowed by a pandemic that has left airlines struggling to survive and virtually halted jet deliveries since mid-March.
Airbus has begun implementing government-assisted furlough schemes starting with 3,000 workers in France, ""but we may now need to plan for more far-reaching measures,"" Faury said.
""The survival of Airbus is in question if we don't act now,"" he added.
Industry sources have said a new restructuring plan similar to its 2007 Power8 which saw 10,000 job cuts could be launched in the summer, but Faury indicated the company was already exploring ""all options"" while waiting for clarity on demand.
People familiar with the matter say Airbus is also in active discussions with European governments about tapping schemes to assist struggling industries, including state-guaranteed loans.
It has already expanded commercial credit lines with banks, buying what Faury described as ""time to adapt and resize"".
PRODUCTION CUTS
To stem the outflow of cash, Airbus this month said it would slash benchmark narrow-body jet production by a third to 40 jets a month. It also issued targets for wide-body jets implying cuts up to 42% compared with previously published rates.
""In other words, in just a couple of weeks we have lost roughly one-third of our business,"" Faury wrote in the letter, which was earlier reported by Bloomberg News. ""And, frankly, that's not even the worst-case scenario we could face"".
Reuters reported on April 3 that Airbus was looking at scenarios involving output cuts of up to a half, and analysts say Boeing is expected to unveil comparable cuts along with lay-offs this week, lowering monthly 787 output to as low as 6 jets.
Faury said Airbus's new production plan would remain for as long as it took to make a more thorough assessment of demand, adding this would probably be between two and three months.
He said it was too early to judge the shape and pace of a recovery, but mentioned scenarios including a short and deep crisis with a fast rebound or a longer and more painful downturn with previous demand levels only returning after 5 or 10 years.
Analysts and airlines have so far mostly spoken of a downturn lasting no more than 3-4 years.
Rival Boeing (N:BA), with even weaker finances due to the year-old grounding of its 737 MAX, scrapped a $4.2 billion tie-up with Brazil's Embraer on Saturday in a move widely seen as triggered by the crisis, though it cited contractual reasons. 

""Unfortunately, the aviation industry will emerge into this new world very much weaker and more vulnerable than we went into it,"" Faury wrote.

124,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 26, 2020 07:18PM ET</span>",Europe Starts Stumping Up Billions for Cash-Strapped Airlines,"(Bloomberg) -- Government bailouts for the European airline industry are taking shape after France and the Netherlands pledged as much as 11 billion euros ($11.9 billion) to save Air France-KLM, and German rival Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) AG heads into a crucial week to work out a similar-sized rescue.
The lifelines to the region’s two biggest carriers by passenger traffic would come after each warned of impending cash crunches and their inability to survive the effects of the coronavirus pandemic without state help. They join a global chorus of distressed airlines that have grounded fleets, furloughed staff and decried the biggest crisis ever to confront the sector.
In the case of Air France-KLM, the French and Dutch governments -- the carrier’s biggest shareholders -- set aside a long-simmering conflict over how the group should be run to unveil two, albeit separate, packages of direct loans and guarantees to keep it afloat.

For Lufthansa, the road map to salvation is just as politically fraught, involving German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the governments of Austria, Belgium and Switzerland, where it operates so-called national flag carriers.
The willingness by France and likely Germany to shore up their ailing champions comes after the International Air Transport Association repeatedly warned the health crisis could bankrupt half the world’s airlines, with the hit to European carriers expected to reach $89 billion in lost sales. The U.K., traditionally less inclined to dole out taxpayer money, is extending loan guarantees to carriers that qualify. The U.S. is disbursing about $25 billion in payroll assistance, while airlines have also applied for government loans.
“All efforts are devoted to respond to this unprecedented shock,” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and his Dutch counterpart, Wopke Hoekstra, said in a joint statement on the Air France-KLM aid package, adding that they will push the carrier to recover its competitiveness and financial footing.
Fairness Challenged
The move by France will probably serve as further ammunition to Michael O’Leary, the chief executive officer of budget carrier Ryanair Holdings Plc and the region’s most vocal opponent to state aid. He has told Europe’s top antitrust official that the airline may go to court to stop France and other countries from “selectively gifting billions of euros to their inefficient flag carriers.”
The French aid package may also spell more government intervention in the months ahead. The airline said it would consider a share issue to which the French state might participate. This raises the possibility that the direct 3 billion euro-loan extended by France could be transformed into equity, thereby raising its stake.
CEO Ben Smith has vowed to push ahead with a promised revamp, opening the door to voluntary staff departures to cut costs and a further expansion in the low-cost market.
German Debate
In Germany, Merkel’s negotiators and their counterparts at Lufthansa are expected to sit down in the coming days to hammer out a package of loans, credit guarantees and equity that could be worth around 10 billion euros, according to people familiar with the matter.
While Germany’s government negotiators have said the carrier won’t be allowed to fail, the sides have clashed over what strings will be attached to its contribution to state assistance that could total as much as 10 billion euros. Merkel’s center-left SPD coalition partners want any equity injection to come with a seat on Lufthansa’s board, whereas the company has pushed for a so-called silent participation, the people have said. Air France-KLM already has the French state on its board.“We need to find a solution which will not lead to a permanent politicization of Lufthansa,” Christian Democratic Union lawmaker Joachim Pfeiffer, who is involved in the talks, said on Friday.
State Interests
Lufthansa connects Germany to the far-flung export markets on which its world-beating factory firms depend and, like Air France-KLM, is considered too strategic to be allowed to fail. In the case of the French carrier, its service to overseas territories like Martinique, French Guiana and New Caledonia as well as domestic routes have long kept it in the sights of successive governments as strategically important.
In the U.K., where the Conservative government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson has proven to be adverse to plowing state funds directly into struggling companies, Richard Branson is fighting to save teetering Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd.
His request for some 500 million pounds ($618 million) in U.K. funding guarantees has met with resistance, partly linked to the 69-year-old billionaire’s home in a British Virgin Islands tax haven. Low-cost EasyJet Plc has already tapped the state loan guarantee program.
Branson is considering pouring more money than he originally pledged in a bid to attract outside investors and gain access to hundreds of millions of pounds of state-backed loans, according to people familiar with the matter.
This week will also be decisive for discount regional and trans-Atlantic carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, which has already placed four units into bankrupcy protection and is pursuing a last-ditch plan to convert debt to equity. The airlne needs assent from bondholders and shareholders to fully access a 3 billion kroner ($282 million) bailout from Norway’s government.

125,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2020 06:20PM ET</span>","Diamond Offshore files for bankruptcy, citing 'price war,' coronavirus","By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Diamond Offshore  Drilling Inc (N:DO) filed for bankruptcy protection in Texas on Sunday, after the company recently skipped making an interest payment and said it had retained restructuring advisers.
The Houston-based contract drilling company's filing, one of 15 of its group companies seeking protection under Chapter 11, said day rates and demand for its services had ""worsened precipitously"" this year amid a ""price war"" between OPEC and Russia and the steep drop in oil demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The company has significant operations in the Gulf of Mexico.
The filing comes as the five biggest U.S. and European firms have cut spending an average of 23% in response to the drop in oil demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The companies are  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa)  BP  PLC (L:BP),  Total  (PA:TOTF) and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX).
Global spending on oilfield equipment and services is forecast to fall 21% this year to its lowest level since 2005. Oil futures prices last week closed below $0 for the first time in history.
Chevron, BP and others have been reducing deepwater drilling projects, including the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where some of Diamond's drilling rigs are located.
Loews Corp (N:L) was Diamond Offshore's largest shareholder, with 53% as of April 3, according to Refinitiv.
Diamond had recently drawn $400 million under a revolving credit facility. But it said ""the financial and operational conditions of the Diamond Offshore Group Companies have continued to deteriorate in the weeks following such responses.""
Diamond Offshore Drilling listed Bank of New York Mellon Corp (N:BK) as by far its largest creditor, with a combined $2 billion in claims. The next largest creditor was National Oilwell Varco Inc (N:NOV), with about $6.2 million in claims.
The company had about 2,500 workers, including international crew furnished through independent contractors, as of the end of 2019.

126,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 26, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",Softbank’s $23 Billion Buyback Helps Investors Overlook Profit Hit,"(Bloomberg) -- Soured investments, a forecast record loss and a rating cut are not turning SoftBank Group Corp. analysts and investors into bears on the stock.
That’s because they believe a massive $23 billion share buyback plan will buoy SoftBank’s shares for months to come, more than offsetting the hit from the Vision Fund’s write-downs.
Masayoshi Son’s tech giant last month boosted the size of planned share repurchases to 2.5 trillion yen, to be funded with proceeds from asset sales. The stock is up 38% since then, continuing to rise even after it said earlier this month that it will post an operating loss of 1.35 trillion yen for the fiscal year ended in March on hits from the Vision Fund’s soured wagers on startups such as WeWork and OneWeb.
“The economics of the buyback basically trump everything else,” said Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.’s Chris Lane. “You could be a skeptic of the Vision Fund but still appreciate the effect, mathematically, of the buyback.”
Lane expects the shares to climb another 40% from recent levels. And he isn’t an outlier: the eternally bullish crowd of SoftBank sell-side analysts have an average 12-month target on the stock of 6,659 yen, more than 50% above the current price. Jefferies Group’s Atul Goyal sees the buyback program giving the stock an “easy 3-9 month upside.”
“Retail investors and hedge funds are targeting a short-term rebound,” given that the the loss isn’t so large relative to the company’s $86 billion market capitalization plus the fund, said Naoki Fujiwara, chief fund manager at Shinkin Asset Management Co.
Elliott Management Corp. in February urged SoftBank for more transparency and a large buyback to help boost its share price, which the activist investor said undervalues the Vision Fund’s holdings in companies including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. Other market participants had speculated that Son would sell some Vision Fund holdings to fund share repurchases.
SoftBank had executed just 16 billion yen of its planned buybacks as of end-March, but Jefferies’ Goyal believes Son has picked up the pace this month. The analyst estimates the company may repurchase about 250 billion yen of its own stock every month through next January, accounting for about 17% of the trading volume in SoftBank Group shares.
“That’s an extremely powerful tailwind,” he said.
While the size of the buyback plan can’t be ignored, selling down lucrative investments to cover damage from loss makers is somewhat of a double-edged sword. Alibaba currently accounts for 65% of SoftBank’s shareholder value, by the Japanese company’s own calculations.
“A cut-down in Alibaba stock will mean weaker equity value” for SoftBank, said Masahiko Ishino, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Securities.
Still, Bernstein’s Lane says details on the asset sale plan will serve as a further catalyst for the stock. He estimates that while total assets will fall, total shares will fall faster.
Depending on the amount of capital gains tax paid by SoftBank on asset sales, “we estimate 15 – 30% upside in equity value per share,” he said. “Probably the only real risk right now is, they’ve announced a buyback but they don’t have the cash.”

127,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2020 06:00PM ET</span>","After betting its future on Boeing, jetmaker Embraer scrambles for elusive plan B","By Marcelo Rochabrun, Tim Hepher and Rodrigo Viga Gaier
SAO PAULO/PARIS (Reuters) - Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) has been thrust into an uncertain future with no immediate plan B, while not ruling out seeking a bailout after  Boeing Co  (N:BA) jettisoned a $4.2 billion commercial aerospace tie-up amid the coronavirus crisis.
The company's shell-shocked chief executive, in the job for a year with little aerospace experience, sought to rally staff after the board held late-night talks to review the collapse of plans for surviving mounting aerospace competition.
""Our history is full of difficult moments, and we have overcome all of them,"" Francisco Gomes Neto told Embraer's 20,000 staff before giving them a thumbs up.
But Embraer now faces a historic crisis with its isolation reinforced by the breakup - two years after Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) absorbed Embraer's main competitor, the Canadian-designed A220.
""For Embraer, it could be very damaging,"" said Teal Group consultant Richard Aboulafia, noting it was the only significant independent jetmaker.
""It's hard to pressure your suppliers when the volume you're offering is a fraction of your competition's"".
Embraer's immediate aim is to reassure investors. It pledged cost savings and said it had solid liquidity.
It also tore up arguments previously used to persuade unions and regulators to back the deal, saying it could survive without Boeing rather than stating the deal would be its ""salvation"".
The former state-owned company has not asked for a bailout but says it is open to ""complementary"" sources of financing.
Brazilian companies, including airlines and automakers, are in bailout discussions.
Embraer ""will need strong government support to recover the (separation) expenses and recover from the economic crisis caused by coronavirus,"" said Aurelio Valporto, who heads minority shareholder group Abradin and opposed the deal.
Embraer had two main pitches for investors that have now vanished. 
First, it would pay $1.6 billion in dividends from the sale. Second, it would receive enough cash to wipe debts clean and rejuvenate defense and executive-jet units. As a revamped company, Embraer would get a fresh start. 
Executives also hoped Boeing's marketing would be a silver bullet for the commercial arm, to be 80%-owned by Boeing.
Instead, Embraer now has a crisis committee that meets daily and no end in sight for its troubles. 
That, analysts say, could not come at a worse time.
Sales of its E2 have lagged. Overall jet demand has vanished due to coronavirus. Now, crashing oil prices have further weakened the case for new jets, sold mainly on fuel efficiency. 
CHINA WILD CARD
Questions have also been raised over how long high-profile Embraer jetliner CEO John Slattery, who aggressively marketed the E2 jet while lobbying for regulatory approval, will stay without the deal. He did not respond to a request to comment.
In a Twitter post, he said, ""Despite this uncertain period in our industry, I’m confident Embraer will emerge stronger.""
On the positive side, analysts expect demand for small jets like the A220 or Embraer's E2 to lead any future rebound.
The breakup may also spark a distracting legal battle. 
In Brazil, alarm bells rang when Boeing lawyers began quizzing Brazilian counterparts on paperwork in recent weeks.
Industry sources said Boeing needed room to maneuver as it seeks U.S. government support for the U.S. aerospace industry. With the crisis expected to resurrect economic barriers, it was seen in a corner over moves to acquire thousands of Brazilian engineers while drawing up plans to lay off its own staff.
""You can't easily go to Congress and ask for support and spend the money on an acquisition,"" a senior source said.
Embraer says Boeing scuppered the deal on technicalities because of its own financial problems. Boeing says it pulled out only because Embraer failed to meet conditions. But the row itself could be damaging.
""Since it came apart in such vitriolic fashion, it's hard to believe they can pick up the pieces and try again,"" Jerrold Lundquist, managing director of The Lundquist Group, said. 
That leaves limited options for Embraer though none has been discussed as a serious plan B.
One potential wild card is China, which almost beat Airbus to the A220 program and which remains on the hunt for ways of accelerating its own aerospace ambitions.
""From a strategic point of view, it is an option but it could be politically problematic,"" Lundquist said.
Members of the inner circle of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro have repeatedly attacked China over coronavirus.
The breakup also leaves uncertainty for Embraer employees, many of whom were expected to work on future Boeing programs.
Embraer had already furloughed more than 90% of its main Brazil plant due to the crisis.
It had also spent $30 million on a new headquarters as it prepared to carve out the commercial unit.

""Our teams were working together, deciding things together. There were thousands of people working on joint decisions, all for it to end this way,"" a person close to the discussions said.

128,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2020 01:30PM ET</span>",European carmakers restart production as coronavirus lockdowns ease,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) will restart production at its Wolfsburg factory in Germany on Monday, the latest of a fleet of European carmakers to take advantage of eased coronavirus lockdown rules to resume manufacturing.
VW, the world's largest car manufacturer, is celebrating the reopening of its biggest plant, in Wolfsburg, by projecting a cartoon of a VW logo squashing coronaviruses. 
Encouraged by a fall in infection rates, Germany has allowed small retail stores to reopen, provided they adhere to strict distancing and hygiene rules. Now large corporations are following suit.
BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and VW are banking on Germany’s ability to trace and contain the new coronavirus, and a healthcare system capable of extensive testing to identify possible carriers of the disease.
This stands in stark contrast to the United States, where the head of the United Auto Workers union said on Thursday it was ""too soon and too risky"" to reopen auto plants in early May, citing insufficient coronavirus testing.
European factories have changed work patterns, to incorporate more rigorous hygiene and cleaning intervals as well as more generous spacing between workers.
As part of Volkswagen's cartoon, the VW logo celebrates with a ""thumbs-up"" after defeating the virus.
""On Monday, the German auto industry is back. We at Volkswagen have used the five-week pause to prepare ourselves for restarting production,"" said VW works council chief Bernd Osterloh.
BMW says it is cranking up engine manufacturing starting this Monday. BMW wants to reopen its British plant in Goodwood and its Spartanburg, South Carolina on May 4, followed by Dingolfing, Germany and San Luis Potosi in Mexico on May 11, depending on market demand, the carmaker said.
Other plants in Leipzig, Regensburg, and Rosslyn South Africa will open after May 18, starting with a one-shift system the carmaker said. BMW's factory in Shenyang, China has been producing since Feb. 17. 
Workers need to wear masks and keep a distance to one another. The seating order on BMW factory buses has been changed, as has the process for entering and exiting the bus.
Workers need to come to the plant already wearing their factory clothes, to avoid time stuck in changing rooms, and designated pathways in the plant have been altered to ensure there is ""one-way"" traffic only, BMW said.
Mercedes-Benz plants in Sindelfingen and Bremen are also making preparations to ramp up production.
Unlike Italy and Spain, Germany never banned car production, though factories came to a standstill after authorities restricted the movement of people and ordered the closure of car dealerships, hitting demand.
FiatChrysler will open its Sevel plant in central Italy on Monday, with plans to resume production at a rate of between 70%-80%.
In France, Toyota this week restarted an assembly plant in Valenciennes and  Renault  (PA:RENA) began producing engines at its factory in Cleon, west of Paris. It will be followed by Renault’s Flins plant, west of Paris, where only 25% of the workforce is due to resume work. 
Sweden’s Volvo Cars reopened its Torslanda factory this week after overhauling its production processes.

""The economy has come to a halt in Europe. A vaccine will take a long long time. It is important to restart in a safe way. Hopefully we can contribute to a normalization,” Volvo cars Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson told Reuters.

Rolf Muetzenich, parliamentary party leader of junior coalition partners the Social Democrats, demanded a say in the running of the company in return for financial aid.
""If companies such as Lufthansa receive billions of euros in state aid from taxpayers' money, the federal government must also be guaranteed a say in the matter,"" he told the Bild newspaper.
Joachim Pfeiffer, from Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), said the company must retain the freedom to make ""structural adjustments"" to remain competitive worldwide.
And Hans Michelbach, from the CDU's Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU), said the government should not intervene in the firm's management, but be a silent partner.
""The necessary later exit from the state holding will be made even more difficult if the state is involved in the management of the company,"" he said.
Reuters reported last week that Lufthansa aims to finalise a state aid rescue package worth up to 10 billion euros ($10.82 billion) this week, people close to the matter said.
The package will consist of equity from Germany's new economic stabilisation fund (ESF), state-guaranteed loans from Germany and debt supplied by Austria, Switzerland and Belgium, where Lufthansa subsidiaries are based, they added.

Chief Executive Carsten Spohr this month said that Lufthansa would seek state aid in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Belgium, citing cash burn at a rate of 1 million euros per hour, meaning its 4 billion euro cash reserves will be inadequate.

130,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2020 09:20AM ET</span>","Equity valuations rebounding, with bleak earnings a wild card","By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The sharp rebound in equities has pushed widely used measures of valuing U.S. shares to their highest level in years.
Strategists say price-to-earnings ratios could go higher still given monetary stimulus, but huge uncertainty around earnings this year because of the economic fallout from the coronavirus makes for challenges in valuing shares.
Stock prices have risen even as earnings estimates have fallen, lifting multiples that were knocked down in the virus-driven market meltdown. The S&P 500 (SPX) has recovered more than 25% from its March low following a raft of global stimulus and, more recently, after COVID-19 infections showed signs of peaking in parts of the United States.
The S&P 500's P/E ratio, based on earnings estimates for the next four quarters, is now at 20.1, the highest in at least 15 years, according to IBES data from Refinitiv as of Friday. That's up from about 14 just last month.
The forward P/E for Europe's STOXX 600 (STOXX) is at 14.6, not far from the 15.3 level it reached on Feb. 26, and well above its recent low of 11.1 in March, based on Refinitiv's data.
Meanwhile, analysts expect earnings for S&P 500 companies to drop 17.9% in 2020 from the previous year, the IBES data shows. That is much steeper than the 3.5% decline estimated at the start of the month.
""In certain cases, the valuations are not necessarily showing the true picture,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. 
First-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to have declined 14.8% from the year-ago quarter, while second-quarter earnings are forecast to fall 33.3%.
Analysts' earnings expectations could fall further, giving investors further reason to question current multiples.
Strategists see problems with European equity valuations as well.
""The P may be a little bit higher but not too stretched,"" said Michael Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. ""It's more that, it's that the E is probably too optimistic.""
Referring to the current forward P/E for European equities, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists wrote in a note: ""If we think that the bottom-up consensus is too high, then this is pretty meaningless."" 
Figuring out the extent to which the virus outbreak has hurt corporate profits has been difficult for analysts since many companies have been pulling guidance.
But the Federal Reserve's stimulus could pave the way for even higher multiples.

""The Fed has picked up the mantle of 'whatever it takes,' and so has Congress,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey. ""So between monetary and fiscal policy, they have crossed into each other's realms to help cushion the economy, so the economy can come back as quickly as possible.""

""In China alone, we sold around 50,000 vehicles again in March. That makes us confident,"", said Markus Schaefer, managing board member for production, told Bild am Sonntag newspaper.
Mercedes-Benz delivered a total of approximately 477,400 passenger cars worldwide between January and March. The report did not say how many of those went to customers in China, who bought 694,200 Mercedes-Benz cars last year, 29% of total sales.
Starting Monday, cars are set to roll off Daimler's assembly line again in Germany. The Sindelfingen and Bremen passenger-car plants will start production of E- and S-Class vehicles. 
China is the largest market for the S-Class built in Sindelfingen. Normally several hundred vehicles roll off the assembly line in Sindelfingen every day. 
""We won't reach this number right away when production starts next week,"" said Schaefer.

Daimler reported a plunge of nearly 70% in first-quarter operating profit on Thursday due to the pandemic and warned that the cash flow it uses to pay dividends would fall this year.

The lender’s estimate of losses to customers across China increased from about 600 million yuan in the middle of last week as more information was gathered from its over 10,000 outlets, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter. The number isn’t final and subject to further changes as the lender examines the data from its branches, one of the people said.
The losses stem from the bank settling May West Texas Intermediate contracts that underpinned its “Crude Oil Treasure” product on April 20 at minus $37.63 a barrel, leaving Bank of China customers caught in the middle of oil’s unprecedented collapse below zero. Hundreds have taken to the Internet to protest the lender’s handling of the contract rollover and to demand it shoulder some of the losses.
Bank of China declined to comment. It hasn’t disclosed the size or performance of “Crude Oil Treasure” since launching the product in January 2018.
Bank of China suspended trading in the product last week. China’s biggest banks including China Construction Bank Corp. and Bank of Communications Co. also halted sales of similar vehicles that had become a popular way for individuals to speculate on swings in oil.
More than 60,000 clients have invested in Bank of China’s product, Caixin reported, adding that investors have lost their margins of 4.2 billion and owed the bank a further 5.8 billion yuan.

133,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 26, 2020 02:09AM ET</span>",Factories Fire Up in Europe to Pull Economy Back From the Abyss,"(Bloomberg) --
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG is rebooting plants, Airbus SE is up and running and U.K. builders will soon be erecting homes again as Europe starts returning to work after coronavirus shutdowns plunged the region into its worst economic slump in living memory.
Factory doors are reopening after nations from Denmark to Germany began easing restrictions on public life, with Italy, France and Spain to follow. But it won’t be a sudden return to business as usual. Companies will have to implement social distancing and hygiene measures to keep workers safe, after the pandemic claimed more than 110,000 lives in the region.
The restart is crucial to pull the European economy out of a tailspin that’s forced governments to pledge hundreds of billions of euros to keep companies afloat. Measures of private-sector business activity plummeted to an all-time low in April, with record job cuts. Even in Germany, the nation that may weather the crisis best, business sentiment is “catastrophic,” according to the Ifo research institute.
But while shutting down factories is relatively easy, ramping them up again is more complicated because even small kinks in the supply chain can cause major disruptions, said Michael Groemling, an analyst at the Cologne-based German Economic Institute.
“What complicates matters even more is that no one knows for sure how demand in the key markets in Europe and the U.S. will shape up in the coming months,” Groemling said by phone.
PSA Group, for one, isn’t saying when it will reopen European factories. The maker of Peugeot, Citroen and Opel automobiles said there’s no point in building up inventories while sales are dormant. “It’s important to have dealership and sales activity before we push the button,” Chief Financial Officer Philippe de Rovira told analysts.
While the extent of the reboot differs by country (Portugal, for example, has allowed most factories to keep running throughout the crisis), it’s happening gradually. Moving too quickly, or carelessly, risks contributing to a second wave of infections that would turn the recovery effort on its head. And some segments of the economy -- think bars and restaurants, air travel or movie-going -- will probably remain disrupted for some time.
Read more: Europe Grapples With Lockdowns as Cases Drop and Economies Reel
Europe’s car industry, which accounts for about 14 million jobs across the region, is eager to get back to work, even though it’s unclear whether buyers will return to showrooms once lockdowns are lifted.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, the Italian-American carmaker, will restart production at its Sevel light van plant in southern Italy and resume some operations at other factories across the country on Monday.  Ferrari NV  (NYSE:RACE) plans to reopen its Maranello and Modena factories in northern Italy on May 4.
Volkswagen, the world’s largest automaker, resumed production of its new ID.3 electric car at a factory in Zwickau, Germany, on Thursday, saying it expects to start European deliveries of the vehicle this summer as planned.
 Renault  SA (PA:RENA) began a gradual ramp-up in France last week, starting with three engine and parts factories and as little as a quarter of employees. It’s providing safety measures such as protective gear, temperature monitoring and extra cleaning. The company has already reopened plants in countries including Spain, Portugal, Morocco and Russia.
Most carmakers aren’t revving up all their factories at once, and those that restore output are expected to run assembly lines at slower rates until demand climbs back toward pre-crisis levels.
Keep Building
The U.K.’s largest homebuilders have drawn up plans to resume work starting this week after implementing a widespread shutdown last month in response to the outbreak.  Persimmon  (LON:PSN) Plc will begin a phased restart from April 27 and  Taylor Wimpey  (LON:TW) Plc plans to resume work in May after drafting new guidelines for workers on how to maintain social distancing during construction work.
Construction materials companies including  CRH  (LON:CRH) Plc and Marshalls Plc have both furloughed workers to cope with the slowdown, but have continued to supply some customers and will gradually ramp up to meet demand.
Commercial projects including the redevelopment of the former Whiteleys shopping mall in London managed to avoid shutdowns because they could maintain social distancing with just heavy machinery and few staff on site. Projects closer to completion, like the city’s Twenty Two Bishopsgate skyscraper, had been forced to temporarily suspend work because it’s harder to keep workers apart when fitting out an almost completed office building.
In Spain, one of the countries in Europe hardest hit by the virus, most large developers, including Aedas Homes, have resumed construction after the government imposed a two-week lockdown at the end of March.
Planes, Trains, Ships
Planemakers that were in a race to increase production before the crisis are now faced with a plunge in demand for their aircraft, with over 60% of the world’s fleet grounded and airlines delaying orders.
European manufacturer Airbus, which earlier this month cut its output target for the year and warned it may have to eliminate jobs, adjusted or halted production at sites in the U.K., France, Spain and Germany in March and April to account for the drop in demand and implement health and safety measures.
Airbus has since resumed its European manufacturing, albeit at a lower rate. It divided up workers in red and blue teams who use different routes to enter and exit buildings, turned cafeterias into takeaway restaurants and introduced temperature screenings. Its assembly sites in Canada and the U.S. are still on hold.
Spanish train-maker Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles SA began operating again on April 20 after downing tools for nearly five weeks. The company reached an agreement with workers to make up the lost hours of production by the first quarter of 2021. It’s carrying out strict protocols at its three main plants in Spain with 15 staggered shifts starting at 5.45 a.m., temperature checks of workers and the use of gloves, masks and disinfectants.
Shipbuilder Fincantieri SpA resumed part of its production on April 20 at its eight Italian shipyards, but with only 10% of staff working on average, a spokesman said. The company plans to gradually add more workers starting May 4 to reach full capacity in early June.
Production restarts are set to lift energy consumption, which stumbled because of the restrictions to contain the virus. Those curbs cut European electricity demand to the lowest in almost 12 years, pushing prices in a few markets below zero at some times of the day. Italian oil major Eni SpA cut its production forecast for the year on Friday after the benchmark U.S. oil contract turned negative for the first time ever.
With factories working again, utilities including Germany’s RWE AG (DE:RWEG), Italy’s  Enel  (MI:ENEI) SpA and France’s Electricite de France SA (PA:EDF) will restore generation capacity that’s been offline.

""Because of significant costs to our business caused by unprecedented market conditions which the COVID-19 crisis has brought with it, we are exploring all available options to obtain additional external funding,"" she said.
She said talks with the British government were ""ongoing and constructive.""
Virgin Atlantic is based in Britain and is 51% owned by Branson's Virgin group and 49% owned by U.S. airline Delta (N:DAL).
The pandemic has lead to a massive fall in global air travel demand. Australia's second-biggest airline  Virgin Australia  Holdings (AX:VAH), which is a part of Virgin Group, has already succumbed to third-party led restructuring that could lead to a sale.
Earlier in the week, Branson had said that Virgin Atlantic would only survive the outbreak if it gets financial support from the UK government.
""This would be in the form of a commercial loan – it wouldn't be free money and the airline would pay it back,"" Branson said in a blog post to staff last Monday.
In its report, the Sunday Telegraph quoted sources as saying that Lansdowne Partners, Singapore sovereign wealth fund Temasek and Northill Capital were among the investors interested in rescuing the airline. U.S. based Centerbridge Partners and Cerberus Capital Management were also in discussions, it said.
The interested companies can offer to structure a rescue by injecting debt, equity or convertible loans, which could leave Branson with no residual stake in the airline, according to the sources cited in the report.
The deal options also include putting the company into administration, it added.

136,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2020 08:00PM ET</span>",U.S. airlines receive extra $9.5 billion in payroll support: U.S. Treasury,"By Jonathan Landay and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said on Saturday it has released $9.5 billion in additional funds from the Payroll Support Program to U.S. air carriers, bringing to $12.4 billion the total provided to the airline sector hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.
In total, the government has disbursed grant funds to 10 major airlines and 83 smaller carriers.
Congress approved $25 billion in grants for payroll assistance for passenger airlines. Treasury required major airlines receiving more than $100 million in assistance to repay 30% in low-interest loans over 10 years and issue warrants equal to 10% of the loan amount.
Airlines must not cut pay or jobs through Sept. 30 as a condition of the grants and are barred from buying back stock or paying dividends and face restrictions on executive compensation.
 SkyWest  Inc (O:SKYW) Chief Executive Chip Childs told employees on Friday the airline expects to receive $438 million from Treasury in payroll assistance. 
""There is still much about the future and recovery that remains uncertain, and there is a very real possibility that we could be a smaller airline by the end of the year,"" he wrote in a email seen by Reuters.
The four largest U.S. carriers are receiving $19.2 billion in total out of the $25 billion -  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL), United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV).
Treasury is awarding major carriers 50% of the grant funds initially and then releasing the remainder through July. 
Treasury said additional money will continue to be provided to approved applicants ""on a rolling basis.""
The department is still reviewing how to award $4 billion in grants to cargo carriers and $3 billion to airport contractors such as caterers.
Cargo carriers that receive $50 million or less of payroll support and contractors that receive $37.5 million or less ""will not be required to provide financial instruments as appropriate compensation"" for support, the department said.
The Treasury Department also published on Saturday the application form for companies deemed critical to maintaining national security seeking loans from a $17 billion fund.
The fund has been mentioned as a potential source of funds for  Boeing Co  (N:BA), which declined to say on Friday whether it would apply. Treasury said it wants companies to apply by May 1.
Treasury has an additional $25 billion in loans it can award to passenger airlines and $4 billion in cargo loans. Some airlines, including American, Delta and Alaska Airlines (N:ALK), have already applied.
Airlines may still need more money as U.S. air travel demand has fallen by 95% and shows no sign of improving. 
On Friday, President Donald Trump said the U.S. government could pre-buy airplane tickets at a steep discount of 50% or more for travel for the next four or five years. ""You infuse them with some cash. And in the meantime, we're flying the people of our country for ... a fraction of the cost,"" he said.

Airlines for America, a trade group representing major U.S. airlines, declined to comment.

Tesla had suspended production at its Fremont, California plant on March 24. The company had previously said that it planned to resume normal operations on May 4, a day after the Bay Area's shelter-in-place order is scheduled to be lifted.
However, San Francisco Mayor London Breed on Friday said that it was likely the Bay Area's stay-at-home order will get extended beyond the current expiration date of May 3, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Tesla supervisors told some staff in the paint and stamping operations at the California factory to report to the facility on April 29, the Bloomberg report https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-25/tesla-is-calling-some-california-plant-workers-back-next-week?sref=y3YMCJ4e said.

138,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2020 03:00PM ET</span>",Embraer hits out after Boeing scraps $4.2 billion tie-up,"By Marcelo Rochabrun, Tim Hepher and Tatiana Bautzer
SAO PAULO/PARIS (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) on Saturday pulled out of a $4.2 billion deal to buy Embraer's (SA:EMBR3) commercial jets division, sparking a furious response from its jilted partner and leaving plans for a U.S.-Brazil alliance from regional jets to jumbos in tatters.
The collapse, first reported by Reuters, came hours after a midnight deadline expired with no agreement on how to implement a deal first aired in 2018, partially in response to a similar Canadian acquisition by Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR). 
Boeing accused Embraer of failing to meet conditions for closing the transaction, but Embraer said Boeing had torpedoed it because of wider financial problems it faces as a result of the coronavirus crisis and the grounding of its 737 MAX.
""Embraer believes strongly that Boeing has wrongfully terminated the (agreement,)"" the Brazilian company said.
Boeing struck a more emollient tone but behind the scenes, both sides were bracing for months of argument over the breakup.
""Over the past several months, we had productive but ultimately unsuccessful negotiations ... We all aimed to resolve those by the initial termination date, but it didn't happen,"" Boeing senior vice-president Marc Allen said in a statement. 
The rift halts the second half of a major reshaping of the global duopoly between Boeing and Airbus as both companies sought to expand into regional jets. Airbus bought the Canadian CSeries in 2018 and renamed it A220, which has sold well.
Industry sources say Boeing was interested in Embraer mainly for access to lower-cost engineers and new manufacturing options, but it is now pondering cutting 10% of its workforce while also seeking U.S. federal help for the aerospace sector.
The feud also breaks a previously close relationship between two of the world's top three planemakers, who have adopted similar positions on trade battles with Europe and Canada.
""This is not the kind of statement you see very often in this industry,"" Teal Group consultant Richard Aboulafia said.
The deal calls for a $100 million breakup fee but Embraer is poised to sue Boeing for significantly more, alleging that the long period of uncertainty has hampered sales of its E2 jets.
It said it would pursue ""all remedies"" against Boeing, without elaborating.
FINANCIAL, PAPERWORK DISPUTES
In addition to the deal on commercial aviation, a separate joint-venture to find new markets for Embraer's KC-390 military cargo plane is also off. But a more simple agreement to ""market and support"" the KC-390 signed in 2012 will remain.
The prospect of an abrupt collapse was first reported by Reuters on Friday after sources reported slow progress in talks with hours left before a midnight cut-off.
On Saturday, plans for simultaneous announcements were abandoned after Reuters quoted sources as saying Boeing had notified Embraer late on Friday that it would refuse to extend the midnight deadline, effectively blocking the deal. 
People familiar with the matter said Boeing had raised objections during talks about funding and legal matters, which Embraer regarded as a deliberate bid to frustrate the deal. 
Others said the dispute revolved around how much Embraer had invested in the commercial aerospace unit pending a final deal, as well as the progress of technical and contractual paperwork.
Embraer said it had met its commitments.
The deal had already faced antitrust hiccups but sources close to the talks said these did not ultimately wreck the deal. While the transaction received antitrust approvals from most countries, the European Union delayed a decision until August.

Analysts expect Embraer, which has called the tie-up crucial for its future, to move quickly to reassure investors over its finances. It ended 2019 with $2.3 billion in cash.

139,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2020 02:21PM ET</span>","Here's why you can't find frozen fries, while U.S. farmers are sitting on tons of potatoes","By Lisa Baertlein
(Reuters) - Shopper Lexie Mayewski is having a hard time finding frozen french fries in Washington, D.C.-area supermarkets in the wake of coronavirus-fueled stockpiling. 
On the other side of the country, Washington state farmer Mike Pink is weighing whether to plow under 30,000 tons of potatoes worth millions of dollars that would have been turned into french fries for fast-food chains like McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), Wendy's Co and Chick-fil-A.
Their incongruent experiences underscore how America's highly specialized and inflexible retail and foodservice supply chains are contributing to food shortages and waste in the wake of demand disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic that has killed almost 50,000 people in the United States.
Frozen french fry sales at grocery stores spiked 78.6% for the four-week period ended April 4, according to Nielsen data, resulting in shortages at many U.S. supermarkets. 
Mayewski, 25, a construction manager, has not seen frozen fries at the Giant Food or Safeway supermarkets near her Maryland home. 
""There's not a single french fry to be found,"" said Mayewski, whose supply of frozen shoestring and waffle fries was running low. 
Frozen fries are an ideal pandemic staple - offering comfort, convenience and long-shelf life for U.S. families accustomed to fast-food meals and school cafeteria lunches. 
The main hurdle is the extra-large size of foodservice packages that are meant for kitchens that turn out dozens if not hundreds of meals each day. 
""Think Costco, but bigger,"" said International Foodservice Distributors Association (IFDA) CEO Mark Allen, referring to the oversized products sold at warehouse retailer Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST).
Nondescript foodservice packaging also does not have the ingredient and nutrition labels required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the bar codes needed in grocery checkout lanes. 
While the FDA has said it would temporarily relax labeling rules and protect consumers with food allergies, foodservice suppliers still face significant hurdles switching to retail-friendly formats. New equipment for packing and labeling product is expensive, and plastic containers are in short supply. 
FREEZERS FULL OF FRIES
Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co's Ore-Ida, the main producer of frozen fries for supermarkets, is rushing to bolster supplies. 
""Our Ore-Ida factory is running at full capacity to keep up with demand,"" Kraft spokesman Michael Mullen said. 
At the same time, major fast-food french fry suppliers McCain Foods, J.R. Simplot Co and Lamb Weston Holdings Inc are canceling potato orders. 
Fast-food suppliers' freezers are full of frozen fries, hash browns and potato skins and their storage sheds are packed with potatoes, farmers and experts told Reuters. 
Their demand is down because four in 10 U.S. restaurants are closed, as are schools, hotels and workplaces. Fast-food chains are doing drive-through only, and with no set date for lifting stay-at-home orders, the outlook for the foodservice industry is dim. 
Lamb Weston, McCain and Simplot - which supply the lion's share of McDonald's french fries - did not respond to requests for comment. Lamb Weston also does retail sales.
Pink, who farms near Pasco, Washington, said fast-food french fry suppliers canceled orders for 1,000 acres of potatoes. He has already invested $2.5 million on those crops. Each acre produces roughly 30 tons of potatoes and getting them ready for sale would cost Pink another $1.5 million. He may have to plow the potatoes under - adding to food destruction in the U.S. produce and dairy sectors. 
""Do I continue to invest or do I stop and try to minimize my loss?"" asked Pink. ""It's just devastating."" 
The National Potato Council said there are $750 million to $1.3 billion in potatoes and potato products clogged in the pipeline. 
""It's a huge challenge. Nobody was prepared. Nobody could imagine that this could happen,"" Rabobank food analyst JP Frossard said.
Grocery consultants and retailers told Reuters that foodservice products like toilet paper, cleaning supplies and meat have found their way into the retail channel, while many others have not. 
Compounding problems, most foodservice operators do not have connections at supermarkets - where adding a new product can take several months. 

""It would be a Herculean task,"" Allen said of rerouting supplies. And with all the uncertainty around demand, he added, ""the investment would be tough to justify.""

140,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2020 11:35AM ET</span>",Proxy advisers recommend Boeing shareholders vote against key board members,"By Maria Ponnezhath and Kanishka Singh
(Reuters) - Two proxy advisers, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), have recommended that shareholders of  Boeing Co  (N:BA) vote against key board members of the planemaker to show objections to the company's handling of the 737 Max crisis.
Glass Lewis recommended that at Boeing's annual meeting on April 27 shareholders vote against Larry Kellner, the chairman of its board who previously oversaw the board's audit committee.
""We believe the audit committee failed to mitigate the risk posed by management's decisions and should be held accountable for its oversight,"" Glass Lewis said in its recommendation.
In a separate recommendation, ISS advised shareholders to vote against four longtime board members - Arthur Collins, Edmund Giambastiani, Susan Schwab and Ronald Williams (NYSE:WMB) - who had served when the 737 MAX was being developed and rolled out.
ISS also said that a vote for newly named Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun is ""warranted, with caution"" and that he will need to show that he can be an ""effective leader of cultural change"" at the company.
The recommendations, issued earlier in April and viewed by Reuters, were reported first by the Wall Street Journal on Friday.
A Boeing spokesman said the planemaker is continuing to learn from the 737 Max crashes and is taking actions to rebuild trust.
Proxy advisers recommend how investors should vote in corporate elections and cast ballots on behalf of some asset managers. The role of proxy advisers has gained more attention in recent years as they have grown more influential.
Boeing, which has been struggling to get its 737 MAX aircraft flying again following two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, has been forced to cut production due to falling demand amid the coronavirus pandemic. And on Saturday, the company said it had canceled a $4.2 billion deal to buy the commercial jets division of Brazil's Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3). 

The Chicago-based company suspended 737 MAX deliveries in March 2019, when the Federal Aviation Administration grounded the aircraft following the deaths of 346 people in crashes of two 737 MAX planes operated by Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines.

The airline, which has seen its passenger numbers tumble as it has slashed 90% of its international flights and 60% of domestic flights, has tapped its main lenders Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (T:8306), Mizuho Financial Group (T:8411) and other banks for extra funding, NHK said, citing unnamed sources.
It was also considering securing special emergency funding from the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ), it added. 
The airline was not immediately available for comment.
Global airlines are struggling to pay fixed costs as the majority of their planes have been grounded due to traveling restrictions put in place to control the spread of the coronavirus.
Japan's government has promised financial support for the country's airlines as part of a coronavirus stimulus package equivalent to a fifth of Japan's annual GDP, although it has yet to say how much they will receive.
JAL and its rival ANA Holdings Inc (T:9202) are not government owned, but ties with regulators are close, with officials and politicians willing to extend financial help in troubled times to support a domestic aviation network which connects an island archipelago stretching almost 3,000 kilometers (1,800 miles).

Earlier this month, Reuters reported that ANA is seeking a $2.8 billion credit line from the DBJ, and is working with private banks to bring forward $930 million in borrowing that had been scheduled for June.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to block federal aid for the U.S. Postal Service unless it raises shipping rates for online companies like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), prompting criticism that the move would hurt consumers relying more than usual on packages during the coronavirus outbreak.
The president has long accused the post office of charging too little for packages, saying that deliveries for Amazon and others cost the service money. Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post newspaper, which Trump has accused of unfair coverage of his administration.
""The Postal Service is a joke. Because they're handing out packages for Amazon and other internet companies, and every time they bring a package, they lose money on it,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. ""The Post Office should raise the price of a package by approximately four times.""
The president also accused post office officials of being ""very cozy"" with big online merchants.
Trump made the remarks at a ceremony to sign a $484 billion coronavirus relief bill designed to help small businesses and hospitals and assist in testing for the virus, which has killed more than 50,000 Americans.
The Postal Service has said that it may not be able to continue service past September without help. The U.S. Congress has authorized the Treasury Department to lend it up to $10 billion as part of an earlier $2.3 trillion coronavirus stimulus package.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who attended Friday's signing, told reporters that his team was meeting with post office officials ""and actually, we are going to put certain criteria for a postal reform program as part of the loan.""
Treasury officials have told top postal service officials that they may ask for changes in how the service manages its finances as part of the loan, including what it charges to deliver packages, The Washington Post reported on Thursday.
Trump told Mnuchin at the event he would not support aid unless the postal service raised its rates. 
""If they don't do it, I'm not signing anything and ... I'm not authorizing you to do anything,"" Trump said.
Later on Friday, the president said that he wanted the post office to be updated but wanted to make sure it would survive.
""I will never let our Post Office fail,"" he tweeted. ""The people that work there are great, and we’re going to keep them happy, healthy, and well!"" 
The Package Coalition, whose members include Amazon, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and others, said that raising prices to deliver packages would mean Americans would pay higher prices.

""Now, when Americans need affordable and reliable package delivery service more than ever, Congress must fight to guarantee emergency relief for the Postal Service and stop this package tax,"" said coalition Chairman John McHugh in an email statement.

143,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 09:15PM ET</span>","Some U.S. companies will keep small business loans, defying backlash","By Hilary Russ and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - Several publicly listed companies worth hundreds of millions of dollars said on Friday they had no plans to return funding they received under a U.S. government program providing emergency loans to small businesses, even though some of their peers have started to do so.
The loans are designed to support smaller businesses - defined as having no more than 500 employees - ranging from hair dressers to landscapers to help cover employee payroll and rent, as large swaths of the economy have been shut down to keep the coronavirus from spreading. 
The U.S. Treasury Department said on Thursday that ""big public companies with access to capital"" would have a hard time proving they really needed the coronavirus relief funds, dubbed Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans. It updated its eligibility criteria, and gave companies that do not qualify until May 7 to return the aid.
A handful of big public companies, some of which had qualified under a loophole in the program that defined the 500-employee limit to each location operated by a single company, responded to the public backlash by saying they were returning their loans. That included Ruth's Hospitality Group Inc (O:RUTH), owner of the Chris Steakhouse chain, investment firm  Manning & Napier Inc  (N:MN) and biotechnology company  Wave Life Sciences Ltd  (O:WVE). Restaurant operators  Shake Shack Inc  (N:SHAK) and  Kura Sushi USA Inc  (O:KRUS) returned loans from an initial tranche of the program.
But others are holding fast.
 MiMedx Group Inc  (PK:MDXG), a manufacturer of biomaterials with a market value of $420 million,  Digimarc Corp  (O:DMRC), a digital watermark provider with a market value of $197 million, and  ZAGG Inc  (O:ZAGG), a maker of screen protectors for mobile devices with a market value of just shy of $100 million, told Reuters on Friday they took the loans because they needed them and planned to keep them.
MiMedx, which took a $10 million loan, said it was in compliance with the Treasury's loans and could not access the capital markets because it was not current in its financial statements.
""COVID-19 has created operating complexities many never imagined. From sourcing material, to guarding our staff's health and maintaining high quality production standards,"" MiMedx said in a statement.
Digimarc, which took a $5 million loan, said it complied with both the guidelines and the spirit of the program. ""We don't know whether the capital markets are open to us until we go there,"" CEO Bruce Davis said.
ZAGG, which took a $9.5 million loan, said it qualified because it met all conditions.
""With extensive retail closures nationwide, our business has been severely impacted during the shutdown of all non-essential businesses due to COVID-19. We are using the money in accordance with government guidelines,"" Zagg said in a statement.
A Treasury spokesman declined comment. 
""The risk that these companies run is that they become the poster child for greed,"" said Chas Hermann, the former chief brand officer at Noodles & Co (O:NDLS) who is now a marketing consultant. ""Shake Shack recognized that quickly and turned it around. It was the best move you could make after you made a really bad move.""

There is more loan money coming. President Donald Trump signed a new $484 billion aid bill on Friday, the fourth passed by lawmakers to address the coronavirus crisis to fund small businesses and hospitals. It includes $310 billion for PPP loans.

144,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 09:10PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Spotlight falls on 'dividend aristocrats' after market tumult,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Companies across a range of industries are slashing or suspending dividends to cope with the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, complicating the stock selection process for money managers eager to buttress their portfolios with a steady stream of income. 
The past week's plunge in oil prices has potentially accelerated that process, raising concerns about the rock-steady dividends of companies such as  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX), which are set to report results on Friday, May 1. 
The S&P 500 dividend aristocrats index (SPDAUDT), which tracks companies that have increased dividends annually for the past 25 years and includes Exxon and Chevron, has fallen about 19% so far in 2020 as of Thursday, greater than the 12.9% drop over that time for the S&P 500 total return index (SPXTR). 
That's bad news for yield-thirsty investors at a time when payouts on U.S Treasuries stand near historic lows as the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates in check to stimulate the economy. The S&P 500's dividend yield recently exceeded the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury (US10YT=RR) by its highest margin in nearly five decades.
“In times like these, financial strength and dividends are two of the critical components in making your investment selections,” said Alan Lancz, president of investment advisory firm Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc. “It’s not just the dividend yield, but the sustainability of that dividend.”
Lancz added to positions in stocks such as UPS (N:UPS), Cisco (O:CSCO) and Merck (N:MRK) during the market's swoon, in part because of those companies' financial strength and dividends.
(GRAPHIC: Dividends dropping - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/gjnvwegxkvw/eikon.png)
Investors have been particularly focused on the energy patch, where a tumble in oil to negative territory for the first time has pressured a broad range of companies. 
Norway's Equinor (OL:EQNR) said on Thursday it was cutting its quarterly dividend by two-thirds as part of an effort to preserve cash, while oil services firm Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) earlier this month slashed its dividend by 75%.
Exxon's dividend yield of 8% and Chevron's of 5.9% are the second- and third-biggest in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) behind only chemical company Dow Inc's (N:DOW) 8.6%, according to Refinitiv data.
Morningstar equity analyst Allen Good said investors are more concerned about Exxon and Chevron's dividends than in the past but payouts appeared to be safe for now. Debt levels for both companies remain relatively low while dividends ""sit high in the financial priorities list"" for management, he said.
AbbVie (N:ABBV), 3M Co (N:MMM) and Aflac (N:AFL), which are in the dividend aristocrats index, are also due to report first-quarter results next week.
Other companies that have recently taken action on their dividends include casino operator  Las Vegas Sands  (N:LVS), cruise operator Carnival Corp (N:CCL) and apparel retailer Gap Inc (N:GPS), which suspended their payouts. 
“This earnings season, where companies have to basically commit to the dividend or not, will determine some potential turnover in the shareholder base,” said Margaret Reid, senior portfolio manager with The Private Bank at Union Bank.
In fact, some companies in areas of the market that have held up well recently raised dividends, including consumer staples companies Costco Wholesale Corp (O:COST) and Procter & Gamble (N:PG) and diversified healthcare company Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ). 
Those companies, however, may be outliers. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expects S&P 500 (SPX) aggregate dividends to fall 23% to $398 billion in 2020 after rising each year over the past decade.

“For some companies to preserve cash flow to ride through the economic downturn, the smart move would be to cut or suspend the dividend now,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist/SunTrust Advisory Services.

146,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 06:55PM ET</span>",AutoNation returning $77 million in U.S. payroll assistance coronavirus relief loans,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AutoNation Inc (N:AN), the largest U.S. auto dealership chain, said on Friday it will return $77 million it received in forgivable loans from the U.S. Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) meant to help struggling small businesses and employees during the coronavirus outbreak.
Marc Cannon, a spokesman for the company, told Reuters that AutoNation was ""clearly eligible and applied on behalf of the 7,000 employees furloughed caused by the COVID-19 crisis.""
He said the company ""intended to rehire all 7,000 associates under the PPP program as encouraged by the government and designed to get individuals back to work.""
AutoNation has implemented cost-cutting measures, including temporary pay cuts for staff, curtailing of advertising expenses and postponing over $50 million of capital expenditures through the second quarter of 2020.
On Thursday, the Small Business Administration issued new guidelines on the program and soon after AutoNation called a board meeting ""and decided to cancel all PPP applications and return all PPP funds"" by May 7.
The loans are forgivable if companies use at least 75% on payroll expenses. AutoNation said it had planned to use all of the funds on payroll.
Cannon confirmed a Washington Post report that said AutoNation had used separate tax identification numbers to apply for at least $266 million in funds for separate dealerships. Cannon emphasized the company had followed the program rules.
Auto dealers have been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic, with some states temporarily barring new vehicle sales. Sales have plummeted amid stay-at-home orders aimed at curbing the spread of the highly contagious virus.
 CarMax Inc  (N:KMX), the nation's largest used-car dealer, had said effective April 18 it was furloughing 15,500 employees, but some have been called back as stores reopen. About 60% of its locations are now fully open. CarMax said on Friday it did not apply for a payroll protection loan.
On Thursday, U.S. companies began refusing government loans they were just awarded, after the Treasury Department said that publicly traded firms would have a hard time proving they really needed the coronavirus relief funds.
Some large well-funded companies were granted millions of dollars from the $350 billion pool of funding, while many small, mom-and-pop shops were unable to access any funding at all, sparking public outrage.
The initial PPP funding was snapped up in less than two weeks. Congress has now approved an additional $310 billion and new loans will be issued again starting next week.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn said he expects to see ""good opportunities"" to buy after the historic stock market sell-off but warned there will likely be more heavy selling because the coronavirus outbreak has yet to be contained.
""There will be good opportunities,"" Icahn said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Friday, adding, however, ""in the short term we could still see some big downdrafts.""
Icahn was speaking at the tail end of a week in which oil prices fell so far that sellers had to pay buyers to take it off their hands, U.S. lawmakers approved a $484 billion bill to aid small businesses and hospitals, and unemployment claims topped 26 million in the last five weeks. Oil prices are no longer in the minus zone. [O/R]
Even as some states are preparing to reopen some businesses that have been largely shuttered for weeks to prevent the virus' spread, Icahn said he thinks the virus can return in ""spurts.""
He warned that people will not be as enthusiastic about returning to normal life while the threat of a deadly disease lingers. ""It is not like turning on a spigot,"" he said.
""Today the risk is too high for the reward in many companies,"" said Icahn, who at age 84 has lived through decades of financial crises.
He said he likes what he calls ""mundane"" companies and said he thinks technology stocks are overvalued. 
This week he made money in the oil market when he urged refiner  CVR Energy Inc  (N:CVI), in which he owns a big stake, to make storage available for sellers who did not know where to put the oil. ""I usually don't micromanage,"" Icahn said, adding he called CVR to say ""we have storage space."" The company has storage capacity for millions of barrels of oil and filled a fraction of that, he said.
He also spoke again about a current favorite trade: a bet against an index of commercial real estate debt that will pay off when large shopping centers default on their debt. The coronavirus, which has shuttered malls, has been helping with that trade. A number of retailers including Neiman Marcus [NMRCUS.UL] and Lord & Taylor are exploring bankruptcy as their stores remain shut.

Icahn declined to discuss  Hertz Global Holdings Inc  (N:HTZ) which has hired debt restructuring advisers, saying only, ""we are on the board there.""

149,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 04:46PM ET</span>",Brazil JBS workers catch COVID-19 in latest meat plant outbreak,"By Ana Mano
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A JBS SA (SA:JBSS3) poultry plant in southern Brazil was hit by an outbreak of COVID-19, a source close to the company said on condition of anonymity on Friday, marking the first large-scale infection at a Brazil-based meat plant.
Affecting several workers at the meat processing facility in the town of Passo Fundo, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, the outbreak follows several others in the United States in recent weeks, including at some JBS-owned plants. 
The plant has not been shut but it is being investigated by the labor prosecutor's office, the source said. A report by news website UOL citing the municipal health authorities said they want the immediate closure of the plant. 
The source denied a report by Brazilian news webiste UOL that two family members of workers had died from the disease, adding that the number of people infected at the facility was ""less than the 19"" that UOL had reported. The source declined to provide an exact number of infected people. 
In a statement responding to queries about the Passo Fundo plant, JBS said it was following guidelines from local health authorities and keeping strict controls at its processing plants, distribution centers and offices to avoid contamination from the novel coronavirus. 
But it declined to comment on the cases of COVID-19 affecting its employees and said nothing specifically about Passo Fundo, which employs a total of 2,600 workers.
As of April 18, that JBS plant had seven confirmed cases of COVID-19, including one person in critical condition, according to a municipal health department statement published by UOL.
Reuters could not reach the department, Passo Fundo officials or the labor prosecutors for comment on the matter.
Some 78 JBS employees at the facility had been removed from work for showing flu symptoms, the department said, according to UOL's website.
JBS declined to comment on calls to close its Passo Fundo plant. 
Noting that food production is considered one of the essential activities authorized to operate even amid coronavirus lockdowns, JBS said it had sought to keep operations running safely.

On Monday, JBS indefinitely closed its Worthington pork plant in Minnesota as the COVID-19 began to affect employees of meat facilities across the United States.

The news of some of the company's 1,700 employees at the plant testing positive comes a day after a worker advocacy group sued Smithfield over working conditions at a Missouri plant, where the group said employees have been forced to work ""shoulder to shoulder"" during the pandemic.
More than 5,000 U.S. meat and food-processing workers have been infected with or exposed to the new coronavirus, and 13 have died, the country's largest meatpacking union said on Thursday.
To contain the virus spread, other companies such as  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) have also shuttered some pork plants, but the closures are adding to stress for farmers who are losing markets for their pigs.
Smithfield, owned by China's WH Group Ltd (HK:0288), said the Monmouth plant represents about 3% of U.S. fresh pork supplies.

(Reuters) - Industrial materials maker DuPont (N:DD) is doubling production of protective garments it makes from its Tyvek material to about 30 million a month to help meet increased demand due to the coronavirus outbreak.
The spread of the pandemic across Europe and the United States has led to a worldwide scramble for protective masks, gowns and gloves worn by healthcare and other workers battling to curb the spread of the virus.
Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security estimated this month that a single 100-day COVID-19 wave would create a need for 321 million more isolation gowns, such as those made by Dupont, in the United States alone.
Before the coronavirus crisis, the global market for personal protective equipment (PPE) was valued at about $40 billion annually, with Dupont and U.S. peers Honeywell International Inc (N:HON) and 3M Co (N:MMM) among the biggest players. That will now increase.
""We're producing up to almost two times the number of garments per month to help support the demand that's currently in front of us,"" John Richard, vice president of DuPont's safety business told Reuters.
DuPont's Tyvek, a fabric used in gowns and coveralls for protective use, has been a silver lining for the company as it faces steep declines in demand for its products in the auto sector and other industries hammered by the virus outbreak.
The company pulled its full-year forecast on Monday, but estimated first-quarter profit would top Wall Street estimates on demand for products such as Tyvek and those used in water filtration.
The industrial giant, a top player in the PPE market with other products such as protective gloves, flame-resistant and chemical protective clothing, said everything it was producing was being sold promptly.
The company expects the heightened demand to continue at least until later this year as industries resume operations and bring back workers using additional safety measures. DuPont, which makes Tyvek in Richmond, Virginia and Luxembourg, has re-purposed its manufacturing operations and simplified some designs to eke out more pieces per square area of the fabric.
Dow (N:DOW), part of the erstwhile DowDupont conglomerate before a split last year, has also started making sanitizers and face shields to meet growing demand.

Investing.com – The Dow snapped a two-week winning streak despite closing higher on Friday, led by a Facebook-infused rally in tech stocks ahead of major tech earnings due next week.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.11%, the S&P 500 rose 1.39%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.65%.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) closed 2.7% higher after rolling out a group video chat feature called Messenger Rooms as the social media giant looks to cash in on the ramp-up in demand for video conferences amid lockdown measures.
 Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) reversed gains to end down 6%.
With major tech earnings hitting the tape next week, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) also ended higher.
Chip stocks also played a role in the rally, as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) cuts its losses, rising 0.3%.
Intel reported earnings that topped estimates, but the chipmaker pulled its guidance, stoking concerns its future growth is more likely to ease rather than accelerate.
The surge in tech stocks, however, was unable to prevent the broader market from falling to its first weekly loss in three weeks following declines earlier in the week amid a historical plunge in oil prices.
Oil prices settled 2.7% higher, though still ended the week 7% lower after settling in negative for the first time ever on Monday.
Adding to the surge in jobless claims earlier this week, a slump in U.S. durable goods orders provided further evidence the economic downturn will likely be severe.
U.S. durable goods orders fell by 14.4% last month, the biggest slide since 2014, led by waning demand for big-ticket items such as cars and a slump in orders for Boeing (NYSE:BA) passenger planes.
The weaker-than-expected data come just as President Donald Trump signed the $484 billion coronavirus stimulus package into law to ease the Covid-19 hit to the economy at a time when some states are set to reopen.
But with worries over the pandemic still running high, some of the biggest companies are wary of opening for business, with Macy’s (NYSE:M), Gap (NYSE:GPS), and TGI Fridays choosing to remain shuttered in states such as Georgia and South Carolina."

(Reuters) - Wall Street rallied on Friday, led higher by Apple and Microsoft as investors finished a turbulent week of trading and some states prepared to relax coronavirus-related lockdowns.
Apple (O:AAPL) and Microsoft (O:MSFT) each climbed more than 1%, lifting the S&P 500 more than any other companies. The two tech titans are on tap to report their March-quarter results next week, giving investors a glimpse at how the pandemic has affected their global businesses.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) tumbled more than 6% after a report the planemaker was planning to cut 787 Dreamliner output by about half.
All of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes moved up, with information technology (SPLRCT) jumping 2.1% and materials (SPLRCM) rallying 1.5%.
Even with Friday's gains, the S&P 500 ended the week lower, with investors fearful of a deep economic slump following a near-crash in April business activity and weekly jobless claims topping 26 million in five weeks.
The index has recovered more than 25% from its March low and expectations are growing that more businesses will be allowed to reopen as coronavirus infections showed signs of peaking.
Georgia became the first state to push ahead with its plan to allow an array of small businesses to reopen on Friday despite disapproval from President Donald Trump and health experts.
Investors may be overestimating how quickly U.S. businesses can go back to normal, and the S&P 500 could fall 5% or more as it becomes evident that resuming normal economic activity may not happen for months, warned Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in North Carolina. 
""We think this is likely to be a little bit of a sideways market, and we won't be surprised to see a bit of downside before we see more upside,"" Freedman said.
Overall, analysts still expect a 15% decline in S&P 500 first-quarter earnings, with profits for the energy sector estimated to slump more than 60%, raising fears of debt defaults, layoffs and possible bankruptcies.
New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly rose in March, but the gains are not likely to be sustainable amid the pandemic, which has abruptly shut down the economy and contributed to a collapse in crude oil prices.
The CBOE volatility index (VIX), known as Wall Street's fear gauge, was down for the third straight session.
Amazon (O:AMZN) rose 0.4% to a record high close ahead of its quarterly report on Thursday. With online shopping booming as people avoid traditional stores, Amazon's stock market value has ballooned by over $100 billion since Feb. 19, just before coronavirus fears gripped Wall Street.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) jumped 1.11% to end at 23,775.27 points, while the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 1.39% to 2,836.74.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 1.65% to 8,634.52.
For the week, the S&P 500 fell 1.3%, the Dow lost 1.9% and the Nasdaq lost 0.2%.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.65-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.00-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 35 new highs and 14 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.2 billion shares, compared with a 12.5 billion-share average over the last 20 trading days.

155,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 03:45PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Trial of Gilead's potential coronavirus treatment running ahead of schedule, researcher says","By Deena Beasley
(Reuters) - A key U.S. government trial of  Gilead Sciences Inc 's (O:GILD) experimental coronavirus treatment may yield results as early as mid-May, according to the study's lead investigator, after doctors clamored to enroll their patients in the study.
Preliminary findings from the randomized trial of the antiviral drug remdesivir, begun in February by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), could come even sooner, lead researcher Dr. Andre Kalil told Reuters in an interview. There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the new virus that has killed over 190,000 people globally, according to a Reuters tally.
Remdesivir has drawn tremendous attention as a therapy with the potential to alter the course of the disease, based on anecdotal reports that it may have helped some patients.
Those hopes were dampened somewhat on Thursday, when details from a Chinese remdesivir trial in patients with severe COVID-19 inadvertently released by the World Health Organization suggested it provided no benefit.
Gilead pushed back on that interpretation saying the study, which was stopped early due to low patient enrollment, cannot provide meaningful conclusions.
Other reports have provided reason for optimism.
Doctors at Houston Methodist Hospital told Reuters that since March 23, they have treated 41 mostly severely ill COVID-19 patients with the drug. None have died and half are back home. But they and other doctors contacted by Reuters said they need much more information than the few details available from the Chinese trial and anecdotal reports on its emergency use in the United States to form a view on remdesivir.
They emphasized a need to see how patients on remdesivir fare compared to those who do not receive the therapy in a rigorous clinical trial at different stages of illness to know whether and under what circumstances it may provide benefit.
The NIAID trial ""has all the necessary scientific standards that are really going to help us define if this drug works or not,"" said Dr. Kalil, a professor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. It is a randomized, double-blind study in which half the patients were given the drug and the other half a placebo. Enrollment in the trial closed on Sunday, but has far exceeded initial goals of 400 to 500 patients, he said. The investigator would not disclose total enrollment, but the latest public update says trial size may exceed 800 patients. The NIAID trial is designed to show whether remdesivir, when given to patients with a range of disease severity, improves outcomes such as length of hospitalization, need for mechanical ventilation and survival. Dr. Kalil declined to comment on precisely how much of an improvement on those metrics is needed to deem the trial a success and the drug a viable treatment. ""We are looking for not only a statistical difference, but also for a meaningful clinical improvement,"" he said. ""We expect to have results sometime from mid- to late May.""
Gilead on Thursday said it expected results from the NIAID trial in late May. The company's shares, up more than 20% so far this year due largely to remdesivir prospects, were 1.7% higher at $79.10 on Friday.
A lack of hard evidence has given U.S. medical associations, as well as the National Institutes of Health, pause. They have not recommended remdesivir to treat COVID-19.
The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), which represents more than 12,000 U.S. specialists, said it will make a formal recommendation once the entire body of evidence for remdesivir is available.
Dr. Rajesh Gandhi, an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who helped draft the IDSA guidelines, explained that most patients with COVID-19 will recover with little or no medical care. He is awaiting more clinical trial data before remdesivir can be deemed a useful therapy. EARLY INTERVENTION?
In general, doctors say they would expect remdesivir to work better if given early in the course of the disease. The drug, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is designed to keep a virus from replicating in the body and overwhelming a patient's immune system.
""You can put out a campfire, but once it becomes a wildfire it's hard to control,"" said Dr. Kevin Grimes, an infectious disease specialist at Houston Methodist, which is participating in Gilead studies.
Gilead is leading its own trials of remdesivir, which is given to hospitalized patients as an intravenous infusion: One in patients with severe disease and the other in patients with more moderate symptoms.
The company expanded the number of patients it would enroll in the severe disease trial to 6,000 from 2,400, and expects results at the end of April. But that study does not compare remdesivir to another treatment or placebo.
The medical news website STAT last week reported that nearly all participants in Gilead-sponsored studies at a University of Chicago hospital saw rapid recoveries in fever and respiratory symptoms, and many were discharged in less than a week. The New England Journal of Medicine previously published an analysis showing that two-thirds of a small group of severely ill COVID-19 patients improved after treatment with remdesivir.
But it is impossible to know whether those outcomes can be attributed to the drug in the absence of a control group that did not far as well, since so much is still unknown about this new virus.
Still, these reports provide reason for hope given the desperate need as the virus rampages around the globe.

""We were asked to participate in this trial and we jumped at it,"" said Grimes. ""We see people that are getting sicker and then they get better.""

157,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 03:40PM ET</span>",Wall Street curtails corporate lending in Europe to put America first: sources,"By Arno Schuetze, Pamela Barbaglia and Maya Nikolaeva
FRANKFURT/LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. investment banks are shrinking lending activity in Europe as the coronavirus crisis forces them to retreat home, allowing  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and other European lenders to fill the funding gaps and grab market share, seven sources told Reuters.
Facing unprecedented demand for loans, and under pressure to support their local economy, the likes of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) have taken a more cautious approach on Europe, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) have also become more risk-averse in taking lending decisions in Europe as they fret over a wave of potential loan defaults, the sources added.
With U.S. banks focusing on their home turf, France's BNP Paribas is using its robust balance sheet to gain market share by increasing lending across the continent, according to the sources and Refinitiv data.
Bank of America, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and BNP Paribas all declined to comment.
The U.S. banks remain active on selective deals, however, with Goldman Sachs and Citigroup underwriting a 3.5 billion euro credit facility for Fiat Chrysler in March. 
They are also deploying different financing tools - such as issuing bonds as well as providing bridge capital or bilateral loans - to spread their bets in Europe. 
Sources at the banks say that their European rivals can afford to be more aggressive in their capital allocation as they can access ultra cheap financing from the European Central Bank.
The retreat of Wall Street's giants nonetheless follows a lending bonanza of several years, with U.S. lenders consistently dominating European investment banking league tables since the financial crisis in 2008, Refinitiv data shows.
""U.S. banks are right now more concerned with their domestic commercial and retail banking activities, so they are taking a more careful approach to Europe,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) Germany country head Guido Zoeller.
Bank of America, for example, turned down requests by British events organiser Informa in March to underwrite a new 750 million pound ($926.5 million) credit line, according to one source with direct knowledge of the matter, despite being its joint corporate broker.
BNP Paribas, HSBC and Spain's  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) decided instead to take on the job and underwrite the facility, while Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley agreed to syndicate the debt. 
Bank of America subsequently failed to land a key role in handling Informa's share sale on Apr. 16 which raised 1 billion pounds and was led by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as joint global coordinators, the source said.
Informa did not respond to a request for comment. 
A source close to Bank of America said the bank had committed more than $9 billion to European clients for liquidity back-up facilities since March 1.
FRENCH OFFENSIVE
BNP Paribas, under CEO Jean-Laurent Bonnafé, leads both Refinitiv and Dealogic's league tables for syndicated loan bookrunners in Europe, with Dealogic data showing it has underwritten $32 billion worth of loans so far this year.
Despite oil market turmoil, BNP Paribas solely underwrote a $10 billion credit facility for Britain's  BP  (LON:BP) on Apr. 6. It is unusual for one bank to underwrite such a large facility alone, particularly in a sector under strain.
French lenders Societe Generale and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), along with Santander and Italy's UniCredit, have also moved to fill the lending gap, Refinitiv data shows.
While facing pressure to provide much-needed financing to domestic businesses, French banks have the backing of the country's political establishment to expand overseas.
Having high levels of liquidity means French banks are likely to be less affected from the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic than other European lenders, one of the sources said.
BNP is widely seen as having emerged a relative winner from the financial crisis by keeping a tight rein on costs and risk. French banks say they have built up higher capital ratios and liquidity levels than during the last crisis.
""The French banking system is seen as the most active and the most solid,"" said a Paris-based banking source. 
EXCEPTIONAL DEMAND
American banks' international focus had to give way as the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic has triggered exceptional demand for liquidity from both U.S. and European clients.
The eight banks topping this year's Refinitiv league table for syndicated loans are all European, while Bank of America - which was number one last year - has slipped to 10th position, providing around $6 billion of loan commitments. 
JPMorgan is the highest-ranked American bank, in ninth place, down from seventh last year.

Banks have seen cash-strapped clients around the world draw down more than $150 billion of revolving credit facilities in the first quarter of the year as business activity came to a halt in many countries.
The rush to deploy lifelines has prompted lenders to set aside billions of dollars in provisions to cushion potential losses, while missing financial targets and stomaching sharp declines in profit.
The bleak outlook, combined with a series of government relief packages for struggling businesses in the United States and Europe, has increased pressure on lenders to prioritize domestic clients, using state guarantees to rescue companies.
""In this crisis most banks need to align their interests with their own governments' and come forward to support state-backed schemes,"" said a London-based banker.

""That's where nationalism comes from. It leaves banks with tough choices to make as there is huge demand for liquidity across borders.""

With little clarity on when the U.S. economy will reopen, companies of all sizes have been bracing for months of limited revenues. Several corporations have reduced or suspended dividends, slowed capital spending and cut jobs and wages to save money.
Companies have also raced to raise as much credit as possible and preserve liquidity, allowing corporations including  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) and  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) to end the March quarter with much higher cash balances.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Investors in SkyBridge Capital asked for hundreds of millions of dollars back after the fund suffered a 23% loss in March when investments made by its debt-focused hedge fund managers soured, Anthony Scaramucci wrote in a letter to clients, saying he was ""embarrassed"" by the loss.
""Redemptions were approximately 9.3% of assets as of March 31, 2020,"" Scaramucci wrote about the firm's main portfolio, called Series G. The letter was dated April 23 and seen by Reuters on Friday. The firm manages $7.7 billion in assets.
SkyBridge, which invests with a handful of hedge funds, in turn submitted redemptions of more than $1 billion to these managers in order to pay back its investors and shift around its investments.
The firm had no comment beyond the letter.
Scaramucci, one of the hedge fund industry's best-known executives, said that a number of the firms SkyBridge invests with, including Bayview Liquid Credit Strategies, Metacapital Mortgage Opportunities, Medalist Partners Harvest and Tempo Volatility, had suspended redemption requests, which means investors cannot pull their money out right now.
He also detailed the Series G portfolio's March losses, described new investments and said that a long-serving executive who had planned to retire was returning to full-time service.
""We are embarrassed by this performance,"" Scaramucci wrote about the firm's 23.3% loss in March, which left the portfolio down 22.79% in the first quarter. The firm's year-to-date loss has narrowed to 21.54%, thanks to a 1.62% gain for the current month through April 21. The S&P 500 stock index has lost 14.79% this year.
""We have to do better, and we will,"" Scaramucci wrote, noting that the fund made a $170 million investment with $22 billion hedge fund manager Canyon Partners on April 1, having waited for a distressed credit cycle to make the investment.
Ray Nolte, SkyBridge's long-time co-chief investment officer who had been transitioning into an advisory role, is back full time for at least two years. ""He is energized by the opportunity to lead the investment team and, once again, produce the attractive returns that marked the past fifteen years,"" Scaramucci said.
Scaramucci himself returned to SkyBridge, the firm he founded in 2003, after a planned sale to Chinese conglomerate HNA Group fell through in 2018. He spent 11 days as the White House communications director in 2017 and has since spoken out widely on economic and political topics.

SkyBridge's heavy investments in structured credit -- a bet that helped it a few years ago -- contributed to this year's heavy losses, the letter said. Angelo Gordon Mortgage Value Partners funds, Medalist Partners Harvest funds, and Axonic Credit Opportunities funds hurt SkyBridge the most, the letter said, noting that the funds were ""insufficiently hedged relative to their peers.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange plans to reopen its iconic trading floor, which is shuttered due to coronavirus concerns, as soon as possible, but it has not yet set a date to do so, the NYSE and people familiar with the matter said on Friday. 
""The NYSE will reopen its trading floors when we can do so with reduced risk and without adding strain on local healthcare systems,"" exchange spokesman Farrell Kramer said in a statement, without giving further details. The exchange operator also has an options trading floor in San Francisco that is closed due to the pandemic.
The NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE), held a conference call with NYSE staff and the traders who work on the floor on Wednesday to discuss an eventual reopening, but did not set any dates, according to two people who were on the call.
The exchange plans to reopen floor trading in phases, monitoring everyone who enters 11 Wall Street for symptoms and ensuring traders adhere to social distancing guidelines, the people said.
New York City is now the epicenter of the global pandemic. Home to more than 8 million people, the city had 150,976 confirmed coronavirus cases and 16,388 related deaths as of Thursday. 
As a financial exchange, the NYSE is considered an essential service and can open the floor when it wants, but it has taken a cautious approach. 
The NYSE announced on March 18 it would temporarily shutter the floor and move to fully electronic trading for the first time the its 228-year history, after one of its employees and a trader tested positive for COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by the coronavirus.
Days later, at least two more floor traders tested positive, despite measures taken to prevent people with the virus from entering 11 Wall Street while it remained physically open the previous week, according to a memo seen by Reuters.
At the time, the NYSE recommended anyone who had visited the floor in the previous two weeks self-quarantine for 14 days.
Floor trader Peter Tuchman said on March 25 on Twitter that he tested positive for the coronavirus on after battling symptoms for a week. 

After recovering, Tuchman was itching to get back to work, Tweeting on April 21, ""looking forward to get our lives back on track open the New York Stock Exchange and see each other all again I love you all.""

165,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 03:10PM ET</span>",U.S. state bankruptcy push would disrupt municipal bond market: BofA,"By Karen Pierog
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Allowing U.S. states to file for bankruptcy is not the way to deal with deep financial problems the governments are facing from the COVID-19 economic disaster, and would knock down the municipal bond market, BofA Global Research said on Friday.
In a research report BofA said the $3.8 trillion muni market where states, cities, schools and other issuers sell debt would ""certainly sell off"" if the idea garnered support.
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday brought up state bankruptcy as a preferred alternative to sending more federal money to the governments to plug their budget holes and potentially pay for pensions. President Donald Trump on Thursday said his administration would look at the idea.
Several Democratic governors slammed the notion as irresponsible. Municipal market analysts said the move would face big political and constitutional hurdles and was unlikely to gain traction.
""It will be highly disruptive to the municipal bond market broadly and will result in significantly higher borrowing rates at a time when those costs are least absorbable,"" the BofA report said.
It added states would not likely opt for bankruptcy for fear of hurting their market access and that most municipal bankruptcies have resulted in a better treatment for pensions than bondholders.
Currently, only cities and other local governments can use Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy to restructure their debt if allowed by their states. Puerto Rico, a U.S. commonwealth, commenced a form of municipal bankruptcy in 2017 after the U.S. Congress authorized it.
The National Governors Association has been pushing for $500 billion in federal money to replace revenue lost by states. The $2.3 trillion federal CARES Act allocated $150 billion to states and local governments exclusively to cover virus-related expenses.
With social distancing and stay-at-home orders in place around the nation aimed at slowing the virus' spread, nonessential businesses and services have shuttered, leading to skyrocketing unemployment and lower consumer spending. As a result, cities and states are starting to project deep revenue losses, particularly for big money generators like income and sales taxes

In addition, the stock market downturn could push overall state pension debt to an all-time high, according to a new report from The Pew Charitable Trusts. With 75% of state pension assets invested in stocks and alternative investments, pension debt, currently at $1.2 trillion, could climb by $500 billion, absent positive returns in the next three months.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several staffers at major retail chains, including J.C. Penney Co Inc and Saks Fifth Avenue, reported for duty at some Texas-based stores on Friday, selling merchandise ""to-go"" for orders placed online.
Following Texas Governor Greg Abbott's executive order, the retailers could open for curbside pick-up for anything from a Gucci handbag to a pair of Levi's (NYSE:LEVI) jeans.
For more than a month, ""non-essential"" stores have been closed to the public to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, and many were limited to shipping online orders to customers' homes.
On Friday, Texas, the second-largest U.S. retail market after California, along with South Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee, started to reopen their economies. 
""To be able to see that there is a light at the end of the tunnel is a huge confidence builder"" both for consumers and retails, said Marshal Cohen, chief retail industry adviser at market research firm NPD Group. 
Even with curbside service, chains have sharply curtailed signature department store services. Makeup applications and spa services are unavailable, and personal shoppers cannot interact with clientele in person. They have been using Zoom, Instagram, text and email instead.
Penney, which is exploring filing for bankruptcy protection after the coronavirus pandemic forced the retailer to temporarily shut its 850 department stores, will offer curbside pick-up starting on Friday at certain store locations in Texas, including San Antonio and Dallas.
Dallas-based Neiman Marcus, which also is preparing to seek bankruptcy protection, will allow customers to collect online orders, gift cards and alterations via curbside pick-up at all Neiman and Last Call locations in Texas. Upon arrival, an associate - wearing a mask and gloves - will deliver the product to the customer without making any contact.
Saks Fifth Avenue stylists and personal shoppers on Friday sent messages to Texas-based clients telling them they can schedule appointments to shop online and collect merchandise curbside, or make returns, at two Saks stores, one in San Antonio and one in Houston. The personal shoppers can also advise customers on what purchases to make, though not in person.
""Wall Street is looking closely at how the 'non-essential' stores reopen,"" said Randy Hare, portfolio manager at Huntington Private Bank. ""We will be in a new environment post-quarantine and different companies have an opportunity to become leaders.""
Many retailers were offering curbside pick-up before the coronavirus pandemic to drive sales, and some states have allowed non-essential businesses to operate curbside in recent days. 
Macy’s Inc started testing curbside services this week at three locations in California, Florida and Texas, a company spokeswoman said. 
As they return to doing in-store business, the retailers might take a lesson from others overseas.
In Germany, where stores are gradually reopening to shoppers country-wide, Swedish furniture chain Ikea counts people as they enter and exit to make sure there are no more than 640 shoppers at one time. It has put up protection screens for staff offering assistance and closed its childcare and restaurant areas. 
Staff are not required to wear face masks but can if they want. Signs on the floor ask shoppers to maintain a 1.5 metre (4.9 ft) distance from each other.

At H&M stores that have reopened in Germany, customers are reminded with announcements, signage and floor stickers about social distancing rules. Plexiglass shields separate cash-desk areas, and the retailer is following the ruling of several German states regarding the compulsory wearing of protective masks for all employees.

168,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 02:25PM ET</span>","Insurers feel the heat as chefs, Trump join calls for payouts","By Carolyn Cohn, Suzanne Barlyn and Noor Zainab Hussain
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Daniel Duckett, owner of the Lazy Claire patisserie in Belfast, was hoping for an insurance payout of up to 100,000 pounds ($123,460.00) to cover losses during the coronavirus lockdown. Now he fears for the future as he battles for the compensation. 
Duckett is one of thousands who have called their insurers to claim on business disruption policies as the spread of the new coronavirus forces large parts of the global economy to shut down, with the answer for most a straight ""no"".
As the industry increasingly comes under fire, critics ranging from U.S. President Donald Trump to groups of celebrity chefs have joined the call for payouts to be made.
But insurers, already facing huge payouts on travel and trade credit insurance and the cancellation of sporting events such as the Wimbledon tennis championship, say clauses allowing claims due to government closures or communicable diseases often do not apply to the widespread lockdowns in place to stem the spread of the coronavirus.
Meanwhile, market volatility has also slashed normally comfortable investment income and if insurers were forced to make payouts on policies that do not cover the pandemic, ""it would damage or destroy the insurance industry in a terrible way,"" Evan Greenberg, CEO of Chubb (NYSE:CB), one of the world's largest insurers, said this week.
Greenberg said the pandemic would in any case likely spur the largest single loss in insurance history. 
UBS estimates industry insured losses for non-U.S. business interruption total $7-22 billion. 
In the U.S., monthly small business losses are seen at between $255 billion and $431 billion, according to the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, dwarfing the roughly $6 billion a month in premiums the local industry receives for key property insurance lines. It is unclear how much of their losses are insured for the pandemic.
A payout can't come soon enough for Larry Brehm, owner of a Play It Again Sports store in Torrance, California, who has been told by insurer Nova Casualty Company, a unit of The Hanover Insurance Group that he is not eligible to make a claim as his policy does not cover the virus.
""If I don't get some kind of help, either from the government or from the...loss of business insurance, then I might have to close. It's the only way that I feed my family and it's very sad to think about.""
Hanover said it could not comment on the particular case, but was ""committed to delivering on our promises to our customers"".
Lazy Claire's Duckett is in one of at least three groups of small businesses in Britain squaring up to Lloyd's of London insurer Hiscox.
Lawyers at Fieldfisher and DMH Stallard also said they had clients seeking payouts from Hiscox and other UK-based insurers. 
Hiscox said this week it would work with the industry, regulators and customers to ""seek means of expediting resolution through the range of independent mechanisms available"".
RESTAURANTS IN CRISIS 
Trump weighed in on the issue during an April 10 briefing, saying he had spoken to restaurateurs who had been paying for business interruption cover for 35 years. 
""They've been paying a lot of money for a lot of years...And then when they finally need it, the insurance company says, 'we're not going to give it',"" Trump said. ""We can't let that happen."" 
A group of famed U.S. restaurateurs, including Wolfgang Puck and Thomas Keller, owner of the upmarket French Laundry in California's Napa Valley, last month banded together with Louisiana lawyer John W. Houghtaling to form the ""Business Interruption Group,"" or BIG, a non-profit organisation launched to push for payouts.
""If insurers do not start paying...we will bring BIG legal action in every state,"" the group said.
In Britain, celebrity chef Raymond Blanc, who runs 36 restaurants through his Brasserie Barco group, has hired law firm Legal Risk.
""We think our policy is bullet-proof,"" Brasserie Barco Chairman Mark Derry said.
ALL IN THE WORDING
Analysts say it is hard to strip out business interruption from other commercial property policies, though McKinsey estimates the specific cover earns $40 billion in annual premiums globally. 
One issue is whether a virus can be described as causing physical damage, often a pre-requisite to trigger payments.
Epidemics are generally excluded although businesses can buy additional cover. But that extra policy might specify the diseases it covers - meaning the new coronavirus that only appeared in recent months would not be included.
Some businesses buy extra coverage for a government-mandated shutdown, but again, this may not apply to a pandemic.
Whether businesses will be covered depends on the wording of individual policies, said Ling Ong, vice president of the London Forum of Insurance Lawyers.
Travelers (NYSE:TRV) Companies Inc has pushed back against a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles by celebrity criminal defense lawyer Mark Geragos, who said his business had been hurt by shut-down orders. 
""Insurers don't collect premiums to cover losses that policies weren't written to cover,"" said Travelers chief executive officer Alan Schnitzer on Tuesday in an earnings call. Travelers' standard coverage excludes viruses.
Chubb and Lloyd's of London are among other insurers facing U.S. class action suits. The insurers declined to comment.
However, some businesses have found they are covered - the British Columbia Dental Association's members can claim under  Aviva  (LON:AV)'s pandemic policy, it said this week.
GOVERNMENT PRESSURE 
Insurers' protests may be futile. Eight U.S. states have introduced legislation which would require insurers to pay claims, mainly to small businesses, despite exclusions. Many of the bills would let insurers seek reimbursement from the states.
Pennsylvania State Senator Vincent Hughes, a Democrat, said he introduced the bill after many small businesses told him that insurers wouldn't pay their claims and government aid programs had ran out of money. 
Insurers say such laws make retroactive changes to contracts, with global trade body the Institute of International Finance saying earlier this month in a letter to regulators that this could lead to ""decreased availability of insurance, the withdrawal of insurers from certain markets and overall increases in the price of available coverage"".
In France, President Emmanuel Macron said last week that insurers ""must be there"" to help stabilise the economy.

French insurers have said they would put 3.2 billion euros ($3.47 billion) on the table including a 1.5 billion investment programme and donations to the government's aid fund.

Investing.com – The Dow turned higher on Friday, led by tech as investors weighed up further evidence of weakness in the economy against the backdrop of fresh economic stimulus measures.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.60%, the S&P 500 rose 0.84%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.03%.
In a further sign the economic downturn is likely to be severe, U.S. durable goods orders fell by 14.4% last month, the biggest slide since 2014, led by waning demand for big-ticket items such as cars and slump in orders for Boeing (NYSE:BA) passenger planes.
But some on Wall Street suggested the underlying data was more resilient and the weakness was largely driven by transportation orders.
""Outside of transportation, we saw an underlying resiliency in the face of the lockdowns, at least in March,"" Jefferies said in a note.
The weaker-than-expected data come just as President Donald Trump signed the $484 billion coronavirus stimulus package into law to ease the Covid-19 hit to the economy at a time when some states are set to reopen.
But with worries over the pandemic still running high, some of the biggest companies are wary of opening for business, with Macy’s (NYSE:M), Gap (NYSE:GPS), and TGI Fridays choosing to remain shuttered in states such as Georgia and South Carolina.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, moved off session lows to trade 1% higher even as oil prices lost some gains into settlement.  
But ahead of major tech earnings next week, including from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), investors showed some interest in the sector.
Chip stocks also edged higher, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up about 2%, as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) cut its losses to trade flat.
Intel reported earnings that topped estimates, but the chipmaker pulled its guidance, stoking concerns its future growth is more likely to ease rather than accelerate.
Airlines, meanwhile, were given a slight lift off the lows after President Trump reportedly suggested the government should buy ""4-5 years worth of airline tickets"" in advance to boost airlines.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) was up about 0.9%, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), and Delta Air Lines were down about 0.5%."

In its sentencing, seen by Reuters, the court said the budget airline must immediately reinstate the workers ""in the same working conditions"" and with ""immediate payment of wages not received"" since their contracts were terminated in January.
Ryanair dismissed the employees, who worked at bases in Tenerife, Lanzarote and Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands, and Girona in mainland Spain, after announcing it planned to close the four hubs due to delays in the delivery of grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX planes. 
But the High Court on Friday rejected Ryanair's arguments that the Boeing delay, Brexit, and the seasonality of the Girona base justified the dismissals.

""I hope this makes it clear to them (Ryanair) they have to comply with the law and begin to change their attitude,"" he said.

174,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 02:00PM ET</span>",IRS Has Sent 88 Million Stimulus Checks Totaling $158 Billion,"(Bloomberg) -- Almost 88 million Americans have received coronavirus aid payments worth nearly $158 billion, according to the U.S. Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service.
That represents more than half of the stimulus payments of up to $1,200 for adults that the IRS will send out to bolster household budgets as unemployment numbers rise and businesses remain shut down. The IRS plans to send more than 150 million payments in total, which congressional scorekeepers estimate will total about $292 billion.
“The IRS, Treasury and partner agencies are working non-stop to get these payments out in record time to Americans who need them,” IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said in a statement Friday. “Tens of millions of people across the country are receiving these payments, and millions more are on the way.”
The IRS said it’s currently processing the $1,200 payments for people who aren’t require to file tax returns, including recipients of Social Security, Supplemental Security Income and veterans affairs benefits. Those individuals will start receiving payments in late April and early May, according to guidance from the agency.
Democrats had questioned whether the inclusion of President Donald Trump’s name on the checks, which are typically signed by a civil servant and don’t include the president’s name, had slowed down the process.
“Checks are being issued on time, as planned,” according to a letter the Treasury Department sent to Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon on Thursday.
The IRS is encouraging taxpayers who haven’t received a tax refund by direct deposit in the past two years to upload their bank account information to the IRS website so they can receive payment more quickly than by a paper check. The IRS “Get My Payment” web page lets users see when their money is scheduled to be mailed or deposited, though many people have reported that the status of their money isn’t available.
The National Taxpayer Advocate is trying to advise (LINK here:https://taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/get-help/taxupdates#Tool) individuals who have not yet gotten their payment about when they might receive it and what steps, if any, they need to take to get their money.
Congress’s $2.2 trillion economic rescue package enacted last month included $1,200 for adults earning up to $75,000 or married couples earning twice that amount, with $500 for their children. Those earning up to $99,000 as an individual or $198,000 as a couple are eligible for a smaller payment.

LONDON (Reuters) - The firm behind Madame Tussauds and Legoland parks is looking to raise 500 million euros ($540 million) in a bond sale, offering a high interest rate to try to secure funds to tide it over while most of its venues are closed in the coronavirus pandemic. 
Merlin Entertainments, the world's second-largest operator of visitor attractions after  Disney  (N:DIS), is poised to sell a five-year bond secured on assets on Friday at a yield in a range of 7%-7.25%, according to a bookrunner for the deal.
Merlin told investors in the bond's prospectus that only nine of its 130 venues were open as of Tuesday and it would run out of liquidity by the third quarter in a ""downside"" scenario. A high-yield data company, 9fin, said the new bond sale pushes that to 17 months. 
The yield is well above the 4.50% Merlin paid for an unsecured bond with a maturity three years longer just last October.
The bond size was increased from the initial 400 million euros, even though ratings agency S&P downgraded the company to 'B', five notches into junk territory on the day of the sale.
The rush to high-yielding debt came to an abrupt halt after the virus outbreak, with the risk premium on European junk bonds at one point rising to its highest since the euro zone debt crisis around a decade ago. 
Merlin rattled the bond market last year when it sold bonds to back its leveraged buyout by a Blackstone-led consortium last October, with terms that gave it leeway to raise significant additional debt, pay dividends to its owners and move assets away from creditors even in certain circumstances of default.
With money pouring into their high-yielding funds at the time, many investors bought into the bonds despite reservations, market sources said. 
But, despite the hit from coronavirus to its business, Merlin's new bond includes the same aggressive terms as October's sale, according to 9fin.
Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which is leading the bond sale, declined to comment on the terms of the deal.
One fund manager, speaking on condition of anonymity, said existing investors might still buy the latest issue, despite the unchanged terms, because they would not want to risk the debt being picked up by distressed investment specialists, who tend to demand a more senior position in the repayment pecking order.
Investors in the new, secured bonds, will be higher in the payment queue than investors in Merlin's October bonds.

179,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 12:58PM ET</span>",Boeing-Embraer deal hits new roadblock as deadline nears: sources,"By Tim Hepher, Marcelo Rochabrun and Tatiana Bautzer
PARIS/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A $4.2 billion deal for Boeing (N:BA) to buy the civil jetmaking arm of Brazil's Embraer (SA:EMBR3) has hit a roadblock over implementation, leaving its fate uncertain unless a breakthrough can be found quickly, people familiar with the talks said.
The companies have been in discussions to assess whether various contractual conditions have been met for the tie-up, including the way a new venture 80%-owned by Boeing would be set up and funded, and have the rest of Friday to resolve the issue.
The deal also depends on delayed approval from the European Union which has said it needs until August to complete its anti-trust probe after the deal was cleared by other regulators, but this is not seen as the main stumbling block.
Neither company agreed to comment.
Under a provisional agreement signed early last year, Boeing (N:BA) and Embraer (SA:EMBR3) had until April 24 - or 15 months after the initial signing - to complete the deal and implement a number of covenants and conditions on both sides.
People familiar with the matter stressed that the deadline expires at midnight Sao Paulo time and that a deal could still be reached to resolve outstanding differences, though two sources said the talks were not progressing quickly.
Embraer said this week it was in talks with Boeing to extend the April 24 deadline for closing the deal and that there were no assurances about whether or when it would close.
Shares in Embraer fell 11% in line with a sell-off on the Brazil market (BVSP) after the justice minister resigned accusing President Jair Bolsonaro of interference.
Reuters reported last month that weak markets had raised urgent questions over the fate of the deal as aviation reels from the coronavirus crisis. A drop in Embraer shares and cash concerns at Boeing, driven by the impact of the epidemic on air travel, have undermined the deal's economics.
One source familiar with the talks said Boeing remained committed to the deal and that it would be complex to reverse the carve-out of Embraer's commercial arm, which makes the E2 series of regional jets competing with the Airbus (PA:AIR) A220.
Analysts have not ruled out a second attempt to complete the strategic tie-up if the deal collapses, with Embraer looking increasingly isolated after Airbus bought its main Canadian rival and Boeing seeking a broader and cheaper engineering base.

The agreement has a termination fee of $75 million, rising to $100 million if it is for anti-trust reasons, according to a copy of the merger agreement filed to U.S. authorities.

The French drugmaker is working on two vaccine projects, including one in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline. That venture has received financial support from the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.
Europe risked the United States securing first access for its citizens if U.S. cash funded the successful development of a vaccine.
""It is quite conceivable that if they are successful the American government will ask for Americans to be vaccinated first,"" Hudson told reporters.
""There has been too much of a lack of co-ordination at a European level. It is starting to move now but the level of preparedness to the pandemic is very, very low,"" he said.
There are no approved treatments or vaccines for COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus which has claimed the lives of nearly 190,000 people and infected more than 2.7 million others.
Hudson said Sanofi, which published its first-quarter results on Friday, had contacted the European Commission to discuss the matter.
""Maybe it is too complicated for them (the Commission) but we will work with member states and try to get this thing moving,"" Hudson said.
""We do not want to get to next summer and not have enough vaccines for Europe.""

World leaders pledged on Friday to accelerate work on tests, drugs and vaccines against the coronavirus and to share them around the globe, but the United States did not take part in the launch of the World Health Organization (WHO) initiative.

182,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 12:05PM ET</span>","EU industry chief wants pan-European recovery plan for industry, tourism, others","By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU industry chief Thierry Breton on Friday pushed for a pan-European recovery plan for as many as 14 coronavirus-hit sectors ranging from heavy industry to tourism, in a move that would do away with the current patchwork of national measures.
A European strategy makes more sense as each sector has its own ecosystem made up of research, engineering, production, assembly and service activities that can be spread across different European countries, Breton said.
He said a pan-European approach would help both big and small companies and also ensure a level playing field in the bloc.
""In my view, it is important to consider the recovery from that perspective, because it allows us to overcome national divisions and to adopt a truly European approach,"" he told a European Parliament hearing on Friday.
""To put it simply: we are all in the same boat. And if a company has difficulties in one country, the whole associated European value chain is impacted. It is therefore in everyone's interest to find the means to support this recovery,"" he said.
He estimated to date 14 industrial ecosystems, from tourism, local businesses, distribution to heavy industry representing more than 50% of added value in the bloc and the hardest hit, would benefit from a pan-European recovery plan.

The European Commission is now assessing the needs of each sector and will then present the results to EU countries for further action.

183,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 11:50AM ET</span>",ECB begins reluctant journey into junk debt,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - European markets are hoping the ECB, again facing the task of rescuing the euro zone, will soon add junk-rated company debt to its stimulus programmes, but some investors say such a bold move might prove counterproductive.
Since the fateful 'whatever-it-takes' moment in 2012 - when its then president Mario Draghi pledged to save the euro at any cost - the European Central Bank has shown a readiness to cross red lines whenever the bloc's economy is in trouble.
European leaders' failure to agree on the one measure that might have calmed markets - joint debt issuance - means this is another such time.
Concerned about liquidity constraints in the banking sector, and possibly anticipating that Thursday's EU summit would disappoint, the ECB this week extended the range of lenders' eligible collateral to the debt of sovereigns and companies cut to non-investment grade during the coronavirus outbreak.
High-yield bond markets, where borrowing costs have soared since February, rallied in response. Yields on an ICE-BofA euro junk index <.MERHEEC> dropped 10 basis points on Wednesday, and debt insurance costs for lower-rated companies tumbled.
The ECB's decision has left the door open to an even bolder move - following the U.S. Federal Reserve in pledging direct purchases of 'fallen angel' bonds downgraded from investment to junk. And might it then also dip more broadly into junk debt?
For now, with the loosening of the collateral rules ostensibly targeted more at easing bank liquidity than at helping companies, many reckon the ECB will only take one or both of those steps if there is another blow-out in high-yield rates or many more credit ratings downgrades..
""It's one thing to support sovereign debt in a global health crisis, but it's another thing for the ECB to reach more broadly into sub-investment grade (corporate debt)"" Andrew Mulliner, bond fund manager at Janus Henderson Investors, said.
""(The ECB) doesn't want to be seen to support companies that have taken on a lot of risk on their balance sheets.""
The spectre of mass downgrades is something of a reckoning for companies that binged on cheap debt for a decade. Rating agency S&P Global estimates that default rates among speculative-grade European firms could quadruple this year from end-2019 levels.
PROS AND CONS
There are reasons why expanding bond-buying to junk makes sense.
The ECB already holds the debt of companies with a mix of ratings on its balance sheet, and it has started accepting junk-rated Greek sovereign bonds.
More importantly, highly-indebted Italy could lose its investment grade rating. Even if it doesn't, the debt of many of its banks and companies risk becoming junk, which would undermine its financial system.
Bank analysts forecast as much as 100 billion euros of European corporate debt will be downgraded to junk in 2020.
S&P has already turned six European firms into fallen angels this year and its global list of others at risk of the chop is the longest since the financial crisis and includes household names like  Renault  (PA:RENA) and British Airways (L:ICAG).
Graphic - Fallen angel risk at highest since financial crisis: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmypmwedpra/Pasted%20image%201587054358364.png
But aiding a broad range of lower-rated companies would require policymakers to overcome deep-seated concerns about effectively bailing out highly-indebted, often private equity-backed businesses.
Buying junk debts would also represent a huge risk for the ECB for potentially modest benefits. 
Compared to U.S. firms that turn to bond markets for around 70% of their financing, European corporates rely more on loans, borrowing via bonds for around a third of their needs. 
Banks used just 55 billion euros of corporate debt as collateral with the ECB in the first quarter of 2020,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) notes, compared to 250 billion euros of government bonds.
NEXT RED LINE
Jorgen Kjaersgaard, co-head of European fixed income at Alliance Bernstein, said the ECB did not need to start buying junk now because its existing investment grade bond-buying programme was ""very aggressive"", the high-yield market small and many lower-rated firms well funded. 
In buying high yield, Kjaersgaard said policymakers ran the risk of rescuing ""black sheep"" - overly-leveraged companies that managed their finances poorly.
The hit to company finances from the virus could prove temporary too, he added, though his view is predicated on ""strong rebounds"" later in 2020.
With the coronavirus widely expected to decimate the global economy, many analysts and investors say the ECB is heading towards purchases of fallen angel debt.
That would leave it staring at another red line - beyond which lies the broader junk market and lower, BB-rated credits. 
""Are they (the ECB) willing to go all the way down below investment grade? I'm reluctant to say they are really going to go there,"" said Iain Stealey, international CIO for fixed income at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.

""But if we are still working from home in three months it's a completely different conversation.""

(Reuters) - Veteran John Stankey will take over as AT&T (N:T) chief executive officer, the company announced on Friday, as the U.S. telecommunications and media giant grapples with the impact of the coronavirus outbreak and its entrance into the global streaming wars.
Stankey will take over on July 1. Randall Stephenson, AT&T's current CEO, said Friday he will retire, but will serve as executive chairman of the board until January 2021.
The announcement was made during AT&T's virtual annual meeting.
Stankey oversaw WarnerMedia after AT&T's $85 billion purchase of media company Time Warner. He was promoted to COO last year.
""After an extensive evaluation, it was clear that John Stankey was the right person to lead AT&T into the future,"" Stephenson said. 
New York-based activist investor Elliott Management called for a shake-up at AT&T last fall, urging the company to end its buying spree and improve its operating businesses. The hedge fund also questioned Stankey's leadership skills and AT&T's desire to promote him into the top role.
By late October, AT&T had unveiled a three-year plan that included selling up to $10 billion worth of businesses, paying off debt and adding two new board members.
Elliott said Friday it supports Stankey's appointment to CEO.
""We have been engaged with the company throughout the search process, which was a robust one, including a range of highly qualified outside candidates and overseen by independent directors,"" said Jesse Cohen, a partner at Elliott Management. ""We look forward to working with John as he begins his term as CEO.""
""My commitment is, you'll get my best from me every day,"" Stankey said.
President Donald Trump tweeted it was ""great news"" that Stephenson was leaving.
""Anyone who lets a garbage ""network"" do and say the things that CNN does, should leave ASAP. Hopefully replacement will be much better!"" he wrote. 
The move should come as no surprise, one investor said. ""Stankey has been running the company for at least the past few months. This has been well telegraphed to the market,"" said Sam Hendel, president and a co-portfolio manager at investment firm LevinEasterly, which owns $1.93 million worth of AT&T shares.

189,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 10:45AM ET</span>",Drop in Rate Targeted by Fed Adds Fuel to Tinkering Speculation,"(Bloomberg) -- The rate targeted by the Federal Reserve fell to match its lowest ever level, adding fuel to speculation that the central bank might need to tweak some of the tools it uses to control the benchmark.
The effective fed funds rate fell to 0.04% Thursday from 0.05% the day before, according to New York Fed data released Friday. That’s in line with the low reached in 2011. The drop also increases the chance that the central bank adjusts some of its tools -- the interest on excess reserves rate could be one -- to steer the benchmark closer to the middle of its target range. That band is currently 0%-0.25%.
The decline, which is taking place even as an influx of Treasury bill issuance could potentially be exerting upward pressure on front-end rates, comes at a time when some of the recent stresses in funding markets have eased back. The three month London interbank offered rate for dollars, for example, on Friday dropped for a sixth straight session.
“There is such enormous demand for front-end assets for flight to safety reasons that despite the $1.3 trillion surge of bill supply, front-end rates have continued to be pressured lower,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities. “The Fed probably wants to give themselves more room, adjusting rates modestly higher in a technical fashion.”
The current effective rate is now six basis points below IOER -- presently 0.10%. May fed funds futures indicate a rate of 0.08%, or 4 basis points above the current effective fed funds rate, which suggests traders are pricing about an 80% chance of a 5 basis point increase in IOER when Fed policy makers meet next week.

190,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 10:27AM ET</span>",Goldman Caught Fed-Fueled Rebound With Bet on Mortgage Bonds,"(Bloomberg) --  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). bought up mortgage bonds during a wave of panic selling last month, a bet that’s almost certainly made money since the Federal Reserve unveiled massive stimulus turning a crash into a rally.
The Wall Street giant amassed mortgage-backed securities from funds that had bought them with borrowed money and needed to sell quickly, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the details are private.
Goldman charged a fee for helping funds and investments trusts exit repurchase agreements and it also stood to gain if the bonds rallied in the period it held them. For the funds, the trade offered a way to free up cash and escape the pain of daily margin calls in a fast-falling market, the people said.
A spokesman for Goldman declined to comment.
Well Timed
The high-risk bet proved to be well timed. Not long after, the Fed intervened to calm market panic and said it would buy unlimited amounts of Treasury bonds and mortgage securities. That allowed Goldman to sell some notes to the Fed, one of the people said, while even bonds that were ineligible for central bank purchases rallied after the Fed stepped in.
The Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Mortgage-Backed Securities Total Return index of the agency mortgage bonds that the Fed is buying has gained more than 3% in the last month. A Markit iBoxx benchmark of non-agency securities gained 14% over the same period.
Goldman was able to find a plentiful supply of willing sellers because the mortgage bond market is dominated by investors using leverage to amplify their positions. While buying mortgage-backed-securities using borrowed money with just a small percentage as a down payment can enhance potential profits, when asset values drop the creditor lending that money can suddenly demand a higher percentage, resulting in margin calls and a wave of forced liquidations.
See also: Invesco Mortgage Capital Warns It Can’t Fund Margin Calls
And that’s exactly what happened last month when the coronavirus credit meltdown reached the U.S. mortgage market, causing prices for bonds secured by home loans to collapse and spurring a chaotic rush to offload the bonds to meet redemptions and mounting margin calls. Some investors, including a number of real estate investment trusts, said the precipitous drop in the value of the securities meant they were unable to meet margin calls and even asked counterparties for forbearance agreements.

Goldman executed a few large trades with key clients and also approached several other structured credit hedge funds to see if they wanted to trade, said the people. The firm saw an increase of as much as 75% compared to regular volumes for similar trades as of early April, one of the people said.
Sweeping Measures
Even before the Fed unveiled a sweeping package of measures to address the economic damage of coronavirus lockdowns, Goldman was confident it could find buyers for any bonds it took on and wouldn’t need to warehouse them for a long period, according to one of the people. Still the Fed’s timing was fortuitous.
The central bank announced last month it’s buying unlimited amounts of mortgage securities to keep borrowing costs low, although it excluded the private U.S. mortgages that are packaged into non-agency mortgage-backed securities. It also set up programs to ensure more credit flows to businesses and expanded its Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility. After the announcement Goldman also bought securities from money market funds to sell to the Fed, one of the people said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Friday, but quickly pared gains as the market digested Thursday's disappointment over Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD)' experimental drug remdesivir, and took comfort in the passage of the latest $484 billion economic support package to be approved by Congress. 
By 10:15 AM ET (1415 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was effectively unchanged at 23,520 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up 0.2%.  
Fiscal and monetary stimulus continue to be the main factors supporting many stocks close to the levels where they started the year. The Nasdaq is now down only 5.5% for the year to date, thanks largely to the pandemic accelerating structural shifts towards streaming, remote work and online shopping. 
Durable goods orders and consumer sentiment were the latest data points to show the extent of the damage on the economy, the University of Michigan sentiment index falling slightly less than expected from its preliminary measure to 71.8 - still a record low. Durable goods orders also collapsed, but held up better than expected once the highly volatile aircraft component was stripped out of it.  Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock fell 3.7% after it announced on Thursday it would halve production of the Dreamliner 787. 
Investors are warning that for the rest of the market, the path back to ""normality"" will be long and bumpy.
""What seems increasingly clear to us is that the path back to normal is looking more like a marathon than a sprint,"" said BlueBay Asset Management chief investment officer Mark Dowding in e-mailed comments.  He compared the fight against the virus to the First World War.
""At the onset of the First World War, there was initially a belief that it would be ‘all over by Christmas’, only for the grim reality of trench warfare to drag on for years to follow,"" Dowding said.
""This isn’t meant to be an overly bleak or pessimistic prognosis,"" he added, ""just an admission that as we learn more, we need to accept and understand that it will be some time before life goes back to the way it was.""
Elsewhere, Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) rose another 5.6% to a fresh all-time high after being included in the Nasdaq 100 index, while oil and gas stocks rose across the board after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin hinted at a rescue facility for the industry.
U.S. crude futures have settled into a range after the volatility earlier this week around settlement of the May futures contract, and were up 4.1% at $17.17 by 10:10 AM.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock was up 1.2%, while the more highly levered Oasis Petroleum  (NASDAQ:OAS) was up 11.7%. 
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock was down 2.9% after reports that its chips will be dropped from Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) next generation of Mac computers, while Verizon (NYSE:VZ) stock fell 0.7% after it took a $228 million charge against possible non-payment of bills as customers lost their jobs in droves due to the pandemic.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock gained 4.5% as speculative interest on a rapid pharmaceutical breakthrough to beat the virus shifted out of Gilead."

195,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>",Norway approves new law that could help rescue Norwegian Air,"By Victoria Klesty
OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's parliament voted through a new company restructuring law on Friday that could help save Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) and many other companies from potential bankruptcy as a result of the restrictions to stem the spread of COVID-19.
The legislation replaces current regulation on debt negotiations and relaxes rules for converting debt into equity.
""(The new law) is a more efficient tool to ... sort out what parts of a business can be strong enough to survive,"" Justice Minster Monica Maeland told parliament.
Her comments were not aimed at any specific firms, but budget carrier Norwegian Air is among those likely to benefit, said Kristoffer Aaseboe, a lawyer at Oslo-based law firm Bull & Co.
""This temporary restructuring law will increase the likelihood to get restructurings in place,"" Aaseboe, who specialises in insolvency and reconstruction, told Reuters.
The airline is seeking to convert debt to equity to qualify for state guarantees in a bid to survive the coronavirus crisis, which has grounded all but a handful of its nearly 160 aircraft.
The law will mean only 50% of the debtors and 50% of shareholders have to agree to a solution, which is less strict than under the current law, Bull & Co lawyer Klemet Gaski said.
Norwegian Air this week said four of its Swedish and Danish subsidiaries had filed for bankruptcy and that it had ended staffing contracts in Europe and the United States, putting some 4,700 jobs at risk.
The company still aims to emerge from the crisis, and will hold meetings of bondholders and shareholders ahead of a vote on its proposed plan on May 4.

Norwegian Air declined to comment on Friday.

196,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 08:25AM ET</span>","Here's why you can't find frozen fries, while U.S. farmers are sitting on tons of potatoes","By Lisa Baertlein
(Reuters) - Shopper Lexie Mayewski is having a hard time finding frozen french fries in Washington, D.C.-area supermarkets in the wake of coronavirus-fueled stockpiling. 
On the other side of the country, Washington state farmer Mike Pink is weighing whether to plow under 30 tons of potatoes worth millions of dollars that would have been turned into french fries for fast-food chains like McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), Wendy's Co and Chick-fil-A.
Their incongruent experiences underscore how America's highly specialized and inflexible retail and foodservice supply chains are contributing to food shortages and waste in the wake of demand disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Frozen french fry sales at grocery stores spiked 78.6% for the four-week period ended April 4, according to Nielsen data, resulting in shortages at many U.S. supermarkets. 
Mayewski, 25, a construction manager, has not seen frozen fries at the Giant Food or Safeway supermarkets near her Maryland home. 
""There's not a single french fry to be found,"" said Mayewski, whose supply of frozen shoestring and waffle fries was running low. 
Frozen fries are an ideal pandemic staple - offering comfort, convenience and long-shelf life for U.S. families accustomed to fast-food meals and school cafeteria lunches. 
The main hurdle is the extra-large size of foodservice packages that are meant for kitchens that turn out dozens if not hundreds of meals each day. 
""Think Costco, but bigger,"" said International Foodservice Distributors Association (IFDA) CEO Mark Allen, referring to the oversized products sold at warehouse retailer Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST).
Nondescript foodservice packaging also does not have the ingredient and nutrition labels required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the bar codes needed in grocery checkout lanes. 
While the FDA has said it would temporarily relax labeling rules and protect consumers with food allergies, foodservice suppliers still face significant hurdles switching to retail-friendly formats. New equipment for packing and labeling product is expensive, and plastic containers are in short supply. 
FREEZERS FULL OF FRIES
Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co's Ore-Ida, the main producer of frozen fries for supermarkets, is rushing to bolster supplies. 
""Our Ore-Ida factory is running at full capacity to keep up with demand,"" Kraft spokesman Michael Mullen said. 
At the same time, major fast-food french fry suppliers McCain Foods, J.R. Simplot Co and Lamb Weston Holdings Inc are canceling potato orders. 
Fast-food suppliers' freezers are full of frozen fries, hash browns and potato skins and their storage sheds are packed with potatoes, farmers and experts told Reuters. 
Their demand is down because four in 10 U.S. restaurants are closed, as are schools, hotels and workplaces. Fast-food chains are doing drive-through only, and with no set date for lifting stay-at-home orders, the outlook for the foodservice industry is dim. 
Lamb Weston, McCain and Simplot - which supply the lion's share of McDonald's french fries - did not respond to requests for comment. Lamb Weston also does retail sales.
Pink, who farms near Pasco, Washington, said fast-food french fry suppliers canceled orders for 1,000 acres of potatoes. He has already invested $2.5 million on those crops. Each acre produces roughly 30 tons of potatoes and getting them ready for sale would cost Pink another $1.5 million. He may have to plow the potatoes under - adding to food destruction in the U.S. produce and dairy sectors. 
""Do I continue to invest or do I stop and try to minimize my loss?"" asked Pink. ""It's just devastating."" 
The National Potato Council said there are $750 million to$1.3 billion in potatoes and potato products clogged in the pipeline. 
""It's a huge challenge. Nobody was prepared. Nobody could imagine that this could happen,"" Rabobank food analyst JP Frossard said.
Grocery consultants and retailers told Reuters that foodservice products like toilet paper, cleaning supplies and meat have found their way into the retail channel, while many others have not. 
Compounding problems, most foodservice operators do not have connections at supermarkets - where adding a new product can take several months. 

""It would be a Herculean task,"" Allen said of rerouting supplies. And with all the uncertainty around demand, he added, ""the investment would be tough to justify.""

The pandemic has hammered the global economy, hurting consumers' ability to make payments on their credit cards. The lockdowns around the world are also hitting transaction volume as people stay at home.
""In light of the current environment, we are aggressively reducing costs across the enterprise"", said Chief Executive Officer Stephen Squeri, adding that the deterioration in the economy due to the virus accelerated in April and has dramatically impacted its volumes.
However, shares of the company were up nearly 2%, as it kept a tight lid on costs to weather the impact of the pandemic on its business.
Total expenses were down 5% at $7.2 billion, due to lower operating expenses in the reported quarter. AmEx spent $2.39 billion on card member rewards, down 2% from a year earlier. 
The company's net income fell to $367 million, or 41 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31 from $1.55 billion, or $1.80 per share, a year earlier.
Consolidated provisions for losses rose to $2.6 billion from $809 million in the year-ago period.

Total revenue, excluding interest expense, fell to $10.3 billion from $10.4 billion.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Facebook's (O:FB) $5.7 billion investment in Reliance (NS:RELI) promises to be the biggest headache yet for Paytm, a SoftBank-backed pioneer in India's digital payments market but which has been losing ground to rivals with deeper pockets.
Facebook's WhatsApp, which has been working on gaining regulatory approval for payments services in India, is gearing up for a full rollout of those services by June, according to a source familiar with the matter.
The partnership with Reliance, announced on Wednesday, will give WhatsApp an inside track on payments for Reliance's retail unit, which aims to serve tens of millions of small shops across India. It will also be able to link up with Reliance's telecoms business, which has taken the market by storm since its launch in late 2016, and WhatsApp itself has an enormous presence in India with more than 400 million users.
""If someone would have lost sleep as the Facebook-Reliance deal was announced, it must be Vijay Shekhar Sharma,"" said a second source, referring to Paytm's founder.
The source, who has close ties to both Reliance and Paytm, declined to be identified to protect business interests.
Compared to other major players in India's digital payments markets, Paytm is seen as more vulnerable to attack, already on the backfoot amid competition from Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) Google Pay and Walmart's (N:WMT) PhonePe.
While having previously attracted investments from the likes of Japan's SoftBank (T:9984), China's  Alibaba  (N:BABA) and U.S.-based Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa), it lacks its own wells of capital for funding, putting it at a disadvantage.
Paytm also remains unprofitable, with its parent firm reporting a loss of over $500 million in the year ended March 2019. 
Launched a decade ago as a platform for mobile recharging, Paytm grew quickly after ride-hailing firm Uber (N:UBER) listed it as a quick payment option. Its use swelled further in 2016 when a ban on high-value currency notes spurred digital payments.
But it underestimated the impact of a state-backed digital payment system that was rolled out in 2016. On that network, Google Pay and PhonePe together accounted for nearly 80% of 1.31 billion transactions in January. Paytm was a distant third with about 10%, according to data from payments firm Razorpay. 
India's digital payments market is expected to more than double in size to $135 billion in 2023 from 2019 levels, according to a study by PwC and Indian industry lobby group ASSOCHAM.
Individual market share can, however, be difficult to assess. Paytm has branched out into services including insurance and gold sales, movie and flight ticketing, and bank deposits and remittances.
Paytm declined to comment.
GOLIATH-LIKE OPPONENT 
Paytm has long seen the threat posed by WhatsApp, and when the messaging service launched a trial of its payment services in early 2018, Sharma accused Facebook of ""cheap tricks"".
Paytm was also part of a lobbying campaign against U.S. firms over local data storage - an issue now mostly resolved but which had been an impediment to WhatsApp gaining regulatory approval. With Reliance behind it, WhatsApp's path to final approval for the payment service is now expected to be smooth.
On one hand, the market is expanding, and sources familiar with the matter say Paytm has seen a boost in transactions as the COVID-19 crisis pushes commerce online.
But the Reliance-Facebook combination represents a Goliath-like opponent, especially given Reliance's track record in decimating rivals when it entered the telecoms market with Jio Infocomm and cut-throat pricing.
""This is a formidable combination of bandwidth and platform player so it will easily shake up the payments industry,"" said Ashvin Parekh, an independent financial services consultant.
He added that in any bruising battle over digital payments, a telecom firm like Reliance's Jio would be hard to beat as it has far more insight into consumer data habits and a greater number of stores to reach potential customers.
Paytm has raised more than $3 billion since it was founded, with the most recent infusion of $1 billion coming last autumn. But should it need more, fundraising now looks far more difficult. SoftBank, its biggest investor, has problems of its own and has backed away from pouring more funds into money-losing startups.

A recent move by India to intensify scrutiny of Chinese investments in the country could also complicate any future fundraising efforts.

The company said on Friday it now expects earnings per share to be flat, within a range of 4 percentage points, predicting that lockdowns will generate ""significant headwinds"" in the current quarter. It also set aside $228 million in provisions against possible non-payment of bills as customers fall on hard times. Over 26 million Americans have lost their jobs in the last five weeks.
Verizon, which also withdrew its guidance for 2020 revenues entirely, had earlier expected EPS growth of around 3% from last year. 
First-quarter adjusted earnings came in slightly ahead of expectations at $1.26 but were hit by a pre-tax loss from special items of about $1.4 billion, caused largely by a $1.2 billion loss related to the FCC's recently completed spectrum Auction 103. It also took another net charge of $182 million as it marked its pension liabilities to market. 
However, the company said it won't cut capital spending, which it still expects to be between $17.5 and $18.5 billion. It had $7 billion cash on hand at the end of the quarter.
""We will emerge from this crisis stronger, knowing we provided critical connectivity to our customers, and especially our first responders, while maintaining our commitment to investing in our 5G and Fiber strategies,"" chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg said in a statement.
Revenue fell to $31.61 billion from $34.78 billion three months earlier, as the pandemic depressed advertising rates at its media business. In the core telecoms business showed mixed results, with losses in consumer subscriptions almost being compensated by gains in business customers. 
Verizon shares are down 6% from the beginning of the year , still down 7.44% from its 52 week high of $62.22 set on December 20, 2019. They are outperforming the S&P 500 which is down 13.77% year to date.
Verizon shares were unchanged in premarket trade following the report, underperforming a broader market that was around 0.5% higher.
 
Verizon's report follows an earnings missed by AT&T on Wednesday, who reported EPS of $0.84 on revenue of $42.78B, compared to forecasts EPS of $0.85 on revenue of $44.33B.

The union had contended that keeping these aisles open put staff needlessly at risk of infection.
According to the ruling of the court in Lille, in northern France, seen by Reuters, a March 23 decree prohibiting French people from leaving their home during lockdown, apart for notably buying essential items, did provide a complete list of what was an essential item.
Thus, operating aisles offering products other than food, hygiene or pharma products was not illegal.
It was also not proven that keeping these aisles open increased risk for staff and customers following social distancing rules.
CGT union representative Amar Lagha told Reuters: ""We will try to find other loopholes. We are convinced that in the interest of staff safety we must shut these aisles,""
Carrefour, Europe's largest retailer, said it acknowledged the court's decision.
The ruling comes as unions pressure companies that are still operating during the lockdown. 
A French court earlier this month ordered e-commerce giant Amazon (O:AMZN) to restrict its deliveries to essentials such as groceries and medical supplies while it makes thorough safety checks. 

A French court will later on Friday decide whether to back Amazon's appeal against the ruling, which has forced it to close its French warehouses until April 25.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global oil supplies may be 6% less than expected by 2030 because of delays to investments by energy companies in response to falling crude prices due to the coronavirus crisis, data from energy analysts at Rystad showed.
Oil and gas companies across the world have slashed investment budgets, exiting projects or delaying bringing them onstream to counter a fall in crude prices to record lows due to a supply glut as the coronavirus outbreak destroyed demand. 
Graphic - Oil, gas companies' spending cuts per region - Woodmac: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/gjnvweggkvw/Oil%20and%20gas%20companies%20spending%20cuts%20per%20region%20-Woodmac.png
Delayed final investment decisions (FID) for projects which take years to come on stream are already expected to shrink global supply of oil and gas by 5.6% by 2025, with the majority of the revisions coming from shale oil, mostly found in the United States, Rystad said.
Continental Resources (N:CLR), the largest oil producer in North Dakota has halted most of its production in the U.S. state and notified some customers it would not supply crude after prices dived into negative territory this week, people familiar with the matter said. 
All this leaves the global oil and gas supply on track to drop off by 6.3% by 2030 compared with what was expected before the price crash, the Rystad data showed.
Graphic - Project delays to throttle future oil, gas output - Rystad: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/jbyvrjooave/Project%20delays%20to%20throttle%20future%20output.png
It estimates that $195 billion worth of non-shale projects are being delayed, most of which are gas and gas condensate field developments. Geographically the biggest slump is in the Middle East in that group.

Excluding the North American shale sector, energy analysts at Wood Mackenzie (Woodmac) reckon only about 10-15 large upstream projects have a ""reasonable chance"" of receiving a final investment green light this year, a level last seen during the post-2014 oil price crash.
That compares with around 50 projects tapping reserves of over 50 million barrels of oil equivalent each which had been pencilled in for a final investment decision this year before oil prices plummeted, according to Woodmac.

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects are also suffering.
""2020 was also set to be the record high year for LNG developments. The price crash and dip in global LNG demand delays FID of 7 LNG plants globally,"" Rystad analysts said in their report.

At 07:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 25 points, or 0.9%, higher, Nasdaq futures up 62 points, or 0.7%. The Dow futures contract rose 187 points, or 0.8%.
The Dow and S&P 500 cash indices are on course for their best months since October 2011.
President Donald Trump is expected to sign into law later Friday a $484 billion coronavirus relief bill, which was passed by a large, bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives on Thursday. 
This would be the fourth bill passed to address the crisis, bringing the total amount of funds approved to try and tackle the economic damage done by the crowd-distancing measures taken to combat the virus to an unprecedented $3 trillion.

""We revised the outlooks because we expect the economic strain stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic to put prolonged pressure on the asset quality and revenue of the banking groups,"" S&P said in a statement.
The revisions affect the ratings on core subsidiaries of Japan's three major banking groups and their holding companies, which are Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (T:8306),  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial  Group (T:8316) and Mizuho Financial Group (T:8411), the rating agency said.
""Creditworthiness of the three banking groups has come under pressure as credit costs rise, unrealized gains on marketable securities fluctuate, and impairment risk grows,"" it said.
Under a stimulus package unveiled to combat the fallout from the virus, the government has urged financial institutions to offer loans at effectively zero interest to small firms suffering that are slumping sales from the pandemic.
The request exposes Japan's commercial banks, many of which were already faced with falling profits from years of ultra-low interest rates, to the risk of being saddled with huge bad loans that could erode their financial health.

The Bank of Japan warned in a report on Tuesday that the coronavirus pandemic, if prolonged, could trigger a negative feedback loop in which a worsening economy threatens to destabilise Japan's financial system.

206,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 06:50AM ET</span>",Big Oil investors to look past earnings pain and focus on dividends,"By Ron Bousso and Jennifer Hiller
LONDON/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Investors already braced for poor first-quarter earnings from major oil and gas companies next week will focus on how executives plan to save cash and whether they will cut dividends following the collapse in oil prices.
The five biggest U.S. and European firms, known as the Oil Majors, have announced spending cuts averaging 23% in a rapid response to the precipitous fall in oil demand because of the coronavirus pandemic and a 65% slump in crude prices.
With the rout likely to extend for months, the pressure on balance sheets remains extreme as very few parts of oil company businesses make money at the current oil price of $20 a barrel. 
""This remains a brutal business environment,""  BP  (L:BP) Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney said on Thursday.
From  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) to Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), companies have put projects on hold, slashed production in U.S. shale fields and reduced operations at refineries to deal with the double whammy of a drop in demand and a supply glut.
But more steps are likely to be needed and investors will be watching closely for changes to output forecasts and to see how companies plan to manage dividends, the most important incentive for shareholders worth more than $40 billion combined last year.
""The look back into what was a weak first quarter seems almost irrelevant. The game plan for dealing with the next three months and the next 18 months is going to be the focus,"" said Jefferies analyst Jason Gammel. 
BP will be the first Oil Major to report first-quarter results on Tuesday, with Shell on Thursday, Exxon and  Chevron  (N:CVX) on Friday and France's  Total  (PA:TOTF) on May 5.
Italy's  ENI  (MI:ENI) reported a 94% slump in net profit on Friday and lowered its spending and production forecasts while Norway's Equinor (OL:EQNR) will report on May 7.
Oilfield services providers Halliburton (N:HAL), Schlumberger (N:SLB) and Baker Hughes (N:BKR) have also already taken huge earnings hits in the first quarter.
DIVIDEND TABOO?
Oil company boards have historically refrained from cutting dividends during previous crises, resorting to measures such as borrowing money or offering discounted shares instead of cash.
But Equinor surprised the market on Thursday by becoming the first big oil company to cut its dividend, slashing its first-quarter payout by two thirds and suspending a $5 billion share buyback programme.
Most oil companies have tapped debt markets in recent weeks to build cash reserves, raising at least $50 billion combined.
Exxon, for example, issued $18 billion of bonds in March and April, up from $7 billion in total last year while Shell has lined up a over $20 billion in new financing in recent weeks.
Some investors, however, have called on them to break the dividend taboo instead, because debt levels are already high. 
The sector's dividend yield - the ratio of the dividend to the share price - soared to its highest in decades following the slide in oil prices and stock markets in the first-quarter. A high dividend yield can imply investors are assigning a higher degree of risk to a company's dividend.
Jennifer Rowland, an analyst at Edward Jones, said the dividend outlook was stable for Exxon, Chevron, Shell and Total though BP may have to look at its dividend payouts. ""Unlike peers, BP's balance sheet is not yet strong enough to withstand a prolonged period of low commodity prices,"" she said.
BP declined to comment.

MAJOR CHALLENGE
First-quarter net income for the sector as a whole is set to fall to its lowest in at least four years, according to Refinitiv forecasts based on analyst estimates.
But the results are only likely to be a prelude to a disastrous second quarter, when the full impact on fuel demand from travel restrictions on more than half of the world's population will be felt. 
Benchmark Brent crude oil prices averaged $50 a barrel in the first quarter, down about 20% from the previous quarter and a year earlier. But Brent futures (LCOc1) were trading at below $22 a barrel on Friday.
""(Boards) will be asked about plans for operating and capital cost reductions to survive $30 oil for an extended period,"" said Doug Terreson, analyst at Evercore ISI.
Most of the big oil companies require Brent to be at least $40 a barrel to generate profits so more spending cuts will be needed, he said.
The current downturn challenges the Oil Majors' model, which includes oil and gas production, refineries and large petrol station networks, in an unprecedented way. 
In previous crises, including the most recent 2014 oil price rout, global consumption rose sharply in response to low prices, allowing refining and retail operations, known as downstream, to offset weaker revenue from crude, or upstream, production.
This time round, both upstream and downstream are in trouble, with global oil demand expected to drop by up to a third in the second quarter and then recover only gradually.

Exxon has already said in a filing that its first-quarter results would be hit by drop in earnings from oil and gas production of about $1.4 billion and about $800 million from refining compared with the fourth quarter.

China cut subsidies on electric vehicles by 10% this year, effective April 23, but there will be a three-month transition period.
After the adjustment, the starting price for the Shanghai-made Standard Range Model 3 sedans will rise to 303,550 yuan ($42,900) from 299,050 yuan, while Long Range Model 3 cars, which Tesla plans to roll out from June this year, will be priced at 344,050 yuan versus 339,050 yuan, a company website showed.
Prices for those models before subsidies remain unchanged.
Tesla, which started delivering cars from its $2 billion Shanghai factory last year, saw its China registrations rose to 12,709 units in March from 2,314 in February.
The subsidies will apply only to passenger cars costing less than 300,000 yuan ($42,376) after the transition period. China will also in principle cut subsidies by 20% in 2021 and 30% in 2022.
Hit by the coronavirus epidemic, China's overall car sales fell 42% in the first three months compared with a year earlier. But the auto industry expects sales to recover as the government promises more supportive policies to boost consumption.

209,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 06:00AM ET</span>",Land Bank debt default draws attention to South African state firms' finances,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A South African state-owned bank which lends to the agricultural sector said on Friday it had defaulted on payments on two bond programmes worth a combined 50 billion rand ($2.62 billion), highlighting the weakness of state enterprises in the country.
Ratings agency Fitch had already said on Thursday that the lender, Land Bank, had defaulted on debt and that risks posed by state-owned enterprises had been a factor in its decision to lower South Africa’s credit rating this month to BB, from BB+.
Land Bank is one of several state-owned firms that are facing financial difficulties and piling pressure on President Cyril Ramaphosa's cash-strapped government as it scrambles to revive a recession hit-economy.
The bank, which funds commercial and emerging farmers, said on Monday that it was experiencing a liquidity shortfall and was in talks with various stakeholders to address its financial obligations.
The lender warned investors that it was at risk of defaulting on its 20 billion rand Domestic Medium Term Note (DMTN) Programme dated 18 October 2010 and its 30 Billion rand DMTN Programme dated 13 March 2017.
""Those defaults have subsequently occurred,"" the lender said in a statement dated April 23, but issued on Friday. 
Fitch said Land Bank’s [SAFLAB.UL] default could influence the ratings agency's assessment of other state-owned enterprises including transport and logistics group Transnet (TRAN.UL) and power utility Eskom.
Eskom has been mired in a financial crisis for many years.
""Both Transnet and Eskom have ongoing requirements to access capital markets,"" Fitch said in its statement on Thursday. ""If Land Bank’s default influences investor perceptions of government support it could affect this access, particularly for Eskom.""
South African Airways is also fighting for its survival after it entered a form of bankruptcy protection in December.
Land Bank, which had a gross loan book of around 45.2 billion rand in 2019, is a key lender in the agricultural sector, with a market share of 29% of South Africa's agricultural debt, according to industry body Agri SA.
The National Treasury said assistance in the form of recapitalisation and further guarantees was under consideration. 
""[This] would have to be accompanied by balance sheet optimisation of the Land Bank to correct the structural liquidity risk embedded in the balance sheet,"" the Treasury said in a statement. 
Fitch said it expected government support for development banks to continue.
""We expect the government to continue to support the development banks, as they are an important part of the government's strategy to maintain and expand investment in the context of rising constraints on direct fiscal spending,"" Fitch said.

210,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 05:27AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Nestle, Ocado Stand out as Reality Catches up with Europe","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Reality caught up with Europe’s stock markets in a big way in early trading Friday.
By 5:25 AM ET (0925 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 0.7% at 331.24, on track to end the week around 0.6% lower. The U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.9% and the Dax was down 1.2%. 
Fresh economic data showed the biggest monthly drop ever in U.K. retail sales (despite a heroic 32% increase in alcohol sales that says a lot about how Brits are coping with the crisis), while Germany’s Ifo index – historically the best guide to developments in Europe’s largest economy – fell to its lowest ever reading.
That came on top of disappointment at the first trial results for Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ:GILD) experimental antiviral drug remdesivir as a treatment for Covid-19, hopes for which had been high.  The chance of the pharma sector finding a way to make the virus go away overnight was never high, given the complexity and rigor of testing procedures – something that investors in Gilead in particular had lost sight of in recent days.
To make things worse, Thursday’s EU summit delivered only the bare minimum of progress on financing the recovery from a pandemic that will shrink the European economy by between 5% and 15% this year, according to European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde. Sovereign yield spreads have widened again on Friday morning, putting fresh pressure on banking stocks in Spain and Italy.   
Europe’s Old Guard of national champions provided plenty of reason for pessimism with their quarterly updates. Lufthansa shares fell 7.3% after the airline warned it could run out of cash within weeks, after posting a 1.2 billion-euro operating loss in the first quarter.
Italian oil and gas giant Eni’s shares fell 2.2% after it said first-quarter profit fell 94% and forecast that output would fall this year, even before taking any mandated production cuts from ‘OPEC+’ members into account.  
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) shares fell 2.2% and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) shares fell 3.8% after Standard & Poor’s cut the rating of the former and lowered the outlook for the latter in a wholesale downgrade of Germany's banking sector.
One of the few bright spots among blue chips was Nestle (SIX:NESN), which rose 3.0% after it reported its fastest organic sales growth in five years - a sharp contrast to stagnation at rival  Unilever  (LON:ULVR). The owner of Nespresso and KitKat is now back within 2% of its pre-crisis high.
Another winner was Ocado  (LON:OCDO), the maker of logistics software for supermarkets. It rose 1.1% to within 1% of a new all-time high after the U.K. retail sales data confirmed an acceleration of the trend toward online shopping.
Finally, Lysol maker  Reckitt Benckiser  (LON:RB) got a 1% bump after President Donald Trump touted the benefits of disinfectant in his daily briefing on Thursday. His speculation that it could be injected into humans to help treat the virus met, however, with widespread skepticism from scientists."
211,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 04:25AM ET</span>",Coronavirus stockpiling drives best Nestle sales growth in years,"By Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - Swiss food giant Nestle (S:NESN) reported its best quarterly sales growth in nearly five years on Friday as consumers stockpiled everything from Purina pet food to Nescafe coffee to frozen meals to prepare for coronavirus lockdowns.
Sales in North America and Europe were particularly strong in March, helping to drive an overall rise of 4.3% in the first three months of the year, the fastest quarterly growth in nearly five years and above analyst expectations for a 3% increase.
In North America, Purina Pet care sales rose by a double-digit percentage while Nescafe and Coffee Mate drinks had high single-digit increases. Consumers also grabbed more DiGiorno and Hot Pockets frozen meals, giving some respite to the business that has struggled recently.
In Europe, Middle East and North Africa, most categories of Nestle product won market share, the company said. Maggi noodles and plant-based products from its Garden Gourmet brand did well, though water sales declined as fewer people ate out.
""A majority of markets, particularly in North America and Europe, saw significantly increased growth in March, partially supported by consumer stockpiling,"" Nestle said in a statement.
Nestle shares were 1.4% higher in early trading on Friday, outperforming the Swiss blue-chip index.
Analysts at Jefferies said Nestle was outperforming rivals, trading at 24.8 times forward earnings compared with 20.9 times for  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNA) and 14.5 times for  Danone  (PA:DANO).
Unilever said on Thursday its underlying sales remained flat in the first quarter. Unilever has a bigger exposure to emerging markets where the coronavirus hit earlier, triggering stringent lockdowns that curbed consumer spending. 
For Nestle, underlying sales in Asia fell 4.6% as customers in China stayed away from restaurants and shops for much of the quarter though online sales there jumped. The Swiss company also said prices had dropped in both North America and Europe.
NEW INITIATIVES 
Nestle said it was launching a 500 million Swiss franc ($512 million) programme to help the cafes and restaurants it supplies by extending payment terms and suspending rental fees for coffee machines. It also agreed to maintain orders from its dairy suppliers who have faced ""significant demand disruptions."" 
Nestle also announced that it was exploring strategic options, including a sale of its struggling Yinlu peanut milk and canned rice porridge businesses in China. The businesses generated sales of 700 million Swiss francs last year.
The company also kept its outlook for the year, which targets continued improvement in organic sales growth, which strips out the impact of acquisitions or divestments, and a higher underlying operating profit margin. 
""Despite the ongoing challenges in the supply chain and ... fast-changing consumer needs, the company was able to deliver strong growth,"" Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said, adding that the confirmation of its 2020 goals showed Nestle's ability to navigate the coronavirus crisis. 

Taking account of changes to its product portfolio, total sales for the three months to the end of March fell 6.2% to 20.8 billion Swiss francs ($21.3 billion), mainly due to the sale of its Skin Health and U.S. ice cream business last year.

212,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 03:55AM ET</span>",The growing worry for bondholders: Getting 'primed',"By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bondholders in particularly hard-hit sectors like energy, travel and leisure have another issue to watch for as companies struggle to survive the economic shutdown - getting demoted by new debt issues. 
This phenomenon is known in the market as getting ""primed"" or ""layered,"" where a company in need of cash offers a bond backed by collateral, called secured debt, which has seniority over any previously issued unsecured debt. Being at the top of the capital structure means that in a bankruptcy those investors get paid back first. 
Since the start of the coronavirus epidemic, this has happened to investors in the debt of movie theater chain AMC Entertainment (N:AMC), theme parks Six Flags Entertainment (N:SIX) and Cedar Fair (N:FUN), propane supplier Ferrellgas Partners  and cruise line Carnival Corp (N:CCL), according to a Reuters analysis. Of the new issues currently trading, all are priced far higher than where the remainder of the company's debt is trading.
""Many companies, especially in high yield, are going to look for ways... to come up with a debt offering that is sellable, period,"" said Tom Graff, head of fixed income at Brown Advisory. ""The most obvious way to do that is to secure the new bonds, but that 'primes' old bondholders, effectively reducing the security for the old holders in favor of the new buyers."" 
Graff said that lately companies had been forced to give bond buyers more security in these deals, but said if they need to come back to market because the public health crisis drags on, ""that's going to get tough.""
AMC Entertainment, which had faced industry-wide headwinds prior to the pandemic, approached the debt market with generous terms on a $500 million bond: secured debt and a hefty coupon of 10.5%, about twice the cost of its previous issues.
One of the largest holders of AMC's unsecured debt, a portfolio manager who requested anonymity for compliance reasons, said that could make existing bondholders worse off and that higher leverage would make it more difficult to turn around the business. 
AMC, Ferrellgas, Six Flags and Carnival did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson from Cedar Fair declined to comment. 
The past decade of cheap borrowing and low yields has allowed issuers to chip away at traditional investor protections. 
About 80% of high-yield North American debt issued since 2011 is unsecured. Priming investors is allowable under the terms of most unsecured debt.
The majority of unsecured high-yield bonds issued since 2011 include terms which allow the company to issue new subordinating secured debt - without consulting bondholders - worth an average of 3.2 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to Evan Friedman, head of covenant research at Moody's. That is up from an average 2.8 times EBITDA for high yield bonds issued in that period that are now inactive, indicating subordinating debt restrictions have loosened. 
The last sustained spate of priming happened during the energy crisis of 2014-2016 which saw companies like Energy XXI offer a $1.45 billion secured deal in March 2015, demoting its unsecured bondholders. 
The chances of being primed are lower in less volatile markets as it is often a last resort for companies, who do not want to annoy potential bond buyers. Multiple investors and analysts say the expected wave of coronavirus-driven bankruptcies has significantly increased the rate of priming in the last month and will continue to do so. S&P Global predicts that the default rate will increase to 10% in the next year, from 3.1% at the end of 2019. 
Not all secured debt jumps to the front of the line, given that bank loans typically have seniority in the capital structure, but ""being primed is relative to other bondholders,"" said Brian Kloss, global credit portfolio manager at Brandywine Global. 

""Due the extreme impact (of the coronavirus epidemic) on business models, being primed has become an issue that may not have been an issue under more normal circumstances,"" said Kloss.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed sharply lower Friday amid disappointment over the reduced likelihood of a quick end to the coronavirus outbreak and concerns at the European policy response to it.
At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index traded 1.4% lower, France's CAC 40 and the DAX both fell 1.8%. The broader based Stoxx 600 Europe index dropped 1.3%. 
Doubts have emerged over the efficacy of Gilead Sciences’ (NASDAQ:GILD) antiviral drug remdesivir in treating the Covid-19, after the Financial Times reported overnight that it had failed its first randomized clinical trial.
Gilead disputed the report, saying that the trial was ""inconclusive"", but the news was taken badly as the drug was previously thought to be one of the best prospects for treating the virus and thus quickly bringing the pandemic to a close.
Markets were also disappointed by the failure of an EU summit to provide any details about a post-pandemic recovery fund, both as regards its size and the method of financing it. 
 European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde reportedly told the meeting that the European Union’s economy could shrink by as much as 15% this year. A best-case estimate was a contraction of 5% she added. 
EU Industry Commissioner Thierry Breton was slightly more optimistic Friday when he stated the EU was heading this year towards a 5%-10% economic contraction. 
""As of today, in the European Union, we're on course for a 5% to 10% (recession), meaning it's about 7.5%. But that is today, and if things don't improve and if we have a second peak (of the outbreak), things could get worse"", Breton said on France 2 television.
The banking sector has been in the spotlight Friday, after Thursday’s move by S&P to cut Commerzbank (DE:CBKG)'s credit rating by a notch to BBB+, and lowered its outlook for  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to negative from stable. Commerzbank’s shares dropped 3.9% and Deutsche Bank shares fell 4.9%.
The oil market has pushed higher Friday, but still remains under pressure given the global supply glut. Eni shares fell 2.9% after the Italian major said first-quarter profit fell 94%, and cut its forecasts for production and capital spending further. 
Airline stocks were also under pressure after Lufthansa posted an operating loss of 1.2 billion euros in the first quarter and warned it could run out of cash within weeks. Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) shares fell 7.7% to their lowest in over 15 years.
At 4 AM ET, U.S. crude June futures traded 1.5% higher at $16.75 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.4% to $21.63.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,750.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0764, down 0.3% on the day.

Sales including auto fuel declined a record 5.1% in March from February, the biggest drop since at least 1996, the Office for National Statistics said Friday. Sales excluding fuel dropped 3.7%.
The figures lay bare the unrepresented damage the virus is inflicting on the U.K.’s already struggling retail industry, and worse could still be to come.
By the end of March only supermarkets, pharmacies and other essential stores remained open after Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered Britons to stay at home, and those shops are not set to re-open until at least May. The retail sales survey covered the period from March 1 to April 4.
Clothing stores saw sales plummet 35%, the worst performer among non-food stores, where sales fell by more than 19% as a whole.
The only hints of good news for the industry came in food sales, which climbed a record 10.4% after being boosted by panic buying in the early part of the month. Meanwhile, shoppers also increasingly turned to the Internet, with online sales as a proportion of all retailing reached a record high of 22.3%.

GfK said its measure of sentiment was at -34 in April, close to the troughs seen during the financial crisis in 2008. Households had become marginally less bleak about the outlook for their personal finances over the coming year, but the index of major purchases remained week.
Britons have been in government-imposed lockdown since March 23 with schools, non-essential stops and most workplaces shuttered. Travel out of the home is restricted to food shopping and exercise.
“It is impossible to say if this is at the bottom after weeks of adjustment to the reality of lockdown life, or if further falls are to come,” said GfK Client Strategy Director Joe Staton. “Despite households making online purchases of home cooking equipment, freezers, TVs, monitors and other goods, these surges in demand have not compensated for the loss of overall retail sales due to the closure of physical stores.”

221,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 11:09PM ET</span>",Malaysia Bonds Are Rallying But Oil Clouds Outlook,"(Bloomberg) -- Malaysia’s bonds have been the top performers in emerging Asia after the Philippines this month as traders bet on further policy easing, but plummeting oil prices may be about to draw a line under further gains.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year security has dropped more than 40 basis points in April as investors have piled into longer maturities after the yield curve climbed to the steepest in more than three years.
Demand for Malaysia’s debt has been bolstered by expectations the central bank will lower its overnight policy rate by at least another 25 basis points in coming months to help cushion the economy from the impact of the coronavirus. Bank Negara Malaysia, which has already cut its benchmark by 50 basis points this year, next meets on May 5.
Malaysia’s bonds have so far proved largely impervious to the slump in crude, but this might start to change if it becomes clear the oil glut will prove more than a temporary disruption. Malaysia derives about 20% of its revenue from energy-related sources, according to DBS Group Holdings Ltd., meaning a sustained decline in prices will eventually feed through into its long-term finances.
The government is forecasting a fiscal deficit of about 4% of gross domestic product this year, but this is based on a Brent crude assumption of $35 to $40 a barrel. The London benchmark tumbled to $15.98 this week, the lowest since 1999. The central bank said earlier this month that GDP might contract as much as 2% this year, or grow as much as 0.5%, estimates that are not too distant from those of its neighbors. Indonesia is predicting an expansion of 2.3%, while Thailand has forecast minus 5.3%.
At least in the short term though, the improvement in emerging-market funding conditions bodes well for the nation’s local-currency assets. Hedging costs in ringgit basis swaps have declined from the middle of March, bolstered by the central bank’s reported access to direct dollar funding with the Federal Reserve via a repurchase agreement facility.
These improving conditions may have encouraged the offshore interest that helped Malaysian bonds outperform this month. The surge in demand was also precipitated by surprisingly robust April 14 auction of mostly domestically-held Islamic-compliant 10-year debt. Bids at the offering outstripped supply by more than three to one, leaving behind a reservoir of foreign funds and real-money onshore players who decided to boost purchases of longer maturities in the secondary market instead.
Whether the more positive tailwind from overseas buyers will help offset any impact from the oil turmoil the next few weeks are likely to reveal.

222,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 10:44PM ET</span>",Asian Stocks Down as Gilead’s Remdesivir Reported to Have Failed Clinical Trials,"By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asian stock markets were down on Friday morning, failing to hold onto their gains from the day before.
Down Under, the ASX 200 was the lone bright spot. It gained 0.63% by 10:34 PM ET (3:34 AM GMT).
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 0.84% even as the Bank of Japan contemplated replacing its government bond-purchase target to allow unlimited buying. Neighboring South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.60%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 0.49%. Elsewhere in Greater China, China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.61% and the Shenzhen Component gave up earlier gains to lose 0.28%.
The slide came as investors digested Thursday’s Financial Times report that Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ:GILD) antiviral drug remdesivir failed its first randomized clinical trials.
The trials were testing the efficacy of the drug in treating the COVID-19 virus, and their failure is viewed as a step back in the race to treat the virus. Johns Hopkins data said that there were almost 3 million global COVID-19 cases and almost 200,000 deaths as of April 24.
The company disputed the report, noting that the study was “terminated early due to low enrollment,” and left Gilead “underpowered to enable statistically meaningful conclusions. As such, the study results are inconclusive.”
The bad news kept on coming as the U.S. reported an additional 4.427 million initial jobless claims for the past week overnight. Analyst forecasts prepared by Investing.com had predicted 4.2 million claims.
“There is a long list of pretty jaw-dropping data, just in the last 24 hours,” Nerida Cole, managing director at Dixon Advisory, told Bloomberg.
“Market pricing is certainly on the optimistic side - that it will be a rosy path out of this crisis - and that’s where investors do need to be quite careful.”"

Leon Eidelman, whose $7.4 billion JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Emerging Markets Equity Fund has trounced 96% of peers through five years, said the firm forecasts 18% annualized returns for a basket of some 1,200 developing-nation stocks over the next half decade. The JPMorgan model jumped to an all-time high last month. He says his fund, which has about half its money in China and India, will do even better.
About 19% of Eidelman’s portfolio is invested in four Asian technology firms:  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., Tencent Holdings Ltd., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co., according to the latest filings compiled by Bloomberg. That’s still slightly less than their weighting on the benchmark MSCI EM Index.
“Our view is that over the next five years these businesses will emerge even bigger,” New York-based Eidelman said in an interview.
Emerging Markets May Lead the Coronavirus Rebound: John Authers
His fund, which is down 18% this year but is still beating three-quarters of peers, has dodged the chaos in crude markets by avoiding oil stocks. Eidelman said he prefers technology-focused firms including Shanghai-based pharmaceutical WuXi Biologics Cayman Inc. as well as online shopping platform Meituan Dianping in Beijing and the e-commerce company  MercadoLibre  (NASDAQ:MELI) Inc. in Buenos Aires.
Estimated earnings per share for MSCI Emerging Markets Index members in the next 12 months have been cut by 17% since the start of the year, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.
The JPMorgan fund manager is among a chorus of investors and strategists including GMO LLC, Research Affiliates LLC and Natixis Investment Managers LP touting value in emerging-market equities after the benchmark’s worst quarter since the 2008 financial crisis. Eidelman’s optimism is buoyed by his forecasts for earnings growth, dividends and currency performance as well as the cheap valuations of many developing-nation stocks.
He said the world’s top two economies, the U.S. and China, are best equipped to quickly recover from the coronavirus -- the U.S. because the dollar is the global reserve currency and China because authorities have been able to impose shutdowns without the political squabbling of other nations.
“I think both places are better off than the rest of the world,” he said.

The filing in a Delaware court sets up the first high-profile U.S. legal fight over the termination of a merger agreement because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sycamore said on Wednesday the worldwide closure of nearly all 1,600 Victoria's Secret and PINK stores, including more than a thousand stores in North America, in response to the coronavirus outbreak occurred without its permission and had breached the terms of the deal.
However, L Brands said the agreement was still valid as it was transparent with Sycamore on the steps it was taking to ""protect the Victoria's Secret business"". 
The company said Sycamore tried to renegotiate the purchase price of the 55% stake, before sending a termination notice.
Sycamore Partners did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.

227,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 07:30PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Hertz taps debt restructuring advisers as car rental demand evaporates, sources say","By Jessica DiNapoli and Mike Spector
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Hertz Global Holdings Inc  (N:HTZ) is working with debt restructuring advisers to explore options for shoring up its finances after the coronavirus pandemic killed demand for car rentals, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
The Estero, Florida-based company, whose largest shareholder is billionaire investor Carl Icahn, is reeling from the impact of the pandemic on global travel. It said this week it would lay off 10,000 people as its revenue dried up. Its workforce totaled 38,000 at the end of 2019. 
Hertz has enlisted restructuring experts at law firm White & Case LLP and investment bank Moelis & Co (N:MC) to help it address a cash crunch that has made its $17 billion debt pile potentially unsustainable, the sources said.
Hertz and its creditors are also preparing for potential negotiations on reworking the company's finances, the sources added. No debt restructuring move is imminent, according to the sources.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Representatives for Hertz, White & Case and Icahn did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A Moelis spokeswoman declined to comment. 
The American Car Rental Association, a trade group representing Hertz and its competitors including  Avis Budget  Group Inc (O:CAR) and family-owned Enterprise Holdings Inc, has been asking Congress to do more for the industry by expanding a $2.3 trillion stimulus program and advancing new legislation targeting tourism-related businesses.
""Our industry is being hurt tremendously already by the COVID-19 pandemic and there is no sign that this situation will turn around in the near future,"" the association wrote in a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in March. 
Hertz's shares have lost more than three-quarters of their value since late February, ending trading on Thursday at $3.95 and giving the company a market capitalization of roughly $561 million.
Weighing on Hertz's finances is the value of its used vehicles, which it uses to borrow against. That value has plunged as weak demand weighs on the car market.
The company said in late March it had access to about $1 billion in cash and had no significant debt maturities until next year. It also said it boosted its U.S. vehicle debt capacity by $750 million in February.
Even before the pandemic, Hertz and its peers were under financial pressure as travelers shifted to ride hailing services such as  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER). 
To combat Uber, Hertz had adopted a turnaround plan, aiming to modernize its smartphone apps and improve its management of its fleet of rental cars.
The company's bank debt was trading at roughly 70 cents on the dollar on Thursday, while bonds due in 2024 were trading at 28 cents on the dollar, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, indicating investor concerns about repayment. 

""The car rental sector has been one of the sectors most significantly affected by the shock given its sensitivity to consumer demand and sentiment,"" Moody's Investors Service wrote in March when it slashed the company's credit rating further into junk territory.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended marginally lower on Thursday after a report that an experimental antiviral drug for the coronavirus flopped in its first randomized clinical trial, denting optimism that the pandemic's impact on the labor market was nearing an end.
All three main U.S. stock indexes fell back from gains of over 1% after the Financial Times reported that a Chinese trial showed that Gilead Science's (O:GILD) remdesivir did not improve patients' condition or reduce the pathogen's presence in the bloodstream.
Gilead said results from the study were inconclusive as it was terminated early.
Last Friday, Wall Street rallied in part because of a report that COVID-19 patients in a separate study had responded positively to remdesivir. 
The market's sensitivity to news related to coronavirus therapies reflects investors' desperation for any indication of when the global economy might be able to start returning to normal.
""The hope as of last week was that Gilead could take the fear of dying off the table, which would result in a much quicker, cleaner, faster recovery. If that’s less likely today than it was yesterday, it is perfectly reasonable for the market to have sold off,"" said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors. 
Stocks rallied earlier after data that showed weekly U.S. jobless claims fell to 4.43 million from a revised 5.24 million. However, the numbers were still staggering, taking the total in the past five weeks to a record 26 million and wiping out all the jobs created since the financial crisis.
""The disappointing drug news stings, but considering another 4 million people lost their jobs, the disconnect between how well stocks have held up in the face of historically bad economic data continues,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Congress was preparing nearly $500 billion more in aid for small businesses and hospitals, which was expected to clear the House of Representatives later in the day.

U.S. stock indexes have rallied this month on a raft of global stimulus, but the benchmark S&P 500 remains more than 15% below its record high as worsening economic indicators foreshadow a deep global recession.
A survey showed U.S. business activity plumbed record lows in April, mirroring dire figures from Europe and Asia as strict stay-at-home orders crushed production, supply chains and consumer spending. 
The CBOE volatility index (VIX) has retreated from 12-year peaks hit last month, but remains well above levels seen in the past two years and analysts have warned of another sell-off as corporate America issues worrying forecasts for the year.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 0.17% to end at 23,515.26 points, while the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 0.05% to finish at 2,797.8.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) slipped 0.01% to 8,494.75.
 Las Vegas Sands  Corp (N:LVS) jumped 12% after the casino operator predicted a speedy recovery in Asia on pent-up gambling demand.
In extended trade, Intel (O:INTC) dropped over 5% after the chipmaker gave a quarterly profit forecast that missed analysts' estimates. 
In Thursday's session, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.64-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.50-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted six new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 36 new highs and 21 new lows.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ruth's Hospitality Group Inc, owner of the Ruth's Chris Steak House chain of restaurants, on Thursday said it would quickly repay $20 million of federal rescue loans it received to help maintain payroll through the coronavirus crisis, a program aimed at small businesses.
The announcement came after the U.S. Treasury said a highly valued public company would have a hard time getting a coronavirus relief loan in the next round of funding.
It also came after public pressure, with an online petition garnering more than 260,000 signatures, asking Ruth's to give back the money.
Ruth's move on Thursday was first reported the Wall Street Journal.
A spokeswoman did not respond to requests for more details about when the loan will now be repaid, and whether the company would be able to keep paying healthcare and wages or would need to seek additional financing to do so. 
There has been widespread concern that big firms took the loans even though they have other means of funding not available to mom and pop shops, many of which have received nothing from the program.
""You're going to kill your brand,"" said celebrity entrepreneur Mark Cuban said on Monday on CNBC of publicly traded companies that sought federal Paycheck Protection Program loans.
Burger chain Shake Shack (N:SHAK) earlier this week became the first public company to say it will return the funds now, rather than pay back the loan over time.
Instead, the New York-based corporation, valued on the stock market at more than $1.6 billion, was able to raise $150 million of equity capital.
Like other public companies, Ruth's qualified for the PPP funding.
""Our goal was to utilize funds to keep as many of our team members working for as long as possible, cover 100% of healthcare benefits, and position Ruth’s Chris to rebuild its workforce as quickly as possible,"" the company said in a statement obtained by Reuters.
It intended to pay back the loan according to government guidelines, but decided to accelerate the repayment ""as we learned more about the funding limitations of the program and the unintended impact.""

""We remain dedicated to protecting our hardworking team,"" the statement said. ""It is our hope that these funds are loaned to another company to protect their employees, just as we intended.""

230,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 06:15PM ET</span>",UAW says virus makes early May restart of U.S. auto plants 'too risky',"By David Shepardson and Joseph White
WASHINGTON/WARREN, Mich. (Reuters) - The head of the United Auto Workers union on Thursday said it was ""too soon and too risky"" to reopen auto plants and Michigan's economy in early May, citing insufficient scientific data and coronavirus testing to assure workplaces are safe.
The warning from UAW President Rory Gamble on Thursday afternoon came as General Motors Co (N:GM) ,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) took new steps toward reopening North American vehicle manufacturing operations in an environment where consumer demand is uncertain and worker safety paramount.
Unionized Detroit automakers and non-union German and Asian automakers have been preparing to restart U.S. vehicle making operations by early May. Companies have shifted reopening dates amid uncertainty about government stay-at-home orders.
Gamble's statement appeared to derail plans by the Detroit Three to start bringing UAW workers back to vehicle manufacturing jobs on May 4. The longer the automakers cannot produce profitable U.S.-made trucks and sport utility vehicles, the longer they burn cash. 
The UAW leader's statement was also aimed at Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who has come under pressure from conservative groups and President Donald Trump to ease coronavirus stay-at-home restrictions.
""At this point in time, the UAW does not believe the scientific data is conclusive that it is safe to have our members back in the workplace. We have not done enough testing to really understand the threat our members face,"" Gamble said.
""We strongly suggest to our companies in all sectors that an early May date is too soon and too risky to our members, their families and their communities.""
Gamble said the union was ""happy with the auto companies’ response and cooperation on working through the health and safety protocols we will need in the workplace when it is appropriate to restart.""
Earlier Thursday, GM began notifying front line managers to come back to work next week to get trained on new safety protocols designed to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus as workers return to plants. 
""What we are doing is making sure the people who are going to lead in our plant facilities, and lead period, understand the protocols well enough,"" GM's global head of manufacturing, Gerald Johnson, told Reuters in an interview Thursday at a former transmission factory in Warren, Michigan, where workers are now making face masks for donation to hospitals and GM's own use. 
Johnson spoke before Gamble issued his statement. The GM executive took questions while wearing a surgical mask and protective glasses - gear workers will be required to wear on the job as they return, he said. 
Many GM managers must now learn how to deal with ""additive and new"" safety procedures, Johnson said.
GM will not rush to ramp up production, he said. ""We think it's smart to be limited and phased in our restart,"" he added, saying it ""has to be metered by demand.""
Johnson did not say when GM plans to restart operations. Suppliers said before Thursday they expected the automaker to begin some production work May 4.
Separately, Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) said on Thursday it expects to gradually resume North American production starting May 4 and will impose significant new safety procedures after it halted operations in March because of the coronavirus outbreak.
The largest Japanese automaker said it expected production will be slow next month. The company added it was not yet clear when the industry will be allowed to resume operations in Mexico. Toyota will add temperature checks for all plant employees, personal protective gear, use ""touchless"" entrances and exits and will even bar non-emergency use of elevators.
""There is no going back to normal for the foreseeable future,"" said Toyota Motor North America chief administrative officer Chris Reynolds. He said he expected production to ramp up later in May ""to meet consumer demand,"" however.
Ford Motor Co (N:F) is considering asking some workers to return next week to prepare for restarting production, a person familiar with the matter said. But Ford said it has not decided on a date for resuming production.
 Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) previously said it hoped to resume North American production on May 4. But the company said in a statement Thursday ""we will only restart operations with safe, secure and sanitized workplaces to protect all of our employees.""

Other automakers have outlined plans to restart U.S. plants over the next two to three weeks. Honda Motor Co (T:7267) said on Thursday it was extending a shutdown of its North American auto plants by one week through May 8.

But zero production won’t mean no income.
The company’s hedge book means that DeltaSteam expects to earn close to C$40 million ($28 million) this year from positions locked in when oil was trading closer to $50 a barrel and higher, Chief Executive Officer Roger Tang said by telephone. The company is winding down production, pumping about 1,000 barrels a day from wells in the Clearwater formation near Slave Lake, less than a tenth of what the company was producing before the downturn, Tang said.
“After April, we have nothing,” he said. “We are not going to sell oil.”
Oil futures in New York collapsed this week to an unprecedented negative $40 a barrel as the coronavirus pandemic slashed demand and storage facilities filled to capacity. Before the collapse, DeltaStream would enter into hedging positions on Western Canadian Select crude and West Texas Intermediate futures every six to eight months at prices of between $45 and $55 a barrel, Tang said. The company is now looking to cash in on those positions.
DeltaStream is one of a handful of companies including Cenovus Energy Inc. and Spur Petroleum Ltd. to tap the growing heavy-oil play in the Slave Lake area. The region is remote and until a new pipeline is completed, oil must be trucked part of the way to an existing pipeline. Tang estimates that DeltaSteam is making as little as a $1 a barrel at current rates, but is shutting for the time being amid the risk for negative prices.

BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services has recommended investors cast advisory votes against the pay of top executives at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc, (N:GS) which could lead to hard-fought ballot item at the bank's annual meeting next week.
In a report dated April 9 and provided on Thursday in response to a request from Reuters, ISS wrote it had ""pay-for-performance misalignment concerns"" at the Wall Street bank, whose annual meeting is set for April 30.
Goldman Sachs said in filings released in March that Chief Executive David Solomon's total compensation for 2019 rose 19% to $24.7 million, up from $20.7 million in 2018.
In comparison, JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) Chief Executive and Chairman Jamie Dimon's 2019 pay rose just 1.6% to $31.5 million from $31 million in 2018.
At Goldman, Solomon's pay for 2019 included a bonus of $7.65 million. ISS wrote that its concerns about Goldman ""are underscored by a significantly increased CEO bonus for a period when several key financial metrics were down year-over-year.""
ISS wrote further that ""The company’s pay programs are significantly reliant on compensation committee discretion, and the application of that discretion and resulting pay outcomes do not appear to be directionally aligned with performance."" 

ISS recommended Goldman investors vote with management on other items, including backing the election of all directors, including Solomon.

China’s central bank is expected to inject funding via the targeted medium-term loans into the banking system as 267.4 billion yuan ($37.8 billion) of the debt comes due. Analysts expect the one-year funding to be offered at a lower rate than the 3.15% of the last operation in January.
Reducing the cost for the targeted medium-term lending facility would put it back into line with other monetary tools, as China’s first economic contraction in decades prompted a series of interest rate cuts by the PBOC. Policy makers have rolled out a wide-ranging response to cushion the economy and bolster investor confidence. Lockdowns to contain the coronavirus are set to result in the country’s slowest annual economic growth since the 1970s.
“The TMLF is likely to be rolled over with a corresponding cut in the rate. Otherwise, the market will be disappointed,” said Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpac Banking Corp. in Singapore. But she added the tool’s role of providing cheap funding is “becoming less of a priority, with various measures pressuring down funding costs already.”
Everything China Is Doing to Support Its Markets During Pandemic
Created in 2019, the TMLF has been used by the central bank to channel liquidity to specific parts of the economy while avoiding a flood of money in the interbank markets. That mindset, however, has changed drastically since the virus outbreak called for much-broader monetary easing.
The PBOC’s relending and rediscounting tools are “more attractive to many of the small banks” now as they offer funding at cheaper levels than the TMLF has, according to Xing Zhaopeng, a market economist at ANZ Bank China Co. in Shanghai. He said even if the TMLF interest rate is lowered to around 2.8%, the amount of loans offered Friday will be less than those maturing because of lack of demand.
There might also be a possibility the PBOC doesn’t offer any fresh TMLF loans Friday, some analysts say, deeming the need for additional liquidity small.
The yield on 10-year sovereign bonds hit 2.48% on April 8, the lowest since 2002, and other key tenors have been at their lowest in more than a decade.
For investors, the interest rate on the medium-term lending facility -- which was cut last week to 2.95% -- is actually more important to watch than the TMLF’s because the former is China’s de-facto policy rate, said Becky Liu, head of China macro strategy at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank Ltd. in Hong Kong.
Still, she said Friday’s announcement is worth watching in order to gauge the future role of the TMLF. “It will either fade out gradually or remain as a tool to provide discounted funding compared with the MLF.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Treasury Department is mulling using a $10 billion emergency coronavirus loan to the U.S. Postal Service to force changes in how it does business, including what it charges for packages, the Washington Post reported on Thursday citing two people familiar with the matter.
 
"
236,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 05:15PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for April 24,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - The markets stayed true to their unpredictability today. Oil is still as volatile as ever, gold is rising and falling along with (rather than opposite to) equities, and stocks showed their fragility again.
Just the brief, accidentally-published report that a drug may not be a gamechanger for the Covid-19 pandemic sapped the life out the bulls.
Early on, investors managed to take a glass-half-full approach to the economic data. Tomorrow there will be more numbers on spending plans and sentiment.
In addition, investors get earnings from the telecom sector and data on oil production.
Here are three things that could move the markets.
1. Biggest Plunge for Durables in 5 Years?
Before the bell tomorrow, investors will get more data on the Covid-19 impact on the U.S. economy, starting with how durable goods orders held up in March.
The Commerce Department will issue its report on orders for goods lasting three or more years at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists expect that durable goods orders plunged 11.9% last month, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com. That would be the biggest plunge since August 2014 (which came about as a rebound from a huge spike the month before in civilian aircraft orders).
Core durable goods orders, which exclude autos, are seen dropping 5.8% for the month.
At 10:00 AM ET, the University of Michigan will release its final measure of April consumer confidence.
The consumer sentiment index is expected to have dropped to 68 from the preliminary reading of 71. That would be down from 89.1 in March.
The index fell into the 50s during the Financial Crisis.
2. Verizon to Report After Boosting Cap Spending Expectations
 Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) leads the earnings parade tomorrow in a typically thinner Friday calendar.
Analysts expect that the telecom giant will report earnings of $1.23 per share and revenue of about $32.5 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
As lockdowns across the country began, the company boosted its capital spending guidance to account for increased demand on its network.
On March 17 the company said it would not be able to gauge the impact of Covid-19 on its results. But it did get a vote of confidence from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on April 1, when Goldman put the stock on its Conviction Buy list.
Verizon has a stable wireless business and strong balance sheet, making risk-reward very attractive, while its wireless service is fairly non-discretionary, Goldman said.
3. Oil Rig Count on Tap
Oil prices settled up sharply again today, making its two-day gain a stunning 65%.
Tomorrow there will be more numbers to help investors gauge the direction of U.S. production when Baker Hughes issues its weekly oil rig count at 1:00 PM ET (17:00 GMT).
Last week Baker Hughes said the number of rigs in operation sank to 438 from 504.
It’s understandable if investors are trepidatious about buying into an oil comeback just yet, given the huge difference in demand and supply, even with cuts, that will persist. Analysts say the difference is around 20 million barrels per day.
“In my opinion, the June WTI contract will repeat what May did,” John Kilduff, founding partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital, said. “It will grind lower and lower and lower into expiration and probably turn negative at some point in time.”"
237,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 05:09PM ET</span>","Capital One Says Provisions Tripled on Pandemic, Oil Decline","(Bloomberg) --  Capital One  Financial Corp (NYSE:COF). said it more than tripled reserves for souring loans from a year ago, prompted by the coronavirus pandemic and a drop in oil prices during the first quarter.
The bank said it set aside $5.42 billion in provisions in the first three months of the year. The total allowance for credit losses increased due to “significant economic uncertainty” from the pandemic and “credit deterioration in the oil and gas industry.”
“Capital One rapidly mobilized to respond to Covid-19 and the disruption it is causing,” Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank said Thursday in a statement announcing the results. “We are well positioned to navigate and manage through these uncertain times, and to emerge with strength on the other side.”
The shares gained 2.1% to $52.61 Thursday in regular New York trading. They have plunged 49% this year, compared with the 30% decline of the S&P 500 Financials Index.

238,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 04:18PM ET</span>",Small Businesses Fear Fresh Loan Funding Won’t Be Nearly Enough,"(Bloomberg) -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says the additional funding Congress is poised to approve Thursday to help small businesses survive the coronavirus pandemic should be the last round, but advocates fear it’ll run out quickly and won’t be enough for mom-and-pop shops struggling to stay open.
The U.S. House is expected to pass a bill Thursday afternoon including $320 billion more for a loan program to keep workers on payrolls. The program, which was launched by the Small Business Administration April 3 with $349 billion, ran out after just 13 days. Lawmakers are also adding $60 billion for a separate disaster loan and grant program whose coronavirus-related funding was exhausted last week.
Mnuchin said this week he expects this would be the last round of funding because there are now other financing opportunities for small businesses, including more money for the disaster loans and the Federal Reserve’s Main Street lending facility.
But small business advocates have estimated that as much as $1 trillion could be needed. They say as large banks are ready to flood the SBA with hundreds of thousands of applications totaling tens of billions of dollars, the additional money could be gone in a few days -- and it’s not clear how many small firms, especially those that haven’t applied yet, can get funding.
“This next tranche is not going to be enough, obviously,” said Karen Kerrigan, president of the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council. “There’s only so much in the funding pot that is available, and the smallest of small businesses unfortunately are not getting access to this capital.”
Lawmakers also said more funding would be needed during a House Small Business Committee hearing on the loan program Thursday. “We all know it’s going to need more money again soon,” said Democratic Representative Tom Malinowski of New Jersey.
Applications for the initial PPP funds were being processed at a rate of about $40 billion a day in the final days before funding was exhausted, signaling that the replenishment could tap out quickly.
Some large, publicly traded companies and big chains such as  Shake Shack Inc  (NYSE:SHAK). that have been criticized for tapping the loan fund may opt for the Main Street facility, making more money available for smaller businesses, said Holly Wade, director of research and policy analysis for the National Federation of Independent Business.
The U.S. Treasury Department issued new guidance on Thursday emphasizing that borrowers must certify in good faith they need the loan, saying it’s “unlikely” a public company with substantial market value and access to capital will be able to do so. Firms that have already taken money can return it by May 7 without penalty, the guidance said.
Still, an NFIB survey of its members on April 17 showed 26% were in the process of submitting an application for loans when funding was exhausted, and it’s not clear how many will be able to access funding before it runs out again, Wade said. Also, there were potentially millions of self-employed individuals and independent contractors shut out because they couldn’t start applying immediately, she said.
“It’s a good second push to get money to small business owners, but there’s still a large number of small business owners who are still waiting to access this program,” Wade said.
The Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, offers loans of as much as $10 million that convert to grants if proceeds are used to keep workers on the payroll and cover rent and other expenses for two months. The SBA guarantees the loans for lenders to disburse, and there’s no comprehensive accounting yet of how much money has reached small firms.
The SBA also stopped accepting applications last week for the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, or EIDL, that offers low-interest financing and emergency advances of as much as $10,000 that don’t have to be repaid. Congress is adding $50 billion for loans and $10 billion for grants to that program.
More than 1.6 million small businesses were approved for PPP funding before the money ran out, with an average loan of $206,000, according to an SBA report. About 755,500 firms have received EIDL grants and almost 27,000 disaster loans have been approved so far, the SBA reported Monday. But there have been millions of EIDL applications, and there are about 30 million small businesses in the U.S. employing about half the workforce.
Congress will likely have to replenish the funds if they run out again, said Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He compared the PPP to an incomplete bridge.
“I don’t think we’re at the point where we can realistically say, ‘The bridge has stopped and we’re sorry if you fall off the end of it,’” he said.
The next funding round includes a $60 billion carve-out for small lenders, which is designed to help them compete with larger banks that will be more actively issuing loans this time, said Paul Merski of the Independent Community Bankers of America.
Even though there is money set aside for smaller banks and financial institutions to lend, that won’t fix the problem that companies with existing banking relationships “are still going to get at the front of the line,” said John Arensmeyer, chief executive officer of the Small Business Majority, a small business advocacy group.
Arnesmeyer said he thinks Mnuchin “will change his tune” about the need for additional funding in a couple of weeks when the crisis gets worse and the problems faced by small firms deepen.
“The sheer magnitude of businesses that don’t have revenue and are closing and/or laying massive numbers of people is staggering,” he said.
Sinnidra Taylor said she has little hope that her business, the Crazy Waffle Bar in New Orleans will see any of the newly approved funds for the PPP.
“I am excited that they have allotted more money. I am also not confident that I will get any,” Taylor said. “I have the feeling small businesses such as mine are being overlooked and falling through the cracks.”

Investing.com – The Dow ended at session lows Thursday, while the broader market was lower, as reports that Gilead's (NASDAQ:GILD) potential Covid-19 treatment had failed to show an improvement in patients spawned a jolt of volatility that offset energy-infused gains.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17%, or 39 points, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite ended just barely in the red.
Gilead's potential antiviral drug remdesivir failed to improve the health of coronavirus patients in a clinical trial, according to draft documents published accidentally by the World Health Organization and seen by the Financial Times. Gilead fell 4.3%.
""The manuscript is undergoing peer review and we are waiting for a final version before WHO comments,” said WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic.
With investor hopes running high that a potential Covid-19 therapy could smooth the reopening of the economy, the news dealt a blow to risk sentiment, forcing investors to rein in some of the bullish bets on stocks.
Wall Street had rallied earlier, led by a climb in energy prices and signs of the number of people filing for unemployment had bottomed.
The U.S. Labor Department reported that 4.427 million people filed for unemployment insurance, down 810,000 from the prior week's downwardly revised 5.237 million and down 2.44 million from the record of 6.867 million seen in late March.
""Looking at the claims data now is a lot like looking at the COVID-19 infection data. It is too early to expect a dramatic decline in the headline numbers, but to the extent that there is anything encouraging to take away from the data, there are signs of a 'flattening curve' where before there was exponential growth,"" Jefferies said.
The move to the downside was also exacerbated by fall in defensive concerns of the market such as utilities, real estate and consumer staples, all of which ended the day down 1%.
But gains in industrials, led by Old Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ:ODFL) ,up 10%, Robert Half (NYSE:RHI) up 5.5% and Textron (NYSE:NYSE:TXT), up 4.4%, kept a lid on the downside in the broader market."
241,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 04:09PM ET</span>",Pemex’s Trading Arm Declares Force Majeure on U.S. Gasoline Imports,"(Bloomberg) -- Mexico, the largest recipient of U.S. gasoline exports, is seeking to cancel imports of the fuel from at least one U.S. company amid the rippling effects of the coronavirus on demand.
Petroleos Mexicanos’s trading unit, PMI, declared force majeure on imports of gasoline as an armada of vessels unable to discharge the fuel idles on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. The legal term “force majeure” typically describes an unexpected, external event that makes it impossible for a party to fulfill its obligations under a contract.
Fuel consumption at gas stations fell by as much as 50% as Mexicans follow the stay-at-home order from President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. The logjam is about 60 vessels waiting, said Erick Tapia, an independent Mexico oil consultant and former PMI employee. Each vessel carries on average 300,000 barrels, bringing the total on the water to about 18 million barrels.
“This will be a very complicated situation for them to unwind themselves from,” he said.
Pemex didn’t immediately return email seeking comment.
Boutique Gasoline
PMI imports “boutique” gasoline that has specific limits on aromatics and benzene that make it difficult to sell outside of Mexico,a person familiar with the matter said. The bulk of it is of so-called Free On Board purchases, FOB, which means PMI is responsible for picking up the cargo at foreign ports with its own vessels.
The plunge in demand caught up with Pemex as the state oil company had its inventories full ahead of the Easter holidays, when travel picks up. Unable to discharge fuel into storage tanks, PMI has been racking up penalty fees for the late return of ships. The so-called demurrage fees are of about $25,000 a day, which means PMI is paying $1.5 million daily in fees.
Last year PMI changed its business model following the landslide victory of Lopez Obrador. PMI which used to buy 40% of its fuel in the spot market, moved to a model where the majority of purchases are made in long-term contracts, Tapia says. That means that PMI had less wiggle-room to adjust to the slump in demand brought by the pandemic.
Mexico is home to Latin America’s largest refining complex after Brazil. After years of mismanagement and lack of maintenance, the oil-rich country now consumes more gasoline that’s produced overseas than domestically.

Investing.com - Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) fell in after-hours trade on Thursday, as a weaker outlook on quarterly profit offset first-quarter earnings that beat analysts' forecasts and revenue that topped expectations.
Shares fell more than 5% postmarket.
The company guided second-quarter revenue and sales of $18.5 billion and $1.10 earnings per share, compared with estimates for $17.8 billion and earnings of $1.17 a share.
""Intel reported an impressive quarter, showing strong double-digit growth in its Data Center Group and its PC-centric unit. But the weak second-quarter forecast shows that there will be headwinds after the Covid-19 outbreak and it will be hard for Intel to completely insulate its business from the economic slowdown,"" Investing.com Analyst Haris Anwar said.
Intel announced earnings per share of $1.45 on revenue of $19.83 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.28 on revenue of $18.63 billion. That compared with an EPS of $0.89 on revenue of $16.06 billion in the same period a year before. Intel had reported EPS of $1.52 on revenue of $20.21 billion in the previous quarter. Analysts are expecting EPS of $1.19 and revenue of $17.71 billion in the upcoming quarter.
The company attributed the stronger results to rising sales for chips used in data centers and growing demand for higher-performance products used in personal computers and related devices.
Its higher-margin data center business saw revenue up 43% on-year, driven by broad strength, including 53% annual growth in cloud service provider revenue. Intel's memory business (NSG) and Mobileye (F:0ME) both set new revenue records in the first quarter.
Revenue for its client computing group was up 13.8% to $9.8 billion.

(Reuters) - Britain's government will void legal attempts to evict or force out small retailers and businesses due to non payment of rent during the coronavirus crises, it said on Thursday. 
The country's commercial landlords are experiencing a significant curtailment in rents as retail activity has paused temporarily due to lockdown measures to curb the spread of the virus. 
The government's move comes just a few days after trade bodies British Retail Consortium and British Property Federation wrote a letter to chancellor Rishi Sunak seeking rental support. 
According to reports, landlords have served winding up petitions to their tenants, with JD Sports (L:JD) and Primark being among the top retailers refusing to pay their March quarter rents. 
""Government should be robust in encouraging landlords and tenants to work together and making clear that those businesses who are able to meet their liabilities should do so"", British Property Federation's Chief Executive Officer Melanie Leech said. ""To stop these unfair practices, the government will temporarily ban the use of statutory demands and winding up orders where a company cannot pay their bills due to coronavirus, to ensure they do not fall into deeper financial strain"", government said in a statement on Thursday. 
""Majority of landlords and tenants are working well together to reach agreements on debt obligations, but some landlords have been putting tenants under undue pressure by using aggressive debt recovery tactics"".
Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick noted that landlords are facing their own ""very serious pressures"" and are concerned about their position with lenders. 
The minister added that the government is working with banks and investors to seek ways to address these issues. 

Overall rent collection for March quarter date fell by 28.7% in the UK, according to cloud-based commercial property management platform Re-Leased, which collected data from 10,000 properties and 35,000 leases on its platform.

Investing.com – Wall Street moved off session lows Thursday, recovering from a slip following reports that Giliead potential Covid-19 treatment had failed to show an improvement in coronavirus patients.
The Dow rose 0.88%, or 206 points, the S&P 500 was up 0.69% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.73%.
“A draft document was provided by the authors to WHO and inadvertently posted on the website and taken down as soon as the mistake was noticed. The manuscript is undergoing peer review and we are waiting for a final version before WHO comments,” said WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic.
Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) said the data suggest a ""potential benefit,"" according to STAT News, which saw the document, but its shares fell 3%.
The news dealt a blow to investor sentiment on big pharma rolling out a potential Covid-19 therapy that could support efforts to get the U.S. open for business again, with states lifting restrictions this week.  
Following a historic rout earlier this week, oil prices eased from highs but remained well bid, helping energy stocks keep a lid on the downside move in the broader market.

252,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 12:55PM ET</span>",Dallas hotelier gets $58.7 million in small business bailout funds,"By Ann Saphir
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Three publicly traded companies overseen by Dallas hotelier Monty Bennett have borrowed $58.7 million under a program aimed at helping small businesses through the coronavirus pandemic, and that may be just a start.
""The Company anticipates receiving additional PPP Loans,"" asset and hotel management company Ashford Inc. said on Wednesday as it reported the receipt of $12.8 million in Paycheck Protection Program loans for six of its subsidiaries. 
Two real estate investment trusts advised by Ashford together won 50 other PPP loans totaling $45.9 million, Securities Exchange Commission filings earlier this week show. The total to the three companies was 285 times the $206,000 average loan size under the program, which is administered by the Small Business Administration. 
Most of the loans were made by Key Bank, among the top five lenders in the $349 billion program. 
More than 150 public companies borrowed more than $500 million under the program before it ran out of funds last week, a Reuters review of SEC filings shows. U.S. lawmakers are expected Thursday to approve an additional $320 billion to the program, and President Donald Trump is expected to quickly sign the bill into law.
The Treasury Department has faced criticism from Congress and small business groups for allocating too much of the funding to big, public businesses. On Thursday, Treasury changed its ""Frequently Asked Questions"" guidance about the program, saying ""It is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith."" 
Two public companies that borrowed under the initial tranche, Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) and Kura Sushi, returned their $10 million each after public outcry over big companies crowding out littler ones for the scarce funds.
The paycheck protection program was meant to help companies with 500 employees or fewer pay their employees, and loans are capped at $10 million. Bigger borrowers could get loans for more if they were split among locations with fewer than 500 employees. At least a dozen companies besides the Ashford group received loans of $10 million or more. 
Ashford spokesman Jordan Jennings on Thursday said that Congress purposefully opened PPP to larger restaurant and hotel groups, many of which would not qualify for the Federal Reserve’s Main Street Lending Program designed for companies with more than 500 employees. 
""I doubt Congress realized that by doing this they might be squeezing out smaller businesses under the PPP program,"" he said in an email.
Of the new funds to be added to the program on Thursday, $60 billion has been set aside for loans through small banks and community development financial institutions in an effort to reach smaller companies. 
Bennett defended his decision last month. 
""My industry and our businesses are completely crushed,"" Bennett wrote in March as Congress debated the $2.3 trillion economic rescue package, passed March 27, that included the small business bailout. ""We should not be disqualified from assistance because we built our previously small businesses into bigger businesses."" 
Bennett and his father, Ashford's founder, own 16% of the company's shares as well as convertible preferred stock that would confer 70% ownership.
The younger Bennett is Ashford's CEO and chairman, and also chairs real estate investment trusts Ashford Hospitality and Braemar Hotels & Resorts Inc. Recipients of the loans obtained by the three companies were mostly hotels and included Ritz Carlton Atlanta, Renaissance Nashville, and Sheraton Anchorage.

255,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 12:27PM ET</span>","Toyota to Tesla Nearing Plant Reopenings, Putting Pressure on Detroit","(Bloomberg) -- Automakers are cautiously coalescing around plans to reopen North American assembly plants early next month following what will be a roughly six-week shutdown for virtually the entire industry.
Toyota Motor Corp., Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., Hyundai Motor Co. and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG are among the major automakers that have said they intend to resume production in the first week of May. Even if they stick to that schedule, many won’t restart all their factories at once, and the facilities that do restore output will run assembly lines at slower rates than they did pre-shutdown.
The non-unionized carmakers’ intentions add to the urgency of talks General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)., Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV are having with the United Auto Workers that weigh the need to get back to business against the possibility that reopening will sicken employees. Of the three, only Fiat Chrysler is confirming plans to progressively restart beginning May 4, pending approval from governments and unions.
“A lot of automakers are looking at some point in May starting production for at least half or a majority” of their plants, prioritizing those making lucrative pickups and SUVs, said Jeff Aznavorian, president of Clips & Clamps Industries, a supplier to Fiat Chrysler and other manufacturers. “All of them are planning on staggering those openings to make sure their processes are in place so they can go back to work safely.”

Less-Dire Sales
Weeks ago, analysts assumed there would be little reason for the industry to rush its restart. Sales in China plummeted almost 80% in the wake of the country’s coronavirus outbreak early this year, and some were expecting a decline of similar magnitude for the U.S. Yet demand has held up better than expected, with researchers LMC Automotive and J.D. Power predicting a roughly 50% decline this month.

While the UAW likely won’t want to put its companies at a competitive disadvantage or keep its members from earning bigger paychecks again, the union also is leery of reopening plants too soon after two dozen union workers at Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler have died of Covid-19 complications.
“The one thing that is a priority of all parties is the health and safety of UAW Ford, General Motors and FCA employees, their families and their communities,” Rory Gamble, the union’s president, said in a late Wednesday statement.
Slow Ramp-Up
Because many factories were running at full speed prior to the shutdown, automakers were carrying plenty of inventory. The process of restarting production will unfold in stages and it could take months for certain products to return to full capacity.
“We do expect to see a slow ramp-up of volumes over the coming weeks” starting the first week of May, said Julie Fream, chief executive officer of the Original Equipment Suppliers Association, an auto parts industry trade group. “That doesn’t mean that all plants will be back online and certainly not that all shifts will be working.”
Not all companies in the supply chain will resume output at the same time, nor are all states in alignment on policy. Michigan’s Governor Gretchen Whitmer on Wednesday cautioned automakers in her state to “slowly engage in a safe manner,” while southern governors are pushing hard to become the first to lift shelter-in-place orders.
“Even if the stay-at-home gets extended, there may be some exceptions,” said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for researcher LMC Automotive. “I have no doubt that the industry is lobbying hard for that.”
Schuster expects the industry to produce at 50% of normal production levels or lower at least through May, if not through the remainder of the second quarter. “Following the model they used in China, it’s probably one shift initially, heavy-duty disinfecting and cleaning, slower line rates because of social distancing, staggered entrance and exits, temperature monitoring and, if they can get them, those quick self-administered test kits,” he said.
Pre-Paying for Parts
Cash-strapped smaller suppliers need detailed timelines -- and sometimes pre-paid orders -- before bringing workers back, sourcing new materials and investing in equipment to promote social distancing on their shop floors, said Alan Baum, an independent auto analyst based near Detroit.
It’s typical for suppliers to take in receivable payments on a 45-day delay, so they’re still getting paid for work they were doing before production was halted. By late May and early June, that money will dry up and cause a cash crunch for some companies.
To help bridge the gap, some automakers are considering front-loaded payments to avoid any cash-flow issues. The approach, referred to in the industry as “factoring programs,” generally involves suppliers surrendering a few percentage points of profit in exchange for early payment, OESA’s Fream said.
“Most of the first tier is ramping up in a very organized way, but my clients are often frustrated they’re not getting enough guidance to make specific plans for restarting,” Baum said.

The company said sales of products, including SkinnyPop popcorn and Pirate's Booty rice and corn puffs, had slowed in recent weeks, after rising in double digits in March, when consumers stockpiled food and other essentials ahead of lockdowns to limit the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
""A significant number of American households are not working and experiencing meaningful financial pressures,"" Chief Executive Officer Michele Buck said on a post-earnings call. 
""All of this has impacted traffic into stores, length of time in stores and the amount of discretionary goods people are purchasing.""
A record 26 million Americans sought unemployment benefits over the last five weeks, confirming that all the jobs created during the longest employment boom in U.S. history were wiped out in about a month as the coronavirus forces companies to release or furlough employees.
The kisses chocolate maker also said social distancing practices have also hit gum and mint sales that are usually sold at the checkout counters, while demand for baking products soared.
Hershey's net sales rose 1% to $2.04 billion in the first quarter ended March 29, but fell short of the average analyst estimate of $2.08 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv data.
Sales from its North American market rose 2.1%, its second-lowest sales growth in two years, while those from China fell 46.7% as the world's second-largest economy imposed weeks-long lockdown because of the coronavirus. Sales in India, Mexico and Brazil, some of its bigger markets, also fell.
Excluding certain items, Hershey earned $1.63 per share, missing analysts' average estimate of $1.71 per share.

269,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 09:41AM ET</span>","Bankruptcy looms over U.S. energy industry, from oil fields to pipelines","By Jessica Resnick-Ault and David French
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers, refiners and pipeline companies are scrambling for cash and face likely restructuring as they struggle under heavy debt loads and a dual supply/demand shock in the worst crisis the oil industry has faced. 
Fuel demand has tumbled roughly 30% worldwide due to the coronavirus pandemic, and just as the health crisis worsened a price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia flooded markets with crude. The industry was already struggling to satisfy investors unhappy with weak returns, even as the United States surged to become the world's largest oil producer in the last few years.
That perilous position was before U.S. prices crashed deep into negative territory on Monday, as much as $38 per barrel in the red. This sudden rout came despite substantial spending and output cuts having already been announced by U.S. producers, and reflected a price environment well below levels that companies and advisors had modeled in worst-case scenarios, according to energy lawyers. 
Approximately half of the top 60 independent U.S. oil producers will likely need to review options for securing more liquidity, according to energy lawyers at Haynes and Boone. 
""The reverberations from this price collapse will be felt throughout the industry and by everyone who provides services to the industry,"" said Buddy Clark, an Houston-based partner at the firm. 
Companies that used debt to fund acquisitions before prices crashed, such as oil giant Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY), are focusing on placating shareholders and preserving cash.
Numerous midstream companies backed by private equity are in danger of bankruptcy, according to some of the more than a dozen industry and financial sources Reuters spoke to for this article, while large banks are preparing to become owners of oil and gas fields as they seize energy assets.
One midstream company, Salt Creek Midstream, which operates in the Delaware basin in Texas, had already hired Jefferies Financial Group (N:JEF) and law firm Kirkland & Ellis for debt advice before the week's events, according to three sources aware of the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss non-public information.
Salt Creek and its advisers declined to comment, as did private equity investors Ares Management Corp (N:ARES) and ARM Energy. 
More shale producers are expected to seek bankruptcy protection in coming weeks, industry and banking sources say, following Whiting Petroleum (N:WLL), which announced such steps earlier this month. Many small and mid-sized producers, including Chesapeake Energy Corp (N:CHK), have retained debt advisers. 
The forecast loan default rate for 2020 among energy companies is 18%, according to Fitch Ratings, while nearly 20% of all energy corporate bonds are trading below 70 cents on the dollar, indicating distress, according to data from MarketAxess. 
Occidental hoped asset sales would help reduce its debt pile, which stood at nearly $39 billion at the end of 2019 after its massive acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) last year. It has since cut costs twice and slashed its prized dividend.
PRODUCERS AND PIPELINES
Privately held pipeline operators are considered the most vulnerable among midstream companies, bankers said. As shale producers hit bankruptcy, they're expected to try to use court proceedings to exit pipeline contracts which charge transport fees based on oil and gas prices well above current levels, according to Buddy Clark and Charles Beckham, another Haynes and Boone partner.
Privately owned Glass Mountain LLC earlier this month sued troubled producer Chesapeake Energy for allegedly defaulting on an oil transportation contract, according to court documents.
Midstream companies are also threatened by a slow fall in production, as wells are being plugged due to poor market conditions. Based on company estimates, at least 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) of U.S. production cuts have been announced, and that cuts off transportation fees earned by pipeline companies.
A number of these midstream operators borrowed heavily to finance pipeline systems, built to support producers developing new, costlier shale plays when oil prices were higher, but are no longer profitable. 
Debt belonging to private midstream operators is trading at distressed levels, with many between 40 and 50 cents on the dollar, such as Brazos Midstream, a Delaware Basin operator whose long-term debt was downgraded to CCC+ by Fitch Ratings last week, a rating described as implying substantial risks.
REFINING
Oil refiner PBF Energy (N:PBF) built up a network of six U.S. refineries over a decade, including this year's nearly $1 billion purchase of a San Francisco-area plant. With the market's slide, the entire company is currently worth less by capitalisation than that purchase.
PBF last month said it would sell hydrogen gas plants for $530 million to raise cash. That sale ""solves some short-term problems for them,"" said one person familiar with the transaction, but cautioned that this alone will not stabilize the company unless fuel demand begins to recover. The person declined to be identified because the matter was not public.
The company declined to comment.
Demand, however, is down by roughly 25% in the United States, and oversupply is expected to linger for months.
An April survey of energy producers by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City found nearly 40% would be insolvent within a year if oil prices remained around $30 a barrel. U.S. crude prices closed under $14 a barrel on Wednesday.
""The restructuring guys are extremely busy. I don't think they'll be busy for just this year - I think it's a multi-year process,"" James West at investment bank Evercore ISI told investors on Wednesday.

Output will also resume at JLR's central English engine factory in Wolverhampton and at a plant in Austria where the electric I-Pace is built but no date has been set for the reopening of its British Halewood or Castle Bromwich locations.
""As countries are relaxing distancing guidelines and retailers are reopening around the world, the restart of production at our other plants will be confirmed in due course,"" the firm said in a statement.

271,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 09:34AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Opens Higher as Jobless Claims Ease Slightly,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Thursday amid signs that the flood of initial jobless claims due to various state-wide lockdowns may be easing. 
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 193 points or 0.8% at 23,669 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.0%.
Earlier, the Bureau of Labor Statistics had said that the number of Americans filing initial claims for unemployment benefits fell to 4.43 million last weeks from a downwardly revised 5.23 million the week before. Continuing claims also came in slightly lower than expected at 15.98 million. 
The numbers mean that over 26 million people had filed for benefits in the five weeks since the wave of coronavirus-related shutdowns began. 
""With the pain spreading from retail and hospitality to other sectors less than half of the working age population of America will be earning a wage by May,"" ING's chief international economist James Knightley said in a note to clients. ""We have to remember that one third of Americans aged 18-.65 are not classified as employed or unemployed – they are students, early retirement, homemakers, carers or sick.""
That background explains the urgency of calls from politicians to reopen the economy as fast as possible. Among the biggest gainers in early trading on Thursday were casino stocks, after Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman said in an interview with CNN she wanted to reopen the town's hospitality-driven economy as soon as possible. Her comments were criticized by Governor Steve Sisolak, and President Donald Trump - who has missed few opportunities to endorse a speedy reopening - pointedly declined to be drawn into the debate.
Even so,  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) stock rose 8.5%, while Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) stock rose 8.4% and MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) stock rose 4.0%.
Away from gambling - well, a bit anyway - TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) stock fell 0.4% after it missed estimates for earnings in its fiscal second quarter.  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW), which has agreed to buy the brokerage, also fell 0.5%.
Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) stock fell 5.5% and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) stock fell 3.2%, both after disappointing updates. Domino's said it expected international sales to have fallen in the first four weeks of this quarter, while Target said higher staff costs and a shift towards lower-margin items by customers stockpiling essentials would hit profitability.
Elsewhere, the dip in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock proved short-lived as bargain-hunters drove it up 4.4%, to within 4% of its all-time high. 
Oil and gas stocks also benefited from the rebound in U.S. crude futures, which rose by nearly one-quarter to $17.16 by 10 AM. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock was up 5.1%, while  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock was up 3.5% and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock was up 2.5%.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Seven Russian airlines have received permission to transport cargo in the passenger cabin, when no passengers are on board, as the coronavirus outbreak has halted the majority of flights, the Russian aviation authority Rosaviatsiya said on Thursday.
International passenger flights, with the exception of those bringing Russian home from abroad, have all been suspended, leaving airlines looking for alternative ways to make money.
Domestic flights within Russia have continued to operate, but demand for them has also sharply fallen.
State carrier Aeroflot (MM:AFLT) and it's unit, Rossiya Airlines, have been included on the list, along with Ural Airlines, Nordwind Airlines, Azur Air, Ikar and Royal Flight. The list could be added to, Rosaviatsiya said.

Last week, President Vladimir Putin pledged more than 23 billion roubles ($309 million) in support to airlines, with Russia's citizens told to stay at home since the beginning of April in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

273,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>",Eli Lilly lifts 2020 forecast as coronavirus lockdowns fuel profit beat,"By Saumya Joseph and Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY) raised the top-end of its 2020 profit forecast on Thursday and beat quarterly estimates, benefiting from customers stocking up medicines such as diabetes drug Trulicity amid the coronavirus pandemic. 
Shares of the drugmaker rose 2.7% to $161 in early trading as first-quarter revenue got a nearly $250 million boost from increased demand for Lilly's insulin products, Trulicity and psoriasis drug Taltz during the lockdowns.
This benefit, however, would largely be reversed over the course of 2020, the company said and warned of a negative impact to its U.S. drug prices in a coronavirus-battered economy.
Long-term U.S. unemployment rates would reduce the demand for drugs and even cut federal reimbursement for Lilly's key drugs, said Citi Equities analyst Andrew Baum, adding there are cheaper options to Trulicity and Taltz.
As patients shift from commercial insurance to federal insurance plans such as Medicaid, Lilly could see a change in net pricing, Chief Executive Officer David Ricks told Reuters.
Meanwhile, with hospitals focus on treating COVID-19 patients, Lilly has had to delay many of its clinical trials, a move that could hurt future revenue and limit patient access to experimental treatments.
""The economic and healthcare consequences of this pandemic are uncertain and could negatively affect our financial results later in 2020 and beyond due to reduced non-COVID healthcare activities and global economic challenges,"" Chief Financial Officer Josh Smiley said in a statement.
The company forecast full-year adjusted profit per share of between $6.70 to $6.90, a 10 cent boost to the top-end, citing more demand for its newer drugs and said it expects clinical trials to resume in the second half of the year.
""While we could see some negative impact to drug pricing from COVID-19, we see this as fairly manageable and far more muted than the impacts being experienced elsewhere in the broader economy,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott said.
Top-selling drug Trulicity brought in 40% higher revenue of $1.23 billion, helping drive a 15% jump in total quarterly revenue to $5.86 billion, which topped Wall Street estimates of $5.51 billion.
Excluding items, Lilly earned $1.75 per share, above analysts' average estimate of $1.48 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Net income fell nearly 66% to $1.46 billion, or $1.60 per share from a year earlier when it recorded $3.68 billion gain from its spin-off of animal health unit Elanco (N:ELAN).

274,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 09:20AM ET</span>",Blackstone's first-quarter profit rises but coronavirus weighs,"By Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) - Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX), the world's largest manager of alternative assets such as private equity and real estate, reported a 4% rise in its first-quarter distributable earnings on Thursday driven by a surge in management fees, even as its funds took a hit in the coronavirus-induced downturn.
Blackstone posted a 16% rise in management and advisory fee revenue thanks to its continued fundraising, which offset a 32% drop in revenue generated from performance fees it books when it cashes out on assets.
Distributable earnings (DE) rose to $557.1 million from $538 million a year earlier. This translated into DE per share of 46 cents, lower than the 50 cents that analysts estimated on average, according to data compiled by Refinitiv.
U.S. stock prices have tumbled as stay-at-home measures to fight the coronavirus pandemic have shut down large swathes of the economy, weighing on Blackstone's portfolio.
Blackstone said the value of its private equity funds fell by 21.6% in the first quarter, compared with a 20% drop in the benchmark S&P 500 stock over the same period. This reflected the economic impact not just of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also of the steep decline in oil prices that weighed on Blackstone's holdings in the energy sector. Excluding the energy sector assets, Blackstone said its private equity portfolio declined 11.1%.
Blackstone's opportunistic and core real estate funds depreciated by 8.8% and 3.9%, respectively, during the quarter.
While this plunge in the mark-to-market value of its holdings does not affect Blackstone's cash position, it takes a big toll on its earnings when reported under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Blackstone posted a net GAAP loss of $2.6 billion, compared to an approximately $1.1 billion profit a year ago.
""We entered this crisis in a position of great strength, having recently completed a two-year fundraising cycle of nearly $250 billion. With ample capital reserves, long-term fund structures, and over $150 billion of dry powder capital – more than anyone in our industry – we are uniquely positioned to invest on behalf of our clients at a time of historic dislocation,"" Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman said in a statement.

Blackstone's total assets under management fell to $538 billion in the quarter, from $571.1 billion in the prior quarter. It declared a quarterly dividend of 39 cents per share.

The year-to-date decline in intra-European fares, by contrast, improved slightly to 20.7% from 22%, while the average drop in Asia Pacific narrowed to 13% from 14.4%.

Average yields - a proxy for fares expressed in revenue per passenger kilometre - dropped to 9.3 U.S. cents in North America from 15.2 cents a year earlier. In Europe they fell to 14.2 cents from 19.9 cents. In Asia-Pacific they slipped to 9.7 cents from 11.9 cents.

277,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 08:27AM ET</span>",All That Matters to Investors Now Is How Fast Economies Reopen,"(Bloomberg) --
Pandemic trading will go down in history for its breathtaking velocity: The fastest market crash meets the swiftest rescue package to offset a virus infecting the world at a pace unseen this century.
A Wall Street fixated on the speed of new coronavirus cases is now turning its attention to the next phase of the crisis: How quickly the lockdowns end.
Bad data is a given. Weak earnings are expected. Stimulus is priced.
Whatever shape the economic recovery takes, cross-asset strategies are hinging on how fast consumption and investment returns.
“Everyone was talking about six to nine months as a timeline for lockdown,” said Edward Park, deputy chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald Asset Management. “Now people are talking about restrictions being lifted in the next one to two months. That shortening of the timeline means that the dire economic data that we have seen can be looked through.”
Look no further than the economic data crossing the tape on Thursday. Gauges of private-sector activity in Europe were disastrous, beyond already gloomy expectations. Yet after an initial dip the Stoxx Europe 600 Index of equities quickly found its feet.
The pattern may be similar when jobless claims hit in the U.S. later -- the S&P 500 has risen every Thursday for the past four weeks even as applications for unemployment benefits in America surged by more than 20 million.

It’s not that the data doesn’t matter. But the scale of the central bank and fiscal response has been so huge, it’s helped investors see past the pain so far. And now, just as the relentless bad figures threatened to overwhelm their optimism -- witness the chaos in the oil market -- the largest economies are moving toward re-opening.
Germany this week allowed smaller stores to reopen in some locations, becoming the first in Europe to move toward a cautious revival of business activity. The White House on Friday issued guidelines for states to reopen in phases, with some already moving toward easing restrictions.
“We do look at PMIs and initial jobless claims to understand the depth of recession, but it’s not the key input to determine our asset allocations,” said Thushka Maharaj, global multi-asset strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management. The team is focused on the removal of restrictions.
“We’ll be tracking higher-frequency measures of infection rates, movement of people back to work. Maybe electricity consumption, transportation,” said Maharaj.
The S&P 500 closed last week at the highest in more than a month, even though the Trump administration’s plans leave many questions unanswered.
Countries adopted varying measures at different times to contain the pandemic, and as a result have experienced different outcomes in terms of spread. It’s likely they will therefore have contrasting approaches to ending their lockdowns, which will feed into relative market performance.
“A pattern seems to be emerging that the euro zone countries which experienced the sharpest impact on public (and economic) life will be the last countries exiting the lockdown measures,” ING Bank NV economists including Bert Colijn wrote this week. “Add to this significant differences across countries regarding the size of the fiscal reaction and there is a clear risk of an asymmetric recovery.”
Both virus rates and asset moves already speak to this. While Germany, with 150,000 cases but just 5,000 deaths, already eased some restrictions, Italy has almost 190,000 confirmed infections and 25,000 deaths, and won’t start relaxing containment measures until May 4.
That helps to account for why the benchmark Italian stock index lags the German equivalent by some 7 percentage points this year. The spread between debt yields of the two nations has widened by more than 80 basis points.
Meanwhile, the world has yet to fully understand the Covid-19 virus. If easing restrictions lead to an acceleration in infections or deaths, containment measures could make a swift return.
At  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), strategists including Jim Reid have been diving into the micro details of what lockdown exit strategies might look like across geographies. They highlight that many countries want to reopen a little sooner than expected, indicating an acceptance “they will have to live with the virus in some form -- at least for now.”
“A key consideration is how to deal with the second wave of the virus that is likely from increased activity,” they wrote in a note. “This is being weighed up against the increasing awareness of the health problems associated with isolation and lockdown itself.”
All this will play out over some time. Until then investors conditioned to bad news and data appear receptive to glimmers of light.
“As long as things are gradually improving and moving on a timeline where the lockdown isn’t going to continue for the next year, if things are gradually improving at a slow pace, that’s enough for equities,” said Park at Brooks Macdonald.

The world's largest pizza chain, however, withdrew its two- to three-year outlook, citing uncertainty surrounding the global economy due to the health crisis.
The new coronavirus has infected more than 2.62 million people globally, including nearly 840,000 in the United States.
Domino's expects international same-store sales to fall 3.2%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, in the four weeks from March 23 April 19.
Restaurants are one of the hardest hit sectors from the health crisis as stay-at-home and social distancing orders have forced many chains, individual and family-run businesses to temporarily shut dining options for customers.
U.S. restaurants have asked Congress for more financial aid, saying they are on track to lose $240 billion by the end of the year. The government recently issued a $349 billion small business bailout fund as part of its economic rescue package.
""We can't predict the full impact of COVID-19 on the broader economy and we don't know how consumer behavior and restaurant purchasing patterns may evolve coming out of this crisis,"" Domino's Pizza Chief Executive Officer Ritch Allison said. 
""What I do know is that our franchisees and teams in the U.S. and across the globe will remain focused on safely serving our customers and our communities in this time of need.""
Pizza chains, including Domino's and rival Papa John's (O:PZZA), have recently added ten of thousands of jobs to cater to higher demand, as consumers rely heavily on home delivery for meals, with pizzas being one of the most popular options.
The pizza chains have also taken precautions to keep delivery contactless and their employees safe by offering hand sanitizers, gloves and temperature checks.
Comparable sales for Domino's U.S. stores rose 1.6% for the first quarter ended March 22. Analysts had forecast a rise of 1.89%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Total revenue rose 4.4% to $873.1 million. Net income climbed to $121.6 million, or $3.07 per share, from $92.65 million, or $2.20 per share. 

Higher royalty revenues from U.S. and international franchise stores and a rise in supply chain volumes also boosted profit, the company said.

281,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 07:02AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Edge Lower; Caution Ahead of Jobless Claims,"By Peter Nurse
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to edge lower Thursday, with investors wary ahead of key unemployment data and amid tensions over the early reopening of some states still gripped by the coronavirus pandemic.
At 07:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures were both essentially flat. The Dow futures contract fell 33 points, or 0.1%.
The main focus Thursday will be on the weekly initial jobless claims, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), which is widely seen as the best gauge of the economic damage caused by the shutdowns .
Economists are expecting a smaller, but still historically huge, rise in claims of 4.2 million, compared with the week before. That would bring the total number of newly unemployed to more than 26 million in the past five weeks.
Later Thursday, IHS Markit will release its preliminary purchasing managers’ index for April. Judging by the European equivalents, the news will not be good.
Given these numbers, some states are very keen to reopen their economies, despite the risk of a surge in infections if done too quickly. This has created tension with the federal government.
President Donald Trump said late Wednesday that he strongly disagrees with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's plan to reopen part of that state's economy, the most ambitious reopening announced by any state so far. Trump's comments come less than a week after he incited citizens in other states last week to protest against lockdown measures.
The pandemic has infected more than 840,000 people in the U.S., according to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University, killing over 46,000.
On the earnings front, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will bring attention to the chip sector after the bell. Analysts expect the company to report a profit of $1.28 per share on revenue of about $18.6 billion.
Shares in Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) gained over 2% premarket after the pharmaceutical company reported a 15% rise in quarterly sales.Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) will also report before the bell, and is another company expected to have shown resilience during the lockdown.
Oil surged on Thursday, while remaining at low levels, with President Trump adding some geopolitical risk into the equation by threatening Iran.


The mood was also helped by the Oklahoma's energy regulator saying late Wednesday that companies could shut wells without losing their leases.
This is the latest sign that U.S. producers are cutting production to weather a collapse in demand as the coronavirus outbreak ravages world economies.
At 7:10 AM ET, U.S. crude traded 12.6% higher at $15.52 a barrel, having risen around a fifth in the previous session. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 7.9% to $21.98.

(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s NBCUniversal said on Thursday it aims to help retailers that have been forced to shut down amid the pandemic through new ecommerce tools that will let people buy products directly from NBC's content.
The launch of the tools, called NBCUniversal Checkout, comes as many brands have reduced advertising spending while the coronavirus batters the economy.
U.S. TV networks are poised to lose as much as $12 billion in ad revenue in the first half of this year because of the postponement of major sports events like the Tokyo Olympics and the NCAA basketball tournament, according to research firm eMarketer.
The new features will allow consumers to scan a code on their TV screens with their phones, sending the advertiser's product shown in the content to an online shopping cart powered by NBCUniversal Checkout.
Users can also purchase items from a sponsored article on NBCUniversal properties like the Today show or Spanish-language news site Telemundo, without leaving NBC's websites.
The moves are aimed at reducing the number of steps needed to buy an item online. NBCUniversal said it accelerated the launch of Checkout as retailers from large companies like Macy's (NYSE:M) to smaller shops have struggled during the pandemic.
""We're getting this in front of advertisers now, so we're able to start integrating them as early as next month,"" said Josh Feldman, executive vice president of marketing and advertising creative at NBCUniversal.

NBCUniversal will not take a cut of sales made through Checkout for the rest of the year, to help retailers who normally do not have the budget to advertise on TV, Feldman said. He declined to comment on how much the company would earn from sales after this year.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Middle East governments are failing to take the action required to protect their airlines from the economic crisis caused by the new coronavirus pandemic, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Thursday.
Several states have stepped in to help their airlines that have seen travel demand decimated by the global outbreak, such as the United States, Singapore and Australia, though few in the Middle East have made their intentions clear.
IATA, which represents 290 global airlines, has been consulting with Middle Eastern governments, regulators and stakeholders on how to revive air travel as some countries start to slowly ease lockdowns.
However, IATA Vice President for the Middle East Muhammad Albakri said the association was not satisfied with regional state efforts to support their airlines. 
""We have not seen the desired movements and decisions of governments and decision makers to ... put on the table the economic stimulation packages and the rescue packages, financial packages necessary to keep the airlines in the region alive,"" Muhammad Albakri said on a call with reporters. 
IATA wants to see Middle Eastern government ""really prioritise aviation and announce specific rescue measures for the airlines and aviation industry in line with other nations,"" he said.
Estimated revenue losses for Middle Eastern carriers from the outbreak have risen to $24 billion, compared with $7.2 billion on March 11, IATA said.
Few Middle Eastern governments have said whether they would prop up the region's airlines, which are mostly state-owned.

Dubai has promised new funding to state carrier Emirates, but has not disclosed details, while Qatar Airways has said it would eventually seek government support.

FCA and unions said on Tuesday that the carmaker planned to reopen the plant, which is a venture with France's PSA Group (PA:PEUP), on April 27, a week before a national lockdown imposed by Rome was due to end.
It will make use of a provision in lockdown laws that allows companies whose activity can be linked to sectors deemed ""essential"" to reopen.
Luca Manzi, from the UILM union, said FCA had informed unions that it planned to restart the plant at around 70% of its capacity, though he could not say precisely how many people would be back to work on Monday.
With a daily production of around 1,200 light commercial vehicles, Atessa, which is located in Italy's Abruzzo region, is the largest van assembly facility in Europe. It has been closed since mid-March due to the coronavirus outbreak in the country.
The plant, which employs around 6,500 people, is operated by Sevel, a 50-50 joint venture between Fiat Chrysler and  Peugeot  owner PSA. It produces vans for both groups.
""Of course safety is a priority, we'll make sure that the agreed health measures are in place,"" Manzi told Reuters by phone. ""Sevel's main external suppliers have also reassured us that they were compliant with safety rules and ready to restart operations"".
Manzi added production would restart with 17 worker shifts each week, as it was operating before the freeze.
FCA declined to comment.
Earlier this month FCA reached a deal with unions on measures to adopt at its Italian plants once the government eases restrictions on business activity put in place to contain the coronavirus outbreak.

288,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 05:19AM ET</span>",StockBeat: ECB Cushions Hammer Blow from PMIs,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets dealt better than might have been expected with another crushingly negative set of business surveys on Thursday, trading roughly mixed thanks to fresh support measures from both government and – more importantly – the European Central Bank.
Italian, Spanish and Portuguese banks were among the biggest winners after the ECB tweaked its rules in an emergency virtual meeting on Wednesday, to ensure that it can still lend to banks even if their sovereign government’s credit rating is downgraded to junk. That prospect most immediately affects Italy in particular, after Prime Minister Giuseppe Conti unveiled plans for 50 billion euros more in spending this year.
BBVA (MC:BBVA) stock was up 4.4%, while  Bankia  (MC:BKIA) stock, Caixabank  (MC:CABK) stock and Sabadell (MC:SABE) stock were all up by over 2%. Italian heavyweights  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) and Unicredit (MI:CRDI) made smaller gains of 1% each, the latter suffering from a barrage of price target reductions after making a 900 million-euro ($970 million) provision for bad loans on Tuesday. The benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 0.2% by 5:20 AM ET (0920 GMT), with the Italian FTSE MIB and the Spanish IBEX 35 outperforming.
Purchasing manager surveys for April, released on Thursday, made clear how badly such provisions will be needed. Forecasts were for the worst European PMIs ever – and the actual numbers were worse than the forecasts across the board, with services hit hardest of all.
The eurozone composite PMI fell to 13.5 from 29.7, while the services PMI fell to 11.7 from 26.4.
“The eurozone economy didn’t just fall flat on its face at the start of Q2, it head-butted the pavement,” said Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Vistesen argued that the underlying reality may not be as bad as the numbers suggest, in that employment subsidy schemes across the region mean that the jobless rolls won’t rise as fast as the numbers suggest. On the downside, he argued, respondents’ were even more gloomy about the outlook for the next 12 months than they were in March: that’s at odds with the sharp relief rally seen in European stocks in the last month.
“The success of governments’ efforts to re-open economies in the next two-to-three months will determine which of the stories that are right,” Vistesen said.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose government has had arguably the best record in containing the outbreak in Europe, told the Bundestag on Thursday that ““we are not living in the final phase of the pandemic, but still at the beginning,” while Spain, which has been at the other end of the pain scale, extended its lockdown until May 9th on Wednesday."

PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) is in talks with the French government to secure a state-backed loan worth several billion euros to shore up its liquidity during the coronavirus pandemic, the French carmaker said on Thursday.
Interim Chief Executive Clotilde Delbos said Renault had enough liquidity to see it through the turmoil but was lining up credit lines and aid when possible, including in France and emerging markets.
""It is our duty to be on the safe side and to cover even black, black, black scenarios,"" Delbos said on a call with analysts, adding that it was unclear how long the crisis would last. She said the French loan should be in place by mid-May.
Renault shares rose as much as 3.5% in early trading.
Like other carmakers around the world, sales at Renault have been hit hard by the coronavirus crisis as demand for cars plummets and many dealerships and production sites close. 
Few major French companies have yet tapped this form of state aid, barring consumer electronics retailer Fnac Darty (PA:FNAC). Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) is also moving towards a government-backed rescue deal.
Delbos said there were no strings attached to the French loan package other than reining in dividends. Renault has already cancelled its payout against 2019 earnings.
The firm said it had 10.3 billion euros of liquidity reserves at the end of March, 5.5 billion euros lower than the end of 2019. The first quarter is traditionally a period when carmakers use cash to bump up stocks. 
Renault, which has suspended its outlook for 2020, posted a 19.2% drop in first-quarter revenue to 10.13 billion euros. It said it would look to resume production in Europe where possible and was cutting costs in areas such as advertising. 
Renault is due to update investors on its strategy to strengthen its alliance with Japan's Nissan (T:7201) by mid-May, with details of cost cuts and joint purchasing plans. 
The two firms were already under pressure before the coronavirus crisis due to faltering demand in emerging markets and the major challenge of coming up with greener vehicles. 
Renault sold more cars in Russia than in its home market in the first quarter as demand slumped in Europe, the first time France has fallen from the top spot. 

The carmaker benefited slightly from selling more expensive SUV-style models such as the Renault Captur but this was not sufficient to offset tumbling sales volumes.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Thursday on the back of dire business activity surveys that vividly illustrated the depth of the region’s economic shutdown, outweighing some better-than-expected quarterly earnings reports.
At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index traded 0.4% lower, France's CAC 40 was down 0.1%, while the DAX fell 0.6%. The broader based Stoxx 600 Europe index dropped 0.4%. 
French business activity plunged even more than expected this month, with the eurozone’s second largest economy reporting its preliminary purchasing managers' index for April dropping to 11.2 from 28.9 in March, the lowest reading on records going back to 1998.
And the news from Germany, the region’s biggest economy, wasn’t any better. Both services and manufacturing suffered record falls in output due to the coronavirus outbreak and measures to contain it. The composite PMI index plunged to 17.1 from 35.0 the previous month. The eurozone manufacturing index fell to 33.6, well below the 39.2 forecast.
Germany is still at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic and will have to live with it for a long time, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday.
""We are not living in the final phase of the pandemic, but still at the beginning,"" she told the Bundestag lower house of parliament.
Yet there has been some positive news in the corporate world Thursday.
Shares in  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) rose 0.4% after the Swiss banking giant reported a jump in first-quarter net profit of 75% despite setting aside an additional 568 million Swiss francs ($552 million) for credit losses.
 Hermes International  (PA:HRMS) climbed 1.4% despite reporting a drop of 7.7% in its first-quarter revenue as its business was hit by the coronavirus. Its sales held up better compared with rivals LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (PA:LVMH) and  Kering  (PA:PRTP), whose first-quarter revenue recorded double-digit declines.
Italian and Spanish banking stocks were broadly higher after the European Central Bank adjusted its lending rules on Wednesday to ensure that it could still lend to them if their sovereign is downgraded to junk status.
Also,  Aston Martin  (LON:AML) shares climbed over 4% after it said it plans to restart its St Athan factory in south Wales on May 5 and will also resume operations at Gaydon later, after the coronavirus-led shutdowns forced the luxury car maker to suspend production at both sites.
The oil market recovered Thursday, posting healthy gains after recent historic losses, but remains at low levels given the global supply glut.
At 4 AM ET, U.S. crude June futures traded 7.3% higher at $14.78 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 5.7% to $21.54.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was up 0.3% at 0705 GMT, recovering for a second straight day after a historic collapse in oil prices sparked a selloff at the start of the week.

The STOXX 600 has bounced this month after hitting eight-year lows in March as unprecedented global stimulus and signs of easing in the coronavirus outbreak brought back bargain hunters.
However, analysts have warned against a quick recovery as the damage from a near shutdown in economic activity piles up. Surveys on Europe's manufacturing and services sector due later in the day are expected to mirror dismal readings from Asia.

""Bonuses in these times of crisis are unwise and incompatible with support funded by taxpayers' money"", Hoekstra told Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf.
Documents filed by Air France-KLM last week showed criteria for Smith's variable pay had been altered, and now included his ability to secure financial aid for the ailing airline group.
Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) is moving towards a 10 billion euro ($10.8 billion) government-backed rescue deal, sources have told Reuters, in which the Dutch government would back around 2 billion euros in loans to Dutch subsidiary KLM.
Group chairman Anne-Marie Couderc told French senators on Wednesday that talks on a combination of state guarantees and direct loans to Air France should conclude ""in coming days"", while an agreement on Dutch support for KLM would take longer.
Smith has said he will reduce his 2020 fixed and bonus pay in proportion to the salaries of workers affected by temporary layoff programmes.
Smith is paid an annual salary of 900,000 euros, while his variable payments can run up to 1.35 million euros. He also receives 2 million euros per year in long-term incentives, paid out after three years.

While the fixed and variable pay will be trimmed in proportion to furloughed workers' salaries, the bonus criteria have been adjusted to remove debt reduction and add cash conservation as well as the ""obtaining of support and financing"".

298,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 02:40AM ET</span>","China's Didi sees overseas business off coronavirus low, eyes payment firm deals, new markets: executive","By Yilei Sun, Yingzhi Yang and Brenda Goh
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing is upbeat that business overseas has turned a corner after dropping to a mid-March low amid the coronavirus pandemic, a senior executive said, and is already looking into new markets and payment firm acquisitions.
Though bullish over future prospects, Tony Qiu, chief operating officer of Didi's international operation, conceded that business sees a ""double-digit"" percentage hit in the short term, echoing gloom across an industry squeezed by travel restrictions in many countries to contain the virus. 
""[Overseas] business has recovered a little since reaching a low in mid-March,"" Qiu told Reuters in an interview. ""In the short term it will impact our business by double-digit, but we hope by doing what we do during the epidemic, we will overcome the virus.""
Last week Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) warned of an up-to-$102 million revenue hit in the first half of this year, while Singapore-based Grab said its ride volumes have gone down by a double-digit percentage in some countries. Uber withdrew its 2020 forecast for gross bookings and earnings, while Grab said it would cap costs.
Uber owned 15% of Didi at least as of September 2018 after selling its Chinese operations to its one-time rival in 2016. Now easily the biggest ride-hailing firm in China, Didi has also been backed by Japan's SoftBank Group to the tune of nearly $12 billion and was valued at $56 billion in a 2017 financing round.
Qiu declined to be more specific on the financial detail of the coronavirus impact on operations. He said his business unit saw daily rides hit a peak of 5 million before the outbreak. On average daily overseas rides account for about 20% of Didi's entire ride-hailing operation. 
Underlining the company's bullish approach, Didi's Chief Executive Officer Cheng Wei said last week the firm aims to have 800 million monthly active users globally and complete 100 million orders a day by 2022, including ride-sharing, bike and food delivery orders.
Demand for Didi in China itself has been recovering quickly since the easing of coronavirus city lockdowns, the company said. One of the company's main products, Anycar, with which passengers can hire ride-hailing cars or taxis, saw March orders more than triple compared with February.
Qiu declined to say how much his business unit might invest in new acquisitions. 
""Acquiring and working with payment companies which have the banking licence, payment or financial technologies would bring advantages to Didi's global business,"" Qiu said, adding there are no clear plans yet for any deals.
Beyond China, Didi operates in eight countries across Latin America, Australia and Japan. New markets being studied could be in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, he said. But Qiu said Didi has no clear plan to enter Southeast Asia and the United States for now, as those markets have already become fierce battlegrounds for the likes of Uber,  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), Grab and Indonesia's Gojek. 
Other expansions being considered would be food delivery services and payments operations in markets where it is already present. Didi already delivers food in Japan, Brazil and Mexico and is rolling out on-demand delivery and courier services in Australia and Latin America. 
Qiu said Didi is also exporting practices developed in China to cope with the coronavirus pandemic. In Mexico, for example, it is offering instructions to drivers on how to install protective plastic sheets in their cars, while it's helping to disinfect cars in Brazil.
It's also looking into how it can better use technology to trace infected people, Qiu said.

Online booking allows easier contact tracing than conventional taxis, he said, and technologies used by Didi's platform helped the Chinese health authorities quickly track down infected cases, as well as those who had close contacts with them.

299,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 02:27AM ET</span>","Zoom Backlash Widens With Daimler, Ericsson and BofA Curbs","(Bloomberg) -- Some of the world’s largest companies have advised against the use of Zoom Video Communications Inc.’s conferencing app, fueling a growing backlash against a service that shot to prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic.
 Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) AB,  NXP Semiconductors  NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). are among a wave of companies forbidding or warning employees against using Zoom because of concerns about its security, according to people familiar with their operations. They join corporations like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. and government agencies from Taiwan to Singapore that have banned the app’s use, though the city-state has since backtracked. India has deemed Zoom an unsafe platform and initiated a public contest to develop a secure homegrown video-chat alternative.
Zoom emerged during the global coronavirus lockdown as a home for everything from virtual cocktail hours to cabinet meetings and classroom learning. It passed the milestone of 300 million daily meeting participants this week, having never crossed 10 million before the start of this year. Its share price remains close to a record high achieved in March. However, cybersecurity researchers warn hackers can exploit flaws in the software to eavesdrop on meetings. Weak protection has given rise to the phenomenon of “Zoombombing,” where uninvited trolls gain access to a video conference to harass participants.
Daimler wrote “the software has various security gaps and data protection problems” in a memo to employees reviewed by Bloomberg News. The automaker, employer to close to 300,000 people globally, wasn’t a Zoom corporate customer before but is now explicitly prohibiting the video-calling app, pointing workers to Microsoft Teams as a more trustworthy alternative.
“Daimler prohibits the use of Zoom for corporate content until further notice,” company spokesman Christoph Sedlmayr said in an emailed statement.
Zoom CEO Eric Yuan has focused on bolstering the security of his videoconferencing application with the goal of winning back customers who abandoned the company. Zoom is working on improving its encryption and argues that many of its problems stem from the fact the app was initially geared toward enterprise clients with their own IT security teams instead of the broad consumer app it’s become. Singapore’s government banned Zoom’s usage by schools but later lifted that moratorium after putting in place security safeguards.
NXP, a provider of wireless communications technology, uses  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT).’s Teams internally and recently banned the use of Zoom with external parties, one person said, asking not to be identified discussing internal matters. Networking giant Ericsson also relies on Teams, previously Skype for Business, for remote meetings and now asks staff not to use Zoom. If clients or partners want to use the app, Ericsson staff will need to make sure the outside parties understand and are willing to accept the risks of using Zoom before proceeding with a meeting, said another person familiar with the measures.
An NXP spokesman declined to comment, while Ericsson said in an emailed statement it has internally approved apps and guidelines for meetings, without elaborating.
“A large number of global institutions ranging from the world’s largest financial services companies, to leading telecommunications providers, government agencies, universities and others have done exhaustive security reviews of our user, network and data center layers and confidently selected Zoom for complete deployment,” said a Zoom spokeswoman via email. “We are proud to be helping these customers maintain business continuity in this challenging and unprecedented time.”
Bank of America doesn’t typically use Zoom internally because it has other video conferencing tools, and in cases where clients seek to communicate via Zoom, bankers need to go through an approval process to use it, a person familiar with the situation said. Of the bank’s 208,000 employees, more than 175,000 are working from home, Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said at the company’s annual shareholder meeting Wednesday.
A Bank of America spokesperson declined to comment.

300,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 02:15AM ET</span>",Japan corporate earnings enjoy benefit of doubt as profits elsewhere portend gloom,"By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - Analysts are sanguine about Japanese corporate earnings this year in the expectation of swift economic recovery from the coronavirus outbreak, though some strategists and investors caution such optimism could be misplaced. 
A reality check could come within weeks as Japanese companies begin announcing results for the January-March quarter, revealing the extent to which bottom lines have been hit so far by business closures and worldwide travel bans.
Earnings per share (EPS) at firms listed on Japan's Topix index (TOPX) have fallen 8% since the start of year, Refinitiv data showed based on analyst estimates. That compares favourably with 15% at U.S. firms and as much as 20% in Europe. 
(GRAPHIC: Earnings downgrades during the coronavirus outbreak - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgvoozrvdx/200422D.png)
Though a decline, the Japan estimate looks particularly rosy considering the global economy is set for its deepest recession since the 1930s.
But there are more dire forecasts based on ""top-down"" forecasts using macro economic projections rather than forecasts for individual companies. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) sees a 23% fall in Japanese corporate profit under its base scenario and 35% in a bearish scenario.
""I think the focus is now more on the degree of recovery than how bad the second quarter will be,"" said Masayuki Murata, general manager of balanced portfolio investment at Sumitomo Life Insurance. ""By the end of June, markets will be looking at how much economic rebound there will be in the next 12 months.""
Investors recognise that bottom-up, business-by-business EPS forecasts tend to move slowly and could be lowered.
""Everyone will be more cautious. Some will reduce spending,"" said Murata. ""We shouldn't expect things to return to the same.""
Murata expects the Topix EPS to fall to around 80 from 112 at the end of last week, and for the Topix to bottom around 1,200 from 1,414. That would be about 15 times estimated earnings.
The novel coronavirus outbreak has so far been relatively limited in Japan, with less than 10 cases per 100,000 people compared with about 180 in Germany and 250 in the United States.
Even if the virus is contained domestically, however, dependence on demand overseas - where government restrictions on movement and business activity have been more stringent - is likely to mean reduced corporate revenue. 
""Almost two-thirds of Topix profits are ultimately generated overseas. Moreover, among major economies, Japan's GDP is one of the most highly sensitive to global trade,"" said CLSA strategist Nick Smith. 
""This is why Japan was hit so hard by the global financial crisis, despite having a banking system that had minimal exposure to subprime lending.""
Profit at companies making up the MSCI Japan Price Index (MIJP00000PUS) fell as much as 70% during the 2008-9 crisis, more than double that of peers. 
(GRAPHIC: Earnings downgrades during the global financial crisis - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkvlnbovbx/200422A.png)
If Japan's economy shrinks 5.2% this year, as forecast by the International Monetary Fund, the Topix EPS should fall about 46% this year, said senior quants analyst Masahiro Suzuki at Daiwa Securities.
Suzuki pointed to the yen, which rose as much as 25% against the U.S. dollar during the financial crisis, shrinking profit that Japanese firms earned overseas when converted to yen. 

The yen's trade-weighted effective level is currently near the average of the past seven years and about 25% below its 2009 peak.

301,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 11:50PM ET</span>","For SoftBank's Son, coronavirus turns vision to illusion","By Anirban Sen and Sam Nussey
BANGALORE/TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) founder Masayoshi Son's dream of a global tech empire is unravelling, with the coronavirus crisis compounding losses at his $100 billion Vision Fund and distress at his big bets portending more pain.
More than half of the fund's capital is in startups that are suffering from the virus impact or exhibiting stress pre-dating the outbreak, a Reuters analysis showed. Ride-hailing usage at flagship transport investments has fallen more than 50% and six SoftBank-backed startups have pushed IPO plans from this year to next.
The Japanese conglomerate has already flagged a 1.8 trillion yen ($17 billion) loss at the fund for the year to March - during which Son's ""intuitive"" bet WeWork spectacularly imploded - unsettling Middle Eastern backers which stumped up much of the fund's money.
Though many problems at portfolio firms pre-date the pandemic, the resulting economic meltdown has exposed what critics have long called an extraordinarily risky strategy of ploughing huge sums into unproven businesses in the expectation that would enable them to dominate big new markets.
""The Vision Fund has been a mess. It has been a case of an organisation with too much money just splashing it around without doing enough due diligence,"" said Joe Bauernfreund, chief executive of SoftBank shareholder Asset Value Investors.
    Son transformed SoftBank into a tech investor over the past three years and raised the world's biggest late-stage investment fund in the Vision Fund. To be sure, some investments are doing better, but examples are scant as the pandemic magnifies problems.
The pain is particularly keen in transport and real estate, which make up $43 billion of investment and include car-share firm Getaround, home-seller OpenDoor and real estate brokerage Compass.
Restrictions on movement worldwide has hit the market for the portfolio's four major ride-hailing firms, with India's Ola suspending operations in cities in Britain, Australia and New Zealand, three people with knowledge of the matter said.
SoftBank and Ola declined to comment.
U.S. peer  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER), whose stock is stuck 40% below its 2019 initial public offering (IPO) price, last month said it had sufficient cash reserves to weather the crisis. Southeast Asia's Grab said its food delivery business is doing well. China's Didi declined to comment. 
The fund does not include all $13 billion invested with SoftBank itself in office-share startup WeWork, or SoftBank's bet on satellite operator OneWeb, which filed for bankruptcy protection last month.
Among SoftBank-backed startups, at least six that have pushed back IPO plans to 2021, including BigCommerce, which powers e-commerce sites for the likes of Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Sony Corp (T:6758), said the three people, who were not authorised to speak with media so declined to be identified.
Vision Fund bet DoorDash, a U.S. food delivery startup which earlier this year confidentially filed to go public, is also re-evaluating IPO plans given capital market volatility, a fourth person said.
DoorDash declined to comment. BigCommerce did not respond to a request for comment.
IPOs are a vital means of raising capital for the Vision Fund, with investors such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Abu Dhabi's Mubadala receiving dividends - an unusual arrangement for such a fund.
PIF and Mubadala in recent weeks have expressed fresh concern about the fund's performance and its ability to pay dividends, said two people directly aware of the conversations.
""As partners with a long-term view, we have discussions with (SoftBank) on ways to best optimise the fund's performance as we all navigate these difficult economic times,"" said a Mubadala spokesman.
PIF declined to comment.
BRIGHT SPOTS 
Consumers housebound due to movement curbs has brought the portfolio some bright spots. For instance, use of short video app TikTok is growing, with Chinese operator Bytedance pledging to nearly double headcount by year-end.
Orders have surged at South Korean e-commerce firm Coupang, and shares of China's Ping An Good Doctor - formally Ping An Healthcare and Technology Co Ltd (HK:1833) - have doubled in price year-to-date on demand for online consultation.
Overall, provided startups have enough cash to ride out the downturn, then recovery could follow, experts said.
But bright spots are scant.
Indian hotel startup Oyo exemplified Son's approach of providing huge sums for rapid expansion before the business had proven it could make money. Movement curbs have since precipitated the collapse of the global travel industry.
Oyo has backtracked on hotel revenue guarantees that are at the heart of its business model claiming force majeure, and is adjusting workforce and slowing expansion, the three people said.
Oyo declined to comment.
REPUTATION
Chief Executive Son's investor credentials rest on an early bet on Chinese e-commerce leader  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA). However, the billionaire has had a string of setbacks including bailing out WeWork after a failed attempt to float.
Startups across the portfolio have struggled to demonstrate paths to profitability or have taken measures such as cutting staff as rapid, SoftBank cash-fuelled expansion came to an end.
With the Vision Fund's estimated losses, analysts said its investments are now likely valued below cost. Moreover, the troubles have left Son's plans to raise a second mega-fund in tatters.
Fund backers and SoftBank stakeholders including U.S. activist investor Elliott Management have called for a committee on the board to oversee Son's big investments, the people said. 
""I don't think the Vision Fund has worked out quite the way many anticipated,"" said venture partner Ben Narasin at New Enterprise Associates. ""In some cases it's an open question as to whether (SoftBank's) bets made sense as laid. Others were spot on, but likely to be hindered by the new COVID realities.""
The economic hit from the virus has far exceeded what the fund expected in the early days of the outbreak, a Vision Fund partner said on condition of anonymity.

""In November, SoftBank indicated that about 15 of the Vision Fund companies would likely go bankrupt. Clearly the world has changed since November,"" said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Chris Lane, who remains bullish on SoftBank stock. ""It wouldn't surprise me if ultimately about 30 of them go bankrupt.""

WASHINGTON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian stock markets rose on Thursday as the combination of a rebound in crude prices from historic lows and the promise of more U.S. government aid to cushion the coronavirus-ravaged economy helped calm nervous markets.
Better-than-expected U.S. corporate earnings also lifted equities, analysts said, though overall sentiment remained fragile as the pandemic cut a destructive path through the world economy.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside of Japan bounced from two-week lows to be up 0.5% at 460.43 points.
Australian S&P/ASX added 0.4%, Chinese shares opened firm with the blue-chip index up 0.3%. Japan's Nikkei climbed 0.8%.
The gains followed a strong overnight lead from Wall Street with the Dow up 2%, S&P 500 adding 2.3% and Nasdaq rising 2.8%.
All 11 S&P 500 sector indexes climbed as the U.S. Senate unanimously approved the new relief package, adding to trillions of dollars in stimulus that has helped Wall Street rebound from its March lows.
The House of Representatives is expected on Thursday to clear the relief, which would be the fourth coronavirus measure passed by Congress, and would boost the overall federal financial response to almost $3 trillion.
Stock markets may have bottomed out after the impressive bounce since a rout last month, analysts said. 
Even so, the recent recovery has been narrowly focussed on the big tech firms, said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. 
Four out of every five stocks are still in a bear market while European benchmark equity indices and the U.S. small-cap index are also in bear territory, ""throwing severe doubts on the impression that investors are optimistic about the outlook,"" she added.
However, Shah believes market positioning may now work to propel markets higher, helped by solid policy stimulus around the world.
""Investors have built up meaningful cash positions suggesting that, not only is indiscriminate selling behind us, but investors have sufficient dry powder to take advantage of attractively valued risk assets."" 
In Europe, traders were buoyed after Italy breezed through a major debt sale on Tuesday and speculation continued that the European Central Bank would provide more support measures.
Still, it may take European Union countries until the summer if not longer to agree on how to finance aid to help economies recover from the pandemic as major disagreements persist, a bloc official said on Wednesday.
Brent oil extended gains on Thursday to rise more than 3% to $21.09 a barrel on the prospects for further production cuts to reduce the glut in the oil market, sending the S&P 500 energy index up 3.6%. 
U.S. crude was up 3.3% at $14.22. U.S. crude futures fell deep into negative territory on Monday as the market grappled with a supply glut and cratering demand. 
In currencies, the dollar was barely changed against the Japanese yen at 107.72. It was slightly firm against the risk sensitive currencies of Australia and New Zealand at $0.6310 and $0.5941 respectively.
The euro was a shade weaker at $1.08 while the British pound was mostly unchanged at $1.2330.

That left the dollar index at 100.38, down 0.1%.

Alafco Aviation Lease and Finance Co. faults the aerospace giant for failing to deliver the planes on time and said it canceled the entire order.
The 737 Max was supposed to be Boeing’s replacement for its tried-and-true 737 line of slim-bodied planes. But after 346 people were killed when two of the planes crashed within five months last year, the plane was grounded worldwide and Boeing halted production.
Boeing was supposed to start delivering the Max planes to Alafco in March 2019, according to the lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court in Chicago. But that was the month of the second Max crash, which is when Boeing suspended delivery of the planes.
Alafco didn’t say how much it agreed to pay for the planes in the lawsuit. But the list price on 20 737 Max 8S planes the company ordered in 2017 was $2.2 billion at the time.
The failure to deliver the planes, “and the circumstances in which they have occurred, substantially impair the value of the purchase agreement as a whole,” Alafco said in the lawsuit. “Accordingly, Alafco has canceled its 737 Max aircraft orders and requested return of all advance payments.”
Boeing didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment, made after regular business hours in the U.S.
Chicago-based Boeing has struggled since the Max crashes, which were blamed on faulty flight control software, inadequate flight manuals and lax regulation. It has been further challenged, along with the entire airplane industry, by the coronavirus pandemic, as air travel worldwide plummeted and demand for new planes has sunk.
On Monday, the company’s stock took another hit, falling 6.8%, after China Development Bank Financial Leasing canceled an order for 29 of 737 Max planes worth at least $2.9 billion based on the list price.

The city-state is “very likely” to see a sharper fall in GDP, the city-state’s trade and industry minister Chan Chun Sing said Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Haslinda Amin. “We are really concerned that worldwide, this is going to lead to a more serious problem than many had anticipated just a month ago”.
The minister refrained from giving a new official forecast for GDP, but noted that connectivity among the major economies has been unsettled, hurting the short-term capacities and long term capabilities of countries. The country’s gross domestic product contracted an annualized 10.6% in the first quarter -- most in a decade -- with the government in March forecasting a contraction of 1%-4% for the year.
Singapore on Tuesday extended its “circuit-breaker” measures for a further four weeks until June 1 in a bid to “decisively” bring down coronavirus cases within the community. Chan said he hopes to ‘progressively open’ the economy in a month’s time and said the country is planning ‘much more testing’ for the entire population.
Initially seen as a global model for how to contain the pandemic, Singapore now has the most cases in Southeast Asia -- more than 10,000 -- as Covid-19 spreads quickly in densely packed dormitories housing foreign laborers.

NEW DELHI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Two lessors to Indian carrier SpiceJet Ltd (NS:SPJT) are in talks to terminate contracts and repossess planes via mutually agreed deals with the airline over missed payments, according to two sources directly involved in the discussions.
One of the leasing companies started to pull out a few planes earlier this year after SpiceJet failed to pay maintenance fees due since late last year and lease rentals since last month, said one source, adding that talks were continuing over other jets. 
The second lessor began discussions, which are ongoing, last month just as the coronavirus pandemic started crippling the airline industry, according to the second source. 
About 10 planes in total have been or could be repossessed, with leases terminated with the airline's agreement, according to the sources, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
A SpiceJet spokesman described queries related to the discussions with lessors as ""speculative, misleading and baseless"".
""We share excellent relationships with all our partners and lessors and our agreements with them are confidential,"" he added. 
""Our fleet structure and exits have been planned exits at our option to cater to the demand requirements,"" he said, adding SpiceJet was taking various steps to re-align its operations with current travel restrictions worldwide.
The carrier did not comment on specific queries about dues owed to lessors or delays in making payments.
SpiceJet is not alone in wrestling with the impact of the coronavirus crisis, which has seen airlines worldwide seeking delays in rent and deliveries or state help. Estimated global airline losses from the coronavirus pandemic have climbed to $314 billion, trade body IATA said last week.
Avolon, a leading global lessor, said this month it had received requests from more than 80% of its customers for relief from payment obligations.
RAPID EXPANSION
The two sources said the lease talks were instigated by the lessors but early termination deals would be mutually agreed with SpiceJet.
The second leasing company is in talks with the carrier to repossess a handful of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 planes, also citing delayed payments, said the second source.
SpiceJet had a 119-strong fleet at the end of 2019. Its two-dozen lessors include Carlyle Aviation Partners, Aircastle and Avolon, according to industry data provider Cirium. 
Carlyle and Avolon declined to comment, while there was no response from Aircastle. 
SpiceJet's challenges in the pandemic crisis come on the heels of a rapid expansion early last year, when it took on around 30 leased planes from bankrupt Jet Airways (NS:JET) and became India's second-largest airline by market share.
India's fast-growing airline market is also one of the most competitive. Weak economic growth over the past year hurt airlines even before the coronavirus outbreak led to a ban on commercial passenger flights until at least May 3.
Airlines including SpiceJet's bigger rival IndiGo (NS:INGL) and state-run Air India, have idled over 650 planes. India is working on an aviation rescue package for all airlines that could be worth as much as $1.6 billion.

(Reuters) - The Silicon Valley venture capital firm known for its early backing of companies such as Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc is raising a new fund, but without one of its most prominent general partners, a source close to the firm said on Wednesday. 
Benchmark is raising a $425 million 10th fund, the person said, after a long track record of early backing for major tech firms such as eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR).
But influential general partner Bill Gurley, who led the firm's early investment in Uber, one of the largest tech companies to emerge in the past decade, will not be part of the new fund, the person said.
The Wall Street Journal reported the development earlier on Wednesday.
Gurley has been a vocal advocate for direct listings, an alternative way for companies to become publicly traded that gives both early investors such as Benchmark and tech company employees paid with stock a way to sell their shares for cash while paying potentially fewer fees to investment banks.
Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Technology SA and Slack Technologies Inc - neither of which was a Benchmark investment - used the technique, but Uber held a traditional initial public offering last year.
Another source close to Benchmark said Gurley was not ""going anywhere."" He will remain on 11 boards of Benchmark portfolio companies and will work with the firm and the founders of those startups for ""many, many years into the future,"" the source said.

The sources declined to say why Gurley was not joining the latest fund.

The company said it would offer $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2025 and intended to enter into a new $1.5 billion Term Loan B facility due 2023.
Atlanta-based Delta reported its first first-quarter loss in nine years and forecast a 90% decline in second-quarter revenue as the coronavirus crisis devastates air travel demand.

Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian had said the company expected to raise several billion dollars more in financing in coming months.

The virus outbreak has pummeled vehicle sales and production globally, as governments impose tight restrictions on business activity and the movement of people to control its spread.
Daimler reported preliminary adjusted first-quarter earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 719 million euros, a 68.9% fall from the prior year.
Preliminary adjusted EBIT for Mercedes-Benz cars & vans fell over 56% to 603 million euros.

(Reuters) - U.S. pipeline operator  Kinder Morgan  Inc (N:KMI) on Wednesday reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly profit and cut its adjusted core earnings forecast for the year, following a coronavirus-induced decline in fuel demand and a crash in crude prices.
The company now expects an 8% fall in annual adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization from previous estimates of about $7.6 billion.
Kinder Morgan also took a non-cash impairment charge of $950 million in the first quarter related to certain oil and gas producing assets in its CO2 unit.
The company cut its 2020 capital expenditure by about $700 million, or nearly 30% from its previous estimate.
Oil and gas pipeline and storage companies in the United States and Canada have slashed their budgets for the year as their customers wind down drilling activity in the face of dwindling demand and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia that has sent crude to its lowest in decades. 
""Sharp declines in both commodity prices and refined product demand in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic clearly affected our business and will continue to do so in the near term,"" Kinder Morgan President Kim Dang said.
The company said it expects crude oil pricing for the rest of the year to average around $30 per barrel, down from its first-quarter realized price of $54.61 per barrel.
""KMI threaded the needle well, in my opinion,"" said Charlie Smith, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh, referring to the company's decision to lower the quantum of its dividend increase to save cash.
""That said, my concerns for the future are twofold. First, their material cuts to growth capex may impair DCF (distributable cash flow) in future years. Second, if WTI prices don't recover to north of $40 by later in 2020, their CO2 business may be subject to material further impairment,"" he added.
The Houston-based company, which has pipelines as well as storage terminals, reported a net loss attributable of $306 million, or 14 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a profit of $556 million, or 24 cents per share, a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, the company reported a profit of 24 cents per share, missing average analysts' estimates of 27 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The company's shares were down 1.8% at $14.40 in extended trading.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - An increasing number of U.S. companies are selling bonds to repay lines of credit they drew down at the height of the coronavirus-induced market turmoil, an indication that the cash crunch facing much of Corporate America may be easing, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts. 
Lenders faced requests from more than 170 U.S. companies to draw down on more than $120 billion in prearranged credit lines in recent weeks, according to Bank of America estimates, as corporate executives rushed to buttress their firms' finances.
In recent days, however, the likes of apparel maker VF Corp (N:VFC), grocer  Kroger Co  (N:KR) and chipmaker Micron Technology Inc (O:MU) have raised cash through new bonds with the purpose of repaying funds borrowed through credit facilities, according to regulatory filings. Earlier this month, American Water Works (N:AWK) also raised cash to repay its credit facility. 
""Now we are seeing signs that some companies have confidence they can get to the other side because they are issuing corporate bonds to pay down credit lines,"" Hans Mikkelsen, head of U.S. investment grade credit strategy at Bank of America, wrote in a note. 
""Of course the main reasons are not just favorable developments around COVID-19 but also policy responses,"" Mikkelsen said, referring to the unprecedented spending and credit support programs to mitigate the economic impact of measures to stop the pandemic's spread.
Many corners of the credit markets are booming following a string of asset purchases by the Federal Reserve and direct lending schemes set up in conjunction with the Treasury Department.
While investment-grade issuers and companies recently downgraded into junk territory have benefited the most from the Federal Reserve's interventions, many lower-tier junk bonds have also seen prices rally. 
To be sure, some strains in the credit markets remain.
The commercial paper market, which companies tap for short-term funding, has still not recovered, Daleep Singh, head of the markets group at the New York Fed, said last Friday. Many companies rushed to draw down on credit lines last month because the commercial paper market was shut to them.
The companies covered by the Bank of America's analysis also do also not include the small businesses that have been a focus of rescue efforts.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday the total amount of government aid aimed at small businesses would ultimately help 60 million American workers, or close to half of U.S. private payrolls.

314,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 06:55PM ET</span>",Facebook bets on India with $5.7 billion Reliance deal,"By Sankalp Phartiyal and Nivedita Bhattacharjee
NEW DELHI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Facebook (O:FB) is set to spend $5.7 billion to buy a 9.99% stake in  Reliance Industries ' (NS:RELI) digital arm, as it looks to roll out services for India's grocers and small businesses by capitalizing on WhatsApp's extensive reach in the country.
The deal announced on Wednesday is Facebook's biggest since its $22 billion buyout of WhatsApp in 2014 and will give the Menlo Park, California-based firm a stake in Jio Platforms - the digital services entity that houses Reliance's telecoms arm Jio Infocomm, as well as its news, movie and music apps, along with other businesses. 
The transaction is also the eighth largest deal in Asia this year based on deal value, according to Refinitiv data, and comes at a time when the coronavirus outbreak has stifled mergers and acquisitions activity globally.
To kick off the partnership, Facebook's WhatsApp messenger, which counts India as its biggest market with about 400 million users, will help fuel the growth of Jio's new retail venture, JioMart, the two companies said.
""In the near future JioMart ... and WhatsApp will empower nearly 30 million small Indian kirana (grocery) shops to digitally transact with every customer in their neighborhood,"" Mukesh Ambani, Reliance chairman and Asia's richest man, said in a video statement.
JioMart, the e-commerce venture of Reliance's retail arm, offers customers free express grocery deliveries from neighborhood mum-and-pop stores. It is yet to be launched across India, and is likely to pose a formidable challenge to Amazon.com's (O:AMZN) local unit and Walmart's (N:WMT) Flipkart, which are also betting big on groceries to grow.
For Reliance, the deal will help the oil-to-retail group, which bet over $30 billion on the Jio telecoms venture, reduce its debt load. 
FACEBOOK INDIA ROADMAP
The companies said the potential benefits of the deal were manifold, but shied away from giving details.
""We will really look to explore multiple areas of collaboration,"" Ajit Mohan, the India head of Facebook, told journalists on a call. ""And the spirit of it will be - can we open new doors? Can we open new avenues?"" 
The investment, according to tech and retail analysts, will give Facebook new means to expand in India, its biggest market outside of the United States.
Facebook's offerings such as WhatsApp Business, which allows businesses to catalog products and send automated replies, and a payment service, could be handy tools for millions of small retailers and customers that Reliance wants to tie together.
The alliance with Jio, which has over 380 million subscribers, could also help WhatsApp evolve into an Indian version of Chinese internet giant Tencent's (HK:0700) WeChat, which allows users to chat, make payments and book flights and hotels, a source with direct knowledge of the deal said.
""The idea is to turn the Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram ecosystem into something like that. What Facebook don't want to do is go out and deal with the physical task of building warehouses, keeping inventory. They don't want to be a Walmart or an Amazon,"" the source added, declining to be identified as details of the deal were private.
RELIANCE'S SWAY
The perceived closeness between Reliance chairman Ambani - who has net worth of $49.2 billion, according to Forbes - and India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party could also ease Facebook's struggles in country which has taken Big Tech to task over issues such as misinformation and data privacy, sources said.
WhatsApp's payments service has been awaiting regulatory clearances for nearly two years, and India has previously blamed WhatsApp for the spread of misinformation and fake news.
Facebook's Mohan, however, played down the idea of the deal being aimed at smoothing regulatory issues, saying it was squarely focused on meeting the needs of small business owners.
Reliance has always pitched Jio as a technology company and it is using its financial muscle to build smart homes, which could rival Amazon's Alexa-based solutions, connected cars and security systems. For all of those, it could potentially tap into Facebook's tech prowess. 
""They (Reliance) have great ambition. As they try to build a retail business on top of the core Jio base, this deal provides them with a mechanism for not having to go through a hit and trial method, but leverage some technologies that are proven,"" said Atul Kunwar, a former Chief Technology officer at one of India's biggest IT firms,  Tech Mahindra  (NS:TEML).
Shares in Reliance ended 10% higher after rising as much as 12% earlier on the news, contributing nearly half the gains on the NSE Nifty 50 index on Wednesday.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) acted as financial adviser for Reliance, while AZB & Partners and Davis Polk & Wardwell acted as legal counsel. Facebook was advised by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).

Stan Deal, who heads Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in an email to employees seen by Reuters that Mark Jenks will be responsible for all programs and the heads of the 737, 747/767, 777 and 787 programs will report to him.
He also announced a number of other executive changes.

Jenks was named head of the 737 program in July after the best-selling 737 MAX was grounded in March 2019 following two fatal crashes in five months.

(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) was sued for $336 million on Wednesday by a Kuwaiti leasing company that accused it of wrongly refusing to return advance payments on a now-canceled order for 40 of its troubled 737 MAX planes.
In a complaint filed in Chicago federal court, ALAFCO Aviation Lease and Finance Co (KW:ALAF) accused Boeing of breach of contract for keeping the payments despite being unable to deliver the planes or provide a revised delivery schedule.
ALAFCO said it canceled its order on March 6 after Boeing failed to deliver nine aircraft on time. It said Boeing has resisted its claim that the problems amounted to a ""non-excusable delay"" that would justify repayment.
Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Chicago-based company suspended 737 MAX deliveries in March 2019, when the Federal Aviation Administration grounded the aircraft following the deaths of 346 people in crashes of two 737 MAX planes operated by Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines.
Boeing is now also struggling with the coronavirus pandemic, which forced it to cut production because of falling demand, airline customers' own cash struggles, and the logistical hurdles of delivering aircraft.
ALAFCO buys large commercial aircraft and leases them to airlines. Its largest owners include the Kuwait Finance House (KW:KFH), Gulf Investment Corp and Kuwait Airways Corp, according to its website.

Boeing shares closed down $1.36 at $134.97 on Wednesday. They have lost more than two-thirds of their value since early March 2019, just before the 737 MAX grounding.

317,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 06:18PM ET</span>",Korea Inc. Credit Outlook Worst in Decade Despite Virus Success,"(Bloomberg) -- South Korea has been a success story so far in the global fight against the coronavirus, but troubles for its export-reliant corporate borrowers may just be starting.
As companies worldwide face a near unprecedented rate of downgrades, Korea Inc. is also vulnerable: debt assessors have taken the most negative actions on the firms this year in at least a decade. The problem is that while Covid-19 cases are falling at home, the outbreak is still raging abroad and that’s bad for some of the country’s biggest companies that are major exporters.
Korea’s example highlights how a country that has the virus relatively under control may still see massive damage to its corporate sector due to a global economic slowdown and disruptions to supply chains. While Korea was one of the worst-hit nations in the early stages of the outbreak, new cases have fallen to the least since late February without lockdowns or travel bans, after authorities relied instead on a massive testing and tracing regime.
“The firms may face rising funding costs due to the downgrades, adding to pressures,” said JunHong Park, Hong Kong-based lead analyst for Korean corporates at S&P Global Ratings. “Some directly-hit sectors such as airlines or hotels and some debt-saddled companies may face liquidity risks.”
Moody’s Investors Service has cut the credit ratings or outlooks of nine Korean firms and placed 18 on review for downgrade so far this year, already marking the most negative actions since at least 2010, Bloomberg-compiled data show. S&P also took similar actions on 14 companies, the most in at least a decade as well. Neither firm has upgraded a single company.

The fact that the Korean firms evaluated by global rating companies are mostly investment-grade blue-chip issuers suggests that smaller businesses are struggling even harder and some of them may not be able to survive without government support.
Even before the virus outbreak, Korean corporate ratings were pressured due in part to a glut of goods such as LCD panels, oil refining products and steel that some of the companies sell, and also because of high investment needs at certain firms.
Now their prospects look even more troubled. The latest to be downgraded was Hanjin International Corp., a hotel-operating unit of Korean Air Lines Co., to CCC+ from B- by S&P last week. The rating firm said Hanjin faced significant pressure to meet its debt maturities over the next six months as the coronavirus pandemic has hampered its operations and debt capital markets have become increasingly risk averse.
Other companies that have been faced negative credit actions by S&P this month include Mirae Asset Daewoo Co., Hyundai Motor Co., Hyundai Steel Co. and Hyundai Glovis Co.

318,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 06:18PM ET</span>",Saudi Arabia Could Borrow Record $58 Billion as Oil Slump Bites,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia could borrow 220 billion riyals ($58 billion) this year as it plugs a widening budget gap induced by plunging oil prices and crude production cuts, a record since the kingdom’s debut in international bond markets in 2016.
The government is looking at additional spending cuts and may issue as much as an additional 100 billion riyals of debt on top of 120 billion riyals already announced, Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan said in a press conference on Wednesday. Officials will not withdraw more than planned from reserves, he added.
“The kingdom went through similar crises in its history -- maybe even worse -- and was able to pass through them,” he said. “This is not an exception.”
Already under lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, the world’s largest crude exporter is bracing for a second impact from the oil rout and unprecedented production cuts negotiated by OPEC and its allies. Both will slash government revenue, and in turn derail a fragile economic recovery. Brent crude is trading around $20 a barrel -- a quarter of the level Saudi Arabia needs to balance its budget -- leaving officials with limited options to offset economic pain without crippling public finances.
The government’s budget deficit could widen to 15% of economic output, according to Mohamed Abu Basha, head of macroeconomic analysis at investment bank EFG Hermes in Cairo. The fiscal shortfall reached 4.5% last year after peaking at just over 17% in 2016, according to the International Monetary Fund.
The government has already tapped global bond markets twice this year and has borrowed a total of $19 billion from local and international investors, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The government said last month that it planned to raise its debt ceiling from 30% to 50% of gross domestic product as it borrows more to cope with the crises.
Non-Oil Contraction
Without providing details, Al-Jadaan said the kingdom was “looking at additional measures” to reduce government spending. He added that officials expected to save some money during the virus-related shutdown as they spent less on on travel, events and entertainment, and would “delay some spending on projects that are halted now.”
The challenge for officials will be balancing fiscal pressures with the need to support the economy.  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) recently revised its economic growth forecast for Saudi Arabia in 2020 to a 4.5% contraction from a previous expectation of 5% growth, largely due to the agreement to cut oil production.
The government expects gross domestic product for the non-oil private sector to shrink “for the first time in history,” Al-Jadaan said. He added that was “not surprising because of the precautionary measures” taken to slow the spread of the virus, including a 24-hour curfew in major cities.
Oil has already dropped below levels seen in 2015, when the kingdom first started tapping local banks to help fund the deficit. It also put the brakes on spending at that time by delaying tens of billions of dollars in payments for government contracts. The decision hit foreign and domestic investor confidence, and Al-Jadaan vowed to continue paying contractors on time during this crisis.
The government has announced a slew of stimulus measures to aid businesses during the virus shutdown, including a plan to cover 60% of the salaries of some Saudi nationals working at private firms. In total, the state has pledged 177 billion riyals of support, according to the finance ministry -- though that includes extra allocations for the health sector.
Officials are continuously studying the impact of the stimulus measures and will extend more support if needed, Al-Jadaan said.
“The private sector’s concerns are our concerns,” he said.

319,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 06:14PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for April 23,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Oil prices dictated stock market direction again today, with equities following a rebound in crude to close higher.
And volatile trade is expected to continue for the commodity. Fundamentals continue to point to overwhelming supply and nonexistent demand but traders must also grapple with uncharted price levels and jawboning from global leaders.
Oil will continue to be in focus tomorrow. More data on employment will arrive and there will be earnings from the semiconductor sector.
Here are three things that could move the markets Thursday.
1. Oil Storage Space Running out Soon?
Oil futures ventured into negative territory for the first time in part because of holders facing rising storage costs with few buyers willing to take delivery.
And the Energy Information Administration said late today that storage capacity at the Cushing, Okla. hub was about 76 million barrels, lower than many in the market thought.
In its inventory report today the EIA put Cushing supplies at 60 million barrels.
Over the past four weeks showed U.S. crude inventories as a whole have grown by a cumulative 65 million barrels. That averages a growth of 16.25 million barrels per week. If all that oil came to Cushing, the hub could fill up by next week.
In addition, President Donald Trump’s Twitter feed will be closely watched for any new moves by the administration or updates on assertions Trump has already made.
Just as the stock market open on Tuesday, Trump pledged his support for U.S. oil and gas companies and said the Treasury and Energy secretaries had been charged with creating a plan to get funds to those companies. Today, Trump said the Navy had been instructed to destroy Iranian gunboats if they harass U.S. ships.
Any details on a plan to help U.S. shale oil producers or any escalation in tensions between the U.S. and Iran could call the tune for sentiment. As could any jawboning from major oil producers.
2. Another 4 Million Jobless Claims Expected
Employment will be in focus before the bell as weekly initial jobless numbers are reported.
The Labor department will issues its measure of first-time applications for unemployment benefits at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists are expecting a smaller, but still historically huge, rise in claims, compared with the week before. The consensus is for a rise in claims of 4.2 million, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
That would bring the total number of newly unemployed to more than 26 million in the past five weeks.
At 9:45 AM ET, Markit will release its preliminary purchasing managers’ indexes for April.
The manufacturing PMI is expected to have dropped to 38 form 48.5 in March. The services PMI is seen sinking to 31.5 from 39.8, further into record low territory.
And at 10:00 AM ET the latest new home sales figures arrive.
New home sales are expected to have plunged 15% in March to an annual rate of 645,000.
3. Intel Earnings on Tap
On the earnings front, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will bring attention to the chip sector after the bell.
Analysts expect the company to report a profit of $1.28 per share on revenue of about $18.6 billion.
Today, Jefferies boosted its price target on the stock to $62 from $53 per share on expectations revenue would top forecasts due to work-from-home components and data center strength.
Earlier this month CEO Bob Swan told Bloomberg earlier this month that the chipmaker is starting to see demand pick up as more people work from home.
Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) will report before the bell, another company expected to have shown resilience during the lockdown.
On average, analysts predict a profit of $2.13 per share on sales of about $841 million."
320,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",Spoiling Rice in Vietnam Ports Show Perils of Food Protectionism,"(Bloomberg) -- Follow Bloomberg on LINE messenger for all the business news and analysis you need.
The owner of one of Vietnam’s biggest rice exporters, Nguyen Quang Hoa, can only watch as 500 containers of sticky rice stranded in a port container yard for a month slowly degrades.
He’s furloughed 400 factory workers, but his losses keep growing. If he doesn’t ship the 12,500 tons of rice soon, he’s worried his Chinese clients will reject it, and his company will be forced to default on $13 million in bank loans.
“We may have to throw away all the sticky rice, and spend more money getting rid of it,” said Hoa, director and founder of Duong Vu Co. “My company is teetering on the edge of collapse.”
Hoa is one of more than 100 traders in Vietnam hurt by a government measure last month to restrict shipments on concerns that global demand will spike as the coronavirus upends supply chains. While the world’s third-biggest rice exporter has since reopened some trade, hundreds of thousands of tons of spoiling rice at the country’s ports show the dangers of curbing exports.
Midnight Registration
Less than three weeks after suspending overseas shipments on March 24, the Vietnamese government said it would allow 400,000 tons of exports in April. To do so, traders had to submit customs declarations, with registration opening at midnight on Saturday April 11.
Within three hours, the export quota was full, according to local news. Many were unable to register, and an estimated 300,000 tons are still stuck at ports, according to Pham Thai Binh, chief executive at exporter Trung An High-Tech Agriculture Co., who sits on the Vietnam Food Association’s governing board.
The trade ministry, which oversees exports, was unavailable to comment.
If the rice isn’t shipped, the companies involved will struggle to survive, the Vietnam Food Association said in a state newspaper. Even with the April quota deducted, there’s still about 1.3 million tons of contracted undelivered rice, according to Bloomberg calculations.
Additionally, uncertainty over whether the government could restrict shipments again is holding back traders from signing new export deals. No new contracts have been signed, even after the export halt was lifted, according to the Vietnam Food Association’s Binh.
Tough Predicament
“Over 100 rice exporters are in financial trouble as thousands of rice containers have been ensnared at ports,” said Binh, whose firm was also unable to sign up for rice exports in April, and has more than 100 containers of rice trapped at ports since March 24.
In Can Tho, a city in Vietnam’s rice belt, officials estimated that a majority of its rice exporters have been losing as much as $14,000 a day each on damages paid to shipping companies, container fees, and fines for being unable to fulfill export contracts, according to Tien Phong newspaper.
Vietnam’s handling of the situation has drawn criticism, with the food association urging the government’s customs department to stop opening the registration for customs declarations at midnight like it did this month. Many traders signed up to ship large amounts even though they didn’t have enough volumes ready for exports, Vietnam News reported.
In response, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc ordered an investigation into profiteering as well as whether there has been any wrongdoing in the state’s management of rice exports. The government also directed the trade ministry to bring forward some of May’s export quotas to this month, adding 100,000 tons for April shipments.
More Curbs?
The trade ministry has been ordered by the premier to submit its rice export plan for next month before April 25. It also proposed that the country ship 2.7 million tons of rice to help farmers, without specifying if the amount is meant for this year.
But concerns over the outlook for exports is only growing. National rice stockpiles, the very reason the export ban happened in the first place, have failed to grow to the state’s target levels due to a spike in domestic prices, raising speculation the government could intervene again. Low-quality rice shipments, which account for about 1/5 of total shipments, may be halted until mid-June to help build inventories.
“We’ve stopped signing new contracts. How can we know if we are able to deliver?” said Nguyen Van Thanh, director of rice exporter Phuoc Thanh IV Co. “Vietnam is offering our export market to other rice producers, and we traders will have to restart from scratch after everything settles down.”

The gambling industry, which thrives on air travel and large groups of people in close proximity, is one of the hardest hit as the world goes into lockdown in its battle against the pandemic.
""The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our business has been unprecedented, and I have never seen anything like it in my over seventy years in business,"" Chief Executive Officer Sheldon Adelson said in a statement.
Revenue from the company's main casino business plunged 55.8% to $1.18 billion, with declines across all of its businesses, including rooms as well as food and beverage.
In March, gambling revenue fell 80% in Macau, the world's biggest casino hub that accounts for more than 60% of the company's revenue.
The S&P 500 casinos and gaming index <.SPLRCCCGL> has lost 49% this year, compared to the 13.4% dip in the S&P 500 (SPX).

Investing.com – The Dow snapped a two-day losing streak on Wednesday as Congress reached a deal on a fourth coronavirus stimulus package and the sea of red in energy abated as oil prices steadied.
The Dow rose 1.99%, or 456 points, theS&P 500 gained 2.29% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.81%.
After two-straight days of sharp declines, oil found its footing, rising 20% despite data underscoring the timid state of demand as weekly U.S. inventories jumped by 15 million barrels, the most since May 2017, further exacerbating the glut in supplies.
The rebound in crude prices underpinned a rebound in energy stocks, which just days earlier were haemorrhaging losses, with Apache (NYSE:APA) up 10%, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) up 10% and  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) closing nearly 10% higher.
Technology, meanwhile, led the broader move higher, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) catching a strong bid as Snap's (NYSE:SNAP) blowout quarter indicated that fears of a material slump in advertising spending due to the coronavirus pandemic may have been somewhat overdone. Snap surged more than 36%.
Elsewhere on the earnings front, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) gave up earlier gains to close about 2.6% lower after reporting a quarterly loss that was not as bad as many had feared. But the company did offer up a gloomy outlook ahead, warning it could take two to three years to recover from the pandemic.
AT&T (NYSE:T), meanwhile, fell 1.3% after the telecom giant missed quarterly earnings estimates as the impact from the coronavirus hit earnings by $435 million.  
The rally on Wall Street comes as some states, including Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas begin to lift the lockdown measures imposed to curb the Covid-19 pandemic.
Colorado became the latest state to join the reopening efforts and is set to get partial reopening underway on April 27.
Investor sentiment was also supported markets by expectations for a fresh wave of stimulus after lawmakers on Capitol Hill reached a deal on a $500 billion coronavirus package to further support the economy."

330,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 03:50PM ET</span>",Securities group asks SEC to intervene for brokers in audit-trail database fight,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. brokers should not be forced to sign an agreement that could make them liable for breaches of a massive new industry trading database that they have no control over, a leading financial industry trade group told regulators on Wednesday.
Brokers must soon begin sending sensitive information derived from their clients' trades to a new database called the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) that the Securities and Exchange Commission tasked exchange operators and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) with building and operating.
But before they begin sending the information, the brokers must sign an agreement that limits the financial liability of the exchanges and FINRA, collectively called self-regulatory organizations (SROs), to $500 per reporting firm if there is a breach of that data. 
That puts the brokers on the hook for any security breaches of the database, which they have no control over, said Kenneth Bentsen, chief executive officer of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), which represents banks, broker-dealers and asset managers.
""SIFMA's guiding principle is 'they who hold the data bear the liability,'"" Bentsen said in a statement. 
SIFMA petitioned the SEC to stay the requirement that brokers sign the agreement before they begin sending the mandated data, which includes sensitive transactional and financial information of their customers, and open the process up to public comment. 
The CAT will allow regulators to track all trades from their inception, pinpointing buyers, sellers, exchanges and brokers involved, with one former SEC commissioner likening it to a Hubble Space Telescope for the securities markets.

The project has faced years of delays, the most recent of which came on Monday when the SEC extended the deadline for broker-dealers to begin submitting reports to June 22, instead of May 20, due to disruptions caused by the coronavirus crisis.

331,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 03:36PM ET</span>",‘Unprecedented’ Has Become Corporate America’s Go-To Descriptor,"(Bloomberg) -- The use of the word unprecedented has become, well, unprecedented.
At a loss to describe the scale of disruption caused by the novel coronavirus, corporate America is falling back on the adjective to describe everything from supply chain stress to the severity of the health crisis. As of Tuesday, nearly three-quarters of the 52 S&P 500 Index companies that have reported since April 14 used “unprecedented” on earnings calls, according to a Bloomberg analysis of transcripts.
Executives at International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp. employed the word seven times in the technology giant’s April 20 earnings call, referencing demands on its customers and “unprecedented times.” BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., the world’s largest asset manager, used the word five times on April 16, including a reference to financial markets.
The coronavirus has infected more than 2.5 million people around the world, and efforts to stop its spread have brought activity in broad swaths of the global economy to a halt. Volatility in financial markets and government efforts to shore up economies have prompted comparisons to the 2008 financial crisis. That period also saw executives commonly use the word “unprecedented” to describe the economic pain, but with less frequency.
Over a comparable period in October 2008, the first reporting period after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection, “unprecedented” appeared in fewer than half of S&P 500 earnings calls.

334,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 03:00PM ET</span>",Troubled Oil ETF Again Shuffles Holdings Amid Market Mayhem,"(Bloomberg) -- For a second straight day, the biggest oil exchange-traded fund reshuffled the mix of futures it owns to track crude prices, extending their average expiration amid unprecedented volatility in its markets.
The $3-billion United States Oil Fund LP (NYSE:USO) took the measure in an effort to reduce its holdings in near-term contracts that have borne the brunt of losses as the global coronavirus lockdown saps demand for oil amid a supply glut. The fund, which is the biggest single owner of West Texas crude futures, moved more of its money into contracts expiring in August and September while reducing June and July.
Moving money to longer-dated contracts means the fund is incurring roll costs, but is protecting against the possibility of having its net asset value fall below zero in the event that front-month oil futures turn deeply negative again.
“What they’ve just said is, ‘we’re going to try to use every item we can think of right now to try and solve this problem we have with the contango in our primary strategy.’ Will any of those things work? No one can know,” said Ken Monahan, senior analyst at Greenwich Associates covering market structure and technology.
On April 16, the fund announced it was moving 20% of its exposure to the second-month futures contract. USO on Tuesday shifted to holding 40% in June futures, 55% in July, and 5% in August. According to the most recent filing , the fund holds roughly 20% of its portfolio in the June contract, 50% in the July contract, 20% in the August contract, and 10% in September.
Extending the expiration of the contracts has become an urgent matter for the ETF after May futures, which the fund had already rolled out of, became engulfed in a selling frenzy on Monday that turned their price negative. Losses have tended to mass in near-term contracts over the past few weeks as concern mushroomed about where to store the crude delivered in such contracts.
At the same time, frantic reshuffling of its holdings has wrecked any claim the ETF has to being a passive product. In its filings, U.S. Oil Fund repeatedly notes that the strategy untethers it from its stated investment objective.
“In an attempt to save the fund and boost its price, they have destroyed the utility of the product,” said Peter Cecchini, Cantor Fitzgerald’s chief market strategist.
USO fell 8.7% to $2.57 as of 2:48 p.m. in New York. The ETF is mired in a nine-day losing streak that has wiped about 40% from its price. Despite its 80% plunge this year, the fund has drawn massive inflows from retail investors confident they can find a bottom in oil prices. In addition to reshuffling its holdings in futures, the fund yesterday suspended new share issuance after reaching limits from previous filings.

Companies have also raced to raise as much credit as possible and preserve liquidity. Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) said in its report on Wednesday that it had raised $5.4 billion of capital since early March.

LONDON (Reuters) - Kraft Heinz (O:KHC) will extend for two weeks a $100 per week stipend for factory workers producing its packaged foods during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company said on Wednesday.
""Kraft Heinz has made the decision to extend the $100 per week stipend for another two weeks and we will continue to evaluate this special compensation program as the situation evolves,"" a spokesman for the U.S.-based maker of Heinz ketchup and Kraft Macaroni & Cheese said in an emailed statement.
The stipend covers factories in the United States, Canada and Europe.
Conditions for its factory workers were called out this week by a chapter of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) representing 227 of 250 employees at a Kraft Heinz factory in Holland, Michigan, where two people tested positive for the coronavirus and three others are presumed to have it. 
The union complained that the essential pay bonuses were tied to employee attendance, and called for a repeal. 
""Our members more than deserve essential pay, but it cannot be tied to their attendance,"" RWDSU Local 705 said in a statement. ""Tying extra pay to attendance encourages workers to come to work when they are sick.""
Kraft Heinz said it would never encourage employees to come to work if they were not well. The company also said it added social distancing throughout its factories and health questionnaires as part of factory employee safety routines. It is also to start conducting temperature checks this week.
The union also complained that employees had to use vacation days if they had to self-quarantine. The company has since lifted that requirement.

Pacer ETFs is planning to launch a “biothreat” fund that tracks an index of companies offering products, technologies and services that are currently in high demand. Those stocks range from businesses that could identify or combat diseases to those enabling social distancing and working from home, according to a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
With millions of people around the world stuck in their home offices to help contain the coronavirus outbreak, companies that specialize in remote-working products are becoming a hot spot. And while biotechnology shares haven’t been immune to the huge volatility, they’ve been withstanding it better than the broader market. Developing new drugs isn’t easy, and making bets in biotech comes with the risk of failure. Yet, the potential payoff for investors can also be enormous when a new medicine succeeds.
“There is likely to be demand for a thematic diversified strategy seeking to combat biotechnology threats as Covid-19 has reshaped global economies,“ said Todd Rosenbluth, the New York-based head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. “However, many of these likely constituents will be in early stages of growth and profitability, while perhaps also trading at a premium due to investor optimism.”
Pacer plans to track the performance of the BioShares BioThreat Index, seeking to include companies with at least $1 billion in market capitalization and a minimum average daily value traded of at least $2 million for the last six months.

341,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 01:10PM ET</span>","Portuguese banks may need to halt loan repayments for longer than six months, say CEOs","By Victoria Waldersee
LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's biggest banks have suspended repayments on loans worth about 19 billion euros ($20.6 billion) for six months to help those hit by the coronavirus crisis and a further extension could prevent a jump in bad loans, chief executives said.
The six-month suspension applied to about 190,000 loans so far, the CEOs told parliament on Tuesday and Wednesday, in line with government policy. But concerns about the speed of any economic recovery justified further leniency, they said.
Economy Minister Pedro Siza Vieira announced last month that housing loans for people who had lost their jobs or been temporarily laid off due to the coronavirus outbreak, and loans to companies, would be suspended between April and September.
The policy could be applied to loans worth a total 20 billion euros.
On top of those loans, banks added a moratorium on credit payments for private consumption and rental payments for people who have suffered a loss of 20% or more in income.
But the CEOs from Caixa Geral de Depositos (CGD), Millennium-bcp (LS:BCP), Novo Banco, BPI and Santander (MC:SAN) Totta told parliament they did not expect clients would be able to resume repayments by October, which could mean a jump in bad debts.
The five banks together account for 80% to 85% of the country's banking system assets.
Portuguese banks have reduced non-performing loans to a total of 17.2 billion euros in December 2019 from a peak of 50 billion euros in June 2016. But Portugal's ratio of bad loans to assets of 6.1% is still twice the European average.
Outstanding loans stood at 234 billion euros in 2019.
President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, opposition leader Rui Rio and other political leaders have called on banks to support the people through the crisis. Rio told parliament this month that banks should have ""zero profits"" in 2020 and 2021.
The CEOs said banks would register hefty impairments due to the crisis. Santander Totta President Pedro Castro e Almeida estimated such impairments could range from 2 billion to 6 billion euros.
""Banks will not profit from this crisis,"" Castro e Almeida said. ""On the contrary, they will be some of most strongly affected.""
The International Monetary Fund has predicted the Portugal could see economic output contract by 8% this year, although the economy minister said on Wednesday the country not yet seen a slowdown in foreign investment.

Under the agreement, brands and retailers commit to paying manufacturers for finished goods and goods in production, the organisation said in a statement. They will also commit to maintaining open lines of communication with supply chain partners about the status of business operations and future planning, it added.
The group called on governments and financial institutions to accelerate access to credit and income support.
""This is an unprecedented crisis that can only be solved through global solidarity,"" said ILO Director-General Guy Ryder. ""The priority must be to sustain businesses and protect workers."" 
Brands and retailers who have signed up to the call to action include Adidas (DE:ADSGn), C&A (SA:CEAB3), H&M (ST:HMb),  Inditex  (MC:ITX), M&S (L:MKS), Primark (L:ABF),  Under Armour  (N:UAA) and PVH (N:PVH), the ILO said.
An international working group will be set up within the next two weeks to elaborate the steps to deliver on the commitments, it added.
The garment industry employs millions of workers worldwide, producing goods for international brands in countries from Vietnam to India. 

Brands reeling from slumping demand as stores close to control the coronavirus outbreak have cancelled an estimated $3 billion worth of orders in Bangladesh alone, where some 4,000 factories employ around 4 million.

(Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) reported higher-than-expected first-quarter profits on Wednesday, benefiting from market volatility fueled by the coronavirus crisis, but the transatlantic exchange operator also warned of uncertainty ahead.
Trading volumes surged as global financial markets were ravaged by the rapid spread of the pandemic in the quarter, leading to a big increase in transactional revenues at Nasdaq.
But the environment also presented challenges, with nearly all of Nasdaq's 27 initial public offerings in the period coming in the first half of the quarter.
""The vast majority of IPO candidates are waiting to see if market conditions stabilize,"" Nasdaq Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman said on a conference call with analysts.
Some companies were also reducing near-term discretionary spending as well as delaying purchasing decisions, which could impact Nasdaq's corporate solutions business, she added.
""Early observations of the impact of the virus in 2020 makes us more cautious about our short-term growth prospects for the remainder of the year,"" she said.
That is because Nasdaq clients are dealing with the twin challenges of a surge in trading volumes and the logistical challenges of the health crisis, with staff working remotely.
At Nasdaq, which also operates exchanges in Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, 98% of employees are working from home.
""We are all navigating through an unprecedented moment in history as our global community fights the spread of COVID-19 and prepares for what will be a lasting impact on our daily life,"" Friedman said. 
Nasdaq reported quarterly net income of $203 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, down from $247 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, a year earlier. 
The drop was mainly due to bond refinancing costs as Nasdaq took advantage of lower interest rates aimed at countering the economic impact of the crisis. Nasdaq said it also borrowed from its revolving credit line to boost its cash position in light of the uncertain environment.
Stripping out one-time items, Nasdaq earned $1.50 per share, topping analysts' expectations by 4 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The higher trading volumes boosted revenues at Nasdaq's market services unit, which oversees transactions, clearing and settlements, by 21%.
Looking at the current quarter, U.S. equity share volumes are up 92% in April versus a year earlier, Friedman said.
Revenues in Nasdaq's non-trading businesses, which provide companies with a broad range of information and technology, were up 7%.

Overall revenue rose 11% to $701 million.

348,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 12:40PM ET</span>",Coronavirus forces Tyson Foods to shutter its largest U.S. pork plant,"By Tom Polansek
(Reuters) -  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) will indefinitely suspend operations at its largest U.S. pork plant to contain the spread of the coronavirus, the company said on Wednesday, further tightening meat supplies after other major slaughterhouse shutdowns.
The closures are limiting the amount of meat the United States can produce during the outbreak and adding stress on farmers who are losing markets for their pigs.
Lockdowns that aim to stop the spread of the coronavirus have also prevented farmers around the globe from delivering food products to consumers. Millions of laborers cannot get to the fields for harvesting and planting, and there are too few truckers to keep goods moving.
Tyson Foods, the largest U.S. meat supplier, said its largest pork plant in Waterloo, Iowa, was closing after operating at reduced capacity. Plant employees tested positive for the virus, and others stayed home out of fear of becoming infected. The facility slaughters about 19,500 hogs a day, or about 5% of total U.S. pork production, according to industry data.
Brazilian-owned JBS USA [JBS.UL] and WH Group's Smithfield Foods [SFII.UL] have each indefinitely closed massive pork plants in Minnesota and South Dakota, respectively. Combined, the three shutdowns remove about 15% of U.S. pork production.
""The closure has significant ramifications beyond our company,"" said Steve Stouffer, group president of Tyson Fresh Meats. ""It means the loss of a vital market outlet for farmers and further contributes to the disruption of the nation's pork supply.""
Reduced meat output comes as demand has increased at grocery stores while restaurant dining rooms are closed due to the virus. 
Tyson said 2,800 workers at the Iowa plant would be compensated during the closure and invited to the facility later this week for coronavirus testing. The outcome of the tests and other factors will determine when the facility will re-open, according to the company.
Other U.S. meat and poultry plants are operating at reduced capacity. Tyson is running a pork plant in Columbus Junction, Iowa, with limited operations after idling it for two weeks.
Iowa farmer Randy Francis delivers 300 pigs to 500 pigs a week to the Waterloo plant for slaughter that are backing up in his barns. He hopes to truck the animals to other plants, but they are already overloaded with other hogs displaced by the shutdowns.
The pigs will put on more weight than normal due to the delays, Francis said. That could make their meat fattier or tougher to chew when they are eventually slaughtered, he said. 
""It's definitely scary times,"" Francis said.

350,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 12:09PM ET</span>",A $6 Billion Windfall: Mexico's Massive Oil Hedge Is Paying Off,"(Bloomberg) -- Mexico is on track to cash in on a $6 billion windfall once its massive insurance program against low oil prices kicks in following a dramatic plunge in prices, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Wednesday.
For the past two decades, Mexico has locked in its oil revenue via put options it buys from a small group of investment banks and oil companies in what’s considered Wall Street’s largest -- and most closely guarded -- annual oil deal.
The options give Mexico the right to sell its oil at a predetermined price. They are the equivalent of an insurance policy: the country banks all gains from a rally but enjoys the security of a minimum floor. So if oil remains weak or plunges even further, Mexico will still book higher prices.
“We protected the Ministry of Finance,” Lopez Obrador said in Mexico City. “We insured an oil price of $49 a barrel. The hedge will allow us to obtain about 150 billion pesos. We won’t lose money due to the oil-price drop.”
The 150 billion translates to about $6.2 billion at current exchange rates, according to a calculation by Bloomberg News.
The hedge has shielded Mexico in every downturn over the last 20 years: it made $5.1 billion when prices crashed in 2009 during the global financial crisis, and it received $6.4 billion in 2015 and another $2.7 billion in 2016 after Saudi Arabia waged a price war.
Hedge Cost
The operation comes at a cost. In recent years, the nation has spent about $1 billion annually buying the options. Although Mexico in the past disclosed information about its hedge, over the last year it has declared the program a state secret to avoid hedge funds and other speculators trying to profit from it.
“The insurance policy isn’t cheap,” Mexico’s Finance Minister Arturo Herrera told broadcaster Televisa on March 10. “But it’s insurance for times like now. Our fiscal budget isn’t going to be hit.”
Mexico hasn’t disclosed who sold it the put options that the country used to hedge its 2020 oil risk. In the past, it has used some of the top names in Wall Street, including  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) & Chase Co., plus the in-house trading arms of big oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc.
The Mexican government told lawmakers earlier this year it has guaranteed revenues to support the assumptions for oil prices made in the country’s budget -- $49 a barrel for the Mexican oil export basket, equivalent to about $60-$65 a barrel for Brent crude. The Mexican oil basket fell on Tuesday to $7.12 a barrel.
Mexico locks its crude revenue via two elements: the hedge, and the country’s oil stabilization fund. The fund historically has only provided $2-$5 a barrel, so it’s realistic to assume that Mexico hedged at around $45 a barrel, at least, for its crude. In the past, the country has hedged around 250 million barrels, equal to nearly all its net oil exports in an operation that runs from Dec. 1 to Nov. 30.
On top of its sovereign oil hedge, which is run by the country’s Ministry of Finance and executed by the central bank, the state-owned oil company Petroleos Mexicanos also runs a much smaller oil hedge.

Sycamore said less than one month after entering the deal with L Brands, the company closed nearly all of its about 1,600 Victoria's Secret and PINK stores globally, including more than a thousand stores in North America. 
L Brands also furloughed most of its Victoria's Secret employees and reduced compensation for senior staff and took other actions that could hurt the lingerie business, Sycamore said in the filing.

 Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), parent company of Mercedes-Benz, is gradually opening its plants in Europe using lessons learned from resuming production at its plant in China, to ensure that the coronavirus does not spread among workers in Germany.

355,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 11:27AM ET</span>",It’s ‘Game On’ for Hedge Fund Bets That Blew Up in Treasury Rout,"(Bloomberg) -- The swift arrival of the Federal Reserve on the scene as the dealer of last resort stopped a spiral in the Treasury market from turning systemic in March.
The question now is whether a gradual retreat by the central bank would create inviting conditions for the return of leveraged strategies that helped tip coronavirus-ravaged markets into chaos.
“Basis trades are game on” after recent changes to the Fed bond-buying program, according to UBS Group AG strategists including Michael Cloherty.
Such long-short styles profit from small differences in the yield between cash Treasuries and the corresponding futures, which usually move together -- except in last month’s explosion of volatility.
The breakdown of the leveraged bets contributed to a wider dislocation that sent Treasury yields climbing at exactly the time investors needed them for protection, according to regulators and dealers.
So-called basis trades seek out the cheapest-to-deliver (CTD) cash security associated with a futures contract.
But contained in the New York Fed’s weekly purchase schedule on Friday was the news that it would no longer buy these CTDs -- and that could leave the door open to a return of destabilizing basis trades.
Hedge funds burned on basis trades in March may also be drawn back into the strategy as repo markets they use to finance the transactions return to normal.
“We will be watching the futures positioning data for signs that positions are getting crowded,” Cloherty and his colleagues wrote in an April 17 note.
For now, CFTC data analyzed by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. show short positions on Treasury futures -- which had swelled to almost $2 trillion at one point -- are returning to a level near their medium-term average using the z-score, a statistical measurement of the value of a data point relative to its average.
With the Fed balance sheet of more than $6 trillion ready to backstop the crisis, the central bank has been tapering weekly Treasury purchases and shifting market-making back to dealers. Tamer volatility has also expanded dealers’ balance sheet capacity by curbing risk.
“The liquidations have largely run their course,” said Jay Barry, a strategist at JPMorgan. “There’s greater dealer capacity to intermediate than there was prior to March.”
That makes a replay of last month remote despite the toll the coronavirus pandemic claims on lives and the global economy.
LTCM Echoes
It’s an open question whether relative-value strategies, which famously led to the downfall of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, pose a risk in normal markets.
But sentiment remains fragile after the haven status of Treasuries has been tarnished in a market where fast-money quants are raising their profile. Some $1 trillion of $9 trillion in hedge fund assets are tied up in systematic strategies, according to a Bank for International Settlements report this month.
Before the Fed stepped in, the safest government debt wasn’t liquid enough to be used for margin calls, according to Bob Treue, founder and the chief executive officer at Barnegat Fund Management, a New Jersey-based hedge fund.
“In mid-March, converting Treasuries to cash became difficult,” he said.
Two-way flows are back and the Fed has put itself firmly in the role of market guardian, but that doesn’t mean it can see off every threat facing investors.
“Given things are so unprecedented now, there’s always some uncertainty that makes it hard to assume things are all better,” said Kevin McPartland, director of market structure at Greenwich Associates LLC.

(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) said on Wednesday it plans to raise about $1 billion in debt to beef up original content, a day after the streaming pioneer doubled its own projections for new customers as stuck-at-home users binged on movies and shows.
Shares of the company were down 3% at $420 in morning trade after it also forecast a weaker second half of the year when shelter-in-place orders are lifted.
Netflix plans to use some of the cash to acquire content and for possible acquisitions, positioning itself as major U.S. studios halt productions and delay film releases due to the coronavirus-led lockdowns.
Most programming for 2020, and much of 2021, has already been filmed and is being finished remotely in post-production, Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said on Tuesday, adding that the company was working on over 200 such projects.
As streaming video grows in the United States, the space has become more competitive with the debut of Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) Disney+ and other upcoming rivals.
That threat has pushed Netflix, with about 183 million global subscribers, to aggressively expand its content and look overseas for growth.
""Despite new services on the horizon from HBO and launches of services from Disney and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), we expect minimal long-term impact to Netflix subscriber addition and retention,"" Piper Sandler analysts wrote in a client note. 
Netflix launched several popular original shows in the first quarter, including action film ""Spenser Confidential,"" documentary miniseries ""Tiger King,"" dating show ""Love is Blind"" and Spanish drama ""Money Heist."" 
The current quarter slate includes the Chris Hemsworth starred action movie ""Extraction,"" sitcom ""#blackAF,"" comedy show ""Space Force"" and reality dating series ""Too Hot to Handle.""
Netflix had a $15 billion cash budget for content last year and BMO Capital Markets had estimated spending on content to top $17 billion this year.
The company, which usually funds its spending spree by sporadically tapping the debt market, is selling senior notes this time. 

Netflix, which has about $15 billion in debt, last raised money in October 2019 through a $2 billion offering of senior notes.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes rose on Wednesday on signs of more stimulus to aid small businesses ride out the coronavirus-induced economic slump and a recovery in oil prices. 
U.S. crude and benchmark Brent prices edged higher after a collapse in the past two days, sending the S&P 500 energy index (SPNY) up 2.8%, with  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) among the top gainers on the blue-chip Dow Jones.
All the 11 major S&P 500 sector indexes were trading higher, as the U.S. Senate approved a relief package of $484 billion, adding to trillions of dollars in stimulus that have helped Wall Street rebound from its March lows.
The House of Representatives is expected to clear the bill on Thursday.
""Investors are looking at the economy very differently than they are looking at markets,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.
""The market is getting a lot of support from the Federal Reserve and the government. The economy is getting some, but the economy is going to move at a different pace.""
The benchmark S&P 500 is still 17% below its record high as state-wide shutdowns spark layoffs and crush consumer spending, putting several sectors at the risk of collapse.
Estimates for U.S. jobless claims for the latest week range as high as 5.5 million, while a reading on April U.S. factory activity is likely to fall to levels last seen during the 2008 financial crisis. Both reports are due Thursday.
Analysts have also drastically cut their S&P 500 earnings expectations for the first and second quarters and are now projecting a corporate recession for 2020, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
A week after the big U.S. banks issued dismal 2020 forecasts, consumer discretionary and technology firms fared slightly better as the lockdown measures boosted demand for online streaming and home delivery of meals.
""Earnings may or may not be good because (the health crisis) just started taking root toward the end of the first quarter,"" said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.
""Investors are looking for what companies are going to say on their prospects for the future and are gauging the ability of management to navigate through this turbulent time."" 
Fast-casual chain  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG) jumped 8.7% after it reported soaring digital and home delivery sales and said it had enough cash and liquidity to get through the next year.
Texas Instruments Inc (O:TXN) rose 3.5% as the chip industry bellwether reported better-than-expected first-quarter results and said a strong inventory allowed it to be prepared for disruptions caused by the pandemic.
Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) more than doubled its own projections for new customers in the first quarter. However, its shares fell 3.6% as it forecast a weaker second half if the lockdown measures were to be lifted.
Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) reported its first quarterly loss in nine years, but shares gained 3.5% after the airline operator said cheap fuel and cost reduction measures will cut its expenses by about half in the current quarter.

At 10:16 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 343.40 points, or 1.49%, at 23,362.28, the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 41.58 points, or 1.52%, at 2,778.14 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was up 149.96 points, or 1.81%, at 8,413.19.

359,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 11:05AM ET</span>",Explainer: Why Norwegian Air matters to Norway,"By Gwladys Fouche
OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Air (OL:NWC), the budget carrier that changed the way people travel across the Atlantic, is fighting for survival as the coronavirus pandemic deepens the company's financial straits, forcing it to furlough staff and cancel flights.
WHY DOES THE AIRLINE MATTER TO NORWAY?
While governments across the world are trying to shore up national airlines, Norwegian Air is particularly valuable to its home country because of Norway's vast geography, which stretches more than 2,200 kilometres across fjords and mountains, with few train lines to transport locals and tourists.
Its capital Oslo is closer to Munich than to its own northernmost mainland town, Hammerfest. The journey would take 24 hours by car.
As a result, domestic flights by Norwegian and its rivals Wideroe and SAS (ST:SAS), play a more important role in Norway's infrastructure than airlines in many other countries.
Norwegian Air ran daily flights to 18 locations domestically before the novel coronavirus outbreak. The frequency of flights has been cut since then, with some routes suspended, and the government is paying the airline, as it does SAS, to run some key domestic routes.
Norwegian Air's domestic route network roughly matches SAS's, helping keeping fare prices down. 
Wideroe, with its fleet of smaller Embraer (SA:EMBR3) and De Haviland planes, serves the smallest communities, with multiple route stops and links to the bigger cities.
Brand Norway would also take a knock from the collapse of Norwegian, whose red and white, reindeer-nosed planes have become an internationally recognised symbol of the country's open and independent culture.
WHY DOESN'T THE GOVERNMENT BAIL IT OUT?
The political debate has centred on whether the state should rescue the airline at all, given its financial problems even before the pandemic struck.
At the end of 2019, it had debts of almost $8 billion built up during a decade of rapid expansion into Europe's third-largest budget carrier. 
Still, the government threw a lifeline to Norwegian Air last month, with credit guarantees worth up to 3 billion crowns ($282 million) - half the value of the total package offered to the airline industry.
Stringent conditions forcing the company to issue more shares attached to that aid reflect the state's reluctance to get drawn into a more costly bailout.
WHAT'S NORWEGIAN DOING?
Its survival depends on creditors accepting a rescue plan, which would convert $4.3 billion of debt into shares and raise some new equity. The airline could then tap the government's guarantees.
Bondholders will vote on April 30. If they agree, it will be put to shareholders on May 4. If that fails, the company is expected to file for bankruptcy. 
WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES?
There aren't many. 
Other airlines are so preoccupied with preserving their own cash, they won't want to take on Norwegian, analysts say. Its demise would also remove a key player, providing some relief to the stricken sector.
Nationalisation is unlikely too. The coalition government includes business-friendly parties the Conservatives and the Liberals, which ran on a platform of letting business run with less state interference than a centre-left government would. 
WHAT'S AT STAKE? 
The loss of 10,000 jobs, just as a collapse in oil prices strikes at the heart of Norway's biggest industry, would deal a major blow to the country's economy.
Rural communities that rely on air travel are also worried that losing Norwegian would cut competition and send ticket prices skyrocketing.

Some rural voters are already turning against the government after a reform aimed at making local public services more robust, but which critics say has reduced their availability.

(Reuters) - A senior White House aide who has been involved with next-generation 5G networks and the global campaign against China's Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] is moving to the Department of Commerce. 
Robert Blair will become director of policy and strategic planning, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement late Tuesday.
Blair replaces Earl Comstock, who held the post for three years. Comstock, who resigned last month, also helped lead the administration's efforts against Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, which was placed on a trade blacklist last year. 
Blair ""will be incredibly valuable to our Department as we continue our work to execute on the President’s bold agenda,"" Ross said in the statement.
President Donald Trump in December named Blair as the special representative for international telecommunications policy to work on the administration's 5G efforts under Larry Kudlow, the White House economic advisor.
Blair also has been a White House aide and was senior advisor to former White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. 
Last fall, Blair defied a subpoena from the U.S. House of representatives committee conducting an impeachment inquiry into whether Trump improperly pressed Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, now the presumptive Democratic nominee for president.

361,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 10:45AM ET</span>",How to Lose 90% of Your Money in 14 Years,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The freedom to dabble in financial markets is a luxury few can afford in times like these, with the virus crisis unleashing a crippling recession, soaring unemployment and a rise in mortality. 
Some who have this freedom seem eager to fritter it away on complex and costly bets on an eventual oil price recovery, which, so far, have been an excellent way to part punters from their cash. Handling a barrel of crude is risky and dangerous work, but so is trading on its price from home. 
One of the most popular and simple ways for retail investors to bet on oil is to invest in United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO) LP, an optically cheap and liquid exchange-traded fund that doesn’t require any expert knowledge or ability to store barrels of oil — just having a brokerage account is enough. The fund does the hard work of buying U.S. benchmark oil futures contracts and rolling them over monthly before they expire. All investors have to do is decide when to get in on the opportunity. With half of the world in lockdown, and no cars in the streets, betting on oil may have seemed like a no-brainer: An estimated $1.6 billion flowed into USO last week.
It’s doubtful whether many of those investors could have guessed what was coming next: A crash in West Texas Intermediate crude futures for May delivery to below $0, precipitated by the global oil glut meeting a lack of available space to store it all.
If even the experts were stunned by the revelation that zero was no longer the worst possible outcome, it’s hard to believe recent arrivals to the USO ETF had a clue. One such investor, evidently still hoping for a turnaround, told the Wall Street Journal: “I’m either going to get my ass handed to me, or I’m going to be really smart.” Only an estimated 13% of the fund was held by traders betting on a fall in the price, according to S3 Partners. Even more remarkably, the fund’s sheer size and wide availability became self-defeating: USO had accumulated one-fifth of all outstanding May futures contracts in recent weeks. When it rolled over its position into June contracts last week, it only served to exacerbate the market slide.
This isn’t just about one ETF — there are plenty of ways for investors to lose money on oil. Online broker Interactive Brokers said on Tuesday that “several” of its customers’ losses on crude futures had decimated their accounts. Earlier this month trading platform CMC Markets Plc’s chief executive officer, Peter Cruddas, pointed to the trend: “Normally (customers) trade shares and indices but there has been a big focus on oil lately.” 
But it’s the size, structure and stock-like trading that makes commodity ETFs like USO so problematic. The fact that the fund is now changing how it functions — due to “ongoing extraordinary market conditions” it may invest in any monthly contract available, or in varying percentages of them — should be of no comfort to wannabe oil traders. A change to strategy on the fly may be helpful for an immediate market dislocation, but it’s not good for transparency and it doesn’t preclude future price plunges if the oversupply of oil persists. “The same drop we’ve just seen could happen again,” says Ole Hansen, a commodities strategist at Saxo Bank.
More information and more health warnings for investors would be good. But many are already out there, and have been summarily ignored. Eric Balchunas, of Bloomberg Intelligence, warned in 2016 that USO was a “disaster waiting to happen” for novice traders who didn’t understand how the hidden costs of rolling a futures contract from one month to the next could hurt. Even in the good times, it’s a pricey proposition: That year, the spot price of oil rose 45%, yet USO rose just 6%. Any investor willing to dig into the archives would see that the fund’s cumulative losses since its inception in 2006 came to 93.7% at end-March, according to ETF company USCF. Greed can often dismiss signals as noise.
Until those warnings get louder, expect people to keep flocking to brokerage platforms on the hope big gains are right around the corner. The volatility is good news for brokers’ trading commissions: CMC Markets expects net trading revenue to double for the year ended March 31. Maybe it’s brokerage profits — CMC’s share price is up 41% in one month — that will be the lucrative flip side of oil’s finger-burning collapse.

362,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 10:40AM ET</span>",Delta to halve cash burn as it turns focus to choppy coronavirus recovery,"By Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) has taken steps to halve its cash burn to $50 million per day through June after posting its first quarterly loss in eight years, and is bracing for a two to three year recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.""We should be prepared for a choppy, sluggish recovery even after the virus is contained,"" Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in an employee memo on Wednesday.
A second wave of the coronavirus is expected to hit the United States next winter and could strike much harder than the first because it would likely arrive at the start of influenza season, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned on Tuesday.
Delta shares opened 3.6% higher but slipped into negative territory by late morning.
In a matter of months, U.S. airlines like Delta have gone from expansion to survival, searching for ways to raise and save as much cash as possible as flight cancellations started outnumbering new bookings around mid-March when Delta said demand dropped to near-zero.
By the end of the quarter, passenger volumes had dropped by as much as 95 percent and Delta was burning $100 million per day. Net sales are expected to remain slightly negative through June, said Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson, who has suspended his retirement to help the airline through the crisis.
After a series of cost-cutting measures and capital raisings, including a government bailout, the airline's daily cash burn will slow to about $50 million by the end of June, and possibly by May, executives said.
The airline expects to have $10 billion in liquidity in June, up from $6 billion in March.
Atlanta-based Delta said its expenses will decline by about 50%, or $5 billion, in the second quarter, and its revenues by 90%.
The airline swung to a $534 million net loss in the first quarter that ended March 31, or a $0.84 loss per share, from a $730 million net profit a year earlier.
Total operating revenues fell 18% to $8.59 billion.
Delta, the first U.S. airline to post first-quarter results, is among those receiving a government bailout meant to cover six months of payroll on the condition that it not lay off employees until October and retain a certain number of flights.
It received half of its $5.4 billion payroll aid on Monday; the remainder will arrive over April, May and June.
The airline also said it was considering applying for an additional $4.6 billion in secured government loans under the stimulus package known as the CARES Act.
Airlines could benefit in the coming quarter from a recent plunge in oil prices, though with so few planes flying the impact may not be substantial.
Between April and June, Delta is reducing its flight schedule by about 85%, including an 80% cut for domestic flights and 90% for international flights, which experts expect will be the slowest to recover. More than 37,000 employees have volunteered for unpaid leaves ranging from one month to one year in duration.
Delta's fuel expenses decreased 19% in the first quarter compared with a year earlier. It paid $1.81 per gallon, including a $29 million benefit from its refinery.
Delta is parking more than 650 aircraft in the midst of the crisis. Some of those jets may never fly again as the airline looks to downsize in the near term.

""This certainly isn’t the world we were expecting when the year began,"" Bastian said.

(Reuters) - AT&T Inc (N:T) pulled its financial forecast for the year on Wednesday as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic clouded its view for the foreseeable future.
Although the company reported revenue and profit per share that was short of Wall Street expectations in the first quarter, a surge in new phone subscribers sent shares up 1.5% in morning trading. 
The U.S. telecom and media giant warned that the current quarter would demonstrate the full impact of nationwide stay-at-home mandates aimed at curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus, which only affected the company's results during the last two weeks of March. 
The Dallas-based phone giant is the first of the big U.S. communications companies to report quarterly results, providing a glimpse into the resilience and challenges faced by the telecoms sector during the coronavirus pandemic.
AT&T said the pandemic reduced earnings by 5 cents per share in the first quarter. A severe blow to advertising sales, due to the postponement of live sports such as college basketball's March Madness and lower wireless equipment sales, led to a $600 million decline in revenue.
AT&T said it had limited visibility for the rest of the year and on its three-year strategic plan https://www.reuters.com/article/us-at-t-elliott/att-to-add-directors-sell-up-to-10-billion-in-assets-next-year-idUSKBN1X7145 announced in October, but added it had enough free cash flow to pay dividends and make debt payments. 
To boost liquidity, the company entered into a $5.5 billion loan agreement, adding to debt that has been a point of contention for its investors. The company reported $154.3 billion in net debt as of the end of March. 
In the first three months, AT&T added 163,000 net new monthly phone subscribers, beating the average Wall Street estimate of 90,700. 
AT&T was able to sign up more customers despite shutting down more than 40% of its retail stores and reported 0.86% in postpaid phone churn, an improvement over last year's churn of 1.07%.
The company said that the coronavirus pandemic had a $435 million impact on EBITDA.
AT&T lost 897,000 so-called premium TV subscribers, which includes its satellite TV provider DirecTV and a small number of U-Verse users, as more consumers cut cords amid the pandemic.
WarnerMedia, which suffered the brunt of the impact from the pandemic, reported $7.4 billion in revenue, down from $8.4 billion from a year earlier. The closing of theaters and halting of production hurt its media business.
On Tuesday, Netflix reported a surprisingly big surge in new subscribers but warned the second half of the year would experience slower growth as stay-at-home orders end.
AT&T is set to launch HBO Max, a subscription streaming video service and Netflix Inc. (O:NFLX) competitor on May 27.
The company reported total revenue of $42.8 billion, missing Wall Street expectations of $44.2 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Excluding items, AT&T reported earnings per share of 84 cents, missing analysts estimates of 85 cents, according to Refinitiv.

365,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 10:35AM ET</span>",U.S. securities regulator warns investors over Chinese company disclosures,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. securities regulator on Wednesday warned investors against putting money into Chinese companies as they rebalance their portfolios following market turmoil due to ongoing problems with those companies' disclosures.
The comments from Securities and Exchange Commission chair Jay Clayton come as hawkish lawmakers and former officials renew efforts to persuade the Trump administration to halt plans to invest billions of federal employee retirement dollars in Chinese companies, reported by Reuters on Tuesday.
Clayton's remarks came after the regulator late on Tuesday said that Beijing-based U.S-listed issuers should ""present risks prominently, in plain English and discuss them with specificity.""
That note reitered that the SEC and other authorities often have substantial difficulties in bringing and enforcing actions against non-U.S. companies for false disclosures around the nature and quality of financial information, including financial reporting and audits.
In an interview on Fox Business Channel on Wednesday, Clayton said, ""This is a time when institutional investors are going through, rebalancing and assessing their portfolios. We are reminding people that when you see disclosures from an emerging market, it may look like a report from a U.S. domestic issuer, but it is not the same kind of investing.
""The risks are different and hard to discern.""
The SEC has been locked in a decade-long struggle with the Chinese government to inspect audits of U.S.-listed Chinese companies. The regulator's accounting oversight arm, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, is still unable to access those critical records, it has said.
The PCAOB, which was set up by the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act and is overseen by the SEC, is tasked with policing the accounting firms that sign off on the books of the nation’s listed companies. Its problems with Chinese audit quality have been festering since 2011, when scores of Chinese companies trading on U.S. exchanges were accused of accounting irregularities.
Reuters reported in February that auditors for listed Chinese companies will also likely struggle to complete their work by stock exchange deadlines because of travel bans and other restrictions designed to limit the spread of the new coronavirus.

The SEC on Wednesday did encourage financial professionals, including broker dealers, ""to consider the limitations and other risks"" when recommending investments in emerging markets, warning that certain risks may vary between jurisdictions and companies.

367,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 10:22AM ET</span>","Stocks - Wall Street Holds Early Gains, Lifted by Oil Bounce, Senate Action","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher after two days of losses as a measure of confidence returned thanks to a rebound in crude oil prices and the Senate's passing of another economic support package, which tops up the existing program for small businesses by more than $400 billion while also channelling more money to hospitals.
By 10:10 AM ET (1410 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 405 points, or 1.8%, at 23,424 points. The S&P 500 was up 1.7% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 2%.
U.S. crude futures bounced smartly after President Donald Trump tweeted threatening military action against Iran if it ""harassed"" U.S. shipping, and after Russia's oil minister Alexander Novak said he thought the collapse in global oil demand had run its course.
The market was also supported by big leaps for social media companies. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock rose 5.3% after announcing a stake of just under 10% in telecom group Reliance Jio, marking its first big investment in India. Rival Snap (NYSE:SNAP) also surged over 24% in response to its first-quarter earnings late on Tuesday, which showed advertising holding up well despite the coronavirus pandemic, and a bigger-than-expected rise both in average daily users and in the time they spend using the Discover feature.
Also up were consumer giant Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB), which reported a sharp rise in sales of toilet paper due to stockpiling, and medical group Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO).
However, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock slipped 2.6% on profit-taking after it reported late Tuesday that its first-quarter earnings missed the high expectations of Wall Street. The streaming giant attracted twice as many new subscribers, net, as analysts had expected, with nearly all the growth coming outside the U.S. (Asia and Europe were ahead of the U.S. in locking audiences down at home). CEO Reed Hastings warned that the trend was unlikely to persist, and had rather brought forward some of the growth that the company had expected to see later in the year.
The news also pulled down  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock, the biggest beneficiary last year of the streaming boom, by 0.9%. 
AT&T (NYSE:T) stock also edged 0.1% lower after the company's first-quarter earnings and revenue missed expectations. The company lost nearly 900,000 subscribers to DirecTV and U-Verse in the quarter as consumers redirected their entertainment dollars to streaming services. AT&T won't launch its new HBO Max service for another month yet. 
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock was left unmoved by its first-quarter loss, which was accompanied by CEO Ed Bastian saying that he has cut the group's cash burn to $50 million a day. After taking government aid and various other measures, Bastian said he still expects to have $10 billion in liquidity at the end of the second quarter. "
368,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 10:20AM ET</span>",Virus outbreak raises spectre of cash injection for indebted EDF,"By Benjamin Mallet and Bate Felix
PARIS (Reuters) - Plummeting electricity demand and falling power prices during the coronavirus outbreak could leave EDF (PA:EDF) in need of a capital injection by the end of 2020 to avoid a spiralling debt crisis, a source close to the French firm and analysts said. 
The state-controlled utility, which operates the world's largest nuclear fleet, has long been weighed down by a 41.1 billion-euro debt pile. 
Shrinking income due to the health crisis and likely delays in reforming France's electricity market, which could have boosted the firm's earnings power, are now adding to its challenges and pressuring its financial ratios.
A source close to EDF's management said the company may need a capital injection towards the end of the year to cushion the shock, with one analyst putting the size of any rights issue at several billion euros.
""The current crisis has plunged EDF into financial difficulties... due to the fall in production and power prices in wholesale markets. This will strongly penalise the company by 2021,"" the source said, requesting to remain anonymous.
The source added that although EDF's production was hedged for this year, ""difficulties will come at the end of 2020 and capitalisation may be necessary at that time.""
The need for a recapitalisation has not been broached by EDF's board yet, the source said.
A spokesman for EDF declined to comment, saying only that the group had strong liquidity. 
At the end of 2019, this included cash, cash equivalents and liquid financial assets available for sale of around 22.8 billion euros ($24.75 billion), according to a company statement, and revolving lines of credit of around 10.3 billion euros.
EDF has withdrawn all its financial targets for this year and next, scrapped plans to pay a final dividend for 2019 and cut its projected 2020 nuclear power generation to a 30-year low.
The French government, which holds an 83% stake in EDF, has set aside 20 billion euros to help large companies that need to shore up their capital base due to the pandemic.
A spokesman for the French finance ministry said that although it does not comment on individual companies, EDF was not the company most affected by the crisis.
The government is already in talks with other firms such as airline Air France-KLM over state support such as government-guaranteed loans. 
EDF last raised capital in early 2017, with the government coughing up 3 billion euros of a 4 billion-euro injection.
SIGNALS AT AMBER 
EDF, which has 57 nuclear reactors in France accounting for around 70% of the country's electricity needs, has also had maintenance schedules disrupted due to the outbreak.
Discussions to restructure the company and the French electricity market, which could have helped EDF cover its investments, have been delayed as the French government and the European Commission focus on the pandemic response.
A spokesperson for the European Commission said that contacts between the Commission and France were ongoing but timing and outcome could not be prejudged.
EDF's two major capital-intensive projects - the construction of the Flamanville 3 EPR nuclear reactor in northern France, and the Hinckley Point C nuclear reactor in Britain - are already facing heavy cost overruns and delays, and could be delayed further due to the crisis.
""The current situation is not sustainable because part of our investments bring us nothing, which forces us to dig further into debt,"" the EDF source said. 
Borrowing more would further strain EDF's targeted debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, debt and amortisation) ratio, which is likely to be breached by the end of 2020, the source added.
This could trigger downgrades by credit ratings agencies and further increase borrowing costs.
""All signals are at amber level, even red,"" the source said.
Tancrede Fulop, an equity analyst at Morningstar, said in a research note that EDF's production would only gradually recover over the next few years and that a rights issue in 2020 was unavoidable.
Morningstar said EDF's steep cash flow shortfall stemming from the fall in nuclear production over 2020-22 would drive an expansion of the company's net debt to EBITDA ratio from 2.5 in 2019 to 3.3 in 2020 and 3.2 in 2021, well above the previous guidance of 2.6 and 2.7 in 2020 and 2021.
""We calculate that a 4 billion euro rights issue will be required to rein in the leverage ratio below 3 in 2020 and 2021,"" it said.

S&P Global Ratings, which placed EDF on credit watch negative after the company revised its nuclear output lower, said the company's rating still benefited from the high ""likelihood of support from the French state if needed.""

372,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 08:36AM ET</span>",Wall Street Gets Even More Bullish on Netflix ,"(Bloomberg) -- Analysts are raising their price targets for Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). after the streaming giant smashed expectations for subscriber additions in the first quarter as lockdowns triggered a wave of binge watching.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Cowen and Piper Sandler are among the brokers who have lifted their targets on shares of the “Tiger King” producer, while Loup Ventures’ Gene Munster called the performance “staggering.”
It wasn’t all positive though, with the company cautioning that some of the virus impact may be temporary and also noting a stronger dollar may reduce the value of sales abroad. Content production has also come to a halt.
The stock was down 2.5% at $422.98 in pre-market trading, having risen 34% year-to-date.
Here’s a summary of what analysts had to say.
Loup Ventures, Gene Munster
Paid net membership adds were “staggering,” and it’s important to note that the company has a notoriously conservative management team.
However, the quarter can be summarized as temporary. “Unfortunately, the truth is people want to spend less time at home.”
Goldman Sachs, Heath P. Terry
Management’s assertion that outperformance was a function of subscribers being pulled forward and that net adds in the second half will fall is likely to prove overly conservative.
The company will continue to benefit from word of mouth customer acquisition and growth in lower cost mobile only plans, as well as a significantly easier competitive environment.
Cowen, John Blackledge
Streaming services typically are counter-cyclical during economic pullbacks because of price/value relationship.
International paid subscriber additions to be driven by increased focus on local content.
Piper Sandler, Michael J. Olson
Raised full-year subscriber estimates, but only modestly, as increased churn is anticipated upon the loosening of rules keeping people at home.
Noted growth was driven in part by the expected roll-out of the 2020 content slate without delays.
CFRA, Tuna N. Amobi
Second quarter guidance for 7.5 million global net adds could be conservative.
Noted the reaffirmation of Netflix’s target for another 300 basis points of margin expansion in 2020.
Citi, Jason B. Bazinet
Subscriber growth exceeded Citi’s expectations in all four regions. Noted EMEA net adds were 6.96 million versus the bank’s forecast of 3.8 million.
That said, management noted a strong dollar may temper the financial impact of better-than-expected subscriber growth.
Wells Fargo, Steven Cahall
Report demonstrates the unique value of Netflix in these even more unique times. “As long as hand sanitizer is sold out, NFLX should outperform, and execution is outstanding.”
Prior bearish view was on valuation with concerns around long-term cash generation, “but frankly such long-term views are a bull market luxury.”
Few businesses are growing right now, but Netflix is adding subscribers at a break-neck pace.

373,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 08:35AM ET</span>",Tissue sales help Kimberly-Clark beat quarterly results,"(Reuters) - Kimberly-Clark Corp (N:KMB) said on Wednesday sales of tissue and toilet paper rose 13% in the first quarter as consumers stocked up in preparation for the coronavirus pandemic, helping the company beat Wall Street estimates for profit and sales.
The company, however, suspended its forecast for the year citing uncertainties caused by the health crisis that has killed at least 177,000 people globally, including over 45,000 in the United States. 
Kimberly-Clark makes several pulp-based products, such as Cottonelle toilet paper, Kleenex facial tissue and Kotex feminine hygiene products, a majority of which, were in high demand as consumers stocked up before the lockdowns to curb the spread of the virus.
Volumes increased 14% in its consumer tissue segment with sales of $1.7 billion, the company said. Sales in the personal care business, that includes diapers and feminine hygiene products, rose 6% to $2.4 billion.
""We increased investments in our business and our market positions remain broadly healthy,"" Chief Executive Officer Mike Hsu said in a statement. 
The company's shares rose 2% to $142 in trading before the bell. 
Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG), which also makes Pampers diapers and Charmin toilet papers, said it had seen a rise in demand for cleaning products including detergents and dish soaps as consumers stayed at home and did their laundry and dishes more often. 
As demand rose, several supermarkets have limited purchases per customer and reduced hours as they struggle to stock up shelves.
Organic sales of Kimberly-Clark's consumer products, which exclude effects of currency fluctuations and acquisitions, rose 11% in North America. 
""A combination of increased consumer demand for our products and strong execution by our teams is reflected in our first quarter results,"" Hsu said. 
Total net sales for the three-months ended March 31 rose about 8% to $5.01 billion. Analysts were expecting sales of $4.89 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Excluding one-time items, the company earned $2.13 per share, well above market estimate of $1.98.

Come clean, Singapore bourse tells companies","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore Exchange's (SI:SGXL) regulatory chief called on listed companies to provide ""prompt and high quality"" information on the impact of the novel coronavirus on their business or risk a loss of investor confidence.
SGX RegCo's CEO Tan Boon Gin gave the guidance in a column on Wednesday, just as Singaporean companies begin issuing quarterly results that will reflect the impact so far of the coronavirus pandemic.
In his remarks, Tan said ""reliance on broad-stroke explanations pinned on a decline in general economic activity to explain away their outlook would be deemed inadequate and of little utility to their shareholders"".
Instead ""prompt and high-quality information"" would benefit both issuers and investors, he said.
""If issuers do not come clean, investors will assume the worst. In today's market, the consequences of late or poor-quality disclosure could be dire,"" he said.
With more than 2.54 million cases reported and 177,000 deaths, the coronavirus outbreak has forced many countries to go into lockdown, disrupting global supply chains and debilitating the global economy.Tan said boards and auditors of companies should increase vigilance on the possible effects of global developments on companies' finances.
""This includes a review of the effectiveness of internal controls, including close scrutiny on high-risk areas such as cash balances and accounts receivables,"" he said.
Since Feb. 7, SGX-listed companies no longer need to issue quarterly reports, in line with practices in markets including Hong Kong, Britain and the European Union.

Companies listed on SGX now only need to file semi-annual reports unless they have issues such as regulatory concerns, in which case they still have to post quarterly results.

375,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 07:50AM ET</span>",Safe as houses? Trading from home tests bank defences during crisis,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Trading worth billions of dollars has shifted to kitchen tables or bedrooms as traders work through the coronavirus crisis from home, testing patchy fixes to make sure they stick to the rules.
Far away from the strict confines of a dealing room, compliance officers find they can no longer eavesdrop on staff, leaving some banks and brokers worried that the activities of their traders under lockdown could come back to haunt them.
""Compliance personnel can't walk the floors and look to see what's actually happening and hear some of the conversations,"" Rachel Sexton, head of EY's financial services forensic and integrity practice in London, said of the new arrangements.
And after facing multi-billion dollar fines for trying to rig currency markets and Libor interest rates, financial firms are relying on their compliance teams as a key line of defence against malpractice and keeping regulators off their backs.
""There are a number of questions in terms of how does a bank convey into the living room all the great work done in instilling cultural and ethical behaviour?"" Martin Pluves, chief executive of Britain's FICC Markets Standards Board, said.
This body was set up to improve conduct in fixed income and commodity markets and Pluves is planning a series of ""sprints"" for participants to help them head off potential conduct traps.
Meanwhile, banks have been asking regulators for reassurance they will not face sanctions once the pandemic has passed, a senior compliance official for a global broker dealer said.
The biggest task has been making sure that traders do not use personal phones for work and that all transactions have an electronic trail that regulators can check for any market abuse.
""For the most part regulators have been understanding about audit trail issues, but only the CFTC has given real relief on potential voice recording issues,"" the officer said, adding that there had been some difficulties with transactions such as doing so-called block trades from home.
""Working from home was very rare before the pandemic, it would be just for the top trader that had a home in the Hamptons,"" said Tim Carmody, chief technology officer at IPC, a Jersey City based financial systems company.
But the weekend retreat of wealthy New Yorkers has been joined by apartments from Auckland to London and Boston as banks and brokerages scrambled to keep business going during the crisis.
To help banks meet compliance rules, Carmody said IPC installed 10,000 voice recording systems in traders' homes in the United States and Europe between the beginning of March and mid-April as national lockdowns were rolled out.
""We have seen which customers were prepared for this and which ones scrambled a bit,"" he said, adding that while deep pocketed big banks installed hundreds if not thousands of kits in traders' homes, smaller institutions have struggled.
RUN TO CATCH UP 
As the coronavirus crisis has unfolded, regulators around the globe have rapidly had to adapt their rules to keep the wheels of finance whirring.
That has led to some unorthodox fixes such as the European Union's securities watchdog simply telling traders to take notes of calls if they get stuck.
""Compliance have had to run to catch up to understand what processes have changed,"" EY's Sexton said. 
Some banks have redeployed compliance staff into customer services roles to help deal with the wave of requests for help from their clients, piling pressure on those trying to stay on top of not only trading floors but areas such as accounting.
""It's a difficult time and many companies will be struggling, so there is the incentive to cook the books here more than there might have been,"" said Sexton, adding that EY is seconding some of its own staff to banks.
Banks in Britain have had to move some compliance staff to the front line to help answer calls from millions of customers wanting a repayment holiday for their mortgage or a loan.
The Financial Conduct Authority has warned lenders they must treat customers fairly in the pandemic and not repeat the shoddy treatment of clients seen in the last crisis a decade ago.
Some compliance cannot be done during the pandemic, however, such as full reviews of trading practices.
""It's hard to do that when you are not sitting at the desk and watching what's going on. Some parts of it you really can't do,"" the senior compliance officer said.
As banks look to life beyond the coronavirus crisis, some such as IPC's Carmody see signs that working patterns will change now that the rubicon has been crossed.
""You could see traders work from home on a Friday.""

The lawmakers said car insurers had reported an almost 50% drop in claims during the lockdown and the British government had said driving was down by 75%, with insurers calculated to make one billion pounds ($1.24 billion) profit from the drop in claims.
""We do not need to restate all of the financial challenges faced by families during these desperately difficult times,"" the cross-party group of 27 members of parliament - mainly from opposition parties - said in a letter to Britain's finance minister Rishi Sunak dated April 18 and seen by Reuters.
""For this reason, we, MPs from all political parties, would suggest to you that HM Treasury take action to ensure that UK insurance companies repay some, or where appropriate all, of premiums to customers.""
Major U.S. motor insurers are offering credit to auto and motorcycle policyholders following a decline in driving, as most Americans stay at home under widespread orders to help contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.
In Britain, insurer Admiral (L:ADML) said on Tuesday it would give back 110 million pounds - or 25 pounds per vehicle - to car and van policyholders due to the lockdown.
Hastings (L:HSTG) said it had passed on a number of benefits to customers, including price reductions and fee waivers, as well as financial support for those customers suffering difficulties meeting payments.
 Direct Line  (L:DLGD) said it had introduced support measures to help customers and RSA (L:RSA) has said customers could update their policies and potentially lower their premiums.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Some blood tests being marketed to tell people if they have had the new coronavirus are a ""disaster"", Roche (S:ROG) Chief Executive Severin Schwan said on Wednesday as he prepares to launch the drugmaker's own antibody test next month.
Roche's (S:ROG) diagnostics business has moved out of the shadow of its main medicines unit during the pandemic, as the Swiss pharma giant confirmed its 2020 sales and profit outlook amid rising demand for COVID-19 testing.
Countries around the world hope such blood tests - meant to show whether people exposed to the disease have developed antibodies thought to offer some immunity - will guide efforts to restart their economies and keep healthcare workers safe.
An erroneous false-positive result could lead to the mistaken conclusion that someone has immunity. In developing its test, Schwan said, Roche scrutinised some existing products for reliability before rejecting them. 
""It's a disaster. These tests are not worth anything, or have very little use,"" Schwan told reporters on a conference call. ""Some of these companies, I tell you, this is ethically very questionable to get out with this stuff."" 
Schwan said there were about 100 such tests on offer, including finger-prick assays that offer a quick result. The Basel-based company declined to specify which rival tests it had studied, but said it was not referring to tests from established testing companies. 
Roche also makes separate tests to determine if a person has an active coronavirus infection, with a sample taken via a swab from nasal passages. 
Sales of those tests helped push first-quarter sales in its Molecular Diagnostics business up 29% in the first three months of the year, it said.
AMATEURS IN GARAGES 
By contrast, Roche's planned antibody test relies on intravenous blood draws taken by a nurse or a doctor. 
Schwan did not release figures for its test's ""specificity"", or how many false-positives can be expected, but promised it would be reliable because Roche had successfully found the antibody produced by the body after exposure to the novel virus.
""This is really what matters,"" he said. ""Every kind of amateur could produce an antibody test. The two of us could do it overnight in the garage. That's not the problem."" 
""The question is, does it really work? And for that, you have to do testing and validation,"" he added.
 Abbott Laboratories  (N:ABT) also said last week it would begin shipping a new coronavirus blood test similar to Roche's by June. Like Roche's test, Abbott's assay would be launched under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's recently relaxed rules for coronavirus tests.
Roche confirmed its existing 2020 forecast for sales to grow in the low-to-mid single-digit percentage range, with core earnings growth per share matching that, after first-quarter sales rose 7% to 15.1 billion Swiss francs ($15.57 billion).

While most of Roche's coronavirus activity has been focused on testing, it is also studying if its older arthritis drug Actemra will help critically ill patients hit by severe immune system reactions, also called cytokine storms. The medicine has already been deployed for such cases on a limited basis, including in China.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Wednesday, bouncing after the hefty two-day selloff, as investors welcomed the news of more Federal aid to bolster the battered economy.
At 07:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 34 points, or 1.3%, higher, Nasdaq futures up 94 points, or 1.1%. The Dow futures contract rose 255 points, or 1.1%.
The equity markets have seen a severe selloff over the last couple of days, hurt by the turmoil surrounding the oil market, with the Dow losing over 1,100 points, or 5%. That said, all three major indices are still on course to post their best month since June.
The Senate signed off on a $484 billion coronavirus aid package for small businesses late Tuesday, the second for a sector of the economy that has been hit hard by the pandemic, shedding millions of jobs. It also included additional help for hospitals and virus testing.
The bill will now be handed to the House of Representatives, which could vote on it as early as Thursday.
In corporate news, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be in the spotlight after it reported a massive jump of 15.77 million in new subscribers late Tuesday, more than double expected, as viewers tuned in amid the coronavirus shutdown. 
However, some of the gloss was removed by cautious comments from CEO Reed Hastings who suggested subscriptions could cool in the next few quarters. Netflix shares, up over 30% year-to-date, fell 0.9% premarket.
Shares in Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) gained 4.6% premarket after the restaurant chain said after the close Tuesday that digital sales more than doubled in March, helping it report positive same-store sales growth despite the country’s social-distancing measures.
Shares in  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) rose 5.6% premarket following a report in the Wall Street Journal that the online travel giant was close to selling a stake to private equity firms Apollo Global Management and Silver Lake Partners, resulting in an infusion of around $1 billion.
The oil market has stabilized to a certain extent Wednesday, although at a much lower level due to extraordinary oversupply.
Inventories at the biggest U.S. storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, are at the highest since 2017 and are likely to rise further. The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute reported that crude stockpiles rose 13.2 million barrels last week and the official Energy Information Administration figures are due later on Wednesday.
TheCrude Oil WTI June contract traded 1.4% lower at $11.41 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.4% to $19.26, having fallen to its lowest level since June 1999 at $15.99.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shielded by the resilience of three behemoth defensive stocks, the Swiss blue-chip index has comfortably weathered the coronavirus storm compared with other European benchmarks which have sustained up to three times more damage.
With no direct exposure to oil, airlines or other sectors battered by the pandemic, the Swiss Market Index (SSMI) is down less than 10% since the beginning of the year. The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index has slumped 21% in the same period.
Switzerland is home to the world's biggest food group Nestle (S:NESN) and pharmaceutical giants Roche (S:ROG) and  Novartis  (S:NOVN), all of whose earnings typically hold up even when markets are in turmoil and economic indicators turning south.
Graphic - European stocks by countries: Switzerland outperforms: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/oakpekwxprd/Pasted%20image%201587504345436.png
Nestle, Roche and Novartis make up over 70% of the blue-chip index, which has a market capitalisation of 1.16 trillion Swiss francs ($1.2 trillion). The trio are the biggest companies by market value in Europe.
Nestle, known globally for its packaged products like Maggi soups, KitKat chocolate bars and Nescafe instant coffee, has been a top pick for investors while restrictions to contain the virus are forcing people around the world to stay at home.
""Markets that are more heavily weighted in defensives in general and pharmaceuticals in particular (Switzerland notably) tend to outperform, while countries heavily weighted in banks and oil and gas tend to lag (typically Italy, France or Norway),"" Makor Capital Markets strategist Stéphane Barbier de la Serre said.
Healthcare and foods have clearly found favour with investors since mid-February, when the virus broke out in Europe, leading to much smaller losses than for banks, car makers or travel and leisure stocks.
Within those sectors, Swiss names have been the top picks.

Analysts warn, however, that the heavy weighting of a handful of stocks in major indexes can give investors a false sense of security.
For example, never before has the overall weight of the top five S&P 500 (SPX) stocks been as high as now, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) (FAAAM) making up 22% of the index with 500 constituents.
A rise in just a few stocks can therefore lift a index even if many of its constituents are actually losing ground.

The EU executive halted its probe on Feb. 24 while waiting for the companies to provide information it had requested. The so-called stop the clock ended on April 7, according to the filing. Sources said millions of documents have been provided in recent months.
The EU competition enforcer in October last year expressed concerns about the $4.2 billion deal, saying it would remove Embraer as the third largest global competitor in the highly concentrated commercial aircraft industry, especially in single-aisle commercial planes. 
Embraer's commercial unit builds jetliners in the 70- to 150-seat segment and competes with the Canadian-designed A220 programme recently acquired by Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR). 

Brazil's competition watchdog has already approved the deal, which has garnered backing from some of the world's largest aircraft buyers.

389,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 05:38AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Fevertree Fizzes as Home-Schooling Parents Are Driven to Drink,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The bad news for Fevertree  (LON:FEVR) investors is that its tonic waters won’t cure the coronavirus. The good news is that it doesn’t need to, given what weeks of home-schooling will do to middle-class parents’ demand for gin.
“While the On-Trade sector is facing an extremely challenging period, we have seen strong sales in the Off-Trade in many of our markets both from the initial buying ahead of lockdown but also in recent weeks as at home consumption has remained robust,” CEO Tim Warrilow said as the company presented its 2019 results on Wednesday. The release was consistent with other sales updates of spirits makers such as  Diageo  (LON:DGE) that have testified to the determination of drinkers not to let the closure of bars disrupt their favorite habit.
Fevertree had also enjoyed a strong start to the year, helped by better pricing in the U.S. As a result, it joined the select band of companies confident enough in its future to not only keep paying a dividend, but to increase it. The final dividend of 9.88 pence a share raises the full-year payout to 15.08p.
Even so, the U.K.-listed maker of mixers had had a rough 2019, as signs of the hipster gin boom peaking shone a harsh light on its astronomical valuation.  From its peak in September 2018 to its trough at the worst of last month’s panic, the stock lost over three-quarters of its value.
It has made an impressive comeback in the last month, a 4.7% rise on Wednesday taking its monthly gains to over 50%.
It’s been helped not least by one of the weirder pieces of pseudoscientific disinformation generated by the pandemic – alas, one that seems destined not to last.
A video by a Missouri chiropractor Eric Napute which claimed that the quinine present in tonic water (he actually quoted rival Britvic’s Schweppes brand) combined with a 100mg zinc tablet could cure the coronavirus got over 21 million views before it was deleted last week.
Napute’s claims dovetailed with claims by President Donald Trump that the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine – which is based on the chemical composition of quinine - could be an effective treatment against the virus (when combined with the antibiotic azithromycin), despite the absence of any reliable supporting evidence. Trump personally pressed federal health officials to make malaria drugs available to treat the coronavirus in March.
“Hopefully, they will both be put in use…IMMEDIATELY,” Trump tweeted on March 21.
The U.S. National Institute of Health formally recommended against the hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin combination on Tuesday, citing the risk of ‘toxicities’ and saying that it increased the risk of cardiac arrest.
Fevertree’s was already resigned to the fact that its Trump Bump in sales was going to be short-lived.
“Anti-malaria drugs contain a significantly higher amount of quinine than tonic water so we would not advise using our tonic water for anything other than making a delicious drink to keep your spirits up during this difficult time,” it said in blog post on Friday."

391,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 04:50AM ET</span>",Tyre industry pushes back against evidence of plastic pollution,"By Joe Brock and John Geddie
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A growing body of scientific research linking tyre wear to microplastic pollution, as well as increasing scrutiny from lawmakers in the European Union (EU), has led the $180 billion-a-year tyre industry to fight back.
The companies have stepped up lobbying with EU lawmakers weighing tougher regulations on tyre wear, according to lawmakers and LobbyFacts.eu, a website that tracks EU lobbying data. They are also quickly countering scientific studies on tyres and microplastic pollution with ones of their own that say tyre particles present no significant risk to humans and the environment.
Cardno ChemRisk, a U.S.-based consultancy that has worked with companies facing chemical exposure litigation, including Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ),  BP  Plc (L:BP) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F)., is spearheading the tyre industry's response to the microplastics threat. It declined to comment for this story.
The plastic particles, which are increasingly being found in the air, food, drinking water and even Arctic ice, may pose a risk to human health and marine life, although there is no scientific consensus on the issue. The World Health Organization said last year that there was an urgent need to find out more about the health impact of microplastics, which some environmental researchers say could weaken the immune system. 
At least 10 studies since 2014 by academics and environmental consultancies cite particles generated by friction between tyres and the road as one of the biggest sources of microplastics - fragments less than five millimetres long – being released into the environment.
REPORTS COMMISSIONED
The tyre industry has published at least ten studies over the last decade concluding that tyre particles present no significant risk to humans and the environment, and are not as prevalent as other research shows.
The reports, available online, were all fully or partly authored by Cardno ChemRisk, according to a Reuters review of the documents. Three of the reports have been published since 2017.
On its website, the consultancy says its work ""is not influenced by the member companies of the (tyre) industry, nor by the trade associations"".
The Tire Industry Project (TIP) – which is funded by 11 tyre companies, including Bridgestone Corp (T:5108), The  Goodyear Tire  & Rubber Co (O:GT), The  Michelin  (PA:MICP) Group  and  Continental AG  (DE:CONG) - commissioned most of those assessments, according to the group's website. 
The European Tyre and Rubber Manufacturers Association (ETRMA), an industry body lobbying European lawmakers, also commissioned a study authored by Cardno ChemRisk consultants. 
Two former Cardno ChemRisk employees who prepared some of the reports and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the assessments were partly aimed at preparing for potential chemical exposure claims that could be brought by individuals, companies or governments. It was not possible to independently confirm this. 
""We focus on issues where we think there is a lot of litigation potential,"" one of the former employees said. ""If we found something that would make our client look bad, we wouldn't publish it.""
Gavin Whitmore, a TIP spokesman, said the group's sponsored research was aimed at ""answering fundamental questions about the potential human health and environmental impacts of tyres"" and not as preparation for possible chemical exposure claims. He added that the group had no knowledge of Cardno ChemRisk omitting information from its studies.
ChemRisk worked with BP after the Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010, Pacific Gas & Electric in the water contamination lawsuit in the 1990s that inspired the movie Erin Brockovich, and for Johnson & Johnson and Ford in asbestos cases. It was bought by Cardno, an Australian infrastructure group, in 2012. 
ETRMA and TIP said the research they commissioned from Cardno ChemRisk was independent and fair.
NEW REGULATIONS LOOM
For tyre makers facing new rules, the stakes are high. EU lawmakers are considering regulations that would set minimum standards for tyre design to reduce microplastic pollution, such as the rate of abrasion and durability.
The requirement could lead to billions of dollars in redesign costs for tyre makers, three industry sources said. 
Jarmo Sunnari, senior manager on standards and regulation at Nokian Tyres Oyj (HE:TYRES), a Finnish manufacturer, said the effect would be of ""that kind of great magnitude"", when asked about estimates of a financial hit of billions of dollars made by several industry experts.
Such added costs would be a financial headache for an industry that has suffered a sharp drop in sales due to the coronavirus outbreak, ETRMA data last week showed.
Fazilet Cinaralp, ETRMA's secretary general, acknowledged a cost from future regulations but that it was too early to quantify. She said ETRMA's goal was to broaden knowledge about tyre wear by funding research and assisting with the development of a tyre wear test.
""The tyre industry wants to be part of the solution,"" said Cinaralp.
Olly Jamieson, a researcher for Eunomia, a sustainability consultancy that conducted a 2018 study on tyre wear for the European Commission, said the industry tended to focus on external factors influencing tyre wear like driver behaviour, road conditions and weather, rather than things like tyre design, cited in the scientific studies.
Environmental groups have also questioned the independence and accuracy of the industry studies. Specifically, they take issue with the narrow use of consultants and the industry's conclusion that there is no risk to health from tyre particles.
""Given evidence of the contribution to both air pollution and aquatic pollution, it is misleading to claim that there is no risk of harm from tyre-wear microplastic emissions,"" said Julian Kirby, plastics pollution campaigner for Friends of the Earth, an environmental group that has studied the links between tyres and plastic pollution in Britain.
""There is an appreciable risk that pollution from car tyres is harmful to human health.""
The tyre companies and company-funded groups say it is premature to declare that particles from tyres are harmful to humans or the environment.
""The peer-reviewed scientific research that we have sponsored concludes that"" tyre and road-wear particles ""present low risk to human health and the environment,"" TIP's Whitmore said.
""The scientific data that we have do not show a risk on human health or any demonstrative impact on flora and fauna,"" said Cyrille Roget, Michelin's technical and scientific communication director. 
""It's important to continue to work on the gaps that we have in our knowledge."" 
Joerg Burfein, who was until recently head of global standards and regulations at Continental, said microplastics had become a focus for the firm in the last two years.
""We are open to solve it but we also said let's look at all facts, let's not have an emotional debate,"" said Burfein, who was named president of Hoosier Racing Tire Corp., a Continental subsidiary, in January.
Eunomia's 2018 study concluded that 500,000 tonnes of microplastics are generated from tyres in the EU every year, accounting for potentially the largest source of microplastics in the aquatic environment. 
A year earlier, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) published a paper that estimated that tyres were responsible for 28% of primary microplastics in the world's oceans.
Weeks later, ETRMA, the tyre-lobbying body, commissioned a study that found that most tyre particles never make it into rivers and oceans as they are captured in drains or by the roadside.
ETRMA says it could be take up to seven years to roll out a test for tyre abrasion, which will impact the timeframe for future legislation. Some critics say this is a delaying tactic. Cinaralp said the ETRMA was not trying to delay EU legislation.

""I do not see any great commitment by the tyre industry to address this problem,"" said Joao de Sousa, a marine plastics specialist at IUCN who has held consultations on microplastics with tyre industry officials. ""They want business as usual.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian share markets were on the defensive on Wednesday as the floor fell out from under crude prices, sparking worries about further turmoil in the energy sector, already reeling from the heavy blow from global shutdowns.
The dizzying dive in oil has turned investors away from stocks to the safety of high-grade bonds, with short-term U.S. Treasuries yields edging down near record low levels.
European shares are on course to claw back earlier losses with pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 futures up 0.98%. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell as much as 1% before erasing losses to last stand at 0.4% higher while Japan's Nikkei slumped 0.7%.
Oil prices plunged again after a shocking fall earlier this week in U.S. crude futures prices to negative levels, hurting anyone saddled with a glut of the commodity.
""Until we see an end in the demand destruction by coronavirus, markets will remain nervous about the possibility of U.S. prices hitting negative levels,"" said Tatsufumi Okoshi, senior commodity analyst at Nomura Securities.
""No U.S. producers will be making money at current price levels. Some oil producing producers in the Middle East may scrape home minimum cash to get by. But at national levels, their fiscal conditions will be very severe.""
International benchmark Brent futures dropped 14.3% to $16.57 per barrel. So far this week, it has lost 40%.
U.S. June crude futures dropped 4.7% to $11.03 per barrel.

The five-year U.S. Treasuries yield hit a record low of 0.3010% on Tuesday and last stood at 0.3339%. The 10-year notes yield stood at 0.561%, near the lowest since March 9, when panic buying drove it a record low.
The risk-averse mood offset news that the U.S. Senate on Tuesday unanimously approved $484 billion in fresh relief for the U.S. economy and hospitals hammered by the pandemic.
Governors of about half a dozen U.S. states pushed ahead on Tuesday with plans to partially reopen for business but some health officials warned doing so could trigger a new surge in coronavirus cases - fears shared by some investors.
As the difficulties of restarting the U.S. economy sank in, U.S. Treasury yields tumbled, with the five-year note hitting a new record low on rising prices for bonds: one of the safest assets.
In the currency market, the dollar was broadly supported as investors fled riskier assets for the world's most liquid currency while putting pressure on oil-linked currencies such as the Norwegian crown and the Canadian dollar.
The safe-haven yen held firm at 107.79 to the dollar while the Swiss franc stood near five-year high against the euro at 1.05255 franc.

The three private investment groups are interested because they are experienced airline investors, said one of the sources, who has direct knowledge of the situation. The five sources declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak with media. 
BGH and Oaktree declined to comment. Apollo did not return requests for comment.
The administrators are looking to execute a binding deal with a buyer by the end of June, The Australian Financial Review reported, citing a confidential flyer sent to interested parties. 
The flyer said an information memorandum would be available to potential buyers by the end of April, there would be an updated management plan ready in early May, non-binding indicative offers would be due in mid-May and binding bids would be due in mid-June, the newspaper reported.
As of Dec. 31, Virgin had A$1.8 billion of unsecured bonds that will be key to a restructuring deal.
""What they need to do is to get rid of some liabilities and then attract new investors,"" said a lawyer representing creditors, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. 
Nomura's credit trading desk said it put the company's value at A$2.3 billion as a going concern under a restructuring that maximizes its valuation, which would value the unsecured bonds at around 20-25% of the issue price.
If the bankrupt airline was liquidated instead of restructured, bondholders would only get around 10% of the issue price or less, Nomura said.
The airline's entry into administration could give any successful bidder the chance to free it from a complex ownership structure that has slowed decision making and been blamed for years of losses.
Several analysts said the best option for Virgin under a new owner would involve getting rid of its wide-body jets and turboprops and keeping its Boeing (N:BA) 737s, the backbone of its domestic fleet.
As of Dec. 31, Virgin had 132 planes, of which 69 were leased and 63 were owned.
The lessors with the biggest financial exposure to Virgin include Goshawk, Aviation PLC (L:AVAP),  Aercap Holdings NV  (N:AER), ORIX Aviation and SMBC Aviation Capital, each with estimated income from the airline of at least $1 million a month, according to aviation data provider Cirium.

398,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 02:36AM ET</span>",European Banks Brace for Storm as Coronavirus Hits Earnings,"(Bloomberg) -- European bank stocks are trading close their steepest-ever discount to U.S. rivals and early signals show that first-quarter earnings may only reinforce the gap.
The continent’s lenders, already in a tough spot before the coronavirus outbreak hit, are likely to detail more worrying news for their embattled investors. In Germany,  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) may have seen credit trading weigh on its markets revenue while  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) probably started to set aside more funds for troubled loans.  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) warned of higher provisions, and French bank  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA has already taken a trading hit.
Italian banks are confronting the prospect a resurgence of troubled loans after spending years decade cleaning up their balance sheets. Switzerland’s big wealth managers may prove an exception, with UBS Group AG and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG already indicating that earnings will rise.
Average prices of European bank stocks compared with their book value are at 50% of U.S. levels, the lowest since a record 48% was reached in 2012 at the height of Europe’s debt crisis. The continent’s banks are set to report on a period hit by lockdowns that have devastated their corporate clients’ income and whipsawed markets, with uncertainties remaining over the duration of the crisis and the level of government assistance that will be given.
Provisions for future bad loans will be a major focus after many of the biggest U.S. lenders set aside billions of dollars in the first quarter. European banks are set to report comparatively small increases in loan loss reserves, Bloomberg reported last week, citing senior bankers and regulators.
Here’s an overview of how various banking businesses may have fared in the first three months of the year.
CORPORATE BANKING
The disruption of global supply chains could hurt banks focused on financing companies and trade. Commerzbank will more than double the amount of funds it sets aside for troubled loans this quarter from the same period last year, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That’s still a smaller jump than at U.S. banks, but provisions will probably continue to rise later this year. On Wednesday, UniCredit SpA said it will book an additional 900 million euros of loan loss provisions in the first quarter to prepare for the economic impact of the coronavirus. On the revenue side, the issuance of new loans probably stalled in March although the effect of companies tapping existing credit lines may “flatter” lending income at banks, according to S&P Global Ratings.
RATES AND CURRENCIES
One bright spot is that swings in the price of sovereign bonds and currencies usually force investors to tap banks for hedging services. That’s why a communication misstep by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and the subsequent roller coaster ride for government notes could be a good thing for banks’ revenue. The focus will be on firms like BNP Paribas, which touted market share gains in rates last year. The volatility could also help Deutsche Bank, one of the world’s biggest currency traders, although analysts only expect a small increase overall in fixed-income trading revenue, compared with a 31% jump at the biggest U.S. banks.
CREDIT TRADING
Corporate bond markets had some of their worst weeks since the financial crisis, with droughts of liquidity from late February into March. Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank are the most exposed banks in Europe to leveraged loans, meaning they’re at risk of being been forced to take losses on debt they invested in or held to facilitate trading for clients, according to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. analysts. Credit Suisse said last month that its overall trading revenue was higher than a year earlier. Oil companies have also suffered from a plunge in the price of crude, which could spell trouble for lenders that are more exposed to the sector such as France’s Natixis SA and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA.
EQUITIES
Stock market brokers were busy in the quarter as investors jettisoned their holdings. While several banks stand to benefit from that level of activity, investors will probably be more focused on the performance in the more complex business of equity derivatives, where SocGen and BNP Paribas are leaders. BNP Paribas lost an estimated 200 million euros ($219 million) when trades went awry in areas including dividend futures and structured products, Bloomberg reported earlier this month citing people familiar with the matter.
ORIGINATION AND ADVISORY
Companies raised a record of at least $752 billion in bond markets around the world last quarter to build cash buffers as the threat of recession grows. While U.S. banks dominate that business, the trend augurs well for  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc, Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas and HSBC Holdings Plc, which were in the top 10 in the first quarter. The picture is a lot less rosy for equity issuance, where volumes declined. Credit Suisse and UBS had the highest ranks among European banks in the business. The deep freeze in mergers and acquisitions has deal makers pitching themselves as restructuring experts to open up a source of revenue once companies run into trouble.
WEALTH MANAGEMENT
The turmoil has given affluent individuals a reason to reassess their portfolios or make opportunistic purchases. That helped wealth management, which is dominated by UBS and Credit Suisse. The latter said on March 19 that private banking was ahead of the year-earlier period thanks to higher transaction revenue. UBS Chief Executive Officer Sergio Ermotti told Bloomberg TV on April 9 that his firm saw “new demand” for loans in its wealth management business. Still, analysts at Barclays recently cut their estimates for how much the two firms stand to earn in private banking in coming years to reflect lower market levels.
RETAIL BANKING
Banks including Commerzbank say this business got off to a good start in 2020, but it’s been undermined by the prospect of interest rates staying low to help deal with the fallout of the virus. Deposits now frequently generate losses for banks because negative rates at central banks aren’t being passed on to the broad mass of customers. The answer for many banks has been to cut costs, but that may be difficult to pull off as many banks try to reassure their workforce by promising to pause staff firings. Generating additional revenue will also be difficult in markets where business is facilitated by face-to-face meetings. “Let’s be realistic, I don’t think that the French citizen will go to branches to borrow money on a mortgage,” SocGen CEO Frederic Oudea said last month at a conference.
GEOGRAPHY MATTERS
Geography is bound to be a major factor as countries such as Italy and Spain have endured the most deadly virus outbreaks. While UniCredit generates slightly less than half its revenue in Italy, rivals such as  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) SpA and Banco BPM SpA are completely dependent on their domestic market.
In Spain, both Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) SA get more revenue from Latin America than their home country. However, that comes with its own issues. Santander withdrew its full-year guidance for its Mexico business, which accounts for 9% of underlying group profit, citing measures such as loan deferral programs.

399,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 02:10AM ET</span>",China's equity funds outperform Asian peers in first quarter,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Tom Westbrook
(Reuters) - China's equity funds topped Asia in price performance in the first quarter of 2020, Refinitiv Lipper data showed, owing to the resilience of the mainland markets during a coronavirus-induced sell-off in the region.
An analysis of 1,348 Asian mutual funds, which are managed by passive and active fund managers and with net assets of $500 million and more, showed seven out of the top 10 performers in the first quarter of 2020, based on price performance, were from China.
China's GF Small Cap Growth Hybrid Fund (LOF) A , China Universal Health Care Service Flexible Fund , GF Innovation Upgrading Mixed Fund , and China Universal Innovative Medicine Mixed Fund  topped the list, climbing more than 10% each in the first quarter.

Effective containment of the coronavirus outbreak, policy stimulus pledge and the sheer size of the national economy helped Chinese stocks fare better than their global peers, analysts said.
The Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) fell 9.8% in the first quarter, compared with the MSCI Asia-Pacific index's (MIAP00000PUS) decline of 19.8%.
""When the rest of the world has to react to something, China can afford not to react so much,"" said Paul Sandhu, head of multi-assets quant solutions at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in Hong Kong.
""They are a massive economy, and their growth is also massive, so in terms of situations like COVID-19... it's not unrealistic for them to have a more tempered response... it's kind of like a nick on a massive aircraft carrier.""
Refinitiv Lipper data and a Morningstar analysis also showed fixed income funds exposed to China were solid performers.
A Reuters analysis showed bond funds comprised almost two thirds of the top 20 performing funds in Asia, led by Hong Kong bond funds run by Fidelity Investments and Principal Global Investments, which returned about 5% over the quarter.
Morningstar, which tracked funds available for sale in Singapore and Hong Kong, showed a similar representation. 
Fund managers Binay Chandgothia and Raj Singh, who run Principal's HK$6.1 billion ($790 million) Hong Kong bond fund, said a strategy of investing in long-duration Hong Kong and U.S. Treasuries as well as shorter-dated corporate credit paid off.
""We knew this portfolio was ideally positioned with this defensive tilt... to withstand these conditions,"" said Chandgothia. 
They received modest inflows, rather than redemptions over the quarter, which they were able to direct into corporate debt of firms including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent.
""When you do well during these environments, it gives a lot of mental satisfaction... your clients tend to remember you for having done a very good job during very volatile times,"" said Chandgothia. 
On the other hand, Australia's real estate funds, heavily exposed to listed landlords, led the worst performers in Asia.
iShares Australian Listed Property Index , Vanguard Australian Property Securities Index  and iShares Wholesale Australian Listed Property Index  shed more than 40% each in the last quarter.

""Most of these REITs, their values are based on passing rents,"" said Simon Mawhinney, chief investment officer at fund manager Allan Gray.
Falling rents or even vacancies as retail tenants struggle with lockdowns or forced closures would pressure balance sheets of many listed landlords, Mawhinney said.

400,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 01:36AM ET</span>",BofA Says S&P 500 to Hit Fresh Lows If Volatility Pattern Holds,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks are likely to see new lows if VIX patterns from yesteryear hold sway, according to Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).
The current bear-market rally most closely resembles what occurred in 2008, and suggests there’s limited further upside before a turn that drags the S&P 500 to fresh lows, strategists led by Benjamin Bowler wrote in a note Tuesday. They drew that conclusion by measuring from the peak of volatility in the three most recent major sell-offs and comparing those with the present one.
Volatility markets are “underpricing the risk of a secondary market shock,” they wrote.
If the S&P 500, which is up about 15% since the March 16 peak in the VIX, continues to trade in line with the 2008-09 bear-market rally, it would top out around 2,960 as the economic impact of this crisis get priced in, according to the report.
In the three previous big sell-offs -- 1987, 2002 and 2008 -- it took between one and a half to four months after the VIX peaks for equity market to bottom, BofA noted. During that time, the S&P 500 rose anywhere from 15% to 25% before falling again, they said.
The analysis is at odds with strategists at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., who maintain that the worst is likely over for stocks. At the same time, others like Guggenheim’s Scott Minerd see risk of the S&P 500 falling well below its mid-March closing low of 2,237.40 as markets work through the implications of Covid-19’s effect on economies, companies and public health globally.
The BofA team recommend selling upside equity calls to fund downside put spreads and selling volatility puts on the belief markets are pricing in a recovery path for the economy that is too optimistic.

401,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 11:54PM ET</span>","Singapore GDP to Shrink 8.5% as Restrictions Extended, Citi Says","(Bloomberg) -- Singapore will witness a deeper recession this year after the nation extended and tightened its partial lockdown,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). warned, widening its forecast for an economic contraction.
The city-state’s economy will contract by 8.5% in 2020, down from an earlier estimate of a 6% fall, economists Wei Zheng Kit and Kai Wei Ang wrote Tuesday after Singapore extended “circuit breaker” measures until June 1 to “decisively” bring down coronavirus cases within the community.
“The circuit breaker would cause close to 25%-30% of GDP to come to a standstill, with every month of extension further reducing 2020 GDP by 2% to 2.5%,” the economists wrote. “The technical rebound after the lifting of the circuit breaker on 1st Jun will be capped by continued social distancing and only gradual recovery in exports.”
Initially seen as a global model for how to contain the pandemic, Singapore now has the most cases in Southeast Asia as Covid-19 spreads quickly in densely packed dormitories housing foreign laborers. The economists warned of further downside risks to their outlook, given that the steps announced Tuesday will bring most construction activities to a standstill and more services will be restricted or suspended.

Any further cut to GDP forecasts for this year or next raises the odds that the Monetary Authority of Singapore will again ease policy by lowering the currency’s trading range at its October meeting, the economists wrote. The de facto central bank, which uses the exchange rate as its main policy tool, took unprecedented easing steps in March by allowing for a weaker exchange rate to support the export-reliant economy.
The government also pledged S$3.8 billion ($2.7 billion) in additional fiscal stimulus Tuesday, bringing the total stimulus offered to more than S$60 billion.

The Samsung (KS:005930) S&P GSCI Crude Oil ER Futures ETF, which held more than $500 million worth of the derivatives as of April 20, lost nearly half its value in Hong Kong on Wednesday. The 45% slump to HK$1.82 was both the biggest decline and the lowest level since trading began in May 2016.

Samsung Asset Management (Hong Kong) Ltd, which manages the fund, said in a Tuesday exchange filing that the fund will sell its entire holdings of June oil contracts and buy September contracts. It also warned that in a “worst case scenario,” the net asset value of the fund may drop to zero and investors may suffer “a total loss” of their investments.
“There is a big tracking error after the ETF switches from tracking June futures to September futures,” said Castor Pang, head of research at Core Pacific-Yamaichi International Hong Kong. “After the switch, the value of the ETF evaporates by more than half because of the plunge in oil futures.”
In the U.S., the United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO), the biggest ETF tracking crude prices, took a series of unusual actions after losing a third of its value in two days. It had to suspend the issuance of new shares, an action that could leave it untethered from prices it’s supposed to track.
ETFs are being rattled because of a quirk in the main U.S. oil benchmark, West Texas Intermediate futures, which requires anyone holding contracts after they expire to be able to take delivery of crude in the oil hub of Cushing, Oklahoma.
Storage tanks there could be completely full by May because of unprecedented lockdown measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus, which have decimated fuel demand. With fewer people able to buy crude and store it, liquidity in near-term contracts could dry up and create squeezes like Monday, when U.S. futures fell to as low as minus $40 a barrel. So ETFs are spreading their exposure into further-out contracts.

The fund said it’s bought 2.6 million shares, equivalent to just over 2% of the company and valued at around 119.6 trillion yen ($1.1 billion) based on Tuesday’s close. It’s held discussions with Nintendo’s management about long-term strategy, ValueAct said in a statement without disclosing price or other details.
Nintendo has built a global following with hit franchises from Mario Bros. to the Legend of Zelda. But it’s struggled in past years to take advantage of the global smartphone gaming boom, and it’s yet to communicate a clear strategy for competing in the online sphere against the likes of Sony Corp (T:6758). or  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). While its Animal Crossing has become the breakout hit of the Covid-19 era, fueling sales of the Switch console, one major test in coming years will be how its next-generation device matches up against Microsoft’s and Sony’s machines.
“Nintendo is building a unique entertainment ecosystem. In their core business Nintendo can become one of largest digital content businesses in the world,” ValueAct Capital Partner Rob Hale said in the statement. “Surrounding this is a growing set of opportunities for consumers to interact with Nintendo characters and stories outside of video games.”
A Nintendo spokesperson acknowledged the investment but declined to comment further. Its shares were up about 2% Wednesday morning.
ValueAct, which has roughly $16 billion in assets under management, has a track record of activist investment in Japan, where it’s taken stakes in Olympus Corp. and JSR Corp. Activist investing has been on the increase in the country in recent years as corporate governance overhauls force management to take notice of shareholders, but successes are still rare, with shareholders often backing management.

405,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 09:54PM ET</span>",Oil Spasms Send Foundering ETF Into Series of Unusual Actions,"(Bloomberg) -- For investors getting crushed by oil’s relentless drop, contortions in the exchange-traded fund they swarmed into are adding mind-numbing complexity to an already anxious situation.
The United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO) has taken a series of unusual actions as the impact of crude’s swoon was exacerbated by wrinkles in the structure of the markets where it operates. The security, which has lost a third of its value in two days, had to suspend the issuance of new shares, an action that could leave it untethered from prices it’s supposed to track.
The episode has shown how seemingly simple products for wagering on a commodity price can get complicated in a hurry, particularly when instruments like crude futures and ETFs interact. About $3.3 billion of value is still at risk in a stock-market product that, in a quest for self-preservation, is making on-the-fly tweaks to rules that have guided it for years.
“The majority of retail investors in this product probably had no idea what these nuances are,” said Ben Johnson, Morningstar’s co-head of passive strategy research. “There’s probably also a portion of them too that fundamentally don’t understand what it is they’ve signed up for -- that there’s no investment product that gives you pure unadulterated exposure to movements in the underlying commodity.”
To be sure, a ton of pain was awaiting anyone speculating that oil would rise. The ETF isn’t itself responsible for the crash in crude, and actions by its overseers have on several occasions kept losses for its owners from spiraling. But extraordinary buying and selling by the fund, the biggest player in oil futures, may be adding to the velocity of the swings, creating feedback loops that some analysts warn could themselves impede a recovery.
Among measures forced on the fund in the past few days has been the loosening of rules dictating which futures it holds. As near-term contracts plunged amid a panic about where to put the oil that they obligated owners to receive, USO has scrambled to move its holdings into longer-dated contracts.
Rejigging Holdings
On Tuesday, USO changed its holdings to keep about 40% of its portfolio in the most active June contract, while parking even more in July and 5% out in August, according to a regulatory filing. The step -- which anchored the ETF to contracts that, while down, have fallen less violently than near-term ones -- was due to “ongoing extraordinary market conditions” in the crude oil market, the filing said. At this point the fund may invest in whatever contracts are available.
Retail investors looking for a bottom to the rout have flocked to the ETF in recent weeks. Their purchases led to another complication in the ETF’s rigging. So much stock was issued to account for their demand that the security exhausted the number of shares it was allowed to issue under past filings. USO on Monday had asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to register an additional 4 billion shares, according to USCF, which runs the ETF.
Until the new shares are cleared by the SEC for issuance, the oil ETF will not purchase more West Texas Intermediate oil futures, according to analysts, potentially adding to pressure on crude prices that have plunged after the coronavirus took a massive toll on global fuel demand.
Trading Questions
USO closed Tuesday at $2.81, down 33% in two days, though its 25% loss Tuesday was dwarfed by the drop in June futures. Trading of USO shares on the NYSE Arca, Inc. won’t be discontinued as a result of the suspension of sales of creation baskets, the company said in the filing announcing it had run out of shares to issue.
Famed oil trader Pierre Andurand said earlier in the day that he thought the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) would have no other choice but to close out long-oil ETF positions because of the risk of negative prices. “Anything that invests in the front two months of WTI is a recipe for disaster,” he added in an interview with Bloomberg TV.
In effect, until the new shares are cleared, the oil ETF will have characteristics of a closed-end fund, with no easy way to keep its price aligned with the underlying commodity. Closed-end funds often trade at sizable discounts or premiums to the market value of their constituents, since there’s no way to offset buying and selling demand in the secondary market by adjusting the supply of shares. USO closed at a premium of roughly 8.4% to its net-asset value on Friday.
Arbitrage Blocked
John Love, president of USCF LLC, didn’t immediately respond to request for comment.
The fund held 23.5% of June West Texas Intermediate crude futures contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of Monday.
Normally, specialized traders known as authorized participants will sell shares of a rallying ETF and purchase the underlying securities to pocket a virtually risk-free profit. That process usually keeps the ETF’s price in lockstep with the fund’s net asset value. However, with the authorized participants no longer able to create shares, that arbitrage trade has been disrupted.
Demand Dynamics
Since demand for the oil ETF has been running incredibly high, the secondary market is likely to create upward price pressure on its stock. At the same time, with no new shares being created, market makers have less incentive to purchase oil futures to exchange with the fund. The elimination of those buyers could effectively put downward pressure on the underlying commodity -- offsetting some of the upward pressure on the stock.
“The ETF will trade at a larger premium versus its net-asset value, and potentially cause a short squeeze in the short-term,” said Mohit Bajaj, director of ETFs for WallachBeth Capital. The authorized participants “can’t buy the ETF shares at NAV,” he said. “There is no way to source shares now. You have to buy it in the open market, causing the price to ramp up higher -- more than what it’s potentially worth.”
Investors looking to bet against the ETF may explain some of the demand for new shares, according to JonesTrading’s Dave Lutz. In the so-called create-to-lend process, new shares of an ETF are generated in order for traders to borrow and sell short.
Short Squeeze
With the current halt of new-share creations, USO is likely to become further unmoored from its net-asset value, Lutz said.
“The ETF should completely disconnect from fundamentals and could cause a hell of a short squeeze,” he wrote in a note Tuesday.
Other funds are feeling the stress as well. Horizons ETF Management said on Tuesday that it will not accept new subscriptions for shares of its BetaPro Crude Oil 2x Daily Bull ETF or its twice-leveraged daily bear ETF, while redemptions will continue to be accepted.
Meanwhile,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc said late Monday it will suspend further sales and issuance of its iPath Series B S&P GSCI Crude Oil Total Return Index ETNs immediately, and exercise its issuer-call option and redeem in full at the end of the month.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ten of the world's largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America, have been sued for allegedly conspiring over nearly 14 years to rig prices in the $9.6 trillion U.S. corporate bond market, costing ordinary investors billions of dollars.
The proposed class action filed on Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan said the banks have since August 2006 violated antitrust law by overcharging investors on ""odd-lot"" trades, which are worth less than $1 million and comprise 90% of all corporate bond trading.
Other defendants include  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, or their respective affiliates.
According to the 81-page complaint, the banks leveraged their power from handling more than two-thirds of U.S. corporate bond underwriting to quietly inflate spreads between the prices where they would buy and sell odd-lot bonds.
This allegedly resulted in spreads 25% to 300% higher than on ""round-lot"" trades over $1 million, which are normally conducted by institutional investors, enabling the banks to reap higher compensation while boosting retail investors' trading costs.
""No reasonable economic justification explains the magnitude of the pricing disparity,"" the complaint said. It added that odd-lot spreads are narrower even in foreign bond markets with lower volumes and liquidity.
Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo declined to comment. Representatives of the other banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The investors are led by Isabel Litovich, a San Juan, Puerto Rico, resident who said the collusion resulted in overcharges on odd-lot bond trades through her Morgan Stanley account.
Lawyers for the plaintiff did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Manhattan court has been home to dozens of private lawsuits accusing banks of conspiring to move various bond, commodity and currency markets. Earlier settlements in some of those cases have resulted in billions of dollars in recoveries.

The case is Litovich v Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) et al, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 20-03154.

407,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 09:10PM ET</span>",Netflix doubles expected signups but warns coronavirus boost may fade,"By Lisa Richwine and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) more than doubled its own projections for new customers as quarantined audiences binged on series such as ""Tiger King,"" but the company predicted a weaker second half of the year if stay-at-home orders to fight the coronavirus are lifted. 
The world's largest streaming service gained 15.8 million paying customers from January through March, bringing its global total to 182.9 million. Netflix had predicted it would add 7 million during the period.
The company warned that it expected fewer new subscribers from July to December compared with a year earlier, however. Many people who would have joined then are likely to have already signed up, executives said. 
""We expect viewing to decline and membership growth to decelerate as home confinement ends,"" Netflix said in a letter to shareholders.
The company is among the few businesses to benefit from government orders imposed in March to keep people away from each other in order to stop the spread of the highly infectious novel coronavirus. While the S&P 500 Index (SPX) has fallen 19% from its Feb. 19 record high, Netflix has gained 11% during the same period. 
Netflix also issued a bullish forecast that it would add 7.5 million new customers for the current quarter, which ends in June, though the company said it was ""mostly guesswork"" given uncertainty over when stay-at-home orders might be lifted. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected 3.8 million.
Investing.com senior analyst Haris Anwar said Netflix's big gains showed ""it's the ultimate stay-at-home stock.""
""That said, there's no guarantee that a global recession and increased competition won't hit Netflix in the latter part of the year,"" Anwar said. ""There's little clarity from the company about the future, and that's likely to hurt the stock in the short run.""
Netflix said the shutdown of film and TV production around the world had temporarily increased its free cash flow but could delay some programming by a quarter. In the second quarter, the impact will be ""modest"" and mostly will affect dubbing in various languages, the company said. 
Most programming for 2020, and much of 2021, already has been filmed and is being finished remotely in post-production, Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said in a post-earnings interview with an analyst.
""We don't anticipate moving the schedule around much, certainly not in 2020,"" Sarandos said.
For the just-ended quarter, Netflix's earnings per share fell short of analyst expectations. The company posted diluted earnings per share of $1.57, below the $1.65 consensus, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Total revenue rose to $5.77 billion from $4.52 billion. Analysts on average had expected $5.76 billion.
Appreciation of the U.S. dollar, due partially to the coronavirus crisis, dragged on international revenue, the company said.
In the quarter, Netflix true-crime documentary ""Tiger King,"" about a colorful Oklahoma zookeeper, became a cultural sensation. It also released reality show ""Love is Blind,"" and a new season of Spanish-language thriller ""Money Heist."" 
As streaming video has grown in the United States, the market has become more competitive with the debut of Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) Disney+ and upcoming rivals. That has pushed Netflix to look for growth overseas.
The company's biggest expansion from January through March came from Europe, where it added 4.4 million new customers. 
The most popular Netflix plan in the United States costs $13, nearly double the $7-per-month cost for Disney+.
Netflix does not currently plan to raise its prices given the global pandemic, Chief Product Officer Greg Peters said.
""At this point we are not even thinking about price increases,"" Peters said.

Shares of Netflix were up 0.5% at $436 in after-hours trading.

409,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 09:00PM ET</span>",U.S. energy companies' quarterly reports to show depths of slump,"By Caroline Valetkevitch and Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are in for more bad news on the energy front in the coming weeks as a host of the sector's biggest companies report quarterly results following the historic collapse in oil prices.
Forecasts for U.S. energy sector earnings this year have dropped along with oil prices, weighing on shares along with worries over debt, layoffs and possible bankruptcies.
Analysts see a 58.9% year-over-year decline in energy earnings for the first quarter, steeper even than the 37.7% decline they projected at the start of the month, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. For the year, energy earnings are estimated to drop more than 95%.
Down a whopping 46% since Dec. 31, energy is by far the S&P 500's worst-performing sector this year. For many Wall Street strategists, it has become a sector that is hard to recommend. 
""It's all messy, and it suggests there's no easy way out of this. We have too much supply and too little demand,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis, which downgraded energy shares to its ""most unfavorable"" rating from ""neutral"" in early February.
The supply-demand situation needs to improve for the outlook to get better, he said. ""What it needs, in a market with investors that have very little patience, is probably for some time to pass.""
Results so far bear out that the season will be grim for energy. On Monday, U.S. oilfield services giant Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) reported a $1 billion first-quarter loss on charges and outlined the largest budget cut yet among top energy companies.
Oil prices have sold off amid concerns about rapidly filling storage space at the key Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point, as demand collapses with the shutdown of businesses as U.S. states try to contain the coronavirus outbreak. 
The spread of the coronavirus has cut fuel demand by roughly 30% worldwide in recent weeks, though oil inventories already had been building after Saudi Arabia and Russia in early March failed to come to terms on extending output cuts.
On Monday, U.S. oil prices ended in negative territory for the first time in history, with the May U.S. WTI contract settling at a discount of $37.63 a barrel. 
Falling prices raise worries for energy firms on everything from debt to future spending to dividends, still cited as a reason to hold energy names. The S&P 500 energy index dividend yield is at 6.6% compared with 2.6% for the S&P 500 index, based on Refinitiv data.
""Probably the dividends are going to be one of the last places they look to conserve cash,"" Samana said.
Next week, energy majors  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) are due to report, while results from exploration and production companies  Devon Energy  Corp (NYSE:DVN), Hess and  Noble Energy  (NASDAQ:NBL) are scheduled to follow.
Historically, while lower oil prices are a negative for energy companies, they are often a boon for consumers and businesses that use a lot of oil, such as airlines and some chemical manufacturers.
The current collapse is different.
""You could say this is great for airlines, but nobody is flying anywhere. You could say it is great for the consumer because gasoline prices are going to go down. Guess what – nobody is filling up their gas tank because nobody is driving anywhere,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.
""That positive benefit of lower energy prices just doesn't affect anyone in a lockdown,"" Hogan said. ""That is true across the board.""
The energy sector's weighting in the S&P 500 has fallen dramatically in recent years, now accounting for just 2.7% of the index, making it the second-smallest sector.
For earnings, S&P 500 companies are expected to see a fall of 13.6% in the first quarter. But once energy is excluded, the expected decline becomes 11.9%, based on Refinitiv data.
Even with the grim expectations, as results come in, investors could find some compelling reasons to buy.
""As the market gets more clarity into supply or demand, we do believe that is going to be priced back in and that can provide a lift into these prices,"" said Darwei Kung, portfolio manager and head of commodities at global asset manager DWS Group in New York.
""There will be separation between winners and losers, and even strong ones, without capital spending, their natural production will decline, so we will see a decline in production regardless,"" Kung said.
U.S. companies have been pulling guidance as they assess the impact of the coronavirus on their operations, but energy companies typically give little earnings guidance even in normal times.

Expedia's shares rose more than 6% in extended trading. The company's shares have fallen about 47% so far this year as global travel restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic ground the travel and tourism industry to a virtual halt.
The company is expected to give board representation to the investors as part of the deal, which could be announced this week, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. 
However, the talks could still collapse and Expedia could opt to raise funds in a public-debt offering instead, the report added.

Expedia and Silver Lake declined to comment, while Apollo did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.

Weekly revenue from the United States declined about 60%, excluding bulk purchases, over the last few weeks, as hospitals focused their efforts on treating surging numbers of patients infected with the novel coronavirus, the world's largest standalone medical device maker said.
Weekly revenue from China, where the pandemic started, has declined 20% to 40% since March 9, adding to the dent it expects to its overall fourth-quarter sales.
More than 2.5 million people globally have been reported to be infected by the virus and over 170,000 have died. 
The company said it was running many of its factories at or near full capacity to have adequate stocks to support an anticipated rebound in procedures and was still on pace to ramp up production of much-needed ventilators by nearly five-fold to more than 1,000 per week by June-end.
Medtronic said it was in a strong position in terms of liquidity, with about $11 billion in cash and investments as of the most recent quarter, and an undrawn $3.5 billion credit facility.

(Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) on Tuesday announced a public offering to raise more than $1 billion, the first major airline to sell equity to help it survive a sharp travel downturn in the coronavirus pandemic.
The offer of 39.25 million shares is underwritten by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC), who IFR said were re-offering the shares at $25.95 to $26.50 each, a discount of up to 6.9% on Tuesday's close of $27.88.
Shares in United, like other airlines, have been punished by decimated travel demand, losing 67% over the past three months as the pandemic forced lockdowns in many countries.
In an effort to boost capital and save costs until people start flying again, U.S. airlines have grounded fleets, raised debt, cut executive salaries, asked employees to take unpaid leaves of absence and sought government aid.
United is set to receive $5 billion from the U.S. Treasury to cover payroll through Sept. 30 and has said it expects to borrow up to about $4.5 billion from a separate government package for airlines. In exchange for part of the funds, the airline must issue warrants for the Treasury to purchase shares at its April 9 closing price of $31.50.
The stock offering announced Tuesday includes a 30-day option for the underwriters, Morgan Stanley and Barclays, to purchase up to 3.93 million additional shares.
In a separate statement on Tuesday, United said it reached a settlement last month with  Boeing Co  (N:BA) over damages incurred in 2019, when airlines were forced to cancel flights due to the 737 MAX grounding that followed two fatal crashes. It did not disclose any financial details.

United on Monday said it expects to report a pre-tax loss of about $2.1 billion for the first quarter.

413,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 08:20PM ET</span>",No takers: Hyundai cars sit in U.S. ports as virus keeps buyers away,"By Joyce Lee and Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - As Detroit's automakers shut production in March due to the coronavirus pandemic, South Korea's  Hyundai Motor  cranked up its factories back home to ship cars to the United States, a move that is proving costly for the world's fifth-largest auto group.
Hyundai (KS:005380) ramped up domestic production to as much as 98% of capacity by late March, not only as the Korean market was recovering from a bad February but also because it bet on demand for Tucson SUVs and other models from U.S. customers, its biggest overseas market outside of China. 
While Hyundai is one of few global automakers whose production has recovered at home, its exports optimism has been dampened by the severity of the U.S. outbreak, weak consumer sentiment and as rivals have quickly moved to guard their turf.
Consignments of cars shipped from South Korea are now sitting in U.S. ports, with dealers slow to take deliveries because of slumping sales and rising inventory, four people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. 
The company idled a Tucson production line at home last week for five days, while sister firm Kia Motors (KS:000270) is looking to suspend three Korean plants for a week. And analysts now expect a sharp drop in first-quarter operating profit when it reports results on Thursday and some even forecast a second-quarter loss. 
""I hope that the situation will recover by the middle of next month. If not, we might have to lay off some people,"" said Brad Cannon, general manager of an exclusive Hyundai dealership in California, whose sales are down more than 50% from when the pandemic started. 
Hyundai runs a factory in Alabama - which is closed until May 1 - but imports are key to meet U.S. demand. Only about half of its vehicles sold in the United States are made in North America compared to between 68% and 85% for Japanese rivals Toyota Motor (T:7203), Nissan Motor (T:7201) and Honda Motor (T:7267), who have also suspended production there till May. 
The South Korean company makes about 61% of its cars overseas, up from 48% a decade ago. That leaves it vulnerable to overseas factory shutdowns and shrinking demand outside of its home market. 
Hyundai's South Korean factory operation, which had recovered from a component shortage from China to nearly 100% capacity by March, could fall to as much as 70% in April, the company recently told analysts. 
""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action promptly,"" Hyundai said in an emailed statement. 
MINIMISING IMPACT
For its part, Hyundai has taken measures to minimise the impact. 
In March, Hyundai relaunched a job-loss protection programme introduced during the 2008-09 global financial crisis in the U.S. market, offering to cover up to six months of payments for car buyers if they lose their job due to COVID-19 this year. 
It has also revamped its model lineup, in a move reminiscent of the car maker's success in 2009 when Hyundai was the only major automaker to post increases in U.S. sales through a revamp of the portfolio and aggressive marketing campaigns. 
But rivals, which were in turmoil a decade ago, are not standing still this time around. Detroit's big three - General Motors (N:GM), Ford (N:F), and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) - have been quicker than Hyundai in launching attractive financial offers, propelling them to their biggest combined market share since 2006 in late March-early April, according to researcher J.D. Power. 
""I think the market has changed… I don't think it will be like 2008. The other makers may be not as aggressive, but pretty much right there,"" Scott Fink, the operator of Hyundai’s biggest U.S. dealer, said. He expects his dealership to post a 40% sales drop in April compared with an 18% decline in March. 
While not optimistic about a quick market recovery, Fink said Hyundai would be still able to resume sales and market share growth, driven by new products like the Palisade SUV. 
RECOVERY AT HOME
Still, demand recovery at home, Hyundai's biggest market, is expected to cushion the blow from the slump overseas, with South Korea's new COVID-19 cases dropping to nine on April 21 from a peak of 909 on Feb. 29, without drastic measures such as lockdowns. 
Hyundai's domestic sales in March hit their highest level in more than four years, up 80% from February, helped by a consumption tax cut. Hyundai also said local pre-orders for new models like the Elantra and Genesis G80 are strong. 
On Saturday, a Hyundai Motor dealership on the outskirts of Seoul was busy, with a steady stream of mask-wearing customers going in and out. 

""Customer traffic has fully recovered to the pre-virus level,"" said Lee Taek-san, the store's general manager, adding some 40 groups are now visiting the showroom on a holiday, from 10 in early March. ""It is a relief,"" he said.

414,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>","Snap shares rise 20% as coronavirus spurs use, revenue growth beats Street","By Sheila Dang
(Reuters) -  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP) on Tuesday beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue and user growth for its Snapchat app, as more people seek entertainment while they stay at home during the global coronavirus pandemic.
Snapchat, known for its disappearing messages, said it saw a jump in usage in the last week of March compared with the end of January, as people increasingly used the app to communicate with friends and family. Usage also increased for Snapchat's original content and in-app games.
Shares of Snap jumped as much as 20% to $14.93 in trading after the bell.
Daily active users (DAU) on Snapchat rose 20% to 229 million in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a year earlier. The figure stood at 218 million in the fourth quarter.
DAU, a widely watched metric by investors and advertisers, beat analysts' average estimate of 224.68 million, according to Refinitiv data.
Revenue, which Snap earns mainly by selling advertising on the app, increased 44% from a year earlier to $462.47 million. The company said higher revenue in the first two months of the quarter offset lower growth in March, when advertisers began to tighten marketing budgets as non-essential stores closed amid the pandemic. 
Analysts had expected revenue of $428.80 million in the first quarter.
So-called ""direct response"" advertisers, or those seeking to increase sales through their ads rather than name recognition, were a bright spot, said Evan Spiegel, chief executive of Snap, during a conference call with analysts. Direct response advertising is now more than half of Snap's total revenue.
Small and medium-sized businesses have been hard-hit during the pandemic, but represent a smaller portion of Snap's direct response ad business, which has helped protect revenue, said Jeremi Gorman, Snap's chief business officer, on the earnings call.
The company said it would shift resources on its sales team to serve advertisers in industries like gaming, home entertainment and consumer packaged goods, which are expected to see higher demand from people stuck at home. 
For example, Snap could help movie studios pivot to digital or streaming releases, Spiegel said.
Snap said it would not provide its usual guidance for the next quarter, given the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus.
""These high growth rates in the beginning of the quarter reflect our investments in our audience, ad products, and optimization, and give us confidence in our ability to grow revenue over the long term,"" Spiegel said.
Research firm eMarketer downgraded growth estimates for the global advertising industry this year to 7% from 7.4% -- a difference of $20 billion -- due to the coronavirus, in a report last month.
Average revenue per user in the first quarter was $2.02, up from $1.68 in the prior year.
Snap's net loss declined slightly to $305.9 million, or 21 cents per share, from $310.4 million, or 23 cents per share, a year earlier.

The funds from the revolving credit facility, originally signed in June 2015, add to the 1.5 billion euros Fiat Chrysler has drawn down from other credit lines.
The outbreak has pummeled vehicle sales and production for automakers across the world, forcing many to take out multi-billion dollar loans to ride out what is likely to be a deep global recession.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) has drawn down over $15 billion from revolving credit lines and last week raised $8 billion from corporate debt investors to shore up its cash.
General Motors Co (N:GM) has entered into a 364-day revolving credit agreement of $1.95 billion, which the company said will be exclusively used by its financial services business.

(Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) said on Tuesday it is shutting down its Maven car-sharing unit, after suspending operations because of the novel coronavirus.
The automaker said it would transfer Maven assets and resources to its Global Innovation group. 
Maven had never gained much traction since it was introduced in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in January 2016. Launched when Dan Ammann was GM's president, Maven had a short-lived strategic alliance with ride services startup  Lyft  (O:LYFT).
Ammann is now chief executive officer of Cruise, the San Francisco self-driving startup that GM acquired under Ammann's aegis in early 2016 just after launching Maven.
Julia Steyn, the first head of Maven, left GM in 2019. She is chief executive officer of Bolt Mobility, an e-scooter rental startup co-founded by world-class sprinter Usain Bolt. 
In a brief statement on Tuesday, Pamela Fletcher, head of GM Global Innovation, said the automaker ""gained extremely valuable insights"" from Maven that would ""benefit and accelerate the growth of other areas"" of GM's business.
GM suspended Maven services in March as the coronavirus triggered increasingly stringent government restrictions on mobility, and ultimately elected to shutter the business.
A GM spokesperson said Maven assets would be transferred to other GM units ""where there is greater potential for profit and growth.""
Other automakers have fared no better than GM in the still-struggling car-sharing sector.
In December, BMW AG (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) said they were exiting the North American car-sharing market. SHARE NOW and its Car2Go unit, a joint venture of the two German automakers, ended operations on Feb. 29 in the United States and Canada, citing high operating costs and the “volatile state of the global mobility landscape.”
The service allowed consumers to rent vehicles by the minute and park them on city streets or at parking meters without charge. It faced tough competition from ride-service companies such as Lyft and Uber Technologies Co (N:UBER), as well as electric scooters.

Investing.com - Stocks took another tumble today, with the Dow falling more than 600 points as the oil markets shook investors’ confidence.
J.P, Morgan was bearish about this week as earnings season ramped up.
“The damage to earnings and activity is likely to linger and the risk is of the (second) wave of infections coming through,” J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note.
Oil will stay in the spotlight tomorrow with inventory data, while earnings arrive from telecom and the airline sectors.
Postmarket earnings today were positive, but stock moves were muted.
Here are three things that could move the market tomorrow.
1. Another Jump in Oil Inventories Expected; Cushing Storage Eyed
Oil continued to dominate headlines today, with crude facing another sharp selloff and June WTI settling down 43%.
Tomorrow the government will issue its weekly report on U.S. oil inventories. The Energy Administration will release the numbers at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT).
Analysts predict a jump in U.S. crude inventories of 16.1 million barrels, compared with a record jump of 19.25 million barrels seen last week, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
In its weekly snapshot of crude inventories, the American Petroleum Institute reported a build of more than 13 million barrels for the week ended April 17 after the bell today.
At 9:30 AM ET, the U.S. Steevol Cushing Storage Report comes out, which will indicate how many barrels are being held at the Cushing, Okla. hub, the spot physical delivery of oil takes place.
Last week’s report showed 5.27 million barrels being held at the hub.

3. Texas Instruments Could Help Chips; Netflix Subscribers Soar
After-hours earnings may bump sentiment up a little in tomorrow’s trading.

There is little clarity from the company about the future and that’s likely to hurt the stock in the short run.”"

The company's shares rose 4% in extended trading as it also said it was in a strong position in terms of liquidity, with $909.2 million in cash and short-term investments and no debt, as of March 31.
With more than 90% of Americans under ""stay-at-home"" or ""shelter-in-place"" orders, Chipotle has had to depend almost entirely on online orders in recent weeks, forcing it to rapidly expand the digital side of its business to keep cash coming in.
The burrito chain partnered with Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats in March to increase the number of regions where it can offer deliveries and is also adding more drive-thru lanes at restaurants, where customers can pick-up online orders without leaving their cars. 
For the first quarter ended March 31, digital sales rose nearly 81% to $371.8 million and accounted for 26.3% of total sales, compared to just 19.6% of sales in the fourth quarter. 
Still, sales volumes for take-out and delivery options are unlikely to be sufficient enough to make up for the hit caused by social distancing measures needed to curb the spread of the virus. 
Chipotle said adjusted same-store sales in the past week were down in the high teens. The company also withdrew its forecast of delivering mid-single digit percentage growth in comparable restaurant sales this year.
Chipotle's same-store sales rose 3.3% in the first quarter, helped by strong demand and higher menu prices in the early part of the year.

Net income fell to $76.4 million, or $2.70 per share, from $88.1 million, or $3.13 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Chipotle earned $3.08 per share, beating analysts' estimates of $2.90, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

(Reuters) - Wall Street tumbled for a second straight day on Tuesday as a collapse in U.S. oil prices and glum forecasts by companies worsened fears of a deep economic downturn. 
All 11 S&P 500 sector indexes fell 1.6% or more, with energy (SPNY) sliding for the seventh time in eight sessions a day after the WTI contract (CLc1) crashed below zero as oil traders ran out of storage for May deliveries.
With the collapse spilling into June futures contracts, equity investors became wary of the extent of the economic damage from sweeping lockdown measures that have halted business activity and sparked millions of layoffs. [O/R]
The S&P information technology index (SPLRCT) slumped 4.1%, while the financial index (SPSY) dropped 3.2%. After many companies pulled their forecasts because of uncertainty related to the coronavirus, investors will focus in the coming days on first-quarter reports for signs of how badly the pandemic is hurting U.S. corporations.
The benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX) has climbed over 20% from its March low, powered by trillions of dollars in stimulus, but it remain nearly 20% below its February record high due to fears of devastating economic damage caused by the coronavirus.
“What you’re seeing is pulling back in the areas that have done well, and taking profits while you can,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey. “The question will be whether this is a consolidation after the market ran up so quickly, or is this the beginning of a more important pullback in the overall market?” 
U.S. jobless claims hit 22 million in the past month as companies launched dramatic cost-saving measures to ride out the slump, and readings of U.S. business activity surveys, due on Thursday, are likely to plummet to recession-era lows.
 Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) provided the latest evidence of the damage wrought by the global health crisis, saying its current-quarter results would take a severe hit from low demand for its soft drinks. Its stock fell 2.5%. 
International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM) declined 3% after the company withdrew its 2020 annual forecast late on Monday.
In extended trade, Netflix (O:NFLX) surged 2.6% after the streaming video company reported more paid subscribers than expected in the first quarter.
Also after the bell, Texas Instruments (O:TXN) rose 3% following its quarterly report.
During Tuesday's session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 2.67% to end at 23,018.88 points, while the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 3.07% to 2,736.57.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 3.48% to 8,263.23.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 4.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.18-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 25 new highs and 34 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.1 billion shares, compared with a 13.2 billion-share average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

(Reuters) - The $349 billion small business loan program passed last month as part of the federal coronavirus relief package discriminated against woman- and minority-owned businesses by prioritizing business with employees over those that do not, according to a lawsuit filed by two Maryland business owners.
The lawsuit was brought by Glitz and Glam Jewelry by LJ, solely owned and operated by LeTresa Williams (NYSE:WMB), and by Alvin Vaughn, sole owner and operator of a financial services business.
They alleged that the loan program, which ran out of money last week, allowed businesses with employees to apply for loans before those without, which they said are disproportionately owned by women and minorities.
The lawsuit, filed Friday, accuses the U.S. Treasury Department and Small Business Administration of violating their right to equal protection under the Constitution, and seeks damages on behalf of a class of all woman- and minority-owned businesses without employees.
""While many larger businesses were able to rush to their banks to avail themselves of the opportunity to participate, most of the minority-owned and woman-owned small businesses were never even given the opportunity to submit an application for the program before the money ran out,"" the lawsuit said.
The Treasury Department and Small Business Administration could not immediately be reached for comment.
The Small Business Administration released guidance on applications for self-employed applicants on April 14, but both Williams and Vaughn said they were unable to obtain loans before the program said it was out of funds on April 16. 
Congress on Tuesday reached a deal on a second round of coronavirus relief, which would provide $321 billion for a small business lending program and $60 billion for a separate emergency disaster loan program also for small businesses.

Responding to criticism that too much of the money from the first relief package had gone to larger, better-connected businesses, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said that $125 billion of small business funds in the latest package would go to ""mom and pop"" and minority-owned stores.

(Reuters) - Investors sent record inflows to high-yield corporate bonds and broke a six-week losing streak for investment-grade debt in the week that ended Wednesday as market volatility from the coronavirus crisis began to subside, according to Lipper data released Thursday. 
U.S. high-yield taxable corporate bond funds drew a record $7.66 billion in the week, while U.S. taxable bond funds took in $10.3 billion. 
The broad push back into financial markets was accompanied by slightly more than $8.8 billion in inflows into mutual and exchange-traded funds that hold U.S. stocks, extending a streak of inflows that began the week of April 1. 
The moves came as the benchmark S&P 500 stock index continued to rally on the back of extraordinary intervention into the bond market by the Federal Reserve, a $2.3 stimulus plan passed by Congress, and signs that the rate of coronavirus infection in hot spots such as New York may be slowing. 
The index is now up more than 25% from its March lows, down approximately 14% in the year to date. 
Money market funds, a proxy for investors seeking safe-haven assets, took in their lowest weekly amount of inflows since March 3. The $46.8 billion in inflows last week was a fifth of the nearly $260 billion in inflows into the category during the week of March 25.

Investing.com – Wall Street fell on Tuesday, as a plunge in oil prices weighed on investor sentiment, even as Congress readies a $500 billion coronavirus aid package to further support the economy.  
The Dow fell 2.67%, or 631 points, theS&P 500 slipped 3,07% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.48%.
Worries over a storage squeeze amid a collapsed in fuel demand sent oil prices sharply lower for the second day in a row.
""The EIA reported in October that storage capacity was around 426.5 (million barrels) and was 55% full. Using inventory since then, we calculate that capacity utilization has risen to over 81%,"" ANZ Research said in a note.
The plunge in energy prices was exacerbated after Railroad Commission of Texas, which oversees oil and gas companies, delayed a vote on mandated production cuts demanded by midsized shale oil drillers.
Despite the plunge in oil prices of more than 40%, energy stocks outperformed the broader market, ending the day down 1.4%.
The selloff in oil stoked worries about loan defaults, pressuring regional banks, which typically carry a larger energy-lending portfolio than that of Wall Street banks.  
The Settle KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking Index fell more than 2.5%.
Tech stocks led the day of selling on Wall Street with FANG and chip stocks bearing the brunt.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fell 4.2%, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell 1.6% and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was down 3.08%, while Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) ended down about 0.77%.
Also weighing on tech,  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) fell 3% after the company pulled guidance and reported quarterly revenue that missed expectations due to the impact from the coronavirus pandemic.
On the economic data front, the decline in existing home sales in March was not as bad as many had feared, but the data was largely shrugged off as it did not reflect the full extent of the lockdown measures, which began in mid-March.
But the lockdown measures in some states are nearing an end, with Georgia and South Carolina set to lift lockdown restrictions this week.
News that Congress reached a tentative agreement Tuesday with President Donald Trump on a nearly $500 billion coronavirus relief bill that would top up the $349 billion small business rescue program failed to lift sentiment. "

FCA intends to make use of a provision in Italy's lockdown laws that allows companies whose activity can be linked to sectors deemed ""essential"" by the government to reopen. 
Fiat Chrysler (FCA) has informed unions that it would seek a green light to restart production from local authorities and would inform central government, basing its decision on Sevel's strategic role, FIM, FIOM, UILM, FISMIC, UGLM and AQCFR unions said in a joint statement.
An FCA spokesman confirmed the carmaker aimed to reopen the Sevel plant on April 27. 
The decision to restart production at Sevel, which has been closed since mid-March like most of other FCA's facilities in Italy, will also mean restarting some components divisions at four other Italian plants, unions said.
The government, facing a backlog of restart applications, is relying on tacit consent by local authorities to speed up procedures.
It recently clarified Italy's lockdown laws to say companies do not need to wait for their local authority's approval to go ahead with requests to reopen.
This means that, unless FCA receives an explicit rejection, the company will be allowed to resume operations in Sevel on Monday. 
Unions in their statement called on Rome to provide a prompt response to FCA's request to provide a guideline covering the automaker's numerous facilities spread across Italy.
Unions also requested meetings with FCA in the coming days to check that all agreed health and safety measures were in place.
FCA earlier this month reached a deal with unions on measures to adopt at its Italian plants once the government eases restrictions on business activity put in place to contain the coronavirus outbreak.
Unions will also make sure that heath rules would be applied to public transportation once productions resumes, they said.

Ruling on a court challenge against the ban by BSR and Deloitte, the Bombay High Court upheld the auditor's arguments that they were erstwhile auditors of the Indian firm and so cannot be banned under a provision of law invoked by the federal government, a government source said of the court's ruling.
The court's 198-page order showed the government has sought an eight-week delay before its Tuesday ruling comes in force. 
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs is likely to appeal the ruling in India's Supreme Court, according to a second government official with direct knowledge.
Deloitte and KPMG did not respond to a request for comment.
As part of a widespread probe of the alleged fraud and mismanagement at IL&FS, India had detected at least 22 violations https://reut.rs/2Voy0tP of auditing standards by the auditors, according to legal filings seen by Reuters.
Both auditors denied any wrongdoing.

434,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 02:00PM ET</span>",New York charges Mallinckrodt with insurance fraud over opioid claims,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state brought civil charges on Tuesday accusing  Mallinckrodt  Plc (N:MNK) of insurance fraud for misrepresenting the safety and efficacy of its opioid drugs, leading to medically unnecessary prescriptions.
Governor Andrew Cuomo said the charges brought by New York's Department of Financial Services are the first against a major opioid manufacturer in the regulator's probe into entities that contributed to the nationwide opioid crisis.
New York accused Mallinckrodt of overstating the benefits of long-term opioid treatment, downplaying the risks of addiction and abuse, and knowing its conduct would result in the payment of fraudulent insurance claims on unnecessary prescriptions.
Mallinckrodt is the largest maker of generic opioids in the United States. According to New York, it supplied more than 1 billion pills to about 5 million policyholders in the state from 2009 to 2019.
The company was charged with violating two New York insurance laws, with civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation. 
Mallinckrodt had no immediate comment.
Tuesday's charges follow Mallinckrodt's Feb. 25 agreement to pay $1.6 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits by state and local governments over its role in the U.S. opioid epidemic.
As part of that agreement, Mallinckrodt agreed to put a U.S. generic drug business into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
Mallinckrodt is headquartered in Staines-Upon-Thames in Britain, and has U.S. offices in Missouri and New Jersey.
Opioids have contributed to more than 400,000 deaths since 1997, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Cuomo has estimated that opioids caused about $2 billion of insurance rate increases to be passed on to New Yorkers.
New York's financial services department formally notified about 23 opioid manufacturers and distributors last year that they might face civil enforcement charges for contributing to rising insurance premiums.
It ordered Mallinckrodt to attend an Aug. 24 hearing at the regulator's offices in Albany, New York.
The U.S. government on March 3 separately charged Mallinckrodt with defrauding Medicaid out of hundreds of millions of dollars on its top-selling Acthar Gel, which treats spasms in infants as well as multiple sclerosis.

In afternoon trading, Mallinckrodt shares were down 49 cents, or 14.1%, at $2.98.

435,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 01:54PM ET</span>","Biggest Oil ETF Could Go ‘Lights Out,’ Warns Wall Street Strategist ","(Bloomberg) -- The blowup of leveraged exchange-traded products is old hat by now.But the recent price action in West Texas Intermediate raises the prospect of the unthinkable: A relatively plain-vanilla fund that offers investors exposure to fluctuations in crude prices might be worth less than nothing.
The $4.1 billion United States Oil Fund LP (ticker NYSE:USO) slumped about 11% to a record low on Monday as the front-month West Texas Intermediate contract made an unpredecented drop below zero, throwing into sharp relief the dearth of demand and storage capacity for the commodity stateside. The ETF tumbled 32% to 12:44 p.m. in New York Tuesday.
USO didn’t own any May futures, with its roll into the June contract scheduled to have been completed by April 13. Its two biggest positions are in the June and July West Texas Intermediate contracts. The net asset value of its holdings could drop below zero in the event the June contract falls well below zero before the projected roll of the position, scheduled to take place from May 5 through May 8.An exchange-traded fund has not and cannot trade below zero, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.Last week, the fund announced a reallocation of its holdings, aiming for 20% exposure to the second-traded future rather than concentrating completely in the front month. Further adjusting this positioning could help protect against the net asset value of its holdings falling below zero. The lack of storage capacity in the near-term is the proximate cause for the May contract’s swoon into negative territory, while contracts further out the curve remain in positive territory for now.Wall Street strategists are speculating about the possibility that a move below zero for the front-month contract this time could prove much more damaging to USO.“Additional hypothetical: the desk notes that despite there not being a redemption mechanism, there is certainly a scenario where if June futures were to also go negative, then USO would be ‘lights out’ as a partnership and could actually ‘owe’ money,” writes Charlie McElligott, cross-asset macro strategist at Nomura Securities. The product’s holdings account for roughly 30% of open interest in the June futures contract, he added.The fund’s prospectus allows for the termination of the fund on a discretionary basis, or resulting from the bankruptcy, dissolution, withdrawal, or removal of the United States Commodity Funds LLC. “However, no level of losses will require USCF to terminate USO,” according to the prospectus.John Love, president of USCF LLC, did not immediately respond to phone calls or an emailed request for comment.
Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth Management, talked to Bloomberg TV about the uncertainty regarding who might be exposed in the event that worst-case scenarios for USO come to pass.“There has been some speculation that the CME or the clearing exchanges may be somehow on the hook for that, or the ETF provider,” she said. “Unclear right now, if the June contract were to go negative who would be on the hook for that but it is certainly part of the enhanced volatility we’re seeing around the trading, both in WTI and in USO today.”
In the case of the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV), the exchange-traded product that offered inverse exposure to short-term volatility futures, language governing so called “acceleration events” that could result in its closure were clearly outlined in the prospectus.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) announced the early redemption of XIV on Feb. 6, the day following an unprecedented doubling in the VIX Index that saw the indicative intraday value of the short-volatility product plummet by more than 80%.USO posted a record inflow last week as traders speculated that depressed oil prices had nowhere to go but up, bets that have since soured spectacularly.

436,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>",Stocks Are Finally Feeling the Fear That’s Hitting Other Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- In the pandemic economy, financial markets have flashed confusing economic signals, muddied by monetary support, the trading impulses of the fast money, and ever-more complex infection data.
But this week the message is loud and clear: the recession is hitting hard.
After a stimulus-driven rebound for the S&P 500 Index, the chaos in oil markets is proving too much for investors to ignore. Crude is now pricing in no less than total demand destruction, and U.S. stocks are slumping as the fallout intensifies from the prolonged economic lockdown.
Oil is on the front line of the turmoil, but it’s far from the only asset that has been ringing alarm bells. Corporate bonds have recovered thanks to policy support, but fear of default is rife.
Government bond yields near historic lows point to expectations that virus-induced pain will be with the world for months or years to come.
“We are left with a situation where we have pretty dire economic conditions at the moment, a collapse in corporate earnings and markets essentially pricing in V—shaped recovery or a far too optimistic scenario,” said Brian O’Reilly, head of market strategy for Mediolanum Asset Management. “Most parts of the market are priced for a recession -- we can take bonds or gold or oil. Just equity investors have gotten a little bit ahead of themselves.”
No asset is screaming a louder warning than oil this week. The price for a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery plunged below zero on Monday for the first time in history ahead of the expiry of contracts today.
While technical factors like vanishing storage capacity are at play, the demand outlook is dire. An easing of lockdowns is set to be sporadic and staggered, and legacy impacts such as altered consumption habits could be lasting. Small wonder June contracts also fell more than 45% at one point Tuesday.
“The hit to demand from virus containment measures will mean that the oil market will remain oversupplied for much of this year,” the team at Capital Economics wrote on Tuesday. “That said, we do expect prices to start to pick up later this year in tandem with somewhat stronger global economic activity.”
Optimism on a 2021 rebound is one reason stocks had proven so resilient to disruptions in other market corners. Anchored by a recovery in large-caps and tech companies, the S&P 500 Index gained 28% from its March low to the end of last week.
That caused all manner of hand-wringing on Wall Street on the perceived disconnect between equities and the economy. Every piece of data from retail sales to home building and surveys of manufacturing sentiment has been dismal across America, with policy stimulus found wanting so far.

The acute pain from the oil crisis also threatens to upend the recent calm in the corporate debt market, where a wave of energy company defaults is expected.
U.S. junk bond spreads remain far below the 1,100 basis points they reached a month ago, but they snapped a two-day rally amid the oil wipeout Monday, with spreads widening 15 basis points to 720 basis points.
The argument is that credit stability is a product of emergency Federal Reserve action and little else. The U.S. central bank has unleashed hundreds of billions of dollars of bond buying in a bid to keep markets functioning, including support for corporate obligations and even some high-yield debt.
“The signal of intent from policy makers has been so strong that they have changed the balance of risk,” said Karen Ward, chief market strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management. “They have taken away the left-hand tail -- the risk that the market could be down another 30%.”
But that’s unlikely to prevent a wave of failing companies. The U.S. corporate high-yield default rate will likely exceed 4% this month, up from 2.9% at the end of March, Fitch Ratings said last week. That would be the highest in more than three years.
All told the “Great Lockdown” recession -- possibly the steepest in almost a century -- has the likes of James McCormick (NYSE:MKC) at NatWest Markets shifting to a negative stance on risk. He thinks recent stock gains have been excessive.
“Oil prices exaggerate the level of global weakness, and equity exaggerates the potential for recovery,” the strategist said. “They are both wrong as global growth guides.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), the largest U.S. lender, said on Tuesday it was working on a plan to bring thousands of employees currently working from home back onsite in phases, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.
JPMorgan is the first big bank to announce steps to return to normal as debate grows over reopening the U.S. economy after the novel coronavirus shuttered businesses across the country and put a record 22 million people out of work.
""Two considerations are paramount as we plan for this across the firm: We want to do it at the right time — which may differ by region, country and state — and in a manner that prioritizes your health and safety,"" the bank's Operating Committee said in the memo.
Around 180,000 of JPMorgan's more than 200,000 employees have been working from home, with around 25% of its bank branches closed, in an effort to protect employees from the virus, it has said. The bank continued to pay staff whose hours were reduced by their normal branches being closed.
The bank said Tuesday it does not have a firm timeline for when it will return employees to offices. It added that it will follow guidance from government and health authorities and would take into consideration concerns over access to transportation and school re-openings.
U.S. President Donald Trump has pressed states to begin easing restrictions on non-essential businesses, sparking criticism from some health officials who say doing so will lead to a second wave of infections.
The World Health Organization warned on Tuesday that lifting lockdowns must be gradual or populations will risk a resurgence in cases of the deadly COVID-19 respiratory disease caused by the virus.

New York City, home to JPMorgan's headquarters, is in shutdown until at last May 15.

The health crisis first hit China - a major market for high-end wares - late last year before spreading elsewhere, and several European states including Italy and France as well as the United States have since gone into lockdown to try to cope.
At group level, Kering sales fell 15.4% to 3.2 billion euros ($3.47 billion). That was a 16.4% drop like-for-like, which strips out the effect of acquisitions and currency swings.

451,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 11:29AM ET</span>","Stocks - Wall Street Falls, Pressured by Oil Gloom","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets remained sharply lower for a second-straight day on Tuesday as a string of corporate warnings about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic reinforced a painful hangover from Monday's volatility in oil markets. 
By 11:25 AM ET (1525 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 610 points, or 2.8%. The S&P 500 was down 3.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 3.8%, the latter in part due to weak data on exports of South Korean semiconductors.
All three indices had fallen heavily at the start of the week as crude oil prices had turned negative due to crushing oversupply in the spot market.
The psychological shock of seeing oil, the world's most important commodity for the last 100 years, trade below zero for the first time on Monday has been profound. Of the majors, only Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) outperformed the broader market, remaining basically flat. while  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock was down 1.7%, and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) was down 2.75%. Smaller upstream companies were outperforming slightly after heavy falls in the previous session. 
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) argued in a note to clients on Tuesday that while the coordinated cut by OPEC and its allies had been ""too little, too late"" to save prices in the current quarter, but created the basis for a solid rebound in the second half. 
President Donald Trump, meanwhile, raised expectations of a possible bailout for the sector on Tuesday, tweeting that: ""We will never let the great U.S. Oil & Gas Industry down. I have instructed the Secretary of Energy and Secretary of the Treasury to formulate a plan which will make funds available so that these very important companies and jobs will be secured long into the future!""
Congressional Democrats had previously blocked the appropriation of some $3 billion for purchases to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and do not appear to have changed their position since. Trump mentioned on Monday that an import ban on Saudi oil could be considered. 
Away from the oil patch, a number of heavyweight stocks underperformed after the Covid-19 pandemic hit their reports for the first three months of this year; Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) warned that the closure of social venues would hit it particularly badly in the current quarter, while IBM (NYSE:IBM) stock fell 5.9% after it warned of a sharp drop in business investment after the bell on Monday. Big Blue returned to its trend of falling revenue as clients deferred major upgrades to their IT.  German rival SAP's ADRs (NYSE:SAP) fell 5.8% after the departure of co-CEO Jennifer Morgan less than six months after she was promoted to the job.
 Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) stock had a different sort of Covid-19 problem after a rogue art director promoted a T-shirt with the motif ""bat fried rice"", triggering outrage in China, where it was perceived as a reference to the livestock market in Wuhan where the virus is believed to have jumped species. Lululemon stock was down 4.1%. 
By contrast, the day's biggest gainer was Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) stock, which rose more than 5% after announcing a distribution deal with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) in China. Demand for plant-based alternatives to meat is seen by both companies as being structurally supported by the negative publicity around China's policing of its food chain.

453,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 11:18AM ET</span>",Gold’s Allure Spurs Surge in ETF Flows With Oil Rattling Nerves,"(Bloomberg) -- Anxious traders watching oil’s collapse have been piling into gold in a bid for safety, but the dollar’s rally is simultaneously pushing down prices.
State Street’s SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) ETF, ticker GLD, is on pace for its best month of inflows since 2016, with $4.3 billion collected so far, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Meantime, BlackRock’s iShares Gold Trust, or IAU, has taken in almost $1.3 billion in April, already its best month on record.
Investors lacking confidence in the stock rally of recent weeks are increasing gold purchases as a hedge until there’s more clarity on how the coronavirus will impact economic growth. Oil’s unprecedented plunge Monday further ramped up demand for risk-off positions in exchange-traded funds.
“In the environment of heightened uncertainty and the corresponding volatility that comes with it, that’s obviously been a major support for gold prices throughout this period,” said Candice Bangsund, portfolio manager of global asset allocation at Fiera Capital Corp. “At the same time, you’ve got central banks expanding their balance sheets, interest rates are at rock bottom levels, yields are negative -- this is all buoying the allure of gold.”
Total gold held by ETFs has risen 14% this year to 94.5 million ounces, the highest level since at least April 2019. Tuesday marked the 21st consecutive day of growth.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). also raised its 18-month gold-price target to $3,000 an ounce, more than 50% above the existing price record, as policy makers unveil record fiscal and monetary stimulus. The precious metal has climbed 11% this year to $1,681 an ounce and reached a seven-year high last week before paring gains.
A strong dollar, reduced financial market volatility and lower jewelry demand in India and China could cause headwinds for gold prices, BofA analysts cautioned, even as they forecast gains. The dollar climbed against most major currencies Tuesday.

454,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 11:18AM ET</span>","Trump Mega-Donor, a Shipping Magnate, Pushes to End a Shutdown","(Bloomberg) -- An unusual email greeted employees at a Wisconsin shipping-supply company on Friday. It urged them to support a petition for the recall of the state’s Democratic governor, Tony Evers, saying he was violating their constitutional right to work during the coronavirus pandemic.
Most significant, the message came from their boss, billionaire Liz Uihlein, one of the Republican Party’s biggest donors and an economic adviser to President Donald Trump.
The request bothered some staffers, in part because they consider Uihlein insufficiently supportive of work-from-home policies -- something her company disputes, calling its employees’ health and safety “our top priority.”
As protests grip Wisconsin and other states with Democratic governors, the debate is dividing neighbors, politicians and business executives. Big company CEOs -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- have generally urged caution about reopening because of the health risk, yet some of the GOP’s biggest donors have been pushing hardest on the side of lifting restrictions.
Charles Koch, chairman of Koch Industries, and the advocacy groups he supports have also questioned blanket shutdowns, saying businesses should have the flexibility to adapt safely to the virus.
But few have objected more strongly than Liz Uihlein, chief executive officer of closely held Uline -- a simplification of her family’s name, which is pronounced You-Line.
“I want to see America get back to work,” Uihlein said in a statement, explaining her opposition to the governor’s decision to shut down the state for five more weeks. “We love our customers, and we love our employees. We think about our employees and their families. We need a strong economy and a healthy business to support them.”
On the day when Trump declared a national emergency after weeks of downplaying the risk, she questioned the urgency.
“The Media is Overblowing COVID-19,” she said in a March 13 email to dozens of lawmakers in Illinois, where the company has major operations. “At what point do we go back to our normal lives? This has been a huge disruption.”
Over the past decade, Liz Uihlein and her husband, Richard, Uline’s chairman, have given about $95 million to Republican candidates and causes, more than anyone else except casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
In 2016, Trump named Liz Uihlein to an advisory council designed to “get the American economy back on track.” In October, Vice President Mike Pence visited Uline’s warehouse in Wisconsin, one of the stops he made at businesses during a tour promoting the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.
On March 17, Liz Uihlein was among the business executives listed as participants in a call with Trump about the nation’s virus response. She missed the meeting, the company said; the White House declined to discuss the Uihleins.
In 1980, the couple founded their company, which is based in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin. Richard seeded Uline with a loan from his father, who co-founded an office-supply company and was a descendant of a founder of Schlitz Brewing Co.
Today, Uline has more than $5 billion in annual sales and about 6,500 employees. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index estimates that the family has a net worth of roughly $4 billion.
The Uihleins, who are in their 70s, oppose unions and support small government. Uline’s website features links to Liz Uihlein’s letters to customers from the company’s 800-plus page catalog, which offers more than 35,000 products. Over the years, she has written about what she considers burdensome regulation in California, the importance of family dinners and term limits for politicians and noted that the couple’s TV is mostly set to Fox News.
Uline is up-and-running because it supplies essential businesses that are generally exempt from state shelter-in-place orders. Packaging shipped from its warehouses across the U.S., as well as in Canada and Mexico, is used for the delivery of food, medicine and testing.
“This week, the White House called upon us twice with huge orders,” including 4,000 dust masks for local test centers, Liz Uihlein said in a March 19 email to employees. The company said the request came from a member of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on a White House coronavirus task force.
Uline said it has had Covid-19 infections in four locations and that it sent those workers home and notified and protected staffers; several of the recovered employees have returned to work. It said it instituted safety measures, including social-distancing, cleaning and masks.
The company’s professional employees -- in roles such as sales, marketing and finance -- stopped working from their offices in late March, though some are returning in staggered shifts.
While understanding the need for in-person warehouse employees, many staffers questioned why call-center workers had been asked to keep coming in, according to interviews with nine current and former staffers in professional, warehouse and customer-service roles. They requested anonymity because of concern over their jobs.
State orders, including the ones from Wisconsin and Illinois, say even essential businesses should promote telework when possible. Other large companies, such as  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ)., are handling all call-center operations from home.
Uline said its customer operations, which handle more than 35,000 calls and emails a day, aren’t designed to function remotely. More than 60% of that staff worked from home by the end of last month, according to the company.
To reward those remaining on site, Uline offers an extra $5 an hour. Those who can’t work remotely or don’t feel safe reporting to an office or warehouse receive reduced salaries -- a measure similar to other companies that have cut pay or furloughed employees. Initially, Uline offered two-thirds pay; the company has since reduced the sum to one-half.
“Right now, our order and call volumes are not slowing down,” a voice mail from Uline to its staff said this month. “We need more employees on-site to help the teammates who are processing orders.”

458,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 11:15AM ET</span>",Dash for emergency cash provokes fund industry backlash,"By Simon Jessop, Sinead Cruise and Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - As companies pull the emergency cash cord to help them through the coronavirus crisis, shareholders have been split by an easing of the rules to make it easier for them to turn to investors with the deepest pockets. 
In pursing this path, cash-strapped publicly-listed companies and institutional fund managers risk alienating legions of loyal retail investors, whose holdings are diluted.
A change to British market regulations last month enabled firms to raise equity equivalent to up to 20% of their share capital in quick-fire share sales.
These allow companies to skip the conventions of investor roadshows, the publication of detailed prospectuses and so-called pre-emption rights, which bestow equal rights on all shareholders to participate in any capital increase.
""This is clearly an extraordinary situation so it's that balance between the companies that urgently need funds and the ease of execution of these transactions versus the sanctity of pre-emption rights,"" Claire Keast-Butler, a partner in London at law firm Cooley, told Reuters.
A total of 3.7 billion pounds ($4.5 billion) was raised by 79 companies listed in Britain between March 2 and April 17, AJ Bell, which helps retail investors save and invest in the stock market, has calculated, some via emergency cash calls.
Richard Buxton, head of UK equities at Merian Global Investors, said he proactively encouraged British food and drinks provider SSP (L:SSPG) to raise cash last month.
SSP ended up raising 216 million pounds, mostly from its two biggest investors BlackRock (N:BLK) and Merian.
While acknowledging the capital raising would be ""pretty dilutive"" and had its critics among investors who were not included, Buxton said Merian decided it was better for SSP to act now, to avoid coming back for more later.
""We wanted to get it over and done with, get the issue knocked on the head so the company could stand its corner.""
Travel and retail are among the industries feeling the most immediate effects of the coronavirus crisis, and it is these sectors which have most quickly turned to big investors, often leaving smaller shareholders with a lesser stake. 
""It seems very probable that greater numbers of firms will come to market for cash. For those institutions or funds with cash, this could be an opportunity to take a stake in a business they like, or top up an existing holding, at an advantageous price,"" Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said.
Mould describes dilution as ""the enemy of the investor"", as it lessens their share of a company's future profits.
Not all companies are going to find it easy to tap investors, however deep their institutional pockets, for cash either now or in the future.
""I think those who have the highest chance of getting the best result can combine three things: a well-liked management team, a supportive bank group and a strong shareholder register,"" Andreas Bernstorff, head of equity capital markets at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), told Reuters.
'NEED FOR SPEED'
Leading fund managers  Schroders  (L:SDR) and Invesco (N:IVZ) have both weighed into the debate, with Schroders largely supportive of the potential need for fast-track issuance, while Invesco warned boards to first look at other options, such as turning to the government for help.
""Companies shouldn't, especially if your share price has been hammered, necessarily think of equity as the first solution,"" Piers Coombs, head of the London office at investment bank Goodbody, told Reuters.
Firms listed in Britain have been the biggest users of quick equity raisings because many continental European countries demand shareholder approval first, a rule that has forced most firms to instead agree new credit facilities with banks, such as the $15 billion line secured by Airbus (PA:AIR).
Only Amadeus (DE:AMDG) and Nexi (MI:NEXII) have so far tapped European equity markets, for 750 million euros and 43 million euros respectively, although both also issued convertible bonds as part of the overall funding package.
In Britain, among the biggest cash calls were  Informa  (L:INF), which raised 1 billion pounds in a sale equal to 19.99% of its existing share capital and fashion retailer ASOS (L:ASOS), which raised its issued equity by 18.8% to bolster its finances by 247 million pounds.
It is this type of deal which prompted a group of City of London heavyweights, including Fidelity International Chief Executive Anne Richards and AJ Bell founder Andy Bell, to send an open letter to British companies this week demanding they respect the rights of retail investors.
The issue is not just a British one.
In Australia, the regulator has also loosened the rules, extending the period for which companies can be suspended and still raise capital with less documentation, while the stock exchange, among other measures, upped the proportion of capital that companies can raise through placements from 15% to 25%.
Whether the coronavirus crisis raising prove to be a one-off will only become clear once it is over.
""We have always said, in exceptional circumstances, we accept that pre-emption does sometimes have to be set aside just because of the need for speed,"" Merian's Buxton said.

465,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 10:50AM ET</span>",Battered consumer confidence to slow airlines' recovery: IATA,"By Laurence Frost and Conor Humphries
PARIS/DUBLIN (Reuters) - Faltering consumer confidence will slow the recovery of air travel once coronavirus restrictions end, the sector's main global body warned on Tuesday, citing bleak new survey data.
More airlines are likely to follow  Virgin Australia  (AX:VAH) into administration without swifter government support, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicted, and fuel hedging will prevent many from benefiting from cheap oil.
Domestic and short-haul travel will pick up first, IATA said, but the demand upturn has been tepid in China and absent in Australia even after new COVID-19 cases have dwindled.
""Once market travel restrictions and lockdowns are relaxed, there's still an issue about whether there will be demand from passengers to come back and fly,"" IATA Chief Economist Brian Pearce said during an online media presentation.
Domestic air traffic is down 70% worldwide, IATA said.
The Geneva-based organisation expects the near-total shutdown of global aviation to cut industry revenue this year by more than half, with the $314 billion hit threatening 25 million jobs, and is backing airline demands for government support.
Some 40% of air travellers plan to wait at least six months before resuming their habitual flying, according to the IATA-commissioned survey published on Tuesday, and 69% say they will do so only after their personal finances stabilise.
The online poll of 4,700 consumers was conducted by Rockland Dutton with sample sizes of 300-500 in each of 11 countries.
In Europe, where the cycle of coronavirus spread, containment and travel reopening is lagging behind Asia, major carriers have locked in fuel costs through hedging, Pearce said.
Many airlines are therefore ""unable to take advantage of the low prices even if they were actually flying"", Pearce said a day after U.S. crude futures turned negative for the first time in history.
The collapse of Virgin Australia, which entered voluntary administration on Tuesday, shows that many airlines will need quicker public support to survive, IATA's Director General Alexandre de Juniac also said.

""The example of Virgin Australia is a perfect illustration of the warning we have put forward and the requests we have put in front of governments,"" he said.

469,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 10:36AM ET</span>",Question Everything You Know About Bonds Versus Stocks,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- While everyone was consumed with the coronavirus, something remarkable happened in U.S. markets: When March ended, bonds had outpaced stocks over the last two decades.
That’s right. The Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) U.S. Aggregate Bond Index beat the S&P 500 Index by 0.3 percentage points a year over the last 20 years through the first quarter, including dividends. As it turned out, investors would have made more money and lost less sleep if they had just stuck with boring old bonds.
It’s not supposed to work that way, as every investor has been told tirelessly. Bonds are for stability and stocks are for growth. The price of stability is lower returns relative to stocks, and the price of growth is higher risk relative to bonds. That trade-off between stocks and bonds is known in technical parlance as the equity risk premium.  
The premium was once shockingly reliable over long periods. From 1926 to 1999, the longest period for which numbers are available, long-term government bonds beat the S&P 500 just 2% of the time over rolling 20-year periods, counted monthly. And all those victories were clustered around a short period from 1948 to 1950, the aftershock of stocks’ tumult during the Great Depression. 
But the equity risk premium has been less bankable since then. Bonds have beaten stocks 26% of the time over rolling 20-year periods ending in 2000 or later. While it’s not easy to draw neat causal lines around markets, there are some obvious contributors to bonds’ recent success. The historic decline in interest rates from record highs in the 1980s to record lows today has bolstered bonds. Also, stocks stumbled on an unusual succession of extreme shocks, beginning with the bursting of the biggest stock market bubble in U.S. history in 2000, followed by a near collapse of the financial system in 2008 and now a global pandemic that has shut down the economy. 
What is clear is that stocks’ sagging performance over the last two decades is a challenge to three burgeoning investing theories. The first is that the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings, or CAPE, ratio, once a vaunted barometer of future stock returns, has lost its predictive power. From 1881 to 1999, the average CAPE ratio for U.S. stocks hovered around 15, according to numbers compiled by Yale professor Robert Shiller. When the CAPE drifted meaningfully higher during that period, subsequent stock returns tended to be lower than usual, and vice versa.  
Then the CAPE seemed to break down. After the fierce bull market of the late 1990s, the CAPE stood at a record high of 44 when 2000 began, an unmistakably bearish signal. The S&P 500 was cut roughly in half during the ensuing market crash, but the CAPE bottomed at 21 in early 2003, still well above its historical average. Nevertheless, a new bull market took hold and, except for a brief period around the financial crisis, the CAPE has been higher ever since.
Those who waited for the CAPE to dip back below its historical average missed the bull market that followed the financial crisis, by some measures the second longest on record. And they’re still waiting. Not even the coronavirus has been able to subdue the CAPE, which now stands at 23. 
Many investors have concluded from the last two decades that the CAPE has become more noise than signal. That now appears to be hasty. In addition to losing to bonds, the S&P 500 has returned 4.8% a year over the last 20 years through March, which is roughly half its long-term average. Perhaps the CAPE’s warning rang true after all.    
A second and related theory is that intervention by central bankers is a boon for stocks. When the dot-com bubble popped in 2000, the Federal Reserve jumped in to dampen the fallout by gradually lowering short-term interest rates to 1% from 6.5%, a level not seen in the U.S. since the 1950s. Subsequent interventions have been more brazen. The Fed cut rates to near zero and purchased roughly $4 trillion worth of bonds during the financial crisis, the most ambitious stimulus effort in the Fed’s history. And in recent weeks, the Fed cut rates to near zero again and pledged to prop up bond markets, expanding its balance sheet to a record $6 trillion.
Many investors credit the Fed for keeping stock valuations elevated over the last two decades. Whatever one thinks of the wisdom of those moves, however, the results haven’t been a windfall for stock investors.   
The third theory is that value investing is dead. While value stocks have historically paid a premium relative to growth, U.S. growth stocks have beaten value over the last 12 years and have held up better during the current downturn. For many investors, it’s a sign that value stocks can no longer be expected to pay. But if 12 years of underperformance for value relative to growth means that the value premium is dead, what does 20 years of underperformance for stocks relative to bonds say about the equity risk premium?  
Not much, apparently. Investors have handed a net $36 billion to U.S. equity exchange-traded funds since the S&P 500 tumbled from its peak on Feb. 19, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Still, it’s early days. With the CAPE perched at 23, more than double its financial crisis low, the market appears to be signaling that the coronavirus shutdown will be short-lived. But if it proves otherwise, bonds are likely to extend their lead over stocks, and investors may have to second-guess some newly embraced ideas.

476,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 09:55AM ET</span>",SoftBank shares attractive near-term as buyback eyed: UK's AVI,"By Sam Nussey and Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group's (T:9984) planned $22.5 billion share buyback presents an attractive buying opportunity but it is not a clear longterm investment, said a London-based investor that has built up a small stake.
Asset Value Investors (AVI) has spent around $75 million buying SoftBank shares, drawn by the size of the buyback and a nearly $3 billion position taken by activist investor Elliott Management, which is pushing for measures to improve shareholder returns. 
SoftBank ""may not be an attractive long-term investment for investors such as ourselves. Right now, it's a special situation opportunity on a massive discount,"" said Joe Bauernfreund, Chief Executive of AVI. 
""Mathematically the share price will go up if they carry out the buyback they promised to do,"" he said. 
SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has pledged to raise up to $41 billion by selling down assets as tech bets via his $100 billion Vision Fund flounder and after the group's conglomerate discount yawned to record levels. 
A pledge to repurchase and retire up to 45% of its shares via buybacks means SoftBank is aligned with investors like Elliott, Bauernfreund said, but the group is yet to demonstrate it can improve transparency and governance. 
There is ""nothing to base any confidence on,"" Bauernfreund said, adding AVI has written to SoftBank's directors but has not yet received a detailed reply.
SoftBank has pledged to appoint new independent board directors at its shareholders meeting - although critics point to the company's history of choosing allies of Son. 
Elliott is also pushing for a subcommittee of SoftBank's board to oversee Vision Fund's investments, which are expected to drag the group to a record loss when it reports full-year earnings next month.
AVI has a growing presence in Japan, where corporate governance reforms are attracting investor attention, and has run activist campaigns targeting companies Tokyo Broadcasting System Holdings (T:9401) and Teikoku Sen-I (T:3302). 
A record 23 Japanese companies with valuations of at least $1 billion publicly came under activist pressure last year, according to shareholder advisory firm SquareWell Partners.

The economic shock from the coronavirus pandemic is putting a dampener on activist activity as companies conserve cash to weather the crisis.

(Reuters) -  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, helped by higher sales in its aeronautics business that makes the F-35 fighter jets, but lowered its 2020 sales outlook due to coronavirus-led supply chain delays.
The company said it now expects full-year sales in a range of $62.25 billion to $64.00 billion, down from $62.75 billion to $64.25 billion, forecast previously. Lockheed reaffirmed its 2020 earnings per share forecast of $23.80 - the mid point of the range. 
Lockheed's earnings announcement disclosed that while earnings for the first quarter had not been impacted, ""the corporation is beginning to experience some issues in each of its business areas related to COVID-19"" such as location access and supplier delivery delays.
The Pentagon's chief weapons buyer said on Monday that a three-month slowdown was now expected on major defense programs as a result of supplier operating challenges during the coronavirus pandemic.
Lockheed said production and supply chain activities had slowed in its aeronautics business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing it to trim its sales outlook. Lockheed's Aeronautics division, which makes the F-35 fighter jet, saw quarterly sales up 14% in the quarter to $6.4 billion.
However, the U.S. defense sector is expected to see much less COVID-19 disruption due to generally stable cash flows compared with industrial markets, according to analysts. Early on in the pandemic the defense industry was deemed essential, giving those workers an avenue to continue production.
""While defense companies like Lockheed Martin are not immune to coronavirus, the projected impact on the 2020 results looks very minor compared to what is likely to be seen elsewhere in the industrial sector,"" analyst Robert Stallard of Vertical Research wrote in a note on Tuesday. 
Stable demand along with the Pentagon increasing interim payments to defense contractors, and also paying them for sick time or quarantined employees are expected to buoy the defense industry as coronavirus hits the economy. 
Shares of Lockheed rose 1% to $388 in premarket trading.
Net earnings rose to $1.72 billion, or $6.08 per share, in the first quarter ended March 29, from $1.70 billion, or $5.99 per share, a year earlier, beating analysts' average estimate of $5.80 per share.

Revenue rose 9.2% to $15.65 billion and topped analysts' expectation of $15.08 billion.

DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Gulf debt and equity markets fell on Tuesday and the Saudi currency dropped in the forward market, after U.S. crude oil futures collapsed below $0 on a coronavirus-induced supply glut.
The plunging oil prices, combined with other economic pressures caused by the coronavirus outbreak, are hurting the budgets of Gulf countries that rely heavily on crude exports and their currencies are also under pressure.
""Despite the OPEC deal to cut over 10% of global oil production, the price of oil keeps falling,"" said Artur Baluszynski, head of research at investment management firm Henderson Rowe. ""While yesterday's negative WTI futures price might have been a one-off glitch, it does confirm there is trouble ahead."" 
U.S. crude oil futures (WTI) fell below $0 on Monday for the first time in history as demand cratered. Brent crude, the international benchmark, also slumped, though that contract was nowhere near as weak. [O/R]
Mohammed Ali Yasin, chief strategy officer at Al Dhabi Capital in Abu Dhabi, said most of the market turmoil was sentiment-based.
""People are not understanding why this happened so fast ... Is this (the price) at which governments have to sell oil? The answer is no, but it will take them some time to understand.""
The Saudi stock index (TASI) dropped 1.5% at the market open with oil company Aramco (SE:2222) down 1.7%.
Shares in the Dubai market (DFMGI) fell 1.4% while the Abu Dhabi index (ADI) lost 0.5% and the Kuwaiti premier index <.BKP> declined 2%.
The cost of insuring against a potential debt default by Saudi Arabia -- the world's biggest oil exporter -- increased slightly, to 168 basis points from 166 on Monday, according to data from IHS Markit. It is up 13 bps in the past week.
Meanwhile U.S. dollar-denominated bonds issued by Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Bahrain shed between 0.5 cents and 2 cents while Aramco's paper due in 2049 was down almost 1 cent, according to Refinitiv data.
DOLLAR PEGS UNDER PRESSURE?
The Saudi riyal fell in the forward market against the dollar. It is pegged at 3.75 to the U.S. currency in the spot market, so banks often use the forward market to hedge against risks.
Nine-month dollar/riyal forwards  -- trades scheduled to take place in nine months -- went as high at 148 points, up from Friday's close of 60 points -- their highest level since November 2017. Refinitiv data showed them last at 110 points.
One-year forwards  rose to 210 points, flirting with a near 2-1/2 year high of 211 hit on Monday.
""The collapse in oil prices has led to renewed pressure on dollar pegs in the Gulf,"" said Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.
But besides the Saudi riyal, other currencies did not move much on Tuesday.
""People will get excited about and go long dollars but not because they think the pegs are really going to break but because there will be some others betting on it,"" said Paul McNamara, investment director at GAM.

""It is one of those things that you might see until people become bored of it again.""

490,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 08:55AM ET</span>",Coronavirus casualty Virgin Australia could prosper under new owners,"By Jamie Freed
SYDNEY (Reuters) -  Virgin Australia 's (AX:VAH) entry into administration could give any successful bidder for the country's second-biggest airline the chance to free it from a complex ownership structure that has slowed decision making and been blamed for years of losses.
Hit hard by the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, Virgin appointed an administrator on Tuesday to try to sell the airline and more than 10 parties have expressed an interested in recapitalising it.
Its losses are largely down to its international and budget divisions and efforts to turn the airline around have been often stymied by a board that includes representatives from the five foreign investors who control more than 90% of the company.
They are Richard Branson's Virgin Group, which founded the airline in 2000, Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL), Etihad Airways, China's Nanshan Group and HNA Group. Branson owns about 10% with the other four each holding 20%.
All have suffered a sharp deterioration in revenue because of the pandemic and were reluctant to inject capital into Virgin, which caused talks with the Australian government for A$1.4 billion ($883 million) in state aid to falter this month.
""Having five different owners of very, very different shades obviously wasn't ideal. Getting them off the register would be great,"" said Peter Harbison, chairman emeritus for global aviation consultancy CAPA Centre for Aviation.
For example, when Air New Zealand (NZ:AIR), once the largest shareholder in Virgin, sought to simplify its operations in 2016, the Virgin board rejected its proposal and the airline sold its stake in frustration, according to people with knowledge of the matter. 
Air New Zealand did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
SOLID PROSPECTS
Virgin, which has about a third of a domestic aviation market dominated by bigger rival Qantas Airways (AX:QAN), had reported seven annual losses in a row even before the pandemic decimated travel globally.
Several analysts said the best option for Virgin under a new owner would involve getting rid of its wide-bodied jets and turboprops and just keep its Boeing (N:BA) 737s, the backbone of its domestic fleet.
The Australian market generated two-thirds of Virgin's revenue in the last six months of 2019 and domestic travel is expected to rebound faster than international flights after the coronavirus crisis.
Moving to a single type of jet would help simplify operations and keep costs down while maintaining an appeal to business travellers in Australia as an alternative to Qantas, they said. 
Australia's domestic market, long a duopoly of Qantas and Virgin, has historically produced a profit pool of A$1 billion a year, according to Qantas data.
Citi analysts estimate Qantas could gain anywhere from 9% to 28% of the domestic market because of Virgin's problems - on top of its current 60% control - which could give it the freedom to push up airfares.
The Australian government's policy is for the country to emerge from the coronavirus crisis with two strong domestic airlines to help support competition and the local tourism industry, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said on Tuesday.
""Australia still represents a great opportunity for aviation investors,"" said Brendan Sobie, an independent aviation analyst. ""Long-term prospects are solid, particularly if the new airline focuses mainly on domestic."" 
Under a new owner, Virgin could maintain strong commercial links with partners such as Singapore Airlines, the biggest foreign airline in the Australian market and a major Qantas rival, even if there were no equity ties.
Singapore Airlines feeds traffic into Virgin's domestic network while Virgin puts travellers on Singapore's extensive international network. Singapore Airlines has a similar arrangement with Air New Zealand that does not involve equity.
Singapore Airlines said it would honour upcoming bookings ticketed by Virgin but declined further comment about commercial arrangements.
SKELETON SCHEDULE
Virgin last paid a dividend in 2008 and its shares had fallen to record lows before it entered administration, with its A$5 billion of debt too much to handle as demand collapsed. 
""I would think that this is a good opportunity for them to cut it to a more profitable core,"" said an industry analyst who declined to be named due to compliance issues.
For now, Virgin is continuing to fly a skeleton schedule under its current management team as the administrators try to find a buyer for the operation as a whole.
Interested investors include local private equity group BGH Capital, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, on condition of anonymity. BGH declined to comment.
Airlines normally try to avoid administration because passengers may be reluctant to book and suppliers wary of getting paid but the coronavirus shock is so abnormal those concerns are less pressing, according to one industry source.
With Virgin's equity investors likely to see their investments wiped out because they rank behind unsecured creditors such as Australian bondholders, winning support from creditors will be crucial for any restructuring, analysts said.
Creditors are likely to have to swallow a reduction in the value of their assets, known as a haircut, under a restructuring deal, ratings agencies said. 
If an agreement cannot be reached, an alternative would be for a startup airline to replace Virgin as the second major airline in the Australian market, analysts said.

""Having Qantas do it alone for a few months or even a year would not be disastrous as everything is uncertain re COVID-19 anyway,"" said Rico Merkert, a professor of transport at the University of Sydney Business School.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks fell on Tuesday, a day after U.S. crude oil prices turned negative for the first time ever, as dismal corporate earnings underlined worries about economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic.
The dollar rose against a basket of other currencies as investors shunned riskier assets. 
MSCI's All Country World Index, which tracks stocks across 49 countries, was down 0.9%. European stock markets followed their Asian counterparts lower, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index down over 2% by midday in London. 
Monday's plunge in oil, which saw some prices reach minus $40 a barrel, resulted from growing crude stockpiles and dwindling storage space as lockdowns to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus slashed global fuel use. First-month West Texas Intermediate continued to trade in negative territory on Tuesday, at -$7.13 a barrel.
Graphic - Crude oil's historic crash below zero: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyvrylwpeo/crude.png
""I have always thought of oil a little bit like a currency; it stores value, is controlled by world leaders and makes the world go round,"" said Gregory Perdon, Co-Chief Investment Officer at Arbuthnot Latham.
""But yesterday was a wake-up call and investors would be remiss to ignore that low oil means lower inflation, higher defaults, lower growth and more political instability as less petrodollars circulate in the system.""
Signs the pandemic is taking a toll on the global economy continued to roll in. 
Australia's central bank now forecasts the country's economy will shrink 10% in the first half of 2020. South Korea is set for its biggest first-quarter contraction since 2008, with the latest data showing exports plunged by almost a third in the first 20 days of April.
There was a glimmer of hope in Europe: the mood among German investors improved in April as concern about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Europe's largest economy seemed to ease, a survey from the ZEW research institute showed.
The euro edged lower against the dollar, and Southern (NYSE:SO) European bond yields traded near recent highs before a European Union summit later this week on how the EU will try to revive an economy hit by the pandemic. 
AWASH IN OIL
Monday's plunge in U.S. crude came as the May contract expiry looms at the end of Tuesday's trade.
International benchmark Brent crude, more readily seaborne than its U.S. counterpart, fell 15.7% to $21.69 per barrel.
That is still some 60% below January's peak, highlighting the disruption to energy consumption and the long road back to global growth that underpins oil demand. 
""This level of oil price is not sustainable for any global oil producer. Even for Saudi Arabia, which has a low cost of production, this is not viable,"" said Jai Malhi, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. 
""Such low prices will not last and the pressure on storage will likely force OPEC+ into further production cuts in order to boost prices.""
The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries, which falls when prices rise, dropped under 0.6% to 0.5769%..

Spot gold prices traded 1.5% lower at $1,667.36 per ounce.

Lockheed Martin announced earnings per share of $6.08 on revenue of $15.65 billion, compared with expectations of $5.78 EPS and revenue of $15.09 billion and EPS of $5.73 on revenue of $14.34B in the same period a year before.
""As we confront the challenges introduced by the global pandemic, our corporation remains focused on providing vital national security solutions for our customers while maintaining a safe and healthy environment for our employees,"" said Lockheed Martin chairman, president and CEO Marillyn Hewson.
Shares in Lockheed traded 2% higher premarket, at $3.91/share.
""Except for some short-term disruptions due to the pandemic, Lockheed Martin is on strong financial footing and capable of weathering a potential recession. The company should continue to benefit from the U.S. government’s increased defense spending, especially when the geopolitical situation remains tense,"" said Haris Anwar, an analyst at Investing.com.
An example of this geopolitical tension came from the announcement that two U.S. warships were operating in the South China Sea, amid a standoff between China and Malaysia.
""The company has a strong pipeline of offerings, including its F-35 fighter jets which are Lockheed’s largest source of profit,” Anwar added."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to weaken at the open Tuesday, with investors on edge as oil futures head lower at speed and as the disappointing earnings season continues.
At 7:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 38 points, or 1.4%, lower, Nasdaq futures down 71 points, or 0.8%. The Dow futures contract fell 424 points, or 1.8%.
The price of oil has continued to slump Tuesday, with the front month May WTI contract, due to expire later Tuesday, still weak, although not as low as Monday’s settlement of minus $37.63 a barrel. 
The June contract, where most of the volume and open interest lies, is in positive territory, but at 7:15 ET traded 18% lower at $16.71 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 15% to $21.66.
As a result, oil giant  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) shed 3.7% in premarket trading and major rival  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) slipped 4.0%. Other oil-related companies including  Apache Corp  (NYSE:APA), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) were hit even harder.
Elsewhere, the pace of the earnings season picks up, with almost one-fifth of the S&P 500 companies reporting this week.   
Shares in  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) dropped 4.7% premarket after the tech giant reported late Monday its revenue declined 3.4% in the first quarter. The spread of Covid-19 hit software sales heavily in March. The company also pulled its annual guidance.
Shares in Hertz Global (NYSE:HTZ) are seen 4.1% lower premarket after the car rental giant disclosed Monday it will lay off 10,000 employees in North America due to a sharp downturn in its business during the coronavirus pandemic.
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) reported on Tuesday that first-quarter earnings and revenue topped expectations, but the soft drink giant withdrew its forecasts for 2020, reporting that global sales volumes have plunged 25% since the start of April.  Coca-Cola shares rose 1.4% premarket.
Small businesses could receive even more relief funding from the U.S. government in the near future, with Congress expected to vote later Tuesday on a new $450 billion package.
The economic calendar is a little bare Tuesday, centering mainly around the March existing home sales release, at 10 AM ET.
The American Petroleum Institute’s weekly inventories data for last week are due at 4:30 PM ET, and will likely be of great interest given Monday’s events.
Elsewhere, gold futures dropped 1.5% to $1,686.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded at $1.0830, down 0.3%."
495,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",Tech titans dominate U.S. stock market after surge,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are once again crowding into a narrow range of technology and internet stocks, heightening concerns that the market's dramatic bounce from last month's lows is becoming increasingly vulnerable to sharp reversals as the coronavirus outbreak continues to batter the economy. 
Just five stocks - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) - account for more than 20% of the market cap of the entire S&P 500 index, according to BofA Global Research. That's a greater concentration in the top stocks than was seen during the dotcom bubble of 2000, analysts at the bank wrote.
The information technology sector carried a 25.4% weighting in the S&P 500 as of Friday, far more than the other 10 major sectors and slightly more than its weighting on Feb. 19, when the benchmark index hit its all-time high.
Strong balance sheets and business models that appear likely to weather the fallout from the outbreak have made these companies appealing destinations during the severe volatility of the past several months.
But a top-heavy market is also a worrisome sign to some investors - especially as concerns grow that the S&P's 26% rally from its March lows have put it far ahead of economic fundamentals at a time when the United States continues to shed jobs at a record pace and corporate earnings are deteriorating.
The index's narrow leadership may also be an indication that investors are skeptical that other areas of the market will fare well in coming months. At the same time, a turn lower in stocks could cause investors to bail out of winning shares to lock in their gains, leading to even steeper declines.
""If the market decides it is going to roll back over again and head back down to retest those lows, then people are going to take profits where the profits are greatest,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW).
Amazon, Microsoft and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) have been the greatest contributors to the S&P 500's total shareholder return so far this year, as of Friday, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Netflix shares have climbed 35% so far in 2020, Amazon has risen nearly 30%, while Microsoft is up 11%.
Graphic - Tech, Internet stocks take charge: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/qmyvmllbpra/eikon.png
Meanwhile, an analysis by research firm Bernstein showed technology and internet names among the market's most widely owned stocks. The market's five most crowded stocks are Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Visa (NYSE:V) and UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), according to Bernstein's analysis, which uses factors such as institutional ownership and price momentum.
""You have a market that was narrow back in February and too concentrated in technology. Now it's even more so,"" said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak.
""There's a reason why this happens when the market is vulnerable, because people don't see a lot of value in the overall market, so they go into the small number of names they do see a lot of value in,"" Maley said.
Investors are watching for signs of equity weakness as other markets, such as oil which saw prices turn negative on Monday, are showing stress. Short bets against the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust rose last week to their highest level in data dating back to January 2016, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.
The appeal of tech and other internet companies makes sense to some investors, especially with an uncertain market and economic outlook.
""For a lot of folks, any growth is still going to be in the tech space, so it continues to argue for putting money into those stocks because growth is going to be at a premium,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.
And while tech has outperformed the overall market, stocks in some other areas also have held up well, especially in healthcare and consumer staples, two traditionally defensive sectors.

""Technology has never been considered a 'defensive' sector, but maybe it should be considering how well it has performed during a global pandemic,"" Bespoke Investment Group said in a report.

496,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",Lululemon apologises after staffer offends with 'bat fried rice' T-shirt,"By Pei Li
HONG KONG (Reuters) - U.S. exercise apparel brand Lululemon (O:LULU) issued statements on Tuesday apologising for, and distancing itself from, a T-shirt design promoted by one of its art directors that triggered outrage and accusations of racism online.
The hashtag ""Lululemon insults China"" was viewed 204 million times on China's Weibo platform by Tuesday afternoon, with some commentators demanding a boycott of the brand. 
The furore started on Sunday, with an Instagram link posted by the Lululemon official, Trevor Fleming, that promoted the sale of a T-shirt on the website of California artist Jess Sluder, under the name ""bat fried rice"". 
The long-sleeved T-shirt, bearing an image of a pair of chopsticks with bat wings on the front and a Chinese takeout box with bat wings on the back, riled critics who said the two were trying to stir anti-Asian sentiment during the coronavirus pandemic.
""We acted immediately, and the person involved is no longer an employee of Lululemon,"" the firm said in an Instagram response to a customer on Tuesday, without identifying the individual. 
It called the image and the post inappropriate and inexcusable, and apologised that one of its employees had been affiliated with promoting the offensive T-shirt. 
Fleming did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters to seek comment. On his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) account, he said he worked at Lululemon up to April 2020.
Sluder did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. 
Reports of racially charged assaults on Asians have grown since the pandemic first emerged in a market selling wildlife in China late last year, before spreading worldwide to infect 2.4 million people, with more than 169,000 deaths.
Early studies said the virus could have come from bats. 
Before it was removed on Sunday, the post on Sluder's Instagram account read, ""Where did COVID-19 come from? Nothing is certain, but we know a bat was involved.""
It added, ""Beginning today, my limited edition #quarantees are now available. Link in bio or DM for details…Thank you for your support and sense of humor! #humornothat #batfriedrice"".
However, in the following days, Instagram users left more than a thousand comments on Luluemon's official account, accusing it of xenophobia. 
China blocks Instagram within the country with what is known as its Great Firewall.
A separate statement posted on Lululemon's official Weibo account on Tuesday did not apologise, but said the design was not a Lululemon product and the firm opposed ""any discriminatory behaviours"".
It was not the first time Lululemon has faced criticism of being insensitive. In 2013, Chip Wilson, the founder of the cult yoga clothier, apologised for remarks suggesting that some women's bodies ""don't work"" in the brand's pants.

The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, which was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan last December, has claimed the lives of nearly 170,000 across the globe and has forced restaurants, grocers, sports arenas and entertainment venues to shut doors.
The group, which provides syrups and concentrates to several fast-food chains, theaters and amusement parks, said it saw volumes drop about 25% globally since the beginning of April, largely stemming from the loss of sales other than at retail stores. 
The Atlanta-based beverage maker, which last month said it would not be able to reach this year's financial goals, now expects current-quarter comparable revenue to include a 4% to 5% hit from a stronger dollar. 
Several concerts and sporting events, including the company-sponsored Tokyo 2020 Olympics, have been postponed or canceled.

Britain is in a lockdown due to the coronavirus, with many companies shuttered and some facing the threat of collapse, while millions of workers have been furloughed as the country heads for a deep recession.
The steering group, which is chaired by Stephen Catlin, the chief executive officer of specialist insurer and reinsurer Convex Group, will propose an industry pandemic response to both the government and the country, it said.
""The insurance industry needs to be on the front foot in the current situation, paying claims quickly and continuing to provide people and businesses with the protection they require,"" Catlin said in a statement.

LONDON (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange said on Tuesday it was committed to completing its $27 billion takeover of data company Refinitiv in the second half of the year, with no plans to revise its savings targets for the deal as a deep recession beckons.
""We still have a lot of confidence in the transaction, in the strategic rationale of the transaction,"" LSE Chief Executive David Schwimmer told analysts.
The coronavirus pandemic is sending economies rapidly into deep recession, forcing many companies to furlough millions of staff and raise funds to stay afloat.
Analysts asked Schwimmer whether the deteriorating economy was changing his view of the Refinitiv deal and he said it was ""a little bit early to be speculating"" on synergies from the deal.
The recurring nature of Refinitiv's income was an ""attractive element"" that offers resilience during such economic conditions, Schwimmer said.
""I don't think that at this point we have any plans to change anything in terms of our target synergies,"" Schwimmer said.
""We think the combined business would be able to continue to perform well through an environment like this and would be able to handle the leverage.""
Refinitiv is 45%-owned by Thomson Reuters, which owns Reuters News. 
COMPETITION SCRUTINY
European Union competition regulators had requested a delay on all filings from merger parties due to its staff having to work from home during the coronavirus pandemic.
""We continue to engage constructively with the case team at the European Commission. They have been in communication with us and we continue to answer questions. We are continuing to make progress,"" Schwimmer said.
Schwimmer said he was still committed to completing the deal in the second half of this year.
LSE Chief Financial Officer David Warren said the ""bridge"" put together with banks to finance the deal could be extended until 2021 if need be and contained ""significant headroom"".
There is a ""drop dead"" May 2021 deadline for the transaction that can be extended by mutual agreement of both parties.
The LSE said it was too early to say what the impact of the pandemic would be on its own operations but that it has over 1 billion pounds in free cash and cash lines to maintain continuity of business.
""Our business continues to generate cash and bring our own leverage down,"" Schwimmer said.
The LSE intends to pay its final dividend for the 2019 financial year, subject to approval from shareholders at the annual meeting later on Tuesday morning, it said.
The exchange posted first quarter results on Tuesday that were lifted by higher trading and clearing volumes during recent bouts of extreme market volatility.
First quarter total income rose 13% year-on-year to 615 million pounds ($763.2 million) as the exchange benefited from higher trading in shares, and higher clearing activity.
Markets across the world faced bouts of extreme volatility and record volumes during March as investors priced in recessions following national lockdowns that have shut down swathes of economic activity. 
""There will be lots of consideration about how the ecosystem worked in the period of heightened volatility. I am not clear that we are through the worst of this yet,"" Schwimmer said.
""We can say with confidence that so far our systems have worked very well,"" Schwimmer said.

The loans are expected to keep the loss-making carrier going as Asiana awaits the completion of its acquisition by a consortium led by a South Korean builder, signed in December. 
Asiana can use the liquidity in the form of loans as needed, spokesmen for Korea Development Bank (KDB) and Export-Import Bank of Korea said. 
A consortium led by Hyundai Development Co (HDC) (KS:294870) in December had signed a deal to acquire a controlling stake in Asiana at 2.5 trillion won. 
However, the deal has not closed as regulatory approval from various countries for the acquisition is pending, while the impact from the coronavirus pandemic on the aviation industry has also raised questions about the deal's progress, Yonhap news agency and other local media said. 
A HDC spokesman said on Tuesday that the process of acquiring Asiana remains on track, but declined comment on when it would be completed. 
The banks had previously provided 1.6 trillion won in financial support to Asiana.

Asiana had been loss-making even before the coronavirus pandemic grounded 324 out of 374 planes of South Korean airlines in early April, according to lobby group Korea Civil Aviation Association. It reported a net loss of 818 billion won in 2019.

Everything is down, the only question is by how much. The answer depends, to a large degree, on how close your relationship is to your respective sovereign, because that is a relationship you’re going to need real soon. It also depends on how much your stock market reflects real supply and demand.
The best-performing stocks in the sector are  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222), down 1.8%, and Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), down 2.2%. Both are state-controlled and have the implicit backing of a combined $800 billion or so of foreign exchange reserves. That keeps default risks suppressed, and the relatively solid borrowing costs support the equity price. Just as importantly, the two companies have more reserves than any other on earth. Under any conceivable scenario for global energy demand, they are indispensable.
Integrated majors may also seem indispensable, but that’s all relative, especially since the backing of sovereigns that are already setting end dates for net carbon dioxide emissions will obviously be harder and dearer to come by. Equinor (NYSE:EQNR) shares kept losses to only 2.2%, but  BP  (LON:BP) shares and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) shares were down by 3.7% and 4.1%, respectively, as doubts about their precious dividends rose to a clamor.
At the bottom of the performance table are those for whom dividends are just a fond memory and survival is the only game in town: the service companies. Investors are pricing in the effective death of capex across the sector, and after horrible quarterly updates in the last two sessions from Schlumberger and Halliburton, it’s hard to argue with that assessment.
Seadrill (NYSE:SDRL) shares were down 8.9% as it continued its dance with a second bankruptcy in a decade. Schoeller-Bleckmann (VIE:SBOE), an Austrian midcap with a small but perfectly respectable business in north America, was down 6.9%. For context, SBOE is now trading at around half the level it was at in early 2016, the last time the industry thought the apocalypse had arrived.
U.K.-based  Hunting  PLC (LON:HTG) was down 7.3%,  Weir Group  (LON:WEIR) was down 4.7% and Petrofac (LON:PFC) – whose focus on the middle east made it seem a relatively safe bet until Abu Dhabi scrapped a $1.6 billion gas contract last week – was down 7.1%, only a whisker above the all-time lows it hit in March.
As for the commodity itself, well, anyone who thought that Monday’s price action was just a brief, technically-driven overreaction is being swiftly disabused of that illusion. By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT) The June contract for U.S. crude was down 29% at $14.43 a barrel, while Brent futures were down 25% at $19.12. When there is nowhere left to store oil, there is nowhere for investors in the sector to hide either - except perhaps in the protective folds of nanny state's skirt."

On the brighter side as first-quarter earnings reports rolled in from European companies, Dutch payments firm Adyen NV reported a bounce in revenue and exchange-traded products company Flow Traders NV posted net trading income in the first three months of the year that topped its entire take for 2019.
Strategists at UBS Group AG predicted that the crisis for equities isn’t over yet and their counterparts at BTIG LLC said the historic distress in crude oil markets may actually be a bullish signal for stocks.

509,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 04:31AM ET</span>",Stocks - Europe Weakens; Weighed by Losses in Oil Sector,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets sold off Tuesday, weighed by losses in the energy sector as investors react to the price of oil turning negative overnight.
At 4:25 AM ET (0825 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index traded 1.5% lower, France's CAC 40 was down 2.1%, while the DAX fell 2.2%. The broader based Stoxx 600 Europe index dropped 1.4%. 
The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude to be delivered in May closed at negative $37.63 on Monday, the penultimate day of trading for that contract, as investors and traders desperately sought to avoid delivery given a shortage of storage space for the current glut.
Although the equivalent Brent contract remained trading in the $20s per barrel, this was a graphic illustration of the imbalance in the crude market, with demand down around 30% as the global economy stalls.
The share prices of oil giants  BP  (LON:BP), Shell (LON:RDSa),  ENI  (MI:ENI), Repsol (MC:REP) and  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) all fell between 4% and 5%, while the Euro Stoxx oil & gas subsector fell 4.1%.
At 4:25 AM ET, U.S. crude June futures, the more active month, traded 3.4% lower at $19.73 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 13.2% to $22.20.
Elsewhere, shares in Primark owner Associated British Foods (LON:ABF) fell 4.5% after it said it would not pay an interim dividend and could not provide a full-year earnings forecast.
On the flip side, shares in the  London Stock Exchange  (LON:LSE) climbed over 3% as coronavirus-related volatility in markets lifted first-quarter income.
The main economic release in Europe Tuesday will be the German ZEW  sentiment survey, due at 5 AM ET.
“Being one of the first indicators to show how we have started Q2, the question is not if it is bad but rather how bad,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,715.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0833, down 0.3% on the day.

510,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 04:00AM ET</span>","California regulator wants changes in PG&E reorganization plan, proposes $2 billion fine","(Reuters) - A California regulator has asked PG&E Corp (N:PCG) for governance and oversight changes in its reorganization plan, while also proposing penalties of about $2 billion on the San-Francisco based utility for its role in causing the devastating 2017 and 2018 wildfires in California.
The proposal from the regulator ""will require PG&E to modify its governance structure, submit to an enhanced oversight and enforcement process if it fails to improve safety, and create local operating regions"", the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) said late on Monday.
Separately, CPUC Commissioner Clifford Rechtschaffen proposed imposing $1.94 billion in penalties on PG&E for the utility's role in the 2017 and 2018 wildfires.
In the proposal, an earlier imposed $200 million fine on PG&E was ""permanently suspended"" to ensure that the fine's payment did not reduce the funds to meet the claims of wildfire victims.
Both the proposals will be put to vote next month, CPUC said. PG&E did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
A U.S. bankruptcy judge in December approved PG&E's $13.5 billion settlement with victims of the deadly California wildfires.
Last month, the company had announced some new commitments in its reorganization plan to emerge from bankruptcy to meet concerns raised earlier by California Governor Gavin Newsom.
PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January last year, citing potential liabilities in excess of $30 billion from major wildfires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018.

The company needs to exit bankruptcy by June 30 to participate in a state-backed wildfire fund that would help reduce the threat to utilities from wildfires.

514,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 02:40AM ET</span>","Nissan to close global headquarters, other Japan sites through May 10 due to virus","By Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) said on Tuesday it will shut its global headquarters in Japan for 16 days through early May to contain the spread of the coronavirus, even though the government has permitted keeping workplaces open to get the economy running.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has allowed manufacturing plants to keep operating under a state of emergency that was declared this month and broadened last week, but Nissan and its rivals had already suspended output at many of their factories due to plummeting global demand.
Nissan is the latest Japanese company to shutter its global headquarters to reduce the number of staff commuting, as the COVID-19 infections in the country increased to around 11,000 this week. 
Canon Inc (T:7751) and Toshiba (T:6502) also announced similar measures earlier this month.
Nissan said that 15,000 employees at its headquarters in Yokohama and main R&D centre in nearby Atsugi, Kanagawa Prefecture, would be required to take leave for 16 days from next Monday through Japan's ""Golden Week"" holiday that starts on May 4. 
Its headquarters would be closed to all but essential workers, a Nissan spokeswoman said, adding that those affected would receive ""the majority"" of their full salaries during the period.
She said the measures were aimed at keeping more than 90% of its employees away from its offices, up from 80% at the moment.
Like many of its global rivals, Nissan has also shuttered most of its global production facilities in compliance with ""shelter at home"" directives to contain the spread of the virus.
Nissan stopped production at its Tochigi vehicle plant, which produces the Skyline sedan and Infiniti models, for much of this month, and plans to keep it closed for most of May.
Its plant in Kyushu, southern Japan, will operate only the day shift during April and May and shut down completely for four days during that period.
Nissan's bigger rival Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) has said it expects to cut its domestic production by around 40% as it significantly reduced output at its Japanese plants starting earlier month.
Honda Motor Co (T:7267) also said it would stop production at some of its domestic plants next week, citing disruptions in its global supply chain. 
Most automakers are bracing for a big financial hit from the virus, as lockdowns in the United States and Europe have kept buyers out of dealerships. But Nissan's sales and profits had been slumping even before the outbreak, forcing it to roll back on an aggressive expansion plan pursued by ousted leader Carlos Ghosn.

The pandemic has only piled on urgency and pressure to renew efforts to downsize. Nissan is due to announce a new recovery plan next month.

515,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 01:25AM ET</span>",Bruised hedge funds tentatively looking for risk again,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - After a tough March, some hedge funds, emboldened by early signs of the coronavirus outbreak peaking in some of the biggest U.S. hot spots, have begun tentatively adding to risk.
Worries over the economic hit from the virus slammed riskier assets in February and March. Still, hedge funds outperformed the market, with the HFRX Equity Hedge index down 9.58% in March, compared with a 12.5% decline for the S&P 500 Index.
""In long/short equity there is a small amount of re-risking that has been going on for the last two weeks but not back to the risk levels that we saw in February or the start of March,"" said Rob Christian co-head of research and investment management at hedge fund solutions group K2 Advisors, part of Franklin Templeton Investments.
""Managers are being selective, buying good, solid businesses that have cash flow going forward and shorting indexes or weak companies,"" he said.
U.S. stock markets have partially rebounded from the trough of 2,191.86, touched by the S&P 500 (SPX) on March 23, and through Monday, had risen 30% from that low. Hedge funds have followed suit in rebuilding risk. 
One way to measure hedge funds' risk taking is to track their equity beta sensitivity - or their sensitivity to equity market movements. For fundamental value hedge funds globally, net exposure to developed market stocks as measured by their 30-day rolling beta recently stood at about 0.8, compared with under 0.7 at end-January, according to Nomura. 
For U.S.-based hedge funds, net leverage - a measure of how much risk they are taking as they chase returns - fell during the March selloff to the lowest it has been since 2010 but ""both gross and net (leverage) have bounced back,"" according to a recent report by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s prime brokerage team.
Funds relying on systematic strategies such as risk parity and commodity trading advisors (CTAs), which were partly blamed for aggravating the recent selloff by off-loading risk when the markets were most vulnerable, have also been buyers recently, analysts said.
Despite the buying by some hedge fund styles, macro hedge funds, which place bets on macroeconomic trends using index, currency and interest rate strategies, have remained sellers.
""The stock market is still in the midst of a standoff between technically oriented CTAs and fundamentals-focused macro investors,"" Masanari Takada, cross-asset strategist at Nomura Securities, said in a note on Thursday. If global macro funds join the buying spree it could give the stock market another leg up.
MAX FEAR PASSED 
Some funds that are betting on the market retesting its lows are still looking to do some buying in certain areas. James McDonald, CEO at Los Angeles-based alternative investment manager Hercules Investments has a trade which would profit from the stock market dropping back to March lows. While a majority of his buying would occur once such a pullback materializes, the fund has been making ""incremental buys,"" McDonald said. 
He likes the U.S. Global Jets ETF (P:JETS), the VanEck Vectors Gaming ETF BJK (O:BJK) and the iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF (Z:IGV), among others as recovery plays.
Funds running the risk parity strategy, which automatically allocate money to major asset classes based on signals such as volatility levels, were particularly hard hit during the volatility spike in March.
Funds with a volatility target of greater than 10% and less than 15%, logged a loss of 12.3% for the month of March, their worst monthly loss since October 2008, according to the HFR Risk Parity Index.
Now that systematic funds have started adding to risk, they may well help support the rally by being incremental buyers as volatility settles, said Damien Bisserier, partner at Advanced Research Investment Solutions, a Los-Angeles based investment management and consulting firm managing about $12 billion in assets.
Bisserier, however, warned that markets are likely to remain choppy in the near term.
Dev Kantesaria, portfolio manager at equity hedge fund manager Valley Forge Capital Management (VFCM) in Wayne, Pennsylvania, said he thought ""the maximum fear around coronavirus has passed."" 
VFCM, which was down 4.9% for the Jan-March quarter, compared with a 13.3% fall for the HFRX Equity Hedge index, according to the fund, has been adding to its positions in companies with strong organic growth such as ratings agency Moody's Corp (N:MCO), payments company Mastercard Inc (N:MA) and credit scoring firm Fair Isaac Corp (N:FICO).
""I expect to see an increase in risk-on exposures as managers are positioning for a slowing rate of virus contagion growth,"" said Ken Heinz, president of Hedge Fund Research.

The world's biggest coffee chain has reopened most of its stores in China, where the outbreak appears to be slowing, and is banking on a slew of new plant-based food and beverage offerings to pull in more curious and environment-conscious diners.
The new lunch menu will feature pastas and lasagna using Beyond Meat's plant-based beef products, and also include dishes from Omnipork, a plant-based pork alternative brand.
Starbucks is also adding non-dairy lattes using oatmilk.
The launch is an important step for Beyond Meat which is looking to expand into Asia, where meat alternative products still have not experienced the popularity boom seen in the United States and parts of Europe.

As part of the launch in China, Beyond Meat said it would establish a Chinese-language website, as well as make use of popular social media channels Weibo and WeChat.

521,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2020 09:45PM ET</span>",WeWork directors defend right to represent shareholders against SoftBank,"(Reuters) - A special committee of WeWork board members on Monday rejected an assertion by SoftBank Group Corp that it does not have authority to represent the interests of minority shareholders of the office-sharing startup.
The back-and-forth presages what could become a long and messy legal dispute between SoftBank and the WeWork special committee, which is contesting SoftBank's decision to back out of a $3 billion tender offer for WeWork shares agreed last year. 
Since the agreement was made last October, WeWork's occupancy rates have plummeted, as customers in big cities stay at home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
SoftBank this month said it would not press ahead with the tender offer because several pre-conditions had not been met, frustrating WeWork's minority shareholders, who were expecting a payout. The investors included co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer Adam Neumann.
An independent special committee, comprised of Bruce Dunlevie, who is a general partner at WeWork shareholder Benchmark Capital, and Lew Frankfort, former CEO of luxury handbag maker Coach, had filed a lawsuit, calling SoftBank's decision to terminate the tender offer wrongful. 
""SoftBank's ploy attempts to prevent the more than 850 current and former WeWork employees who tendered stock worth over $450 million from obtaining any remedy for SoftBank's wrongful conduct,"" the committee said in a statement.
""The present complaint reflects an effort by two directors to use WeWork's resources to pursue a lawsuit designed to create a personal benefit for the directors who brought it. That is improper,"" lawyers for SoftBank wrote on Friday to board members of the We Company, WeWork's parent company. 
In the letter, SoftBank's lawyers requested that the board confirm that the special committee is not authorized to act on behalf of WeWork.
Separately, a judge in Delaware court last week set the trial date for early January. 
The WeWork special committee plans to submit initial discovery requests for documents to SoftBank as early as this week, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
The $3 billion tender offer was part of a $9.6 billion rescue package SoftBank had agreed with WeWork in October that gave it control of the company.

SoftBank has so far invested more than $13.5 billion in WeWork. But the conglomerate has been under growing financial strain, with souring tech bets bringing it under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said on Monday it had disbursed $2.9 billion in initial payroll assistance to 54 smaller passenger carrier and two major passenger airlines, while it finalized grant agreements with six major airlines.
The Treasury is initially giving major airlines 50% of funds awarded and releasing the rest in a series of payments. In total, Treasury is awarding U.S. passenger airlines $25 billion in funds earmarked for payroll costs. Major airlines must repay 30% of the funds in low-interest loans and grant Treasury warrants equal to 10% of the loan amount, while airlines receiving $100 million or less do not need to repay any funds or issue warrants to the government. 
Treasury said on Monday it had finalized grant agreements with Allegiant Air, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, Spirit Airlines Inc, and United Airlines Holdings Inc.
Air carriers have been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic and seen U.S. travel demand fall by 95%.
Southwest said it would receive half of the $3.2 billion payroll award immediately and the remainder in installments during May, June and July.
Separately, Treasury said Alaska Airlines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways Corp and SkyWest Airlines had also indicated that they planned to participate. The 12 major airlines represent nearly 95% of U.S. airline capacity.
Airlines receiving funds cannot lay off employees before Sept. 30 or change collective bargaining agreements and must agree to restrictions on buybacks, executive compensation and dividends. 
Treasury is now considering separate requests for additional assistance from another $25 billion loan fund for passenger airlines. United said on Monday it was seeking $4.5 billion in loans from the program, while American said last week it was applying for a $4.75 billion loan under that program, and Alaska and Horizon said they were applying for $1.1 billion in loans.
United said on Monday it expected to cut passenger capacity by 90% in June.
Treasury is still considering how to award $4 billion in payroll assistance to cargo carriers and $3 billion to airport contractors like airplane caterers.

Estimated global airline losses from the coronavirus pandemic have climbed to $314 billion, 25% more than previously forecast, the International Air Transport Association said last week.

(Reuters) - Lord & Taylor is exploring filing for bankruptcy protection after it was forced to temporarily shut all of its 38 U.S. department stores in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
It is one of several options that the retailer and its advisers are exploring, which also include trying to negotiate relief from creditors and finding additional financing, some of the sources said, adding that no final decisions have been made. 
Fashion rental service start-up Le Tote acquired Lord & Taylor last year from Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson's Bay Company for C$100 million. Hudson's Bay kept ownership of some of Lord & Taylor's real estate and assumed responsibility for its rent payments, amounting to tens of millions of dollars a year.
The sources requested anonymity because the deliberations are confidential. Lord & Taylor did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Le Tote spokeswoman said Lord & Taylor is working through various options and declined to comment further. A representative for Hudson's Bay, based in Canada, declined to comment.
Lord & Taylor is not alone among U.S. department store operators forced to weigh bankruptcy in response to prolonged store closures following the coronavirus outbreak. Neiman Marcus Group plans to file for bankruptcy as soon as this week, while J.C. Penney Company Inc is also considering a similar move, Reuters previously reported.
Lord & Taylor was famous for its holiday window display in its flagship on New York City's Fifth Avenue, but Hudson's Bay sold the building to co-working space operator WeWork in 2019. 
Le Tote also owes Hudson's Bay C$33.2 million stemming from a promissory note from the deal. 
Le Tote acquired Lord & Taylor to expand beyond e-commerce into brick-and-mortar stores. It acquired Lord & Taylor's operations, including its merchandise inventory, online business and most of its employees.
As part of the deal last year, Hudson's Bay also secured an ownership stake in Le Tote and two seats on the company's board. Hudson's Bay representatives have since stepped down from the board, one of the sources said. 
Many U.S. businesses grappling with the economic fallout from the pandemic have tapped government funds as part of a $2.3 trillion stimulus program. But most retailers have not been eligible for aid.
The National Retail Federation (NRF), which represents department stores and other shops and e-commerce firms, asked the U.S. Treasury last week to include them in government support programs. 
""The Treasury has been a good partner, and we continue to work with them on this and a number of other issues important to our members,"" the NRF said on Monday.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -  Virgin Australia  Holdings Ltd (AX:VAH) said on Tuesday it entered voluntary administration to recapitalise the business and emerge in a stronger financial position after being battered by the coronavirus crisis and a high debt load.
Deloitte has been appointed as the administrator, the airline said in a statement, adding it had been unable to secure a A$1.4 billion ($887.60 million) loan from the federal government. 
Virgin said the current management team led by chief executive Paul Scurrah would continue to run the business and it would still operate scheduled domestic and international flights to help transport essential workers, maintain freight corridors and return Australians home.
Administrator Vaughan Strawbridge said Deloitte had begun a process of seeking interest from parties in recapitalising the business and there had been several expressions of interest.
""Our intention is to undertake a process to restructure and refinance the business and bring it out of administration as soon as possible,"" he said.
The airline employs 10,000 people directly and 6,000 people indirectly in competition with larger rival Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN), which would have a virtual monopoly in Australia if Virgin stopped flying.
""Our decision today is about securing the future of the Virgin Australia Group and emerging on the other side of the COVID-19 crisis,"" Scurrah said in a statement.
The airline had A$5 billion of debt as of Dec. 31 and had reported seven consecutive annual losses before the coronavirus pandemic decimated domestic and international demand, forcing Virgin to ground the bulk of its fleet and put most staff on leave.
Virgin, which grew rapidly after the collapse of the country's then-second largest carrier Ansett in 2001, has a share of around one-third of the Australian domestic aviation market.
More than 90% of Virgin's shares are controlled by a group of investors including Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL), Etihad Airways, Chinese conglomerate HNA Group and Richard Branson's Virgin Group, which have all suffered a sharp deterioration in revenue because of the pandemic.
Branson said on Twitter that his company would work with administrators, the management team, investors and government to get Virgin Australia back up and running. 
Estimated global airline losses from the pandemic have climbed to $314 billion and led to industry warnings that carriers will collapse without sufficient government aid.
Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) on Monday reported that four Swedish and Danish subsidiaries had filed for bankruptcy and that it had ended staffing contracts in Europe and the United States, putting some 4,700 jobs at risk.

526,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2020 05:50PM ET</span>","Goldman Sachs looks for good borrowers, depositors in the cracks of coronavirus","By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) is forging new partnerships with customers who may be facing financial hardships during the coronavirus, counting on them to be good borrowers and depositors once the global recession recedes, the executive who manages its consumer bank told Reuters.
Goldman's digital bank, known as Marcus, has in recent weeks hatched deals with AARP, a U.S. organization geared toward older, retired individuals, and with JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU), said Harit Talwar, head of consumer banking. Goldman plans to launch a checking account and wealth-management product later this year or early next year, he said.
""One of our big advantages is we are housed in Goldman Sachs and have relationships with some of the biggest companies in the world,"" Talwar said.
He declined to name companies Goldman may partner with, but he said the bank is targeting companies it already works with to find consumers that are likely to have solid credit once global businesses get back to action.
Goldman's consumer bank is small and only five years old, which is why it is looking for customers to grow deposits and loans through partnerships with companies, a strategy larger retail banks like JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) and Bank of America (N:BAC) have used for decades.
The coronavirus has already infected 2,410,208 people around the globe and a deadly respiratory virus associated with it, called COVID-19, has killed 165,854. In response, governments ordered the closure of huge swaths of the global economy, putting many millions of people out of work, but there is now talk of re-opening major cities and businesses. https://reut.rs/2Kmkhxw
While it is still a tiny portion of Goldman's overall revenue, the consumer bank is growing fast.
Consumer banking generated $864 million in revenue last year, roughly 2.4% of Goldman's total revenue. That figure was $282 million, or 3.2%, at the end of the first quarter.
Despite the coronavirus' effect on consumers' finances, Marcus added $12 billion in deposits during the first three months of the year, arriving at $72 billion by March 31 and inching toward management's goal of $125 billion by 2025.
Goldman's Chief Executive David Solomon has encouraged bankers in all divisions to use conversations with corporate clients to open doors for their colleagues in divisions. When the bank helps arrange financing, investments or other services for a big organization, it can sometimes seal a partnership where that organization's employees are offered a special deal for deposits or loans.
For instance, Goldman is giving discounts on personal loans and extra interest on savings products for AARP members, according to the group's website. JetBlue is Goldman's first partner for Marcus Pay, a new product where customers can pay off big purchases in installments over 12 or 18 months at a fixed rate of 10.99% to 25.99%, according to Goldman's website.
Since the coronavirus took hold in the United States, where Goldman has centered its consumer banking efforts, roughly 22 million people there have pursued jobless claims. Aware that surging unemployment and business disruptions could hinder its Main Street banking ambitions, Goldman is also tightening standards for borrowers, Talwar said.
He would not give specifics about credit standards for customers, but in January the bank said the average FICO score across the consumer bank's loan and credit cards is 740.
In the fourth quarter last year, banks tightened underwriting requirements on credit cards by the greatest amount since 2009, according to a survey of credit card customers conducted by Moody's.

""We've always been prudent in our credit standards,"" Talwar said.

(Reuters) - Wall Street fell sharply on Monday after U.S. crude futures turned negative for the first time in history, underscoring the chaos the coronavirus pandemic has unleashed on the global economy. 
The S&P energy index (SPNY) tumbled 4% after the front-month May U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) contract (CLc1) turned negative - unprecedented in history - with sellers offering buyers $37.63 a barrel.
With much of the global economy suspended due to the coronavirus, physical demand for crude has dried up, creating a global supply glut as billions of people stay home. 
“What the energy market is telling you is that demand isn’t coming back anytime soon, and there’s a supply glut,"" said Kevin Flanagan, head of fixed income strategy at WisdomTree Asset Management in New York. ""This price decline can be good if it means more people going to the pump, but that requires people getting out.”
Weathering the broad market sell-off, Amazon (O:AMZN) rose 1.6% and Netflix (O:NFLX) jumped 4%. Both of those companies have benefited from additional demand as millions of people stay home due to the coronavirus. Netflix reports its quarterly results on Tuesday after the bell.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines (O:UAL) said on Monday it expects to report a pre-tax loss of about $2.1 billion for the first quarter, after the coronavirus outbreak smothered its growth aspirations in Latin America and led the company to seek another $4.5 billion in government aid.
Chicago-based United said first quarter revenues are seen at $8 billion, down 17% from a year earlier, with the bulk of the declines in the last two weeks of March as coronavirus outbreaks accelerated globally, causing an average daily revenue loss of $100 million.
The results are preliminary and final first-quarter numbers may change, it said, without disclosing a date for publication.
Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) said on Monday it was delaying its first-quarter results publication to April 28 from April 23. Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) is due to publish on Wednesday. 
All U.S. airlines are seeking government money to help them weather what they say is the worst crisis in the industry's history. With few people flying, United said it plans to operate only about 10% of its normal schedule in May and June.
In addition to $5 billion it will receive from the U.S. government to cover payroll through Sept. 30, United said it also expects to borrow up to about $4.5 billion from the U.S. Treasury Department for up to five years.
Once the terms are finalized, it will have until the end of September to decide whether to draw the money. If it borrows the full amount, United would issue warrants for the Treasury to buy 14.2 million shares at its April 9 closing price of $31.50 per share.
Shares in United were down about 3.7% at $28.01 in afternoon trading.
The estimated first-quarter loss includes just over $1 billion in special charges, mainly reflecting a reserve on a loan United made in connection with an investment in Colombia's Avianca Holdings (CN:AVT_p) as part of its plans for a larger tie-up in Latin America.
The loan was backed by a controlling interest in Avianca, which has not flown any passenger flights since March 24 as its main Colombia and El Salvador hubs shut down their air spaces.
Avianca has furloughed half of its staff with no pay and has not publicly disclosed when it expects to fly again as governments in Latin America repeatedly extend quarantines.
United also wrote down the value of its investments in Brazilian carrier Azul Linhas Aereas Brasileiras and took a $50 million impairment charge for its routes in China, where the coronavirus first started to affect travel in January.
U.S. airlines, including United, have warned that they will have to downsize in October if demand does not show signs of recovering.
United had $6.3 billion of liquidity as of April 16, it said, and announced this weekend a sale and leaseback deal with Bank of China (BOC) Aviation involving six Boeing 787-9 jets and 16 737-9 MAX planes.

The MAX jets were built for United but are parked at  Boeing Co  (N:BA) facilities until regulators approve the aircraft to fly again since two fatal crashes led to a global grounding last year.

Investing.com – Wall Street ended the session near the lows of the day, led by a slide in energy as oil prices slipped into negative territory for the first time ever, as many fret over storage capacity constraints at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic has hit demand.
The Dow fell 2.4%, or 594 points, the S&P 500 slipped 1.8% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1%.
Energy stocks led the broader market lower, paced by a decline in the price of oil for delivery in May, which settled below zero for the first ever, amid weaker demand and fast-paced selling by speculators scrambling to sell long positions to avoid owning tacking physical delivery.
“Cushing is landlocked and stocks look likely to be full within 3 weeks,” said Chris Midgley at S&P Global Platts. “This weekend saw the price of WTI futures crash as traders had to sell long positions to avoid being caught having to deliver physical oil into the contract when there is no storage available.”
The slump in oil prices proved of little respite for airline stocks the sector is not expected to make a quick recovery amid uncertainty about how long the Covid-19 pandemic measures remain in place.
But there was some reason for optimism.
In New York state intubations fell by 32 compared with a 152 decline yesterday, while total hospitalizations were about flat compared with a total of 1384 a day earlier, according to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.  The Covid-19 curve in New York is “off of the plateau and now starting a descent,” he added.
Also weighing on the broader market, defensive corners of the market like utilities, and real estate fell nearly 4%.
Corporate earnings, meanwhile, underscored the impact from the coronavirus, which has killed about 168,000 and infected nearly 2.5 million worldwide.
United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) dropped 4.4% after warning of a $2.1 billion loss in the first quarter as revenue fell 17% to $8.0 billion amid a plunge in travel.
Elsewhere, Boeing (NYSE:BA) slumped 6.6% as China Development Bank Financial Leasing pulled its an order for 29  Boeing Co . 737 Max planes, worth at least $2.9 billion.

(Reuters) - Global vehicle production is now expected to fall more than 20% to around 71 million in 2020 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and ensuing recession, a top automotive forecaster said Monday.
That steep decline, far greater than anticipated earlier this year, likely will cost global automakers 19 million units in lost production in 2020, according to LMC Automotive, which warned those projections could slip further, depending on how quickly major regions recover.
In North America, where most vehicle production remains shut down in April, automakers have been forced to delay introductions or planned ramp-ups of several new vehicles, including the Tesla (O:TSLA) Model Y, the Ford (N:F) Mustang Mach E, and redesigned versions of  Fiat  Chrysler's (MI:FCHA) Jeep Grand Cherokee and General Motors' (N:GM) full-size SUVs, LMC said.
The analyst said it expects vehicle sales will bottom out in April in North America and Europe, with post-pandemic recovery ""unlikely to be rapid"" in the coming months.
China, which was among the first countries hit by the novel coronavirus, already has restarted most of its auto plants and now expects to see a sales decline of just 12% this year, LMC said.
Expectations for a swift economic recovery have plummeted as the virus has swept most of the globe, plunging all major regions into recession, according to researcher IHS Markit.

While the company expects to see the beginnings of an upturn by the end of the year, current projections ""are likely to be revised down"" as the pandemic plays out.

McConnell said congressional leaders and the Trump administration are discussing plans to add funds to a tapped-out small business aid program. The proposal also would provide money for coronavirus testing and overwhelmed hospitals.
“Since this is so urgent, I have asked that the Senate meet again tomorrow in a new session that was not previously scheduled, and the Democratic leader has agreed to my request,” McConnell said on the Senate floor. “It’s past time, past time, to get this done for the country.”
Unanimous consent would be required for the Senate to pass the measure during a pro forma session allowing most members to avoid traveling to Washington.
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer notified lawmakers Sunday that the chamber could meet as soon as Wednesday to consider legislation. Because an objection to unanimous consent is likely, Hoyer said House members would probably have to go to Washington for a recorded vote.
Discussions are focused on adding $310 billion to the Paycheck Protection Program, designed to help small businesses keep workers on their payrolls as much of the country remains under stay-at-home orders.
Another $50 billion to $60 billion would go to a separate Economic Injury Disaster Loan program that provides financing and advances as grants of as much as $10,000 for businesses.
Both of those measure have wide bipartisan support.
The plan also would include $75 billion of the $100 billion Democrats have demanded for hospitals, with a significant portion aimed at rural hospitals, as well as $25 billion for virus testing.

The company, which primarily makes panels for the rooftop solar market, idled facilities in France, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines and the United States, it said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
SunPower said it expected to bring the factories back online ""in the coming weeks."" SunPower officials were not immediately able to say how many employees would be affected by the move.
Residential and commercial solar installations have been hit hard by pandemic-related lockdown orders that have put the brakes on construction and economic fallout that has crippled consumer and business spending. Last week, energy research firm Wood Mackenzie said global solar installations this year would be about 18 percent lower than it had expected before the spread of the virus. 
In addition to halting production, San Jose, California-based SunPower said it had slashed the pay of its executive officers for the second time in a month and was reducing some of its employees to a four-day work week.
The company, which is majority owned by France's  Total  (PA:TOTF), said it is on track to complete its planned split into two publicly traded companies by the end of the quarter. The transaction will separate most of SunPower's panel manufacturing operations from its U.S. solar and energy storage business.

SunPower shares were down 16 cents, or 2.4 percent, at $6.51 in midday trade on the Nasdaq.

The automaker has just reached a tentative deal with its unions that will keep workers net salaries intact, Volkswagen said. Gross salaries will be reduced but Brazil's government will help make up the difference with subsidies. 
If approved, the deal would put Volkswagen's workers in a better position than those at rival General Motors Co (N:GM), who have taken pay cuts as large as 25% even including the subsidies introduced as part of Brazil's coronavirus response. 
Automakers have all but shut down their plants in Brazil due to the coronavirus outbreak. But as the production hiatus has grown, companies have been negotiating how to cut payroll costs. 
The carmakers are also aggressively lobbying Brazil's federal government for emergency loans as most do not have enough cash on hand to keep paying salaries for months. They have asked for as much as 100 billion reais ($18.88 billion), Reuters reported, although there is no guarantee the government would be willing to accept that request. 
The president of Brazil's development bank BNDES, which would issue the loans on behalf of the government, said on Sunday that negotiations with automakers should be finalized in May. 
Unionized workers at Volkswagen were voting on the proposal Monday, through the end of the day.

Even as most of the industry remains shuttered, tiremaker Pirelli (MI:PIRC) said on Monday that it was resuming limited production at its two Brazilian factories incorporating social distancing and other health measures.

In a letter to the boards of FTSE 100 companies, campaign group ShareAction said it was concerned the move would deny shareholders a chance to directly question management on issues from strategy to pay.
""This is not a moment to hide away,"" said ShareAction Director of Corporate Engagement Simon Rawson in the letter, dated April 17. 
""The COVID-19 crisis has seen the value of pension assets and shareholdings fall sharply. Management teams are making vitally important decisions that will affect the long-term success of companies, as well as the lives of their workers and customers.""
Of the 22 companies to announce changes to their AGMs so far, 15 said they now planned to hold them behind closed doors, among them  Barclays  (L:BARC), currently the subject of an activist campaign.
The rest have chosen to hold a 'hybrid' AGM with an element of virtual participation or follow up their closed-door AGM with an additional online question-and-answer session.
ShareAction, though, said it wanted all the companies to hold a virtual AGM in 2020 that would let investors question boards in real time, and for voting to be replicated online.
""Shareholders will want to question directors about the impact of coronavirus and its implications on the company liquidity and solvency and will want reassurance about these and the ongoing business model,"" said Cliff Weight, director of ShareSoc.

""Never has the importance of the AGM been so high. However, questions and answers can be in a hybrid physical meeting and broadcast over the web.""

550,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2020 11:35AM ET</span>",Europe's banks want regulators to match U.S. leverage plan,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Banks are calling on European regulators to match the U.S. Federal Reserve's plan to relax a rule that measures a bank's capital reserves to promote the flow of cash to businesses hit by the coronavirus crisis.
Earlier this month, the Fed proposed a temporary easing of a supplementary leverage ratio rule that applies to the biggest U.S. banks that have assets of more than $250 billion.
This would allow the U.S. banks to expand their balance sheets by lending more to customers hit by the pandemic, but without busting their leverage ratio cap of 3% of capital to total assets.
Temporarily easing the ratio in Europe would ensure that relief packages from governments and central banks to help the economy recover work well in practice, Gonzalo Gasos, senior director of prudential policy and supervision at the European Banking Federation, an industry body, said.
""The leverage ratio could be an impediment to the flow of liquidity,"" Gasos said.
The ratio was toughened up after the global financial crisis a decade ago to act as a ""backstop"" to a bank's core capital buffers.
""What we are asking regulators in Europe is whether reserves held at central banks and exposures to government bonds should be part of the leverage ratio,"" Gasos said.
""In anticipation that the amount of exposures to central banks and governments could grow, that could put a limit on the capacity of banks' balance sheets,"" Gasos added.
The measures EU authorities have put in place are enough for the economy and banks to withstand the crisis, he said.
""However, having that conceptual programme in place does not necessarily mean it will be implemented easily, so we are now working on the details to make sure that liquidity flows as it was meant to.""
Regulators across Europe are already allowing banks to tap into a capital reserve, known as a counter-cyclical capital buffer, to keep credit flowing. The Bank of England reassured lenders on Monday they could tap any of these buffers to help borrowers during the crisis and will be given sufficient time to replenish them.
The leverage ratio is a measure of a bank's capital to its assets on a non-risk-weighted basis, and the largest banks face a supplementary or tougher version than their smaller rivals.
Under the Fed's proposal, U.S. government bonds held by banks, and bank deposits parked at the Fed, are excluded from the leverage ratio calculations until March 31, 2021.

551,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2020 11:20AM ET</span>","Halliburton books $1.1 billion charge, slashes spending by 50%","By Liz Hampton and Nishara Karuvalli Pathikkal
(Reuters) - U.S. oilfield services giant Halliburton (N:HAL) on Monday reported a $1 billion first-quarter loss on charges and outlined the largest budget cut yet among top energy companies as U.S. crude futures plunged to two-decade lows. 
U.S. oil prices have collapsed 80% since January and on Monday traded under $11 a barrel (CLc1), a 34-year low, and below many shale drillers' cost of production. The coronavirus pandemic has crushed oil demand and prompted a sharp decline in the need for oilfield services. 
Halliburton said it would cut this year's capital outlays by roughly 50% to $800 million, the steepest by a major energy company so far, and reduce other costs by about $1 billion. It has laid off hundreds and furloughed thousands of workers. 
The company has no plans to cut its shareholder dividend but added it was a ""lever"" that could be pulled and promised not to take on debt to protect the payment. Rival Schlumberger (N:SLB) last week cut its dividend by 75%, a move welcomed by investors. 
Halliburton, which generates most of its business in North America, booked $1.1 billion in pre-tax impairments and other charges, mostly relating to the value of a pressure pumping business that breaks shale rock to release trapped oil and gas. It posted a 25% drop in revenue from the region to $2.46 billion, while reporting a 5% increase in international revenue to $2.58 billion.
""North America is experiencing the most dramatic and rampant activity decline in recent history,"" Halliburton Chief Executive Jeff Miller said in a call with analysts. Customers' capital spending is headed toward a 50% reduction for 2020, he said. 
Oilfield service rivals Schlumberger and Baker Hughes (N:BKR) also recorded large hits to earnings on writedowns and slashed their project spending budgets.
Wall Street analysts were encouraged by Halliburton's cost cutting measures, and its shares were up about 2% to $7.73 in morning trading. They are down 70% year-to-date.
""We like the company's proactive mindset and actions,"" analysts for investment firm Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co wrote in a note. 
Halliburton warned it faced business disruptions from coronavirus-related border closures and travel restrictions that have prevented the company from accessing certain operations, as well as stay-at-home work arrangements. 
It reported a net loss of $1.02 billion, or $1.16 per share, in the first quarter, compared with a profit of $152 million, or 17 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding charges, Halliburton earned 31 cents per share, beating Wall Street estimates of 24 cents per share, I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv showed.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - India's Infosys (NYSE:INFY) suspended its full-year 2021 revenue forecast on Monday, joining its software outsourcing rivals in flagging a hit to its business as the coronavirus pandemic freezes client activity in the United States and Europe.
Infosys, Wipro Ltd, and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd offer a range of software services to some of the biggest companies globally that have lost business and working days due to lockdowns and production cuts.
""There will be some sort of recessionary environment,"" Infosys Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh told reporters in a post-earnings web conference. We'll be extremely careful with the way we look at costs.""
Infosys' move to set aside its outlook comes a week after bigger rival Tata Consulting Services said the outbreak had ""completely reversed"" the positive momentum from the first half of the fiscal year. 
Wipro also warned of ""huge pressure"" on margins and did not give revenue forecast for the current quarter due to the crisis.
The United States and Europe, the two biggest markets for the Indian IT industry, have been the worst hit from the coronavirus pandemic as lockdowns to contain the virus have brought their economies to a virtual halt.
Infosys Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy warned of near-term pressure on margins because of the virus-led slowdown and said the company had stopped promotions and salary hikes to manage costs.
The company, however, said it did not intend to lay off employees, instead it planned to hire 35,000 new engineers this year.
Infosys added 84 new clients in the fourth quarter to March, compared with 101 a year ago, the company said, while adding that it was seeing ""increased client interest"" for its cloud computing services.
In response to safety measures taken by the company to counter the coronavirus outbreak, Infosys said 93% of its employees were working from home. 
Infosys reported a 7% rise in revenue from its financial services business to 72.82 billion rupees ($951.39 million), which helped boost its overall fourth-quarter revenue to 232.67 billion rupees.
That helped the Bengaluru-based company report a quarterly profit of 43.21 billion rupees, compared with a profit of 40.74 billion rupees a year earlier.

The company's shares closed 3.9% higher, although the broader market closed flat.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday threw out a lower court ruling that had allowed litigation by Montana landowners to proceed against  BP  Plc (L:BP) unit Atlantic Richfield Co seeking a more extensive cleanup of a hazardous waste site than the federal government had ordered. 
The justices, in a 7-2 ruling, tossed a state court decision that allowed the claims for restoration damages by the private landowners within the sprawling site of its former Anaconda copper smelter in western Montana to proceed to trial. The case involves the Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund program responsible for cleaning up certain toxic waste sites. 
In the ruling authored by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, the court decided that under the law governing Superfund sites the property owners needed the approval of the EPA before undertaking restoration of their own contaminated land. Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by fellow conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, dissented from the ruling. 

The decision represented a victory for companies like Atlantic Richfield and business groups that said the lower court's decision could lead to the filing of thousands more lawsuits against companies nationwide, further complicating federally mandated improvements to contaminated land.

The company will immediately return the entire $10 million U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loan as it was able to raise additional capital, CEO Randy Garutti and founder Danny Meyer said (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/shake-shack-returning-its-ppp-loan-heres-why-randy-garutti/?trackingId=95PlIjgRRoWmTNyoj0XR5A%3D%3D) in a blog post on Monday. 
Shares of Shake Shack, which raised about $150 million in an equity offering last week, fell about 3% to $42 on Monday morning. 
SBA, which is a key part of the government's $2.2 trillion aid package, is aimed at helping small companies keep paying their employees and their basic bills during the shutdowns so that they are able to reopen quickly when public health allows.
More than 25% of the total $350 billion fund went to fewer than 2% of the firms that got relief, including a number of publicly traded companies with thousands of employees and hundreds of millions of dollars in annual sales.
This led to a backlash from smaller establishments and mom-and-pop restaurants, one of the hardest-hit sectors as diners stay at home due to lockdowns.
Ruth Hospitality Group Inc (O:RUTH), Potbelly Corp (O:PBPB) and Fiesta Restaurant Group's (O:FRGI) Texas Taco Cabana are among the chains that have borrowed money.
Several franchises of McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) and Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (O:DNKN) are also said to have applied for the loan.
""If this act were written for small businesses, how is it possible that so many independent restaurants whose employees needed just as much help were unable to receive funding?"" Garutti and Meyer wrote.
Shake Shack said the money it received could be reallocated to the independent restaurants ""who need it most, (and) haven't gotten any assistance.""
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a tweet said he was ""glad to see"" that Shake Shack would return the loan. 
Mnuchin told CNN on Sunday that a deal being discussed with Congress would include $300 billion more for the Paycheck Protection Program loan program for small businesses.

President Donald Trump said on Sunday Democrats and Republicans were nearing an agreement on extra money to help small businesses. Trump defended restaurant chains, hotel operators and hedge funds accessing funding meant for small businesses.Shake Shack runs around 189 restaurants in the United States, with about 45 employees in each outlet. The company closed about half of its 120 locations worldwide, and furloughed or laid off more than 1,000 employees after sales fell 28.5% in March.

Investing.com -- Wall Street stayed lower in early trading on Monday as collapsing oil prices cast a pall over the rest of the market, but pared some losses at the start of the heaviest week in the current earnings season.
By 10:05 AM ET (1405 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 345 points or 1.4% at 23,898 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.6%. All three had posted solid gains on Friday amid growing hopes for a sharp rebound in activity as the Covid-19 pandemic passes. 
The front-month May contract for U.S. crude futures, which expires on Tuesday, nearly halved in price to just over $10 a barrel, its lowest in over 21 years, as traders and producers ran out of places to store unsold oil. The June contract, where most open interest and volume is now concentrated, fell 8.6% to $22.88 a barrel.
Occidental Petroleum, highly indebted after its $35 billion takeover of Anadarko last year, led the losers on fears that low prices will hit its ability to service that debt. Occidental (NYSE:OXY) stock was down 8.7%. Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock and Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock  both fell a little over 4%. Oil services company Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) stock, however, withstood early selling pressure to trade up 0.6%, as the market focused on its cost-cutting pledges, rather than the $1.0 billion net loss it posted for the first quarter and its warning of worse times ahead.
Analysts warned over the weekend that the relief rally in recent weeks had arguably gotten ahead of itself. TS Lombard research in London pointed out that the market was trading at an implicit p/e ratio of 24 times 2019 earnings, on the assumption of a 25% drop in cash earnings this year. A more conservative multiple of 16, which chief economist Charles Dumas considered more suitable in view of the low visibility, would result in fair value for the S&P 500 of around 1,900.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts also advised more caution. 
""While we believe that recent developments support the recent risk-on move, the more constructive pricing of growth and risks lowers the bar for disappointments,"" analysts led by Alessio Rizzi said in a note to clients on Monday. ""Uncertainty around the strength and timing of the recovery is still high, and risk premia are likely to remain elevated at this stage.""
United Airlines led airline stocks lower after it reported a $2.1 billion pretax loss due to the coronavirus pandemic. The airline also said it had applied for another $4.5 billion in government loans on top of the $5 billion in payroll grants and loans already disclosed. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock fell 3.8% and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock fell 2.7% in sympathy. 
A rare bright spot was chemical company DuPont  (NYSE:DD), which rose 3.4% after reporting better-than-expected first-quarter numbers.

560,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2020 09:15AM ET</span>",Britain's high street seeks government rent support,"By Samantha Machado
(Reuters) - Britain's commercial tenants and landlords have the asked the government for rental support, saying the coronavirus pandemic makes it impossible for thousands of retailers to pay their rents. 
The scale of the crisis facing the retail sector is grave and businesses are now at risk of administration due to the impact of the virus, trade bodies British Retail Consortium and British Property Federation wrote in a letter to the government on Friday. 
The letter proposed a Furloughed Space Grant Scheme (FSGS) that would mirror similar schemes being introduced in other European countries, with the state supporting the fixed costs of businesses that have experienced dramatic falls in turnover due to the coronavirus outbreak. 
While sales may have increased in certain sectors such as food retailing and household items, these are temporary and the majority of business are experiencing dramatic falls in turnover of up to 100%, the trade bodies wrote.
British retail property owners and tenants are becoming increasingly weary as they work together to defer rent payments and find other ways for shops, businesses and landlords to cope with a countrywide shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Mall operator Intu (L:INTUP) said last month it received only 29% of rent in the March quarter and requested its banks to waive its borrowing terms. 
""Unless further action is taken, we will see many otherwise viable companies file for administration, with the consequent loss of jobs, devastating impact on communities and high streets, and increased cost burden on public funds, not to mention threats to the income generation for pension funds, amongst others"", the letter said. 
The government has already taken steps to prevent hardships for retailers, by passing a law last month to prevent landlords from evicting commercial tenants who cannot pay rents. 
Department store chain Debenhams and fashion brands Oasis and Warehouse are among the well-known British high street businesses to have fallen into financial difficulties in the past couple of weeks due to inability to pay rent for the period during the lockdown. 

Separately, the BRC said on Monday that the number of British people leaving their homes to go shopping has slumped by 83% since the government closed non-essential retail outlets last month to slow the spread of COVID-19.

561,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2020 09:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Airbus puts six jets made for AirAsia up for sale as crisis deepens,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) has put six jets made for one of its largest customers up for sale after giving up on Malaysia's AirAsia (KL:AIRA) taking delivery of them, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
The unusual move is a sign of the deepening crisis in the aviation industry caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which some analysts warn could lead to a fire-sale of unwanted planes. 
Like other airlines looking to save cash amid lockdowns and travel bans that have crippled their business, AirAsia has said it doesn't need any more aircraft this year.
Manufacturers usually insist an airline takes delivery of jets that have been built, while showing flexibility on delivery dates of planes yet to be produced, especially for top clients.
Although ""pop-up"" sales of unwanted aircraft are not new, they rarely involve high-profile customers and typically include the manufacturer keeping the deposit, the sources said. Airbus declined to comment on whether it had done so this time.
""It is a harsh step to take,"" said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
An Airbus spokesman said: ""We do not disclose or comment on delivery schedules for any customers"". 
A spokesman for AirAsia, Asia's biggest low-cost carrier, declined to comment.
Airbus has invited bids for four A320neo and two A321neo jets built for AirAsia, according to the sources and a confidential document seen by Reuters.
Buyers can fetch the jets from France or Germany in June, complete with optional onboard equipment ordered by AirAsia.
AirAsia co-founder Tony Fernandes said this month the group had no revenue and 96% of its fleet was grounded. He added that ""AirAsia is strong and remains firmly focused on the future"".
A senior Malaysian minister told Reuters on Friday that merging AirAsia with loss-making state Malaysia Airlines was one of the options to ""save"" them. 
Airbus said this month it faced many calls from airlines to defer aircraft deliveries, but had not received cancellations directly as a result of the coronavirus epidemic.
RISKS 
A sale would protect Airbus's investment in parts, but comes with greater than usual risk during the industry crisis.
With most airlines struggling financially and reluctant to take deliveries, the move could lead to pressure from other customers to find new homes for aircraft they no longer want, triggering a broader sale of undelivered jets, the sources said.
Airbus has said it has 60 aircraft already built that it is unable to deliver, partly for logistical reasons.
Secondly, Airbus faces a risk that any cut-price deals will set a precedent for future jet sales.
""It's a small community and the result of these tenders often gets out,"" said a second source familiar with the auction.
Others said Airbus had little choice but to recoup as much as possible from the jets, worth $111-$130 million each at most recent list prices but less than half after typical discounts.
Buyers are currently scarce, but some are ready for bargains. Ryanair (I:RYA), a mainly Boeing customer with an Airbus fleet through acquisition, told Reuters last week that now could be a good time to buy jets.
Wizz Air (L:WIZZ) says it wants to take new planes.
In February, long-haul subsidiary AirAsiaX said it would defer delivery of 78 larger A330neo jets.

Boeing (N:BA), meanwhile, faced the latest in a spate of cancellations of its grounded 737 MAX, as China Development Bank said it had agreed with Boeing to cancel 29 jets.

563,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 20, 2020 08:36AM ET</span>",Hasenstab’s Global Bond Fund Posts a $4.3 Billion Drop in Assets,"(Bloomberg) -- The main bond fund run by Franklin Templeton’s Michael Hasenstab posted a $4.3 billion decline in assets in the first three months of the year, its worst quarter since 2016.
Total net assets in the Templeton Global Bond Fund slumped to $22.6 billion as of March 31, public filings show, down from $26.9 billion at the end of 2019. It was the fourth consecutive quarter of declines and takes the drop in holdings in the past year to $11 billion.
Hasenstab has famously been caught on the wrong side of a huge bet against Treasuries and was forced to pare that back last year after yields plunged. Stimulus measures to fight the fallout from coronavirus have pushed yields even lower since.
The filings also show that average duration in the fund -- a measure of its sensitivity to interest rates -- has turned positive for the first time in three years, climbing to 2.06 years by the end of March. It hit a record low of minus 2.82 years at the middle of last year.
In a shift designed to offset loss-making positions, Hasenstab doubled exposure to the yen to more than 40% in the third quarter of last year and added long positions in the Norwegian krone and Swedish krona. The manager said then that he was holding onto his Treasury short, but turning the focus to longer maturities. The fund was betting against Treasuries by trading interest-rate swaps.
Hasenstab has argued for years that markets are overvaluing longer-maturity debt given rising deficit spending and inflation pressures. The fund was also heavily invested in Argentinian local-currency bonds when the country defaulted last August.
Once a top-performer with more than double current assets, Templeton’s flagship bond fund lost 7.4% in the past year, compared with a double-digit return for Treasuries.
A spokesman for Franklin Templeton didn’t immediately comment when contacted by Bloomberg.

The nuggets will be supplied by U.S. agribusiness Cargill Ltd [CARGIL.UL] and will be sold at only three outlets in China in Shanghai and the southern cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen between April 28-30, KFC said on its official Weibo account.
Customers who would like to try a bite must purchase a pre-sale coupon, it said. One serving comprises of five chicken pieces and will be sold for 1.99 yuan.
The move comes amid growing global interest in China's meat substitute industry, which has been identified by both U.S. players Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat (O:BYND) as a key target market. The coronavirus outbreak is also threatening China's poultry production.
Yum Brands Inc's (N:YUM) KFC started offering plant-based fried chicken supplied by Beyond Meat in the United States at one of its Atlanta outlets. The two companies said in January that they would expand that tie-up to several KFC stores in Tennessee and North Carolina.
KFC's announcement garnered mixed reactions on Chinese social media platform Weibo, with some commentators saying that they hoped the new offering would be healthier.

One of the most ""liked"" comments under its post, however, said they were sceptical that the product would be popular in China. ""We want to eat meat!,"" said the poster.

566,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 20, 2020 07:18AM ET</span>",Britain’s Star Stock Pickers Nurse Record Losses From Virus,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.K.’s most famous stock pickers are suffering record losses amid the coronavirus crisis.
The biggest fund managers saw their steepest drop in assets ever in the first quarter, losing as much as 43%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Morningstar Inc. Seven of the top 10 actively managed equity funds had record losses as the pandemic tore through markets, including those managed by Terry Smith, Nick Train and Invesco Ltd.’s Mark Barnett.
Managers who pick stocks the old-fashioned way are struggling to prove their worth in both bull and bear markets, after losing ground to cheaper passive rivals in recent years. Such funds’ selling point is that they often outperform when stock markets are down. But investors in active U.K. equity funds yanked 1.7 billion pounds ($2.1 billion) in March, the second-worst month on record, while passive funds pulled in 1.4 billion pounds, according to Calastone data.
“Active managers face the same problem going forward as they have for the last decade, namely justifying higher fees,” said Ben Yearsley, investment director at Shore Financial Planning. “Fund management companies will have to slim down and reduce costs to compete,” he said.
Investors the world over were blindsided by the coronavirus pandemic that left few unscathed in the first quarter, with the worst damage seen in March as the outbreak saw entire economies shut down and millions of jobs lost. In the U.K., the FTSE All-Share index lost 26% of its value over the three-month period.
The U.K.’s biggest actively managed equities fund, Smith’s 17.9 billion-pound Fundsmith, shed 11.2% of its assets in the first quarter from the previous three months, the data show. Train’s 5.4 billion-pound LF Lindsell Train U.K. Equity lost 19%, while Barnett’s 3.3 billion-pound Invesco High Income fund shed 43% of its assets. The data don’t show the split between performance losses and withdrawals.
Fundsmith saw outflows of 619 million pounds in the first quarter, representing 3.4% of the average assets under management, according to a spokeswoman for the firm. The fund is seeing inflows so far in April, she added. Spokeswomen for Invesco and Lindsell Train declined to comment.
The asset bleeding adds to recent pressures on the high-profile managers. In December, two of Train’s funds were downgraded on concerns they were getting too big. Morningstar lowered the U.K. Equity Fund’s rating, citing its large size and concentrated stock picking.
Barnett experienced a similar downgrade from the rating agency a month earlier, with Morningstar citing concerns over the exposure to less liquid securities and a similar investing style to that of his former mentor, disgraced fund manager Neil Woodford. Invesco has moved to dump all the unlisted companies in Barnett’s funds amid the unprecedented market swings.
“With March proving to be a shockingly bad month for markets, I’m not that surprised that active managers saw huge outflows as investors looked to take risk off the table,” said Ryan Hughes, head of active portfolios at AJ Bell Plc.
The extreme volatility shook investors, many of which put money to work in the last few years and have only known a bull market, he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A group of Argentina's major creditors rejected the government's proposal aimed at overhauling $66.2 billion of its foreign-law debt, saying it inflicted an unjust amount of financial pain on international bond holders.
Argentina sketched out its proposal late last week involving a three-year grace period, large coupon cuts and a smaller reduction in capital which would provide the South American nation with around $41.5 billion of relief.
The grains producer, which has been grappling with recession and a mounting debt crisis, has maintained it wants to find an amicable path with creditors, though that has proved far from simple.
The creditor group made up of some of the world's largest asset managers said in a statement it understood the various economic and political shocks facing the country.
""Regrettably, despite the efforts of the group and other stakeholders, the proposals contained in the recently published press release are not ones which the group can or will support,"" the statement said.
""The group believes that all stakeholders in Argentina will need to contribute to a solution that puts Argentina on a path toward sustainable growth and financial stability.""
The country's proposals ""seek to place a disproportionate share of Argentina’s longer-term adjustment efforts on the shoulders of international bondholders,"" the statement said.
Members of the group include AllianceBernstein, Amundi Asset Management, Ashmore, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Financial Management, BlueBay Asset Management, Fidelity Management & Research Co. and T. Rowe Price Associates. Its legal advisor is White & Case.
Together its members hold more than 25% of Argentina's post-2016 bonds and more than 15% of so-called exchange bonds, issued in the last debt restructurings, it added.
The group said it did support a push aimed at deferring near-term maturities to provide more than $40 billion of cash flow relief in coming years. It said it also had put forward its own proposed restructuring plan which give the government financial space to meet economic and social demands in the country in the near term through an extended period of cash flow relief, though no further details were given.
Its members were ready to continue negotiations, it said, adding they were confident that a solution could be found involving the International Monetary Fund as well as other private and official sector creditors.
Earlier on Monday, another creditor group had also rejected Argentina's debt overhaul proposal. The Argentina Creditor Committee (ACC), which included emerging market specialist Greylock Capital and says it represents a diverse group of international investors, said it could not support the proposal.

The world's biggest tyremaker will shut the 8 tyre plants between April 29 and May 8, including its main passenger vehicle tyre factory in Hikone, western Japan and its main truck and bus tyre manufacturing plant in Amagi, southern Japan.
Bridgestone has a total of 15 plants in Japan, most of which make tyres or other rubber products.
The company had planned to close the plants between May 3 and 6 for Japan's Golden Week holiday but decided to extend the period for the tyre factories by 6 days as tyre demand for new vehicles, retail shops and exports has been slowing, a spokesman said. The closure period for 3 other plants will be extended by 2-4 days.

As of April 16, Bridgestone had suspended operations at 19 of its 51 overseas tyre factories to reflect weaker demand, the spokesman said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open lower Monday, as investors look to pocket some of the recent gains amid protests over the timing of economic reopening in a number of states. 
Sentiment is also suffering from volatility in the oil market, where the price of the front-month contract for U.S. crude fell to its lowest since 1999 against a backdrop of dwindling storage capacity.
At 07:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 45 points, or 1.6%, lower, Nasdaq futures down 87 points, or 1%. The Dow futures contract fell 403 points, or 1.7%. 
The cash markets have seen strong gains over the last two weeks, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 to their highest levels since March 10 and the Nasdaq since March 5. In fact, both the Dow and the S&P are on target to record their strongest months since January 1987 and the Nasdaq since April 2009.
The U.S. has recorded over 750,000 Covid-19 cases and some 42,000 deaths, by far the most in the world, but signs have emerged that it is reaching the apex of the outbreak and that infection rates are slowing in some states.
Texas and Vermont have decided to allow certain businesses to reopen on Monday, while South Carolina has reopened public beaches, and there have been protests in a number of states across the U.S. demanding that governors reopen economies shut by the coronavirus pandemic. This is happening despite the risk of a Covid-19 resurgence posed by reopening too soon.
“The focus is now on ending the lockdown and the risk of new waves of infections,” said analyst Thomas Harr at Danske Bank, in a research note, “Research shows that when interventions, such as strict social distancing of the entire population and the closure of schools are relaxed, infections begin to rise again.”
The earnings season gathers pace this week, but is relatively quiet Monday. Instead the focus could be on department store Neiman Marcus after Reuters reported that it is preparing to seek bankruptcy protection as soon as this week. 
On the flip side, Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) said Monday it will return the $10 million loan it received from the U.S. government after raising about $150 million in an equity offering. Critics had argued that the company's alternative options for raising finance meant it shouldn't have tapped a facility that was intended for more constrained companies. 
Meanwhile, the oil market has continued to see strong selling Monday, falling to new 21-year lows, as producers and traders struggle to find places to store the excess supply.
At 7:15 AM ET, the June U.S. crude futures contract, where most open interest and volume is concentrated, traded 8.8% lower at $22.82 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 3.5% to $27.11. The May contract, which expires on Tuesday, was languishing at $13.34 a barrel.

570,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>",Coronavirus pushes Latin America's budding startups into survival mode,"By Julia Love and Daina Beth Solomon
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The chief executive of Colombian food technology startup Muy had expected to spend the past few weeks gearing up to raise a dollop of fresh funds from venture capital firms for an ambitious expansion plan.
Instead, Jose Calderon was busy shuttering all 40 of the company's restaurants in Mexico and Colombia as the coronavirus outbreak forced lockdowns across the region.
""All stores zero, zero, zero, everything red. It's super difficult,"" said Calderon, who axed his own pay by more than half and asked employees to take voluntary cuts six months after raising $15 million. 
As a veteran entrepreneur, he added, ""I have gone bankrupt because I made bad decisions, I didn't execute well, but this time – it's tough.""
Calderon's experiences reflect the sharp blow the coronavirus has dealt to startups in Latin America, whose tech sector – with a strong helping hand from Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) in particular - had finally begun achieving billion-dollar valuations after years of struggling to attract international investors.
Startups worldwide have been battered by the coronavirus, which has confined billions of people to their homes and ground much of the global economy to a halt. But in emerging markets such as Latin America, it is an especially precarious moment in the technology sector's development, and that could make it harder for entrepreneurs to rebound. 
""We were just gaining traction,"" said Federico Antoni, an investor with Mexico City-based venture capital firm ALLVP. ""It is definitely a bad time to be hit by this huge, unprecedented crisis."" 
For startups from Bogota to Mexico City, survival has become the order of the day. In a memo titled ""Rules of Wartime,"" Argentinian venture capital firm Kaszek Ventures, which has invested alongside SoftBank in startups such as Brazilian used-car platform Volanty and online housing broker QuintoAndar, urged entrepreneurs to assume revenues will plummet to zero and capital will be scarce for the next several quarters. 
""Bread and water until the sun shines again,"" the memo reads.
In some markets, the impact is already stark. In Brazil, funds invested in its venture capital market dropped 85% in March from the year-ago period, according to the market intelligence arm of Brazilian firm Distrito. 
Some deals are still coming to fruition. SoftBank said this month it will invest $48 million in Brazil's online pet products retailer Petlove, and Brazilian logistics startup CargoX announced it had raised $80 million.
But layoffs and salary cuts are rippling across the region and even startups that can still raise money have been forced to do so at fire-sale prices. 
Mexican fintech startup Visor ADL explored a sale, Chief Executive Ruben Sanchez said, but instead was able to bring in an investor. The company is now finalizing a funding round, though he conceded it is at a discount to the valuation. 
""You got to be alive tomorrow to catch the breeze,"" Sanchez said. 
Scooter company Grow, once one of the region's most promising startups after high-profile funding rounds, is now in hibernation after the business was sold.
Grow, which had already been struggling, suspended its operations across Latin America in March.
In Mexico, that left the crews charged with distributing the scooters out of work. Grow offered the workers help finding new jobs, but they protested by occupying a Mexico City scooter warehouse for about two weeks, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
Grow said in a statement that after a period of negotiations it reached a deal with the workers, adding it had worked to minimize job losses and was experimenting with new offerings, such as a monthly rental system in Brazil. 
'TAKING CARE OF EVERY PESO'
For those who survive, timing is key. Colombian startup Ayenda, a high-tech hotel chain, announced an $8.7 million round in February, just before the crisis hit the region.
Chief Executive Andres Sarrazola had figured he would churn through the money by December, but has since hit the brakes. The company has reduced its burn rate by up to 40% by cutting marketing and travel, buying it at least 16 months, Sarrazola said.
Gym membership app Gympass, backed by SoftBank in a $300 million round last June, said it reduced its workforce worldwide by 20% as users stay home. The company founded in Brazil and now headquartered in New York is now offering exercise classes online.
At Colombian delivery startup Mensajeros Urbanos, Chief Executive Santiago Pineda said a funding round has been delayed, putting him on edge even though the company has increased business doing deliveries for pharmacies and supermarkets. 
""It has been quite a challenge to maintain (limited partners) interested in investing,"" he said. 
The co-founder of Mexican eyewear startup Ben & Frank, Mariana Castillo, said she is abandoning plans to seek funding this year and is focused on survival. Although the company is still doing online sales, Castillo shuttered all 24 stores and put the brakes on three new locations. 
""We're really taking care of every peso that comes into the company,"" she said.
Some remain optimistic about the startup scene's survival in a market where entrepreneurs have long operated with limited resources.
Eric Perez-Grovas, general partner at Mexican venture capital firm Jaguar Ventures, said companies that make it through the crunch could be poised for success. 
""Survive these three months, and you'll have a good market and pool of talent,"" he said. 
Calderon, the food entrepreneur, is already laying plans to revive Muy, which runs ""cloud kitchens"" catering to the food delivery sector and also operates its own restaurants, using artificial intelligence to predict demand.
The company had halted operations so it could figure out best practices to keep employees safe, Calderon said, and began reopening locations for delivery orders last week.
But it is still difficult to revisit the presentation he planned to share with investors, boasting rosy projections of doubling average sales per store.

""We lost all that momentum,"" Calderon said. ""We never saw this coming.""

The move comes as policymakers and regulators push asset managers to do more to hold companies to account in the transition to a low-carbon economy, and as Lyxor and peers look to ensure the value of their investments are not hit by corporate inaction.
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors are among investment firms recently to pledge a tougher line on climate, while Britain's investment industry trade body said in March that firms needed to be more open about how they are handling climate-related risks.
For the forthcoming AGM season, Lyxor said it may refuse to sign off a board of directors' actions for the previous year or approve an individual directors' re-election at companies involved in ""environmental controversies"" or which are not transparent enough about their greenhouse gas emissions.
Refusing to sign off a board's actions can make it easier for legal action to be taken against directors.
From next year, Lyxor said it may also refuse to approve the re-election of a chairman at any company which does not uphold the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, a framework for assessing climate risk.
The group, which managed 148 billion euros ($161 billion) of funds at the end of March, will also vote against executives' pay packages if climate and other ""extra-financial"" measures are not adequately woven in to the company's pay policy.
Lyxor, which runs both actively managed funds and those that track an index, said it expected to vote on at least 5,000 resolutions at more than 400 meetings in 2020.

573,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2020 06:41AM ET</span>",Shares turn cautious as U.S. crude gets crushed,"By Marc Jones and Wayne Cole
LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Caution recaptured world markets on Monday as another drubbing for U.S. crude oil futures kicked off a week of data and earnings that will drive home the damage being inflicted by global coronavirus lockdowns.
European stocks made a choppy start, with the pan-regional EUROSTOXX 600 (STOXX) swinging in and out of positive territory in early trading. London's FTSE (FTSE) and Germany's DAX (GDAXI) were up 0.2%.
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) slipped nearly 0.5% too, after Wall Street enjoyed a strong end to last week, though it barely seemed to reflect the latest violent turbulence in oil markets.
With some global storage facilities nearly full to capacity, the 'front-month' May benchmark U.S. crude contract (CLc1) was down $3.40, or 18%, to $14.87 a barrel, having at one point dived as low as $14.47 a barrel - the lowest since March 1999.
European benchmark Brent was down a more manageable 3% (LCOc1) at $27.30 a barrel, but it all points to the same problem - too much supply, not enough demand.
""For oil there is a bit of a technical story (with storage), but still, if energy consumption is down 30% and OPEC reduces supply by 10%, there is still a large gap,"" said Rabobank's head of macro strategy Elwin de Groot. 
The equity and other major markets however were still trading largely on the newsflow of the European virus numbers gradually coming down, he added.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) eased 0.2% in slow trade, pausing after five straight weeks of gains.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) fell 1.2%, but Chinese shares (SSEC) edged up 0.4% as a benchmark lending rate was lowered to shore up the coronavirus-hit economy after it contracted for the first time in decades.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that Republicans were ""close"" to getting a deal with Democrats on a support package for small business.
The United States has by far the world's largest number of confirmed coronavirus cases, with more than 750,000 infections and over 40,500 deaths, according to a Reuters tally.
The S&P 500 (SPX) has still rallied 30% from its March low, thanks in part to the extreme easing steps taken by the Federal Reserve. The Fed has bought nearly $1.3 trillion of Treasuries alone, and many billions of non-sovereign debt it would historically have never gone near.
""The question is, are markets underestimating this in terms of the long-term impact on the economy. There will be damage and there will be damage in terms of the consumer psyche,"" Rabobank's de Groot said. 
That damage should become all more clear this week with April global purchasing manager data - seen as some of the most forward-looking economic gauges - being published on Thursday.
A taster on Monday was that Japan reported its exports down almost 12% in March from a year earlier, with shipments to the United States down over 16%.
TESTING TIMES
In the currency markets, the dollar gained broadly as the concerns about global growth boosted the safe-haven appeal of the greenback and weighed on risk-oriented currencies such as the Australian dollar.
Against a basket of its rivals (=USD), the U.S. currency rose 0.2% to 99.90 and edged closer towards a three-year high of near 103 hit last month.
It gained about 0.1% on the euro and British pound and 0.2% on the Japanese yen. It last bought 107.80 yen  and traded at $1.2478 per pound GBP= and $1.0870 per euro (EUR=EBS).
The dollar's gains were despite the latest trader positioning data showing investors have been ramping up their short positions or bets against the greenback.
Bond markets also suggested investors expected tough economic times ahead, with yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries (US10YT=RR) steady at 0.63%, from 1.91% at the start of the year.
""We are dealing with scales of declining economic activity that nobody has seen before. The potential hit to GDP in the second quarter this year will probably far exceed what we saw at the worst point of the financial crisis,"" Capital Group's economist Robert Lind said in a note. 
Italy's borrowing costs rose meanwhile, heading back towards last week's one-month highs, reflecting unease before a European Union summit later this week over how to tackle the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis. 
Selling pressure on Italian government bonds has returned in the past week, undoing some of the benefits of the European Central Bank's massive bond-buying scheme, after euro zone politicians failed to agree to common debt issuance as a means of addressing the crisis.
Italian Prime Minister Guiseppe Conte used an interview with Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Monday to repeat calls for the EU to issue common euro zone bonds to demonstrate the bloc's solidarity in the face of the pandemic.

""Thursday is the key day this week with the EU leaders summit a potentially big event for the future of Europe as they discuss how close the region can get to joint issuance in the near future,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid.

574,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>",Coronavirus takes toll on global M&A as $1 billion deals disappear,"By Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - For the first time since September 2004, no merger and acquisition deal worth more than $1 billion was announced worldwide last week, according to data provider Refinitiv, as the new coronavirus stifles global M&A.
The dearth of mega deals comes as countries across the world have shut down large swathes of their economies as they battle the COVID-19 pandemic that has infected over 2.33 million people and claimed 165,000 lives.
Worldwide merger activity so far this year is down 33% from a year ago and at $762.6 billion is the lowest year-to-date amount for dealmaking since 2013, the data showed. The number of deals also fell 20% year-on-year. 
""We anticipate that there may be fewer signed deals announced this quarter as parties take longer to work through the impact of the COVID-19 situation,"" said Robert Wright of law firm Baker McKenzie's Asia-Pacific M&A group.
""However, where parties have completed underlying due diligence processes and where there remain strong fundamentals, we do expect to see a number of these deals to come back online.""
Companies have been walking away from announced transactions amid changed deal conditions and high levels of uncertainty. Canada's  Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc  (TO:ATDb) on Monday said it would shelve its $5.6 billion buyout of petrol station operator Caltex Australia Ltd (AX:CTX), as fuel demand plunges and as companies look inward to get through the crisis.
Regulators worldwide have also toughened rules for foreign investments to protect national assets. India last week ruled that investments by an entity from a country that shares a land border with it will require government approval in a move to curb ""opportunistic takeovers/acquisitions"".
Australia and Germany have also stepped up scrutiny over overseas investors.
With big deals largely put on hold as buyers wait to gauge the true impact of the pandemic, dealmakers are seeking other, related work on companies needing rescues, restructurings and potentially nationalizations as governments and central banks try to shore up their economies.
Still, efforts to recover from the virus-driven downturn are set to support M&A activity.
Some 56% of more than 2,900 executives surveyed globally by consultancy EY were planning an acquisition in the next 12 months, as they need to look beyond the current crisis to secure long-term growth, the firm said in a March report. 
""If there is any prolonged downturn due to the current crisis, executives may be bolder in their ambitions and look to acquire those assets that will help them accelerate into an upturn faster,"" the report said.

575,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>","At mercy of banks, India's cash-tight shadow lenders face new turmoil","By Nupur Anand
MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's banks are freezing credit lines to shadow lenders as the coronavirus crisis shuts down commerce in Asia's third-largest economy, but leaving this sector in the lurch risks wider financial contagion.
All major state-owned and private banks have stopped lending to non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) due to concerns about their financial health as businesses they lend to reel from the impact of the pandemic, four industry executives, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation, told Reuters. 
This has led to a working capital squeeze for many NBFCs who account for nearly a fifth of overall lending as they struggle to meet operating costs. Their debt collections have dried up amid a 40-day nationwide lockdown to rein in the respiratory illness that has claimed over 500 lives. 
""For now, we've taken salary cuts of up to 75% across the board so that we can stretch the capital for a couple more months, but if things continue like this we are considering winding up our operations, the founder of a small NBFC that lends to small and medium enterprises said.
A report by India Ratings this month said NBFCs are more exposed to bad debt as they tend to lend to riskier clients, often those likely the hardest hit by the virus lockdown.
Non-bank lenders have faced much tougher market conditions since the collapse in late 2018 of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS), a major shadow bank. Securing credit has become more expensive for all but the top-rated players.
There are nearly 10,000 non-bank lenders in India out of which the top 100 manage at least 80% of the total assets under management, said Krishnan Sitaraman, senior director of rating agency Crisil.
DOUBLE WHAMMY
Adding to the squeeze on NBFCs, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) last month allowed banks and finance companies to offer their borrowers a moratorium on loans for three months to tide over the current crisis.
Most NBFCs have not been able to benefit from this as the final decision on which borrowers can delay loan repayments rests with banks, but they have extended debt moratoriums to their borrowers who mainly fall in the self-employed category and have seen their businesses affected by the lockdown.
""If I am giving a moratorium, then logically it has to be extended to me as well, otherwise how will we cope? In this situation, the small and medium NBFCs will run out of cash, if not now then in one month or so,"" said Deo Shankar Tripathi, CEO of Aadhar housing finance. 
Anil Gupta, vice president & sector head of financial sector ratings at credit rating agency ICRA, said that if the moratorium was not extended to NBFCs, it would lead to defaults and ratings downgrades that would in turn impair their ability to get refinancing.
""Also, due to loan default by these firms, even if 10-20% of banks' total exposure goes bad that will be significant and can pose systemic risks,"" Gupta added.
Non-bank firms lend to smaller companies and individuals via long-term loans which are typically funded by short-term loans from banks and mutual funds.
FIDC, an industry body that represents NBFCs has made several requests to the central bank and finance ministry asking them to direct banks to provide them with liquidity support, according to documents reviewed by Reuters.
They have also asked for additional measures such as restructuring of loans and a reduction in provisioning for bad debt.
The RBI did not respond to a request for comment and the finance ministry declined to comment. 
The Indian Banks' Association (IBA), an industry body, which represents lenders met on Saturday to discuss providing a moratorium to NBFCs but have not reached a consensus, said two bankers who attended the meeting and requested anonymity as the details of the meeting are not public. 
The IBA did not respond to a request for comment. 
On Friday, the RBI also introduced additional measures to provide more liquidity to shadow lenders but industry experts believe it may not help the small and mid-size NBFCs that are in need as banks continue to remain risk averse.
After IL&FS, defaults by two other NBFCs last year, Dewan Housing Finance Corp and Altico Capital, have also increased fears of contagion within the banking system.
The NBFCs have over 1.75 trillion rupees ($22.9 billion) of debt obligations maturing by June which includes bank loans as well as market borrowings, according to rating agency Crisil.

With few refinancing options, this could lead to a fresh hit for debt fund investors and a new wave of woes for banks, already grappling with $140 billion in bad debt, the agency said.

Investing.com -- One of the sectors you would expect to do better than most out of the current pandemic is makers of healthcare equipment. Results out from Philips this morning back that up.
Koninklijke Philips (AS:PHG) shares rose 7.2% to a seven-week high after the company reported a surge in demand from healthcare systems around the world for its ventilators, patient monitors and related equipment.  
The prospect of turning those orders into sales later in the year more than outweighed the negative impact of a 2% drop in group sales and a drop in underlying profit margin to 5.9% from 8.8% a year earlier.
The news pushed it at the top of both the local and regional benchmark indices on a day when volatility fell to levels last seen in happier, pre-pandemic times. The Stoxx 600 was up 0.3%, while the Dutch AEX was up 1.0%. 
“Assuming we can convert our existing order book for the Diagnosis & Treatment and Connected Care businesses as planned, elective procedures normalize, and consumer demand gradually improves, we aim to return to growth and improved profitability for the Group in the second half of the year,” chief executive Frans van Houten said in a statement.
The company said it’s spending 100 million euros ($109 million) to ramp up production volumes for key equipment “steeply”, apparently anticipating that demand will go beyond immediate treatment needs and will continue for some time above pre-pandemic levels even after the crisis passes, as healthcare systems correct what – in hindsight – appears to have been a systematic shortage of capacity.
Even so, the company is far from immune to the damage caused by the pandemic. Sales of its personal care products, such as toothbrushes and razors, tumbled 12% during the quarter (worse still, hairdressers across Europe are just starting to reopen, pre-empting what could have been a surge in sales of hairclippers). Non-pandemic related medical products such as ultrasound and x-ray equipment also saw sales fall.
The company, which said it saw Covid-19 impacts spread gradually from one region to another in the first quarter, said it expects impacts “across all our geographies” in the current one, resulting in “a steep revenue decline for our Personal Health businesses and a sizable high-single-digit decline for our Diagnosis & Treatment businesses, partly offset by a significant increase in revenue of our Connected Care businesses.”
While it pulled its existing forecasts for 2020, it was still confident enough to forecast “modest” comparable sales growth and underlying margin improvement for the year."

SYDNEY (Reuters) -  Virgin Australia  Holdings (AX:VAH) is poised to enter voluntary administration, local media reported on Monday, with the cash-strapped airline unable to weather the coronavirus crisis because of its A$5 billion ($3.2 billion) of debt.
Australia's second-biggest carrier, which has about 10,000 employees, last week suspended trading in its shares to continue talks on financial aid and restructuring alternatives. It had requested a loan of A$1.4 billion from the government and entered debt-restructuring talks with creditors. 
The company, which had reported annual losses for seven consecutive years before the pandemic, is expected to appoint Deloitte as its administrator, the reports said. 
Options available under Australia's voluntary administration regime include asset sales, an agreement with creditors, debt write-offs or a winding up of the company.
Virgin Australia and Deloitte declined to comment. 
A formal announcement about the company entering administration is expected on Tuesday, The Australian newspaper reported without disclosing a source.
Estimated global airline losses from the coronavirus pandemic have climbed to $314 billion and led to industry warnings that carriers will collapse without sufficient government aid.
More than 90% of Virgin Australia's shares are controlled by a group of investors including Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL), Etihad Airways, Chinese conglomerate HNA Group and Richard Branson's Virgin Group, which have all suffered a sharp deterioration in revenue because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
HNA declined to comment. Singapore Airlines and Etihad Airways did not respond immediately to requests for comment. 
In a blog post on Monday, Branson said he was hopeful that Virgin Australia could emerge ""stronger than ever, as a more sustainable, financially viable airline"". 
""If Virgin Australia disappears, Qantas would effectively have a monopoly of the Australian skies,"" he said. 
HEAVY LOSSES
Virgin Australia had posted an A$88.6 million net loss for the six months to Dec. 31 before, due in part to heavy losses at its small international division.
The former budget carrier moved upmarket to compete against larger rival Qantas Airways (AX:QAN) for business travelers under the leadership of long-time Chief Executive John Borghetti but racked up losses.
Paul Scurrah, who took over from Borghetti in March 2019, has been cutting costs and reducing the size of the airline's workforce and fleet in an effort to restore profitability. 
The airline, however, took on additional debt under Scurrah to fund the A$700 million buyback of a 35% stake in the frequent flyer program it had sold to a private equity group when Borghetti was in charge.
After the coronavirus outbreak and imposition of strict travel restrictions, Virgin Australia grounded all international flights with the exception of government charters, drastically reduced its domestic flying and put the bulk of its staff on leave to preserve cash. 
Moody's downgraded Virgin Australia's credit rating on Friday, citing an assumption that any outcome was likely to result a debt haircut for bondholders. Its Australian-listed bonds last changed hands at about 37% of face value.

Virgin Atlantic last month asked the government for emergency financial help in addition to the coronavirus package made available to all British companies, but a deal has not yet been reached.
""We will do everything we can to keep the airline going – but we will need government support to achieve that in the face of the severe uncertainty surrounding travel today and not knowing how long the planes will be grounded for,"" Branson said in a blog post to staff.
""This would be in the form of a commercial loan – it wouldn’t be free money and the airline would pay it back."" 
Virgin Atlantic is based in the UK and is 51% owned by Branson's Virgin group and 49% owned by U.S. airline Delta (N:DAL).
Branson, a billionaire, has come under fire from opposition Labour party politicians for asking for support at a time when Virgin Atlantic employees have taken a temporary wage reduction and much of the economy has ground to a halt.
Virgin Atlantic staff have taken a wage cut for eight weeks, which Branson said was a ""virtually unanimous"" decision by employees and not forced upon them by management.
""I've seen lots of comments about my net worth – but that is calculated on the value of Virgin businesses around the world before this crisis, not sitting as cash in a bank account ready to withdraw,"" he said.

""Over the years significant profits have never been taken out of the Virgin Group, instead they have been reinvested in building businesses that create value and opportunities. The challenge right now is that there is no money coming in and lots going out.""

A further 21,000 cases were still being reviewed for possible payouts of 1,350 - 6,250 euros ($1,464.35 - $6,779.38) per car and the deadline for participating in the settlement has been extended to April 30, VW added. The exact amount depends on the age and model of the owner's car.
Volkswagen will pay out a total of 620 million euros. It had set aside 830 million to cover the costs of settlements with all participants of in the VZBV class action. 
The deal marks a further step in the German carmaker's efforts to make amends after it admitted in 2015 to using illegal software to cheat U.S. diesel engine tests. 
The effort has cost Volkswagen more than $30 billion in vehicle refits, fines and provisions.
Nearly all U.S. owners of affected cars agreed to take part in a $25 billion settlement in 2016 in the United States, but VW has said there was no legal basis for consumers in Germany to seek compensation due to differences in law.

585,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 20, 2020 03:18AM ET</span>",America’s ‘Big Three’ Airlines Prepare for a Very Painful Fall,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. airlines face a bleak future of depressed traffic and volatile revenue well into 2021, as the global economy transitions from the acute damage of a public health catastrophe into a potentially long recession.
Already a bumpy ride for the “Big Three” carriers, the journey promises to get worse this fall when billions of dollars in government assistance comes to an end. Several carriers, including Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL). and United Airlines Holdings Inc., have begun openly contemplating how they will shrink operations, while American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc. is moving to shed more of its older planes.
By one analyst’s count, as many as 105,000 jobs could be lost industrywide.
Airlines are barred from slashing jobs through Sept. 30 under the terms of a $50 billion government bailout, but they’re already warning employees that cuts are almost inevitable. The planned contraction reflects a widespread belief that 2020 revenues could shrink to levels not seen in years. Recovery will probably be a long-term affair, said Cowen & Co., which predicted that ticket sales may not rebound to pre-pandemic levels until 2025.
“The challenging economic outlook means we have some tough decisions ahead as we plan for our airline, and our overall workforce, to be smaller than it is today,” United’s chief executive and president, Oscar Munoz and Scott Kirby, wrote in an April 15 employee memo.
Unable to cut jobs or salaries while receiving grants to cover payroll, airlines will staff their typical summer peak largely as usual, even with millions of fewer travelers. But come fall, it could get ugly for employees. “We’re going to be smaller coming out of this,” Delta Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson told employees last month. “Certainly quite a bit smaller than when we went into it.”
The reversal of fortune comes as a shock for an industry that just last year was breaking passenger traffic records. Last week, the average number of U.S. daily passengers declined 96%, to 95,531, compared with 2.39 million last year, according to Transportation Security Administration data compiled by Bloomberg.
Such anemic demand means that anything less than a robust rebound over the coming months will prompt airlines to cut more employees, jettison older aircraft and cut more salaries, which in turn could persuade more workers to depart. During the past two months, at least 87,000 employees—more than one quarter of the Big Three airlines’ workforce—have taken voluntary leaves, early retirement or reduced work hours.
Carriers face “the worst cash crisis in the history of flight,” with booked revenues down 103% year over year, according to industry lobby Airlines for America. Domestic flights are averaging just 10 passengers while international flights average 24, the group said.
“We could see the airlines look to shed 800 to 1,000 aircraft, which could result in a reduction of 95,000 to 105,000 airline jobs.”
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co. told union leaders it might slash some of its 60,000 workers this fall if a deal can’t be reached to cut labor costs further and traffic doesn’t return to more normal patterns. Any furloughs would be the first in Southwest’s 49-year history.
The government bailout bought employees and labor unions time to devise methods to lessen financial hardship, including bridges to early retirement and other separation programs, said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents almost 50,000 attendants at 19 airlines, including United and Alaska Air Group Inc.
“This gives us time to plan for cutting down the ranks without just cutting people out of work,” Nelson said. “We’re going to be taking proactive steps to stave off as much hurt as possible in the fall.”
The union and its allies are also pushing Congress to amend the bailout legislation so that a dozen large airlines can keep about $6 billion the U.S. Treasury is currently expecting to be repaid.
The pace of any recovery for ticket sales this summer will dictate how many airline jobs are at risk, but so will carrier liquidity when balanced against their debt loads, said William Swelbar, an aviation consultant and a director of Hawaiian Holdings Inc. “It’s going to become a balance sheet story again,” he said.
Airlines like Delta and United are built atop global networks oiled by revenue-sharing alliances. Funneling corporate travelers through domestic feeder routes that can connect a New Hampshire hamlet with a Chinese manufacturing hub is where the money is. Removing those high-value passengers from the equation is akin to tossing sand in the gears—it forces carriers to quickly cut costs to make up the lost revenue.
“If you’re a network carrier, there’s your yield, and if that doesn’t come back fast, they’re really not designed to fly to Orlando and Vegas,” Swelbar said of the Big Three. The big question is “how fast does the business piece come back?”
While airlines foresee an uptick in bargain-hunting leisure travelers this summer, big money road warriors will take longer to win back. Corporations will be reluctant to assume the liability of putting employees back in the sky with Covid-19 still in wide circulation. Plus, many companies have learned to function via video conference—which is a lot cheaper than a business class seat.
“The longer we go, the more people Zoom, the slower business travel is going to come back,” said Swelbar.
Moreover, those who do choose to start flying again won’t be taking long-haul international flights, said Ben Baldanza, a director at JetBlue Airways Corp. and the former chief executive of Spirit Airlines Inc. “It’s going to be easier for people to think ‘I’ll take a quick flight from Dallas to Los Angeles, but I am not going to go to the Middle East, Asia or Europe,’” he said. 
The airline industry generally has taken three to four years to fully recover from major disruptions, said Samuel Engel, head of the aviation group at consultant ICF. Economic downturns often accelerate trends that were already underway, like pulling down marginal routes and, more recently, the decline in demand for large aircraft, he said.
“The last couple of years, you have seen extensions of flights toward end of day and early morning, and growth of long, thin routes to secondary cities in Asia,” he said. “Those types of things get pulled back, and some don’t reappear until quite late in the economic cycle.”
The coming industry pullback will also encompass revamping fleets and retiring older aircraft that are more expensive to operate and maintain. American Airlines has accelerated retirement of its oldest planes—51 Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. 767s and 757s—and will do the same with its fleet of 20 Embraer SA E190s and some 50-seat regional jets. It’s also weighing whether to retire its oldest Boeing 737s.
Delta is evaluating whether to speed the retirement of its oldest Boeing MD80 and MD90 aircraft, while United has said its oldest Boeing 757s and some 767s could also be grounded permanently, ahead of schedule.
“Without a quick improvement in demand, we could see the airlines look to shed 800 to 1,000 aircraft, which could result in a reduction of 95,000 to 105,000 airline jobs,” Cowen analyst Helane Becker wrote in an April 13 client note. “The rightsizing of the fleet and work force is an unfortunate truth.”

588,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2020 02:10AM ET</span>",Mind the gap: Rising Italy yield premia put bond markets back on ECB watch,"By Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - Bond markets are again testing the ECB's resolve to contain a rise in Italian borrowing costs, betting the central bank will have no choice but to unleash greater and more frequent bond-buying to compensate for dithering by euro zone politicians.
Hit hard by the coronavirus crisis and with a debt burden of over 130% of GDP, Italy is widely seen as the euro zone state most vulnerable to a market sell-off. 
Its 10-year bond yield halved to 1.5% after the European Central Bank announced on March 18 a 750 billion euro emergency bond-buying scheme, known as PEPP, to help countries tackle the pandemic, but has risen back in recent days to 2%.
Selling pressure grew after euro zone politicians failed to agree a sale of coronabonds, a debt instrument which would pool the credit risk of weaker countries like Italy with top-rated ones like Germany.
Higher yields make Italy's debt burden more onerous, especially as some estimate the economic hit from the COVID-19 crisis could send the ratio to 180% of GDP.. 
That all creates a dilemma for the ECB, which might face fresh questions about the credibility of its policies. 
""You know there is an issue when everybody is dusting off their debt crisis models again. That is what we and everybody else has been doing in the case of Italy,"" said Gilles Moec, chief economist at AXA Investment Managers. 
Many have been surprised by the speed at which the yield premium, or spread, on Italian over German debt has widened again, especially as the PEPP came on top of an existing 360 billion euro bond-purchase facility.
At around 221 basis points at Friday's market close, the spread -- a measure of sovereign risk -- was 35 bps higher than a week earlier, reversing much of the tightening since March 18. (DE10IT10=RR).
(GRAPHIC: Italian spread - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovazgnpab/Pasted%20image%201587047366003.png) 
READY TO ACT
A signal the ECB is preparing to act came from board member Isabel Schnabel who said the central bank was ready to do more to avoid financial fragmentation in the euro zone.
So what could it do?
Firstly, it could expand PEPP. ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) predicts another 500 billion euros will be added this month. 
The ECB could also continue to front-load its asset purchases and reinvestments from maturing bonds to favor Italy. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimates it may already have bought 30-40 billion euros of Italian debt since PEPP was announced. That is 35%-45% of total purchases -- well above Rome's 17% share under the old capital key rules. 
AXA's Moec said markets would be reassured by some ECB communication on how it will reinvest proceeds from its bond program, for example if it would cover additional debt Italy is raising to cover the costs of the coronavirus crisis. 
""If they were to reinvest for 10, 15 or even 20 years (in Italian bonds) then they will have de facto removed the pandemic-linked portion of the debt increase,"" Moec said. 
(GRAPHIC: Italy's debt to GDP set to jump in face of coronavirus crisis - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgpodybvdx/Pasted%20image%201587120839211.png) 
There is also the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) scheme, an unused crisis tool that allows the ECB to make unlimited purchases of a country's debt. 
Markus Schomer, chief economist at PineBridge Investments, reckons OMT is a bazooka that should be deployed at the earliest opportunity. 
""The longer you do not do this, the longer Italian bond yields will rise significantly above zero percent, the more Italians will want debt relief and you fuel the rising anti-euro sentiment in Italy,"" he said.
But OMT requires a government to first apply to the European Stability Mechanism bailout fund and Italy has said it does not intend to do so.
URGENCY 
There is always the small possibility that none of this is needed. On Thursday, euro zone ministers will take another stab at finding a solution to the crisis, with coronabonds likely to come up again. 
Their meeting comes a day before S&P Global reviews its BBB credit rating for Italy. A one-notch downgrade to BBB- would bring S&P's rating in line with that of Moody's, a step away from ""junk"" territory where borrowing costs balloon.
With hopes slim that ministers will achieve a breakthrough, investors are watching for key intervention thresholds. 
They believe, based on recent market movements, that ECB buying steps up when the Italian/German spread approaches 250-300 bps. That is consequently seen as the area where the ECB starts to fret about disparities in how its monetary policy is transmitted across bloc members. 
Italian 10-year yields around 2% may be another key level, according to ABN Amro's head of financial markets research Nick Kounis.

He said recent ECB behavior suggested 2% was the ""line in the sand to fight against a vicious spiral developing between concerns about the debt outlook, rising yields, tighter financial conditions and hence even weaker growth.""

589,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 20, 2020 01:09AM ET</span>",India Bans Flights Indefinitely in Extreme Step to Contain Virus,"(Bloomberg) -- India ordered airlines not to sell tickets unless they are notified otherwise, stripping them of a key source of cash flow as Prime Minister Narendra Modi takes bolder steps to contain the coronavirus crisis.
With India in nationwide lockdown until May 3, no decision has been made on allowing flights after the restrictions of movement are lifted, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said in a notification posted on Twitter. Airlines shouldn’t sell tickets for after the lockdown, and they will be given “sufficient notice and time” to resume flights, the DGCA said.
The move is another blow to cash-strapped airlines in one of the world’s fastest-growing markets, as they use funds from advance ticket sales to cover day-to-day expenses. The DGCA order, which applies to local and foreign airlines, means carriers will likely have to take more steps to reduce costs having already put some staff on leave without pay and reducing salaries.
Shares of InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., which operates the nation’s biggest airline IndiGo, fell as much as 5.5% Monday morning in Mumbai. Smaller rival SpiceJet Ltd. slid nearly 3%.
India initially announced a 21-day lockdown until April 14, and airlines had started selling tickets before the extension to May 3 was announced last Tuesday. Most carriers have been offering credit instead of refunds if flights are canceled, a practice that other airlines around the world are also using.
The travel restrictions mean the three months ending June 30 will be “virtual washout” for the Indian aviation industry, CAPA Centre for Aviation said earlier this month. Local airlines, some of the world’s biggest customers for Airbus SE and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co., are likely to defer taking delivery of 200 new planes by as long as two years, according to CAPA.

“We forecast S&P 500 cash spending will decline by an annual record 33% during 2020 as firms prioritize liquidity in a worsening economic environment,” strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note Friday. He continues to expect a big decline in earnings per share for the first and second quarters. He noted that “most investors are already looking ahead to 2021 EPS.”
The impact of the coronavirus pandemic fueled a drop of as much as 34% on the S&P 500 from its record high Feb. 19 through March 23. But it has rallied 28% since then, as governments and central banks globally have been rolling out measures to try to keep the financial system operating and provide support to businesses and citizens.
Kostin is still bullish on U.S. stocks. In a report last week he scrapped a prediction that the S&P 500 might fall further, saying the gauge had likely bottomed due to fiscal and monetary policy support. He maintains a year-end target of 3,000 on the benchmark, which closed Friday at 2,875. That doesn’t mean it’ll be all smooth sailing, though -- late last month, he estimated that dividends on the S&P 500 could fall by a quarter in 2020, and he projects buybacks will drop by half.

594,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2020 09:35PM ET</span>",China's CDB Financial scraps purchase of 29 Boeing 737 MAX jets,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - China Development Bank (CDB) Financial Leasing Co (HK:1606) said on Monday it had agreed with  Boeing Co  (N:BA) to cancel the purchase of 29 undelivered 737 MAX jets, adding to a string of recent cancellations of the grounded airplane. 
The model has been grounded globally for more than a year following deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. 
""In light of evolving aviation market dynamics, we've been working together with Boeing over many months to re-calibrate our MAX orderbook to be in line with our long-term view of the market and related opportunities,"" Xuedong Wang, chairman of CDB Financial unit CDB Aviation, said in a statement.
The lessor said it retained an order for another 70 of the planes that also have yet to be delivered. 
Boeing recorded a total of 150 MAX cancellations in March, including 75 from Irish leasing company Avolon. Boeing remains in talks with regulators seeking approval to return the plane to service, but its customers have also seen a sharp fall-off in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Boeing said in a statement it continued to partner with leasing company customers to help them balance their portfolios in a challenging market.
""As we work to return the 737 MAX to service, our focus remains on addressing our customers' fleet needs while optimising the delivery of the more than 4,000 airplanes in our 737 backlog,"" it said. 
""As market conditions normalise, Boeing anticipates that lessors who have restructured or reduced their orderbooks will continue to add MAX aircraft to their portfolios through sale leaseback agreements with airlines,"" the planemaker said. ""Longer term we expect these lessors will again place orders for direct MAX purchases.""

CDB Financial Leasing said that all 737 MAX 10 jets still on order will be switched to the smaller 737 MAX 8 model, and 20 deliveries will be deferred to dates in 2024, 2025 and 2026.

Chinese refiners are snapping up low-price oil from all over the world as Asia’s largest economy emerges from a virus-driven slump.
Varieties such as Alaska North Slope, Canada’s Cold Lake and Brazil’s Lula have been offered at steep discounts to global benchmark prices over the past week as sellers scrambled to secure buyers. Processors in China -- where throughput is back to pre-virus levels -- are snagging many of the bargains as much of the rest of the world remains in lockdown.
See also: Oil Demand Slumps 70% in Third-Biggest Buyer as India Shuts
Spot supplies of Cold Lake were sold by a European trader at a discount of between $8 and $9 a barrel to Brent on a delivered basis, while an oil major sold a shipment comprising Alaskan North Slope and Brazilian grades at a $5.50 to $6 discount, said traders who buy and sell crude in Asia. The cargoes were purchased by Chinese independent refiners, known as teapots, which have staged a strong comeback from run-rate cuts and closures in February.
As for oil that’s produced closer to Asia, Chinese state-owned refiners have been buying Russia’s Sokol crude for significantly less than Dubai benchmark prices. The spot purchases were made on top of crude bought via long-term supply contracts with Saudi Arabian, Iraqi and Kuwaiti producers. At least five Chinese processors sought full contracted volumes from  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) this week after it slashed official prices for Asian customers for a second month.
Major producers are still struggling with a large overhang of physical cargoes despite the agreement this month by OPEC and its allies to curb output by almost 10%. In Nigeria, one of the country’s benchmark grades, Bonny Light, fell to about $12 or $13 a barrel as swathes of Europe, the staple market for the West Arican nation, have gone into lockdown to combat the coronavirus.
Meanwhile, storage across the world -- both on land and at sea -- is rapidly filling up. Brent crude has remained in a steep contango, a bearish market structure where prompt oil is cheaper than later supplies, even after the OPEC+ deal.

598,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2020 03:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Neiman Marcus to file for bankruptcy as soon as this week - sources,"By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Neiman Marcus Group is preparing to seek bankruptcy protection as soon as this week, becoming the first major U.S. department store operator to succumb to the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, people familiar with the matter said.
The debt-laden Dallas-based company has been left with few options after the pandemic forced it to temporarily shut all 43 of its Neiman Marcus locations, roughly two dozen Last Call stores and its two Bergdorf Goodman stores in New York. 
Neiman Marcus is in the final stages of negotiating a loan with its creditors totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, which would sustain some of its operations during bankruptcy proceedings, according to the sources. It has also furloughed many of its roughly 14,000 employees. 
The bankruptcy filing could come within days, though the timing could slip, the sources said. Neiman Marcus skipped millions of dollars in debt payments last week, including one that only gave the company a few days to avoid a default.
Neiman Marcus' borrowings total about $4.8 billion, according to credit ratings firm Standard & Poor's. Some of this debt is the legacy of its $6 billion leveraged buyout in 2013 by its owners, private equity firm Ares Management Corp and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB).
The sources requested anonymity because the bankruptcy preparations are confidential. Neiman Marcus and Ares declined to comment, while CPPIB representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Other department store operators that have also had to close their stores are battling to avoid Neiman Marcus' fate. Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) and  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN) have been rushing to secure new financing, such as by borrowing against some of their real estate. J.C. Penney Co Inc is contemplating a bankruptcy filing as a way to rework its unsustainable finances and save money on looming debt payments, Reuters reported last week.
A bankruptcy filing would be a grim milestone that Neiman Marcus has spent the last few years trying to avoid. It pushed out due dates on its financial obligations last year in a restructuring deal with some creditors, though the transactions added to Neiman Marcus' interest expenses. 
A trustee for some of the company's bondholders sued Neiman Marcus last year, claiming the firm and its owners robbed investors of the value of its luxury e-commerce site MyTheresa by moving the business beyond the reach of creditors in a corporate reshuffling. Neiman maintains its actions were proper. 
""In light of the significant headwinds stemming from the coronavirus pandemic and our expectation for a U.S. recession this year, we believe the company's prospects for a turnaround are increasingly low,"" Standard & Poor's analysts wrote in a note last week.
""We continue to view its capital structure as unsustainable,"" the analysts added, lowering their credit rating on Neiman Marcus deep into ""junk"" territory. They said the move reflected the ""elevated potential"" of a debt restructuring.
Once it files for bankruptcy, Neiman Marcus could attract interest from potential suitors seeking to pick up the company or some of its assets on the cheap, the sources said. 
Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson's Bay Co explored a bid for Neiman Marcus in 2017 but did not pursue it, people familiar with the matter said at the time. The Canadian company was taken private earlier this year by a group of shareholders led by its chief executive Richard Baker, and it is unclear if it remains interested or would be in a position to pursue a new bid. 
A Hudson's Bay representative did not immediately return a request for comment.
FROM FASHION FIXTURE TO BRINK OF BANKRUPTCY
The first Neiman Marcus store opened in Dallas, Texas, in 1907. It was opened by the Marcus and Neiman families, which decided to pursue the retail venture after considering and rejecting an investment in a little-known soft drink at the time called Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), according to Neiman Marcus' website.
The company expanded across the United States and in 1972 it acquired New York City's Bergdorf Goodman, itself founded in the early 1900s, becoming a fashion fixture for celebrities and wealthy customers seeking expensive handbags and clothing.
Like other brick-and-mortar department store operators, Neiman Marcus struggled in recent years to compete with discount retail chains and a consumer shift to online shopping. Luxury e-commerce firms such as Yoox (MI:YNAP) Net-A-Porter Group (YNAP) and Farfetch Ltd have added to the competitive pressure facing Neiman Marcus.

The coronavirus outbreak has pushed the company to the brink. While it has asked some workers back to closed stores to fulfill online orders, these operations cannot make up for lost sales in physical stores.

599,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2020 02:07PM ET</span>",Wynn Resorts CEO calls for Las Vegas Strip to conditionally reopen in mid- to late May,"By Helen Coster
(Reuters) - Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) Chief Executive Officer Matt Maddox on Sunday called on the Nevada governor to begin to reopen the Las Vegas Strip in mid- to late May with extensive safety measures in place, assuming the state is in line with certain benchmarks around the spread of the coronavirus.
In an opinion column https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/a-plan-to-re-open-nevada published on the Nevada Independent news website, Maddox said Governor Steve Sisolak should reopen parts of the local economy in early May.
“Begin with reduced occupancy, physical distancing measures in place, temperature checks and no large gatherings,” Maddox wrote. “We all need to wear a mask.”
He also laid out Wynn’s health and safety guidelines for reopening, which include allowing a maximum of four people to ride in an elevator at one time; and requiring guests to enter the resort through doors that are either propped open, are automated or manually operated by an employee. 
Sisolak ordered all casinos and other nonessential businesses in the state to close for 30 days beginning March 18. He extended that order until April 30, and last week said he has no specific date for when nonessential businesses might be allowed to reopen.
The United States has by far the world's largest number of confirmed coronavirus cases, with more than 730,000 infections and over 39,600 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. In Nevada, there have been at least 3,725 people confirmed to have the coronavirus and 155 deaths.
Wynn Resorts - which owns and operates the Wynn Las Vegas, the Encore Boston Harbor, the Wynn Macau and the Wynn Palace, Cotai - closed its U.S. properties on March 15 and 17. 
Wynn’s Macau casinos reopened on Feb. 20 after a mandatory, industry-wide two-week closure. It and other casinos resumed operations with government-mandated restrictions that include temperature checks, fewer open tables on the casino floor, and rules against guests standing or congregating. 
While the coronavirus epidemic in China has been momentarily halted, in the United States it is spreading from cities to suburbs and rural areas. 
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been pushing to end state-mandated stay-at-home orders, last week laid out federal government guidelines for states to reopen their economies in a staggered, three-stage approach. 
Health experts have warned that to avoid a second wave of infections once people resume activity, extensive testing must be available to track infections, as well as contact tracing and antibody testing.

Wynn is paying all salaried, part-time and hourly North American employees through May 15, which is costing the company approximately $3 million per day or $180 million for two months, according to Maddox.

600,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2020 12:15PM ET</span>",Stock market gains alongside economic pain; some worry about over-optimism,"By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - The U.S. stock market has rebounded swiftly despite a raft of terrible economic news, driven by a massive boost from the Federal Reserve, hopes of a successful reopening of the economy and possible coronavirus treatments, as well as investors' fear-of-missing-out. But not everyone is buying the bounce. 
The S&P 500 (SPX) closed on Friday at 2,874, more than 28% above its recent trough reached on March 23 and just under 18% below its record high close reached on Feb. 19. That rally has been spurred by the U.S. central bank going into overdrive to try to keep the economy from suffering lasting damage, as well as a $2.3 trillion federal stimulus package.
Investors and analysts have turned more positive. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) last week said the unprecedented monetary and fiscal policy actions by the Fed and Congress had ""precluded the prospect of a complete economic collapse,"" meaning its previous near-term downside forecast for the S&P of 2000 was no longer likely.
Andrew Sheets, a strategist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), wrote in a research note that the economic downturn ""will be more severe, but less prolonged"" than the financial crisis, but he expects the economy to hit its low point in the second quarter. If that is the case, Sheets said, ""it's very reasonable that the low for equity/credit prices happens before that.""
The stockmarket has changed its mood swiftly since March 23 - when the S&P 500 dropped as much as 35% below its Feb. 19 peak. But trading has been volatile. Since then the index has closed up more than 1% in ten sessions with its biggest daily gain at 9.4% on March 24. It has fallen more than 1% six times and the deepest cut was 4.4% on April 1. 
Other risk assets have also benefited: Junk-rated bonds saw record inflows of $10.5 billion in the week to Wednesday, BofA said on Friday.
The turnaround in optimism comes against an awful economic picture. Data on Thursday showed a record 22 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits over the past month, manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region plunged to levels last seen in 1980 and homebuilding tumbling by the most in 36 years in March. That followed dismal reports of a record drop in retail sales in March and the biggest decline in factory output since 1946. 
Some investors are arguing for more focus on fundamentals such as corporate earnings. 
""The market's forecasting can be error-prone and currently there is little mention of head fakes, value traps, potentially impotent policies, and significant later-order effects,"" Richard Bernstein, chief executive of Richard Bernstein Advisors, wrote in a report late on Friday. He thinks we are in only the first phase of a bear market. 
Bernstein says fundamentals, not short-term technicals or FOMO - meaning fear-of-missing out, ""will ultimately determine the direction of the markets.""
Chris Beauchamp, analyst at online trading firm IG, said investors ""continue to be confounded by the strength of the rebound in stock markets, which have apparently decided that the coronavirus crisis is receding in intensity."" However, he said that with earnings season intensifying this week, ""the rally faces more hurdles.""
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s chief U.S. equity strategist, Tobias Levkovich, wrote that he worried about ""sentiment moving out of panic so rapidly"" in what he described as a ""somewhat treacherous"" and volatile investment environment. 
While policy moves like those by the Fed and congressional stimulus programs may deserve big reactions if risks are removed, Levkovich says he is looking at fundamentals and worries about ""difficult-to-assess issues such as the potential for second wave infection outbreaks as the economy re-opens."" 
Investors have also been reassured by signs U.S. coronavirus cases may be peaking and on Friday stocks were buoyed by a report that COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms had responded well to a drug from Gilead Sciences (O:GILD) even though full trial data for that drug had yet to been analyzed. (N)
Russell Price, Ameriprise's chief economist, sees government stimulus, reports of virus treatments advances and signs of peaking infections as good reasons for the more positive stock market, but he expects the U.S. economy to take between six and eight quarters to get back to where it was at the end of 2019. 
""What's not fully been embraced is how difficult it's going to be to get the economy up to speed,"" said Price. ""What the market doesn't seem to be appreciating is how long it takes.""
Bernstein argues that if economic progress in China - the first country to report coronavirus cases- is any guide it doesn't bode that well for the U.S economy in the near term.
""China's path has been very saucer-shaped at best,"" according to Bernstein which notes that the country is about 50 days ahead of the United States in its outbreak and recovery.
Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey, is also skeptical of the rally. 

""You don't fight the Fed. You have the momentum people are chasing,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey, who is also skeptical of the rally. ""Is it fundamentally justified, absolutely not.""

601,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 19, 2020 04:54AM ET</span>",Hin Leong Is Said to Have Failed to Declare $800 Million Losses,"(Bloomberg) -- The son of the legendary oil trader and founder of Hin Leong Trading (Pte.) Ltd. said the Singapore-based company had suffered about $800 million in losses from futures trading that weren’t reflected in its financial statements, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
Lim Chee Meng, the only son of Lim Oon Kuin, said he was unaware of the losses suffered over some years and his father had instructed Hin Leong’s finance department to omit them from its financial statements, according to the people with knowledge of an April 17 email sent by the shipping arm of Hin Leong, Ocean Tankers (Pte.) Ltd., notifying recipient parties of proposed moratorium proceedings.
Neither the son nor the father could be reached for comment Sunday. Nobody responded to calls or emails to Hin Leong or Ocean Tankers seeking comment. A spokeswoman for Rajah and Tann, one of Hin Leong’s advisers, said the firm is unable to comment because the matter is before the court.
Hin Leong and Ocean Tankers both filed for court protection from creditors on Friday as the former struggles to repay its debts, said to be up to $4 billion.
The trader’s financial distress has rocked the tightly-knit trading community in Singapore, one of the world’s most important oil markets and its biggest ship fueling hub. It’s raising speculation that the privately-held company could be the latest casualty of the historic collapse in oil prices triggered by the coronavirus.
Privately-held Hin Leong posted a positive equity of $4.56 billion and net profit of $78 million in the period ended October 31, according to the people, citing the email, which was signed off by Lim Chee Meng -- also known as Evan Lim -- and his sister Lim Huey Ching.
Bloomberg first reported Hin Leong’s financial difficulties April 10 after some lenders had pulled credit lines from Hin Leong amid concerns over its ability to finance its debts. It’s said to owe almost $4 billion to more than 20 banks including  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA).
Lim Oon Kuin, known to many in the industry as OK Lim, will be resigning from all executive roles in Hin Leong, the Xihe Group and related companies as of April 17, according to the people, citing the email. He will also step down as director and managing director of Ocean Tankers.
Both Hin Leong and Ocean Tankers have filed for protection from its creditors under Section 211B of Singapore’s Companies Act. Hin Leong was established in 1963 and has grown into one of Asia’s largest suppliers of ship fuel, or bunkers. Ocean Tankers owns a fleet of more than 100 oil tankers of various sizes.

France has rolled out a 110-billion-euro package to prop up the economy and help businesses including cash handouts for the smallest firms, tax and payroll charge deferrals and state-subsidised furloughs.
Some 150,000 companies from restaurants to hairdressers have tapped 20 billion euros worth of loans backed by the state so far, in a scheme operated through commercial banks.
Fnac Darty, which also sells books and video games and operates an events business, is the largest company to apply, the economy ministry and firm said in a joint statement.
""The deployment of state-guaranteed loans is now a reality for French companies, regardless of their size,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said. 
Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) is negotiating state-backed loans for at least 6 billion euros with the French and Dutch governments, but the deal has not been finalised. 
France is resisting demands from banks for a higher level of state loan guarantees, sources have told Reuters. 
Its guarantee is capped at 70% of the funding, while Germany for instance is offering emergency loans for large firms with higher state coverage. 
The package for Fnac Darty, which said its revenue had dropped 7.9% in the first quarter to 1.49 billion euros, has a one year maturity, with a five-year extension option. 
Arkea Banque, Bred,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), CIC,  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), La Banque Postale, LCL, Natixis and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) provided the funds, and Fnac Darty said its lenders had also agreed to suspend its financial covenants, or the terms governing its loans, in June and December 2020. 
The company canceled its planned 1.50 euro per share dividend on its 2019 results. 
It said 80% of its staff in France were on a state-backed temporary unemployment scheme and that it was renegotiating rental payments.
One bright spot was its online sales, which doubled over the last 15 days of March and the beginning of April, as countries where it operates including France, Spain and Portugal enforced coronavirus lockdowns.
TVs and computers, as well as refrigerators and freezers, were in high demand, it said.

603,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2020 02:15PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Amazon deploys thermal cameras at warehouses to scan for fevers faster,"By Jeffrey Dastin and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has started to use thermal cameras at its warehouses to speed up screening for feverish workers who could be infected with the coronavirus, employees told Reuters.
The cameras in effect measure how much heat people emit relative to their surroundings. They require less time and contact than forehead thermometers, earlier adopted by Amazon, the workers said.
Cases of the virus have been reported among staff at more than 50 of Amazon's U.S. warehouses. That has prompted some workers to worry for their safety and walk off the job. Unions and elected officials have called on Amazon to close buildings down.
The use of cameras, previously unreported, shows how America's second-biggest corporate employer is exploring methods to contain the virus' spread without shuttering warehouses essential to its operation. 
U.S. states have given Amazon the green light to deliver goods with nearly all the country under stay-at-home orders. 
In France, Amazon has closed six of its fulfillment centers temporarily - one of the biggest fallouts yet from a dispute with workers over the risks of coronavirus contagion.
Other companies that have explored using the thermal camera technology include  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). The camera systems, which garnered widespread use at airports in Asia after the SARS epidemic in 2003, can cost between $5,000 and $20,000.
This week and last, Amazon set up the hardware for the thermal cameras in at least six warehouses outside Los Angeles and Seattle, where the company is based, according to employees and posts on social media. 
Thermal cameras will also replace thermometers at worker entrances to many of Amazon's Whole Foods stores, according to a recent staff note seen by Reuters and previously reported by Business Insider.
The company performs a second, forehead thermometer check on anyone flagged by the cameras to determine an exact temperature, one of the workers said. An international standard requires the extra check, though one camera system maker said the infrared scan is more accurate than a thermometer.
How widely Amazon will deploy the technology at a time when camera makers are grappling with a surge in demand could not be determined. A Whole Foods representative said cameras ordered weeks ago were starting to arrive for use. 
Amazon confirmed that some warehouses have implemented the systems to streamline checks. The company is taking temperatures ""to support the health and safety of our employees, who continue to provide a critical service in our communities,"" it said in a statement.
Early this month, Amazon said it would offer face masks and start checking hundreds of thousands of people for fevers daily at all its U.S. and European warehouses. Associates walk up to a Plexiglas screen, and an employee on the other side scans their forehead by pointing a thermometer through a small hole.
That process has not been without challenges. A worker performing temperature checks in Houston said his proximity to associates made him uncomfortable, in spite of the screen separating them.
""I didn't sign up for this,"" he said.
A Los Angeles-area employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said a line once formed outside her warehouse, and employees could not receive masks until after they had entered the building and had their temperatures taken.
The thermal camera system is faster, two other workers said, with no stopping in front of a screen necessary. The cameras connect to a computer so an employee at a distance can view the results, one said.
Amazon did not disclose whose gadgets it was using. One of the employees, at a warehouse outside Seattle, said the technology came from Infrared Cameras Inc in Texas. Reached by phone, ICI's chief executive, Gary Strahan, said he would not confirm or deny his company's working with Amazon.

Other purveyors include UK-based Thermoteknix and U.S.-based FLIR Systems Inc (NASDAQ:FLIR).

604,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",French court backs EDF in dispute with distributors over supply contracts,"PARIS (Reuters) - Electricity distributors in France cannot break contracts to buy nuclear power from EDF (PA:EDF) at pre-established prices, France's highest court has ruled, after some argued that the coronavirus outbreak materially altered the situation. 
 Total  (PA:TOTF) is said to be among several power suppliers seeking to declare force majeure on agreed purchases of nuclear power from EDF after prices fell far below existing contracts. 
After energy market regulator CRE rejected their bid, two lobby groups representing the power and gas distributors lodged an appeal with France's high level State Council.
In a ruling dated Friday, the Council said the coronavirus outbreak could indeed hurt revenues for power groups - but added that there was no evidence this posed an existential risk for the firms, which would otherwise constitute a force majeure. 
It rejected the claim, and said that there was no reason the suppliers and EDF could not instead pursue negotiations to ease the burden for the smallest and most vulnerable firms in particular. 
ANODE, one of two lobby groups that brought the claim and which represents distributors such as Eni (MI:ENI), declined to comment. EDF could not immediately be reached for comment. 
CRE did not disclose which firms had tried to declare force majeure, but three sources told Reuters that Total, EDF's biggest rival in France's retail power market, led the move.
Under the so-called ARENH mechanism set up in 2011 to foster competition, EDF's rivals can buy up to 100 terawatt hours (TWh), or about a quarter of its annual nuclear output, at a fixed price of 42 euros ($46.29) per megawatt hour (MWh).
State-controlled EDF operates France's 58 nuclear reactors that account for around 75% of the country's electricity needs.
The coronavirus outbreak and a national lockdown to curb its spread has led to a sharp drop in electricity demand, pushing wholesale prices lower. 

France's baseload power contract for June delivery  closed at 27.70 euros/MWh on Friday.

The Anadarko acquisition closed in August, months before an oil price crash sapped the cash flow Occidental needed to pay the debt taken with the purchase. Critics, including activist shareholder Carl Icahn, have said the financing deal with Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett was too generous. 
Occidental and Berkshire Hathaway declined to comment.
Berkshire Hathaway's $10 billion investment provided it with warrants for 80 million common shares in addition to an 8% dividend on preferred shares received for its support for the Anadarko Petroleum acquisition. 
Shareholders, who did not get to vote on the Anadarko deal last year, will vote at Occidental's May 29 annual meeting to authorize the warrants and to issue 400 million new shares, some of which could pay the Berkshire dividend. https://tinyurl.com/ybf9dmtq
Shareholders could voice disapproval of the Anadarko deal by not voting in favor of the proposals, said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones. But Occidental needs the high number of authorized shares to pay the preferred dividend and some employee compensation, ""as they need to preserve as much cash as possible,"" Rowland added.
Cash-strapped Occidental recently paid Berkshire its first quarter dividend with about 17.3 million shares, which are trading at a fifth of what they fetched last year. When paid in shares, the dividend increases to nearly 9%. 
Berkshire's warrants are nearly worthless, because their $62.50 strike price is well above Occidental's $13.63 closing price on Friday. But they give Berkshire more than a decade to exercise the option, and dividends paid in shares could make it a major holder in short order.
The Anadarko acquisition was a bet on rising shale oil prices months ahead of the worst price crash in decades. The purchase saddled Occidental with $40 billion in debt and the oil-price crash has cut the value of assets that Occidental picked up in the deal, dashing its hopes of selling them to pay down the debt. U.S. oil prices have fallen below $20 per barrel from $61 at the start of the year.
Chief Executive Vicki Hollub's base pay for 2020 was cut 81%, according to a Friday filing, as the board capped the salaries of named officers at $250,000. Her base salary in 2019 was $1.33 million.
Hollub had $4.4 million in realized compensation last year, as the value of stock awards - worth $10.5 million during 2019 - tumbled with the company's share price.

Pay for non-employee board members also was cut 15% recently due to ""the sudden and significant decline in global commodity prices,"" the filing said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday put on hold a suit by Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) challenging the Pentagon's decision to award a $10 billion contract to  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT).
Judge Patricia E. Campbell-Smith granted the Pentagon's request to halt further action on the lawsuit to allow the military to reconsider aspects of the decision being challenged by Amazon, originally considered to be the favorite to win the award. She ordered the case to remain on hold until August 17, but said it could be extended or shortened depending on the length of the review.
Known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, the cloud computing contract is intended to give the militarybetter access to data and technology from remote locations.
The Amazon lawsuit, filed in November, said the Defense Department’s decision was full of ""egregious errors,” which were a result of ""improper pressure from President Donald Trump, who launched repeated public and behind-the-scenes attacks” to steer the contract away from Amazon “to harm his perceived political enemy”, Amazon head Jeff Bezos.
Trump has publicly derided Bezos and accused the Washington Post newspaper, owned by Bezos, of unfair coverage.
Campbell-Smith released an opinion on March 7 that said Amazon was likely to succeed on a key argument of its challenge, namely ""the merits of its argument that the DOD improperly evaluated"" Microsoft's data storage in one price scenario. She said Amazon is likely to show that Microsoft's scenario was not ""technically feasible"" as the Pentagon assessed.
The opinion did not mention Trump or address Amazon's claims of improper influence. 
The Pentagon had said it would reconsider its evaluation of the technical aspects of the scenario cited by the judge if she sent the contract back to the military for further review. The Pentagon added that would give it the ""opportunity to reconsider the award decision at issue in light of (Amazon's) allegations.""
Amazon did not immediately comment on Friday.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper has rejected that there was bias and said the Pentagon made its choice fairly and freely without external influence.

The Pentagon's inspector general on Wednesday said it could not determine whether the White House influenced the award after senior Defense Department officials asserted a ""presidentialcommunications privilege.""

607,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 07:25PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Norwegian Cruise taps Goldman Sachs to explore stake sale - sources,"By Joshua Franklin and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) -  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd  (N:NCLH) has hired investment bank  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) to explore financing options that could include the sale of a stake in the company, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. 
Norwegian's attempt to bolster is finances comes as cruise operators have been forced to suspend their operations due to the novel coronavirus outbreak. They have been left out of a $2.3 trillion stimulus package that U.S. lawmakers have adopted to support the economy and provide aid to troubled companies.
Among the options Norwegian Cruise is considering is a stake sale known as private investment in public equity (PIPE), the sources said. The company is in talks with several private equity firms about a PIPE deal, the sources added.
The sources, who requested anonymity as the deliberations are confidential, cautioned that no deal is certain. Norwegian Cruise did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. 
Several companies have turned to PIPE deals in recent weeks to bolster their finances, including car e-commerce platform  Carvana  Co (N:CVNA), payment firm  EVO Payments Inc  (O:EVOP), and online real estate broker  Redfin  Corp (O:RDFN). 
Cruise lines have been rushing to bolster their cash coffers through equity and debt offerings following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to outbreaks on several ships. 
Earlier this month, Carnival Corp (N:CCL), the world's largest cruise operator, raised $6.25 billion by issuing new debt and equity to investors, while  Royal Caribbean  Cruises Ltd (N:RCL) clinched a $2.2 billion loan last month.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund disclosed earlier this month that it had amassed an 8.2% stake in Carnival. 
Norwegian Cruise, the world's third-largest cruise operator, has lost almost four-fifths of its market value this year, as it grounded its 28-ship fleet to help contain the spread of the virus.
The Miami-headquartered company, which also operates Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises, disclosed last month it had drawn down on $1.55 billion of new and existing credit lines. As of the end of December, Norwegian Cruise had disclosed long-term debt of close to $6.9 billion. 
""This liquidity is sufficient to cover expected cash needs over the balance of the year, but the cushion will be modest given any further deterioration in earnings,"" credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service Inc analysts wrote about Norwegian Cruise's finances on March 31.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on April 9 extended its ""no sail order"" for all cruise ships for up to 100 days. The cruise industry is currently working on a proposal to submit to the CDC, which will include enhanced sanitization and health safety protocols, according to industry trade group CLIA.

608,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 06:56PM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"By Yasin Ebrahim and Kim Khan
Investing.com - Wall Street ended the week on a high note with the major indexes in the green Friday. The anticipation of economies opening up is helping sentiment.
And while investors are looking for where to put cash to work, there were already some signs this week that many are following an old market friend.
Also this week, leading indicators took on more prominence than maybe ever before. And if you dug deep enough into the Fed’s Beige Book, not everything there was negative.
Here are three things that flew under the radar this week.
1. Fed's Shopping List a Hit 
Earlier this week, President Donald Trump outlined a three-pronged approach to get the wheels of the economy turning once again. And investors appear hungry to put money to work. But as the debate over value versus growth heats up, some on Wall Street are keeping it simple.
""Follow the Fed,"" Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) said earlier this week in a blog post.
""We will follow the Fed and other (developed market) central banks by purchasing what they’re purchasing, and assets that rhyme with those,"" said Rick Rieder, head of BlackRock’s global allocation team.
For years, investors have invested safely in the knowledge that when financial conditions turn ugly, the Fed will turn up to save the day.
Just a few months ago in October, the Fed stepped up purchases of short-term debt to calm overnight lending markets, a move that many believe led to a months-long rally before the pandemic erupted.
Over the past month the Fed has gone on a shopping spree that took its balance sheet above $7 trillion, so far, in a bid to stave off a coronavirus-led economic crisis that some have claimed could rival the deepest and darkest downturns of yesteryear.
A myriad of asset purchases including Treasuries, investment-grade debt, ETFs and junk bonds made the list.
And with the well of Fed stimulus thought to be bottomless, others on Wall Street are also keeping one eye on the central bank's shopping list despite the underlying economy showing recession symptoms, with record jobless claims over the past four weeks.
""Corporate bond spread analysis shows that credit investors are already changing their buying patterns to focus on sectors 'adopted' by the Fed,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said in a note.
Investors ramped up U.S. junk bond purchases to a record $7.66 billion in the week to April 15, according to Refinitiv Lipper.
""You can thank the Fed,"" Greg Zappin, a money manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management, told Bloomberg. ""High-yield spreads have tightened about 300 basis points and the market is open to issuance, so I’m not surprised money is flowing in.""
2. Another Grim Record Number
The Conference Board’s monthly measure of leading economic indicators is usually a barnburner when it comes to moving the market. The Conference Board’s own consumer confidence index gets much more attention, for example.
But with the markets fixated on how bad things could get from a global economic shutdown, the more forward-looking the numbers are the better.
Friday’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) says things are historically bad.
The LEI sank 6.7% to 104.2 in March, compared with a 0.2% drop in February.
“In March, the U.S. LEI registered the largest decline in its 60-year history,” said Ataman Ozyildirim, senior director of economic research at The Conference Board, in a press release.
“The unprecedented and sudden deterioration was broad based, with the largest negative contributions coming from initial claims for unemployment insurance and stock prices,” Ozyildirim said. “The sharp drop in the LEI reflects the sudden halting in business activity as a result of the global pandemic and suggests the U.S. economy will be facing a very deep contraction.”
Thee components the composite index include average manufacturing hours, jobless claims, new orders volume, ISM new orders, capital goods orders, building permits, the S&P 500, M2 money supply, interest rates spread and consumer expectations for business conditions.
3. Small Silver Linings Playbook
While the data remain historically bad across several indicators, there were some anecdotal green shoots across several regions in the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book assessment of the economy out this week.
Boston Fed
“One tourism contact reported that coastal communities that rely on seasonal business are cautiously optimistic about a snap-back in visitors who are driving-distance away soon after advisories are lifted, reflecting pent-up demand from cancellation of planned vacations throughout the spring.”
New York Fed
“Looking ahead, contacts in manufacturing, finance, and professional & business services said they expect staffing levels to hold steady from current levels.”
Philadelphia Fed
“According to several firms with global perspectives, supply chain issues with China have eased, and China is mostly back to work.”
Richmond Fed
“One egg farmer said that (a spike in demand) probably saved many farmers as selling prices had been depressed in recent months.”
Atlanta Fed
“Despite the decline in (manufacturing) activity, some firms suggested that new orders were holding steady or even increasing due to changes in product demand. Supply delivery times were reported to be increasing.”
Chicago Fed
“A contact in southern Wisconsin reported greater demand from restaurants for remodeling work as owners anticipated eventually reopening.”
Dallas Fed
“Wheat demand and prices rose due to increased purchases of breads and pastas during the coronavirus pandemic … in the livestock side, pasture conditions were favorable and prices for cattle ready for feedlots rose because of pandemic-related increased demand for beef.

609,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 06:35PM ET</span>",Pemex slides into junk as Moody's cuts Mexico credit rating,"By Stefanie Eschenbacher
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's on Friday downgraded Mexico's credit rating due to the country's poor economic outlook and cut the debt of state oil firm Pemex to junk status in a serious blow to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
Moody's Investor Service said it had cut Mexico's creditworthiness to ""Baa1"" from ""A3"", and lowered the rating of the heavily indebted, loss-making Pemex to ""Ba2"" from ""Baa3"".
Though Mexico retains an investment-grade rating, Pemex's drop to junk is expected to ramp up financing costs for the firm formally known as Petroleos Mexicanos.
""It's likely that next week we will see strong outflows from Pemex bonds,"" said Luis Gonzali, a portfolio manager at asset manager Franklin Templeton.
""While I believe Moody's was benevolent with the sovereign's rating, it wasn't with Pemex's rating, which, inevitably, now enters the universe of speculative bonds.""
Moody's became the second main ratings agency after Fitch to downgrade Pemex to junk. That is likely to trigger a fire sale of billions of dollars of bonds among investors whose mandates stipulate they must hold assets of investment quality.
Mexico's economy entered a mild recession in 2019 and private sector analysts forecast gross domestic product could shrink by up to 10% this year due to the coronavirus crisis.
Lopez Obrador, a leftist oil nationalist, has staked his reputation on reviving Pemex, which has been a powerful symbol of Mexican self-reliance since its creation in 1938.
But ratings agencies have for the past year criticized the president's plans, which include building an $8 billion oil refinery and taking away incentives for private companies to participate in the energy sector.
In a statement, Moody's said the government's responses under Lopez Obrador had been ""insufficient to effectively address both the country's economic challenges and Pemex's continued financial and operating problems.""
The ratings agency also maintained a negative outlook.

S&P Global Ratings, which uses a different scale and pegs Pemex ratings to the sovereign, in March cut the ratings of both Mexico and Pemex to BBB, keeping both in investment grade.

The airline had not done enough to show it had explored other options to bolster cash before asking for state aid, the newspaper added, citing one person familiar with the matter.  
Virgin Atlantic, which is based in the UK and is 51% owned by Richard Branson's Virgin group and 49% owned by U.S. airline Delta (N:DAL), last month asked the UK government for emergency financial help in addition to the coronavirus package made available to all British companies.
Virgin Atlantic did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.

611,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 05:55PM ET</span>",Cash is king as U.S. quarterly reporting season gains steam,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - As the U.S. quarterly earnings season picks up steam next week, investors will get an early glimpse of how companies are weathering the coronavirus outbreak, including the strength of their balance sheets. 
Reports from major corporations including International Business Machines (N:IBM), Coca-Cola (N:KO) and  Union Pacific  (N:UNP) will reflect the initial effects of the crisis in the United States, and investors will pay close attention to their liquidity and ability to weather a steep economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
With little clarity on when the U.S. economy will reopen, companies of all sizes have been bracing for months of limited revenues.
At least 13 S&P 500 companies have cut or suspended their dividends, while several corporations have slowed capital spending and cut jobs and wages to save money.
Companies have also raced to raise as much credit as possible and preserve liquidity. AT&T (N:T), which reports its results on April 22, recently announced a $5.5 billion term-loan agreement to provide ""financial flexibility"", and last month it shuttered 40% of its stores nationwide as a result of the health crisis.
Major airlines, including JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU), Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) and  Alaska Air  Group Inc (N:ALK), which could report in the coming days, have said they would accept U.S. government aid to help them ride out the sharp drop in travel demand caused by the massive lockdowns. JetBlue and Alaska Air have not announced reporting dates.
The following graphic shows companies slated to report in the week of April 20, along with their cash and short-term investments in recent quarters.

612,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 05:27PM ET</span>",Auto Sales Are Added to U.S. Guidelines on Essential Workers,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. newly deemed vehicle sales an essential service in revised federal guidelines Friday, potentially easing the path for auto retailers to restore more normal business operations.
“Workers critical to the manufacturing, distribution, sales, rental, leasing, repair and maintenance of vehicles and other transportation equipment” are essential, the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said. Electric-vehicle charging stations and supply chains that enable auto operations to help essential workers travel also are included.
The updated guidelines are a win for dealers that lobbied the White House after initial guidelines the agency released in mid March listed vehicle and supply manufacturing, maintenance and repair facilities as essential but didn’t reference vehicle sales or leasing operations. The agencyy added car rental and leasing employees on March 28.

614,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 05:18PM ET</span>",Wall Street’s Bulls Triumph in a Week of Doubt and Dismal Data,"(Bloomberg) -- The dueling forces in this historic period for financial markets pit animal spirits and hope against the coronavirus and its trail of economic destruction. For now, the optimists have the upper hand.
The S&P 500 just posted back-to-back weekly gains for the first time since early February, before either the pandemic or the crash took hold in the U.S. The advance was small by recent standards, but it’s another milestone in 2020’s remarkable markets story.
Prior to this week, risk appetite was boosted by a combination of stimulus measures and early indications the outbreak could be brought under control. This week was all about the latter, and the rising belief that the world’s largest economy may reopen sooner than expected.
Drawing on coverage from across Bloomberg News, this was the week on Wall Street and beyond.
Doubts
Monday 13 April: The long weekend is over for the U.S., although a large chunk of Europe remains shut -- including London. That can make the moves fickle and market signals untrustworthy because a lot of the usual participants aren’t operating.
A day of doubt then, and that’s how it plays out. The benchmark for American shares, the S&P 500 Index, just notched the best week in more than four decades. That’s a good thing for most investors, but they are also aware that after major market quakes there are often big aftershocks -- in either direction.
The confused picture surrounding the virus and its economic legacy aren’t helping. The number of infections and deaths keep growing, but at a slower rate in many large nations -- a sign the extreme containment measures are helping to control the outbreak. Yet the toll keeps climbing, and the ramifications for trade, industry and society at large are becoming ever clearer.
One of the big pillars of support has been central bank action. Today the Federal Reserve announces it will dial back operations in the market for repurchase agreements following signs the upheaval in dollar funding has eased. Repo rates are in check and other benchmarks such as the London interbank offered rate are returning to less stressed levels.
Crisis averted? That depends on your perspective. The size of the central bank’s funding operations remain far larger than before the virus hit. Meanwhile, a flood of new T-bills threatens more pressure, helping push the bid-ask spread on the benchmark rate for overnight lending backed by Treasuries higher today.
There remains plenty to worry about. President Donald Trump is at loggerheads with state governors over who has the authority to reopen the country, while Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari reckons the nation may face 18 months of rolling shutdowns.
Internationally, France extends its own lockdown as the global infection count pushes toward 2 million. Even a historic deal to end the oil price war is a footnote to the demand collapse caused by the pandemic -- when trading for the week began in Asia crude’s surge was brief, and it will end lower today.
“The real question we don’t have an answer to at this point is what does the world actually looks like in 12 months,” says Charlie Diebel, head of fixed income at Mediolanum International Funds Ltd. “If you can figure that out, that’s going to be the real rain maker in terms of making your investors money. At the moment, there are just too many cross currents.”
Looming over it all is the quarterly earnings season. It begins in earnest tomorrow, starting as always with the big Wall Street banks. Lenders are a hotspot in this crisis, squeezed on three sides by falling interest rates, rising credit demand and in all likelihood a surge in defaults.
Read more: A Daredevil’s Guide to a Very Wild Earnings Season
With all that potentially captured in the forward-looking comments -- if not yet the financial ones -- banks are among the big stock losers. In a rare occurrence, the S&P 500 finishes down more than 1% while the Nasdaq 100 -- a tech gauge dominated by the likes of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). -- ends up by a similar amount.
The classic haven assets look as uncertain as everything else -- gold and the yen finish higher while Treasuries fall.
Results
Tuesday 14 April: Earnings season arrives. Usually it’s both a quantitative and qualitative affair, where the figures are measured against the expectations of Wall Street’s army of analysts while the forward-looking statements are parsed for new opportunities or threats.
This time will be different. The economic hit from the virus has been so swift and brutal that most estimates are meaningless, and to some extent the backward-looking results are, too. Essentially, the market will have to price shares of each company with a lot less concrete information than usual.
That means the macro picture is more important, and at first blush it’s not good. The International Monetary Fund predicts the “Great Lockdown” recession will be the steepest in almost a century and economists are ramping up their expectations for job losses. In the U.S., even the worst-case scenarios start to look realistic. On the virus itself, the New York City death toll crosses 10,000. U.K. fatalities rise again.
So it’s a gloomy backdrop as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. results land. Shares of both slump as profits take a big hit from loan loss provisions. The lenders, like everyone else, are bracing for tough times ahead.
Read more: JPMorgan, Wells Fargo Offer Reality Check on Profit Outlook
All doom and gloom then? Not quite. Johnson & Johnson, the world’s largest health-care conglomerate, surges after posting stronger sales and boosting its quarterly dividend. A report says President Donald Trump will make some “important announcements” in the next few days regarding states reopening their economies. Leaders across Europe weigh steps to exit quarantines as Spain, Germany and Italy all report fewer infections.
The bottom line is the IMF is telling investors nothing they haven’t already figured out for themselves. These other things are new and promising, and the S&P 500 closes at a one-month high.
The note of caution is in the havens, where this time gold, Treasuries and the yen all climb together. The yellow metal is now loitering near a seven-year high.
“It seems that equity investors are shrugging off the U.S. wall of unemployment which we are about to hit,” says Gregory Perdon, CIO at Arbuthnot Latham Co & Ltd. “And that doesn’t seem like a prudent strategy.”
Reality Check
Wednesday 15 April: This rally has been built on stimulus, a flattening virus curve and fear of missing the bottom. All of that is about expectations of a rebound in the economy, so the bad data can be endured because it is seen as temporary.
The question is how bad can data get and still be endured, and for how long? Today may provide an answer.
With the price war now over, oil is a more useful barometer of global economic health. After three days falling, crude is steady for much of the Asian trading day. But the International Energy Agency is about to change all that.
The plunge in demand for oil this year will be a record, the agency says in its monthly report, and April will be the worst of it. Before 2020 is done, a decade of demand growth will be wiped out. Productions cuts won’t even prevent a potential exhaustion of storage facilities by the middle of the year.
This is the economic face of the coronavirus: a collapse in consumption on a scale never seen before. Oil, already at low levels, tanks. Futures in New York will close below $20 per barrel for the first time since 2002. It takes the currencies of commodity producers with it, and energy shares, too. And they take the Stoxx Europe 600 Index in their turn. The benchmark equity gauge slumps the most in more than two weeks.
“Markets are back into consolidation mode,” Simon Ballard, chief economist at First Abu Dhabi Bank, writes in a note. “It is increasingly apparent that the long-term economic impact of COVID-19 could be far more severe than many are currently assuming.”
Then more big bank earnings. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). slide in pre-market trading after following rivals in setting aside billions of dollars for loans likely to sour. In the mounting gloom the dollar is benefiting, and its gain adds pressure to other assets.
This all unfolds before 8:30 a.m. Eastern time, when U.S. retail sales data for March hits the tape alongside New York state manufacturing data. It’s the biggest decline in records dating back to 1992 for the former, and the largest drop since just after World War II for the latter. Worst still are the indications for April -- surveys show this will actually get worse. It is inevitable that homebuilder data 90 minutes later is abysmal.

The writing is on the wall even before global confirmed coronavirus cases top 2 million, New Jersey fatalities pass 3,000, France’s death count jumps by the most yet and Germany extends its lockdown.
Risk appetite can’t possibly survive the onslaught. All the major industry groups drop as the S&P 500 has its worst day in two weeks. The dollar surges. Treasuries jump, sending the yield on 10-year U.S. notes down by the most since late March. The benchmark American stock gauge is now at the lowest level versus bonds since 1983.
Whiplash
Thursday 16 April: In the past four sessions U.S. stocks have alternated between higher and lower closes, and it’s anyone’s guess where they will go today. Future’s are up after yesterday’s slump, but the weekly jobless claims await, not to mention more earnings.
It will be a messy, confused day on just about every level.
In earnings, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). says there were net outflows from its long-term investment products for the first time in five years, but adjusted first-quarter earnings per share and revenue both beat expectations.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) posts a 24% jump in trading revenue, while casting doubt on whether those gains can continue.
Read more: Bank CEOs Warn of Unprecedented Economic Slump, Job Losses
On the economic front, unemployment claims are truly awful, but expectations were so bad that somehow it was a beat. More than 5 million Americans filed for jobless benefits last week, bringing the total in the month since the coronavirus pandemic throttled the U.S. economy to 22 million.
That effectively erases a decade worth of job creation -- and yet S&P 500 futures actually rise after the release while Treasuries and the dollar pare a gain.
What is happening? Once again, all this was anticipated. Investors are looking past the predictable bad news to the potential good. Trump has said he will unveil guidelines today to relax stay-at-home rules, which is a potential game changer for the markets. The economy is in dire straits, and the longer it is shut down the less likely a rapid rebound becomes.
Caught between these hopes and a slew of downbeat headlines -- the small business relief fund running out of cash, New York extending its lockdown, the U.K. doing the same -- the S&P 500 ping pongs between gains and losses all day.
In the end, with Trump due to deliver his guidelines at 6 p.m. and having already told some state governors they’ll be able to reopen businesses before May 1, stocks close in the green. The Nasdaq 100 wipes out its decline for 2020. Futures trading after the regular session get an extra boost from a report virus patients treated with  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD).’s drug showed improvement and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.’s plans to restart some manufacturing.
The old saying on Wall Street is that stocks are not the economy. But increasingly there are fears that the split between them has gone too far.
“Given unemployment spikes, ageing demographics, and confidence scarring, it is risky to assume that fiscal and monetary policy will have such traction so as to return the real economy to pre-COVID times,”  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets Inc. economists including Catherine Mann write in a note. “Markets are inordinately sanguine.”
Read more: Wall Street’s Bulls Drive Epic Market Split From Grim Reality
Bloomberg’s most-read stories of the day tell the tale: Stories about reopening the economy and market moves are in the top three. The jobless claims barely make it into the top 10.
Clinging On
Friday 17 April: Investors are hungry for good news. The president’s much heralded guidelines to reopen the economy have essentially shoved the tough decisions to state governors. Gilead’s drug successes are promising but a long way from being conclusive. Yet Friday is risk-on -- at one point it looks like S&P 500 futures could hit their upper trading curbs.
There are other rays of light for those looking for them. Procter & Gamble Co. says organic sales rose 6% as the coronavirus pandemic prompted panic-buying of household staples. Credit markets are in rude enough health that Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co., recently relegated to junk status, is selling new debt.
One place where there is no good news to be found, no matter how hard an investor looks, is the oil market. West Texas crude slumps again, at one point dipping below $18 per barrel. There’s no single trigger, just the last miserable day of a miserable week. Data showing that the economy in China, the world’s second largest, contracted for the first time in decades won’t have helped.
It is this kind of bad news that remains easiest to find. China also said its revising up its virus death toll. Spain records the most new infections in a week, Russia reports another record jump and cases in Singapore are soaring.
In the U.S., more and more homeowners aren’t paying their mortgages. A wave of distress is emerging in the municipal bond market.  Shake Shack Inc  (NYSE:SHAK). thinks it might break debt covenants this quarter, just one of countless companies in crisis. The Fed eases off on Treasury purchases -- a good sign for market stability but not great for stimulus fans.
The S&P 500 is undaunted, rising 2.7%, its best Friday in a month. A last piece of good news for investors to take into the weekend: the first back-to-back weeks of green since this madness began.

615,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 04:15PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Hitches Ride With Energy to First 2-Week Gain Since February,"By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com – Wall Street ended Friday on the front foot, wrapping up a second-straight weekly gain for the firrst time since February amid signs of light at the end of the Covid-19 tunnel.
The Dow rose 2.99%, or 705 points, notching its first two-week gain since Feb. 9. The S&P 500 gained 2.68% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.38%.
Unveiling guidelines to restart the economy in three phases, President Donald Trump declared opening up America was the next phase of the battle against the novel coronavirus, which has infected nearly 700,000 and killed about 36,000 nationwide.
As many as 29 states potentially ""will be able to open relatively soon,"" Trump said.
Against the backdrop of expectations for the economy to open sooner rather than later, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said he believes all stores in Texas should be able to operate beginning next Friday, April 24.
In New York, the epicenter of the outbreak, Governor Andrew Cuomo appears eager to get the economic wheels turning again, but has expressed caution and suggested a staggered reopening could be the best way forward.
“It’s going to be incremental, and we have to be smart as we do this,” Cuomo said as the rate of Covid-19-related hospitalizations across the state continued to decline.
""The situation we’re in right now is unstable. People can’t stay in their homes for this length of time. They can’t stay out of work. You can’t keep the economy closed forever. You just can’t. Society can’t handle it,"" he added.
Hopes for an economic restart were given a much-needed boost as Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ:GILD) experimental drug remdesivir has reportedly triggered ""rapid recoveries"" in coronavirus patients, according to researchers from University of Chicago Medicine.

621,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 02:25PM ET</span>",Argentine bonds pushed higher by external factors but debt plan gets panned,"By Hugh Bronstein and Walter Bianchi
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine bonds were pushed higher by external market factors on Friday, despite a credit ratings downgrade by Fitch while Wall Street panned the government's bond restructuring proposal for its lack of detail and tight 20-day negotiating window.
The country's over-the-counter bonds rose an average 5.7% while country risk <11EMJ> fell 496 basis points to 3,490 over safe-haven U.S. Treasuries. The rally reflected improving global sentiment - punctuated by a massive pop in U.S. equities - as bondholders analyzed the government's long-awaited sovereign bond restructuring plan outlined on Thursday.
Fitch Ratings downgraded Argentina's long-term foreign currency bonds to C from CC, warning of an ""imminent"" default if bondholders reject the government's restructuring terms.
Economy Minister Martin Guzman laid out the framework of the bond revamp on Thursday. He gave creditors three weeks to mull his proposal for $41.5 billion in debt relief, mostly in the form of reduced interest payments, as the country grapples with a recession compounded by the coronavirus outbreak.
""Minister Guzman himself says that he hasn't reached an agreement with bondholders and yet imposes an aggressive 20-day deadline,"" said Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America fixed income strategy at Amherst Pierpont Securities in New York.
""There is no urgency to accept the first offer when there are no prospects for any payments anytime soon,"" she said in a note to clients.
Not all market reaction was negative. Gabriel Zelpo, director of Buenos Aires economic consultancy Seido, called the proposal ""better than what markets were pricing in.""
""Bondholders were afraid of something radical, like no coupon payments or high capital haircuts,"" he said.
The proposal includes a sizable cut to interest payments, amounting to a saving of around $37.9 billion, or 62% of the current total. The average proposed new rate would be 2.33%.
There would be a smaller capital cut of around $3.6 billion, or 5.4% of the total debt stock, Guzman said. 
Argentine gross domestic product (GDP), already anemic before the pandemic hit, has plummeted since the country went on lockdown to slow the spread of the virus on March 20.
""Their economic situation has deteriorated and it is not conducive to making generous offers, but I think their capacity for debt servicing is higher than what this offer reflects,"" said one Argentine bondholder, who asked not to be named.
Fitch said in a statement that it ""expects payment default on upcoming bond payments could be imminent should an agreement with bondholders not be reached in the coming weeks.""

Investing.com – The Dow rallied Thursday and remained on track for its first two-week winning streak since February, led by a surge in energy as investor sentiment was boosted by optimism over a potential coronavirus treatment and hopes the economy could reopen fairly soon.
The Dow rose 1.97%, or 462 points, the S&P 500 gained 1.79% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.58%.
President Donald Trump unveiled three-stage guidelines for states to lift lockdown measures and open for business, easing some investor fears the U.S. is set for a prolonged recession.
As many as 29 states potentially “will be able to open relatively soon,” Trump said, even as state governors stressed they would plot their own path as to when and how quickly to reopen.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who has warned that reopening too quickly may risk a fresh wave of infections, suggested a staggered reopening in the state is the way to go.
“It’s going to be incremental, and we have to be smart as we do this,” Cuomo said as the rate of Covid-19-related hospitalizations across the state continued to decline.
""The situation we’re in right now is unstable. People can’t stay in their homes for this length of time. They can’t stay out of work. You can’t keep the economy closed forever. You just can’t. Society can’t handle it,"" he added.
In the race to produce a coronavirus treatment, the University of Chicago Medicine researchers reportedly said they saw ""rapid recoveries"" in coronavirus patients taking Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ:GILD) experimental drug remdesivir.
The upswing in investor sentiment was most prevalent across energy stocks, which led the broader market rally despite a fall in oil amid ongoing concerns about a slump in demand.
Financials, which have been battered this week among weak earnings from major Wall Street banks, rose 4.7% thanks to a strong showing from regional banks, with Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG) up 16% and Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) up 12%.
Boeing (NYSE:BA), meanwhile, jumped 13% pushing the broader industrials higher after the aircraft maker said it would resume commercial airplane production at its Puget Sound-region facilities in Washington state next week."

River State's capital Port Harcourt is the hub of the oil industry in Africa's biggest producer of crude.
""Security agencies arrested 22 staff of Exxon Mobil who came into the state from neighbouring Akwa Ibom State in violation of the extant executive order restricting movement into the state,"" Governor Nyesom Wike said. ""We do not know the coronavirus status of these individuals.""
Wike said the workers were quarantined in line with relevant health protocols and will be charged in court. The state has recorded two cases of coronavirus so far.
Exxon Mobil said in a statement it was working with the Rivers State government to resolve the matter.
An oil workers union said Exxon staff coming into Port Harcourt on essential duty had been arrested and quarantined. It demanded the establishment of testing centres in Port Harcourt so oil workers going to rigs could be tested, rather than being held in quarantine for two weeks first.
On Monday, Nigeria extended lockdowns in Lagos, Abuja and Ogun State for an additional 14 days to combat the virus. The West African country has closed its air and land borders and imposed curbs on cargo vessels allowed to dock at its ports.
The number of cases has been rising in Nigeria, with 442 cases so far and 13 deaths. 

Nigeria's petroleum regulator has ordered oil and gas companies to reduce their offshore workforce and move to 28-day staff rotations instead of the usual 14 days as part of measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

627,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 12:50PM ET</span>",Motor maker Weg emerges as battered Brazil stock market's champion,"By Paula Laier
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - In a bleak year that has seen Brazil's Bovespa (BVSP) slump to the worst performance of any major world stock market amid a coronavirus-linked retreat from risk, electric motor maker Weg SA (SA:WEGE3) has been the index's improbable champion.
Traded on the Brazilian stock exchange for nearly a half century and part of the benchmark index as of 2016, Weg shares have risen over 10% so far in 2020, recovering from steep losses in March. The Bovespa has lost a third of its value in the same period and nearly half in dollar terms.
Weg, which makes everything from wind turbines to automotive paint, is one of just two Bovespa components to eke out gains this year. The runner up is e-commerce firm B2W Companhia Digital (SA:BTOW3), whose shares are up 2.91% amid a boom in internet orders during the crisis. 
Weg's resilience in midst of the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing economic downturn may reflect its ample exposure to countries beyond Brazil's commodities-linked economy, including China. 
""It deserves it,"" said Werner Roger, founding partner at asset management firm Trígono Capital. ""Weg is a leading company and is present in several countries, with more than half of its revenue coming from abroad,"" he said, citing growth that has been sustainable organically and also lifted by acquisitions, as well as good governance.
In 2019, Weg's net income rose 21% to 1.6 billion reais ($306.75 million) as revenue and margins improved in all markets. 
The electric motor maker, which had a net cash position of 1.28 billion reais in December, is expected to report its first-quarter results on April 29. 
Despite its strong cash position and a limited debt load, analyst Lucas Marquiori at investment bank BTG Pactual said Weg's operating margin could be impacted by global output stoppages caused by the pandemic.
The company temporarily cut its factory workforce in the southern Brazilian state of Santa Catarina in March while noting that it had kept its four Chinese factories running since Feb. 11.
But analysts Victor Beyruti Guglielmi and Alejandro Ortiz, at brokerage Guide Investimentos, noted that Weg decided to not cut capital expenditures even during the crisis, which he said could give it a competitive advantage compared to its local peers.

A weaker Brazilian currency this year should also benefit Weg since much of its business is export-based, according to market participants.

628,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>",Traders Face $400 Billion Headache as Libor Angst Hits Crossroad,"(Bloomberg) -- The unprecedented uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve measures to ease dollar funding stresses and the impact on Libor is creating an insatiable appetite for short-term interest rate options.
Open interest -- or the amount of new risk -- has topped 400,000 futures contracts in May 2020 eurodollars worth $400 billion. Thursday’s volumes topped 125,000, third most for the May 2020 contract and matched with rising open interest, yet there is no sign of positions being pared.
Uncertainty revolves around expectations for the path of FRA/OIS, the traded version of Libor and an essential tool for pricing eurodollar futures. That spread has narrowed to around 40 basis points, from near 60 at the start of the month.
One factor on which a further tightening of the spread is hinged upon is a return to liquidity in the commercial paper market. The spread there between 90-day AA non-financial paper and 3-month OIS remains elevated, representing a key outlier in the funding markets which the Fed has yet to fix. The central bank this week launched a commercial paper funding facility to ease liquidity constraint in this market. The vehicle purchased just $974 million of securities in the first week of its operation, according to data released Thursday.
Closely attached to the commercial-paper market, the current Libor/OIS spread tightened to 103 basis points Thursday as 3-month Libor rate resumed its recent decline.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG analyst Zoltan Pozsar in a April 15 note forecast Libor/OIS spread narrowing to 75bp by the end of April, now an equivalent of near 3 basis point drop a day over the nine remaining sessions. With May 2020 eurodollar futures -- due to roll off May 18 -- trading the equivalent of OIS +57bp, there shows an expectation that the Fed’s commercial paper fix may have a positive effect on driving down FRA- and Libor/OIS spreads toward Credit Suisse’s forecast. Option trades for an extending tightening in those spreads emerged Wednesday.
Another issue. The May 2020 futures expiration incorporates the April 29 FOMC meeting, when the committee is widely expected to raise the interest on excess reserves. The OIS curve is pricing in an 8bp Fed effective rate vs. 5bp currently, indicating a 3bp “tweak” higher. Should the move be more or less, this would also impact where the May 2020 eurodollar contract settles.
Lastly, an expected influx of Treasury bill supply stands to effect both expectation for the Libor-OIS path and the potential for an IOER tweak at the April Fed meeting. In terms of Libor-OIS, the expected avalanche of bills stands to push short-term rates wider, acting as a potential floor for Libor-OIS tightening and eliminating the need for an IOER hike.
“There is some sense in waiting to see how the ongoing flood of bill supply is going to impact the front-end rate complex before trying to push EFFR higher,” NatWest Markets strategist Blake Gwinn said in April 16 note.

630,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 12:05PM ET</span>","U.S. airlines sitting on $10 billion owed to consumers for canceled flights, lawmakers say","By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) - U.S. airlines are estimated to be sitting on more than $10 billion in travel vouchers that should have been cash refunds from canceled flights, a group of senators released on Friday. 
Many U.S. airlines are cancelling between 60% and 80% of their flights, and under federal law passengers on those flights are entitled to full refunds, Senators Ed Markey, Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal said in a statement.
""However, many airlines have been obfuscating this right by offering travel vouchers as the default option, requiring passengers to take burdensome steps to request refunds instead,"" they said.
The Democratic senators had asked  Alaska Air  Group Inc (N:ALK), Allegiant Air, American Airlines (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL), Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines (O:HA), JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU), Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV),  Spirit Airlines  Inc (N:SAVE), Sun Country Airlines, and United Airlines (O:UAL) to each provide details on their refund policies during the pandemic.
In the airline replies, which were reviewed by Reuters, most did not share the total value of the travel vouchers and credits they have issued during the pandemic.
But JetBlue, which has 5.5% of the domestic market share, said it issued over $20 million per day of travel credits to consumers in the first few weeks of March.
""Assuming a similar trend throughout the industry over the last month, this figure could mean that the airlines are sitting on more than $10 billion in customer cash,"" the lawmakers said, while inviting airlines to provide more information if they dispute the figure. 
According to their findings, airlines are offering cash refunds when the company itself cancels a flight, as required by the U.S. Transportation Department, but only Allegiant and Spirit are offering refunds to passengers who voluntarily cancel their own tickets.
""None of the biggest carriers with the most revenue, including United, American, Delta, and Southwest, offer similar refunds,"" it said.
In their replies the airlines generally said their policies are consistent with DOT guidelines.
Sun Country, a Minnesota-based ultra low-cost carrier, said refunding all of its non-refundable tickets outside of DOT guidelines ""would put the company's future at risk.""
Among replies by larger carriers, Delta said it had processed over 1 million refunds totaling more than $500 million in March, for passengers that had requested a cash refund for flights that Delta canceled or changed.
American Airlines said in its reply that over 90% of the customers who were offered a refund for flights the company itself canceled chose that option over a travel voucher.
If passengers do not specifically request a refund, they are issued a travel voucher. While many airlines have made the vouchers valid for up to two years, some airlines' vouchers expire within one year.
U.S. airlines are set to soon receive $25 billion in government payroll aid, much of it in the form of free cash, and can also apply for another $25 billion in government loans to help them weather the coronavirus downturn. 
""The airline industry received its $50 billion taxpayer bailout, so the least it can do is offer full refunds--without forcing customers to jump through hoops. All passengers deserve a full cash refund during this unprecedented time,"" said Consumer Reports aviation adviser William McGee in a statement.
The nonprofit organization, which said it has heard from thousands of affected passengers, launched a petition https://action.consumerreports.org/20200420_finance_airlinerefundpetition?EXTKEY=PA204MP on Friday for airlines to refund money to all travelers who had their flights impacted by the coronavirus crisis.
Two weeks ago, the Transportation Department reminded airlines that they are obligated to refund tickets when they cancel a flight or make a significant flight schedule change that passengers opt not to accept, but did not take any immediate action against airlines.

The department said given the massive crisis it ""will exercise its prosecutorial discretion and provide carriers an opportunity to become compliant before taking further action.”

Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 1.6% to $282.13 on Friday morning, bucking a 1.5% rise for the benchmark S&P 500.
The Goldman analysts also lowered their price target for the stock by 7% to $233 in its report forecasting the drop in iPhone demand for the quarter ending in June, Apple's fiscal third quarter. 
The brokerage noted that average selling prices for consumer devices are likely to decline during a recession and remain weak well beyond the point when units recover.
""We do not assume that this downturn results in Apple losing users from its installed base. We simply assume that existing users will keep devices longer and choose less expensive Apple options when they do buy a new device,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note.
Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, which holds Apple shares, said he expects a significant drop in iPhone sales, but 36% seemed ""extreme.""
“I view some of that as deferred demand...I think some of that will come back in succeeding quarters,” Tuz said.
A Goldman ""sell"" rating is relatively rare. Of the stocks in the investment bank's global equity coverage universe, 15% have sell ratings, compared with 46% ""buy"" and 39% ""hold.""
Of the 40 analysts covering Apple shares, 30 have ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" ratings, seven have ""hold"" ratings, and three have ""sell"", according to Refinitiv.
Earlier this week, Apple released a smaller iPhone priced at $399, lowering the starting price for the company's smartphone line to broaden its appeal among budget-conscious customers.
Goldman said it does not expect the company to launch the upcoming iPhone models until early November, as limited global travel could impede Apple's final engineering and production process.

Since the S&P 500 hit an all-time high on Feb. 19, Apple shares are down about 13% against a 16% decline for the overall index.

632,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 11:51AM ET</span>","Airbus furloughs 3,000 French aerospace workers","By Johanna Decorse
TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) will furlough some 3,000 French aerospace workers by tapping a government-backed scheme for four weeks starting from Monday, the planemaker said on Friday, in its latest effort to cope with the coronavirus crisis.
The company said the measures would apply to those unable to work because their workstations ""cannot be fully secured"" in line with health measures imposed during a country-wide lockdown in force since March 17.
Confirming a Reuters report, the company said some 3,000 workers would be affected at factories in Toulouse, Nantes and Saint-Nazaire.
The CGT union said this represented 20% of the Airbus workforce in France. It employs 130,000 people worldwide.
Airbus has announced plans to cut jetliner production by at least a third after demand for air travel collapsed and most airlines found themselves unable to take delivery of aircraft.
Airbus said the furlough or ""partial activity"" scheme may be extended beyond a planned May 17 end-date if needed to address an unprecedented downturn and recently lowered production rates.
The ""partial activity"" or ""partial unemployment"" scheme, which is widely available to companies in France, allows firms to reduce working hours and provide workers with partial compensation that can be recovered from the government. 
Unions backed the scheme which sources said would allow employees to receive some 92% of their usual salary during the furlough.

""Since the beginning of the confinement, we have been asking management to apply the ... scheme,"" said CGT union official Xavier Petrachi. ""It is an essential measure to protect employees and save jobs.""

633,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",EY whistleblower awarded $11 million after suppression of gold audit,"By Huw Jones and Peter Hobson
LONDON (Reuters) - A British court awarded $11 million in damages and expenses on Friday to a former partner at global accounting firm Ernst & Young who exposed money laundering at a major gold refinery in the United Arab Emirates.
Amjad Rihan claimed he was pushed out of EY after raising concerns about irregularities at precious metals dealer and refiner Kaloti in 2013, according to a ruling from High Court judge Timothy Kerr.
He ruled that EY had helped cover up results of an audit led by Rihan of Kaloti's business practices, including that it paid billions of dollars in cash for gold without adequately checking its origin and bought gold bars from Morocco coated in silver to avoid export restrictions. 
Rihan resigned from EY in 2014 and leaked his findings to the media, sending shockwaves through an industry under increasing pressure to refuse gold used to finance organised crime, conflict and human rights abuses.
Kaloti, which was the UAE's largest gold refiner in 2013, could not immediately be reached for comment. It has previously denied wrongdoing.
EY, one of the world's ""Big Four"" accounting firms, said it was surprised and disappointed by the ruling.
""We will appeal and, therefore, not comment in detail,"" EY said in a statement. ""It was the work of an EY Dubai assurance team that uncovered serious irregularities and reported them to the proper authorities.""
""Their work ultimately resulted in sanctions against the refiner and contributed to significant changes in the sourcing of precious metals and the regulation of refiners in Dubai.""
Kaloti remained accredited by UAE authorities until 2015, when a different auditor found it was buying gold from Sudan, which was then under U.S. sanctions. 
A Reuters investigation last year found that the United Arab Emirates is the destination for billions of dollars' worth of gold smuggled from across Africa.
In his claim, Rihan said he had struggled to find work after being driven out of EY. Kerr awarded him $10.8 million in damages and 117,960 pounds ($147,000) in expenses.
""The EY organisation was supposed to have a written whistleblowing policy, though I have no evidence that it had one,"" Kerr said in his 133-page ruling.

""It is generally known to professional persons such as accountants that to become a whistleblower often involves a major risk of financial loss through subsequent 'unemployability',"" Kerr said.

634,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 11:36AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Higher on Reopening Hopes,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened sharply higher on Friday before retracing some of their gains, as hopes for a medical breakthrough to beat the Covid-19 virus combined with further signs of economic life restarting to lift spirits ahead of the weekend.
By 11:30 AM ET (1530 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 345 points, or 1.5%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.6% and the Nasdaq 100 was up 0.9%.
The DJIA was lifted by news that index heavyweight Boeing (NYSE:BA) aims to partially restart production at its Washington state plant from Monday. The Nasdaq was supported by an 7.7% rise in Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) stock, after leaked video footage of biologists discussing apparently favorable tests of its experimental drug remdesivir encouraged hopes that it could be used to treat Covid-19.
Gilead itself said that ""Anecdotal reports, while encouraging, do not provide the statistical power necessary to determine the safety and efficacy profile of remdesivir as a treatment for Covid-19.” The stock pared early gains of over 10%.
The market continues to look through a strong of economic indicators and company reports that are principally historical, preferring to concentrate on evidence that the virus is peaking or has passed its peak in certain countries and regions.
""In a crisis there are only lagging indicators,"" said Barings strategist Christopher Smart in emailed comments, ""so the economic data will be bad at least for the next few weeks.""
""Quarterly reports will also be bad, but when Presidents, Prime Ministers, Governors and Mayors begin to plan a return to life after the Great Lockdown, markets will begin to judge where the damage has been greatest and where the recovery could come soonest.""
Among the biggest movers in early trading were AMC Entertainment, which surged over 50% after saying it had enough cash to last it through July. By that time, the world's largest chain of movie theaters should be up and running again: under President Trump's new three-stage guidelines, theaters will be among the first businesses allowed to open – albeit social distancing will force them to do so at much-reduced capacity.
Elsewhere, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) stock rose 5.9% after the oilfield services company said it would continue to pay 25% of its dividend instead of suspending it entirely, as feared. The company stiill posted a net loss of $7.4 billion after registering over $8 billion of impairments, as oil and gas companies across the world slash their capital spending in the low-price environment.
 State Street  (NYSE:STT) stock rose 0.6% after it handily beat expectations for earnings and revenue in the first quarter thanks to the spike in market volatility that led to much higher levels of client activity."
635,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 11:15AM ET</span>",P&G sees best U.S. sales in decades as shoppers stock up,"By Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) beat Wall Street expectations for quarterly profit on Friday as it reported its best U.S. sales growth in decades thanks to consumers stockpiling cleaning essentials in lockdowns against the coronavirus.
Laying out details of a huge surge in demand for hand soaps, Tide antibacterial spray and other detergents, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said U.S. consumers stuck in their homes were doing more laundry and washing their dishes more often. 
Organic sales in the United States grew 10% in the company's third quarter to the end of March and global net sales rose about 5% to $17.21 billion. 
""We're seeing as much as a 20% increase in consumption across categories,"" Moeller told a call with analysts. 
One of the world's biggest producers of consumer goods, P&G's results come at a time of booming demand, and profound stress, for grocers and their supply chains. 
Supermarkets like Kroger (NYSE:KR), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) or Europe's  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) have seen a surge in sales in the month of March, but have also had to introduce limits on the number of items per customer or special hours for senior citizens. 
P&G said that while everyday essentials have been in demand, sales of beauty and grooming products have dwindled as people stay indoors.
Sales at units that make well-known brands such as Bounty paper towels, Tampax tampons, Charmin toilet paper, and Pampers diapers all rose between 6% and 8%.
The net sales figures were slightly below analysts' expectations of $17.46 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding one-time items, however, P&G earned $1.17 per share, beating estimates by 4 cents.
""We were expecting more variations in results and guidance due to global coronavirus uncertainty. Instead, P&G seems to be benefiting from the solid, and often predictable, demand of household necessities,"" Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said. 
At a time when many companies are refusing to forecast results for the rest of the year in the face of an oncoming recession, the company cut its full-year sales growth target to 3%-4% from its prior forecast of 4%-5%. 
It said that allowed for currency fluctuation; the dollar, whose strength weakens the value of P&G's foreign sales, rose sharply in the second half of March as investors sought the security of the U.S. currency in a brutal global market selloff. 

Boylan said when the crisis ends, slower sales in pantry-stocking items would be offset by higher sales in beauty and grooming categories.

637,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 10:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: IKEA aims to start reopening stores in Europe in May,"By Anna Ringstrom
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - IKEA store owner Ingka Group, the world's biggest furniture retailer, aims to start reopening shops in Europe in May after closures and sliding demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic slashed group sales by 60%, its chief executive said.
Most of Ingka's stores in main market Europe and all in North America are closed since March while in Asia almost all are open.
Ingka CEO Jesper Brodin estimates that the closure period for each store will be up to eight weeks. ""This is the period we need to persevere and, so to speak, survive,"" he said. ""The sales drop in the period we're in is about 60%."" 
He said online sales during the COVID-19 crisis were twice as high as a year ago, cushioning the overall revenue dive and accounting currently for roughly half the group total. 
""Some countries are close to ten times the e-commerce they had before the outbreak. The most extreme is Denmark where sales have now recovered to levels seen before stores closed.""
BABY BOOM
The lockdowns and other measures that have resulted in many people staying at home have boosted overall sales of office furniture, laundry baskets, and kitchen and cooking equipment such as pots, pans and jars, he said. In home market Sweden, sales of entire kitchens are up.
Ingka plans to increase stocks of its baby-related products, expecting a boom in demand in seven to eight months. ""Crises back in time have resulted in baby booms,"" Brodin said. 
He said demand was up for items in the lower end of IKEA's price range. Expecting that trend to continue given the pandemic's blow to the global economy, the group will cut prices on several products in the coming year, and also work on growing that range. 
""Tendencies are similar to what we saw after (the financial crisis in) 2008 - that people have less money,"" he said. 
Given the acceleration in the online business, Brodin also wants to speed up Ingka's expansion in inner cities with showrooms and stores that are smaller than the iconic giant out-of-town IKEA stores, he said.
At the start of Ingka's next fiscal year in September, Brodin reckons group sales will have recovered to around 90% of year-earlier levels, adding: ""We expect next year to be tougher for us, without any doubt.""
In China, where Ingka reopened all but one store in March, sales are back to year-ago levels already, Brodin said. The store in Wuhan, where the new coronavirus first appeared, will reopen in a couple of weeks.
Ingka, the main IKEA franchisee to brand owner Inter IKEA, operates 420 stores and showrooms globally. It has not yet set a timetable for the reopening of stores in North America.

Its sales in the year through August 2019 totalled 36.7 billion euros ($39.7 bln). Online accounted for 11%.

There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for the coronavirus, which has infected 2.14 million globally, according to a Reuters tally, and remdesivir is one of the treatments that has captured investor's attention.
But analysts and the company urged caution on drawing conclusions from the report by medical news website Stat that also helped buoy the broader markets. 
Gilead said the totality of the data from the trial needed to be analyzed, and expects to report results from a study in severe COVID-19 patients at the end of the month, and data from other trials in May. 
The report said the University of Chicago Medicine Hospital was seeing rapid recoveries in fever and respiratory symptoms in patients with severe COVID-19 in a trial of the drug it was participating.
""While the article paints a pretty picture, we think the ensuing exuberance shows a lack of critical analysis,"" said Baird analyst Brian Skorney. 
Skorney added investors looking for a definitive conclusion when the severe study reads out will likely be disappointed as the study offers no control, ""just five days of remdesivir vs. 10 days of remdesivir.""
Wall Street rose on Friday, boosted by President Donald Trump's new guidelines to reopen the economy and Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s plans to resume production.
""There will no doubt be cautionary announcements by various scientific bodies about the validity of a partial set of results from a tiny trial,"" said Jeffrey Halley, a markets analyst at OANDA. 

""Markets, though, will likely do their very best to ignore those, preferring to concentrate on ... a potential treatment for COVID-19 symptoms.""

The $870 million DoubleLine Emerging Markets Fixed Income Fund, managed by Luz Padilla, Mark Christensen and Su Fei Koo, reduced its bond holdings from Asia and Latin America in favor of cash and cash equivalents, according to filings as of March 31. That included dumping notes sold by the Indonesian government as well as Brazilian banks and Chinese oil firms.
The portfolio’s total assets plummeted by almost one-third last month as investors abandoned riskier assets. It has returned -13% in 2020, beating 51% of peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Loren Fleckenstein, a spokesman for the fund, declined to comment.
DoubleLine is among the firms flocking to cash as Gundlach and other prominent investors warn of more pain ahead. Money-market funds have experienced big inflows in recent weeks, with assets under management expanding by almost $1 trillion since the end of February to a record $4.47 trillion as of April 8, according to Investment Company Institute data.
The fund did boost two bets tied to Argentina. It scooped up distressed notes from power generator Stoneway Group LP, which just got bought by the Argentine businessman Jose Luis Manzano, and also purchased bonds from gas extractor Transportadora de Gas del Sur.

This is the third consecutive year that the small German investor has sought the chair's removal and comes as Deutsche Bank is the midst of a major restructuring.
The motion, filed by Riebeck lawyer Jan Bayer (DE:BAYGN), criticises the payment of billions of euros in bonuses despite record losses, millions in severance packages for former board members, and a failure to rein in money laundering issues. 
""Personnel changes must be made,"" said the letter from the lawyer seen by Reuters.
Deutsche Bank, which holds its shareholder meeting on May 20, declined to comment. Last year, the bank said its supervisory board had ""full confidence"" in Achleitner's performance.
In 2019, the Riebeck-Brauerei's motion garnered 9.75% of the vote, up from 9.05% in 2018. Riebeck-Brauerei has disclosed ownership of 200,000 Deutsche shares.

Achleitner's second five-year term ends in 2022. He is in search of a successor, people with direct knowledge of the matter have said.

The exchange-traded fund, which normally holds WTI futures for the nearest month, will now move 20% of its contracts to the second-traded month. The change takes effect today and will be in place until further notice, it said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The shift, announced late on Thursday, coincided with sharp movements in the price relationship between the June and July WTI contracts, traders said.
“As a result of these changes, USO (NYSE:USO) may not be able to meet its investment objective,” according to the filing.
As of Thursday the fund held almost 150,000 June Nymex WTI contracts, which is more than a quarter of the total outstanding. It has received more than a billion dollars worth of inflows so far this week as WTI prices have plummeted below $20 a barrel.
Though low prices are attractive to many investors, they come at a cost. The nearest WTI contracts are trading more than $7 a barrel below the subsequent month. That means that investors face a 30% hit to keep the same position as futures contracts roll from one month to the next.
WTI’s June contract discount to July deepened 71 cents to $4.73 by 8:15 AM ET in New York on Friday. The move will see selling of June contracts and buying of July ones, which could widen the spread further.

669,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 08:35AM ET</span>",Super-charged global stocks race towards second weekly gain,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - World stock markets made a super-charged sprint towards a second straight week of gains on Friday after President Donald Trump laid out plans to gradually reopen the coronavirus-hit U.S. economy following similar moves elsewhere.
The bulls were back in business, with reports that patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms had responded positively to a drug made by U.S. company Gilead Sciences (O:GILD) giving traders an extra excuse to brush off a widely expected slump in Chinese GDP data.
Europe's main markets (FTSE) (GDAXI) and Wall Street futures rose more than 3%, putting the pan-regional STOXX 600 (STOXX) up nearly 8% over the last two weeks and MSCI's 49-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS.> 23% off last month's four-year lows. 
""The market continues to look through terrible data... on anticipation of economies reopening,"" said Steen Jakobsen, Chief Investment Officer at Saxo Bank. ""And hopes that a new drug treatment will help lift longer-term uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic.""
Nearly 150,000 people have now died from the disease, while Friday's data from China had shown the world's second-largest economy had contracted for the first time since recognised records began in 1992.
Gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 6.8% in the quarter year-on-year, slightly more than expected, and 9.8% from the previous quarter. Chinese retail sales also fell more than expected in March, but industrial output dipped only slightly, suggesting manufacturing may be recovering more quickly.
Asia had had a strong session. Tokyo's Nikkei <.225> and Seoul's KOPSI (KS11) both closed up over 3% and industrial metal copper, seen as something of a bellwether of global economic health, was up nearly 4% for the week. 
Investors are now looking at how the lockdowns that have caused the economic numbers to crash are being gradually lifted.
Following plans announced by China and Germany, Italy, Spain and some other parts of Europe this week, Trump laid out guidelines on Thursday for U.S. states to emerge from shutdowns in a staggered, three-stage approach.
""We are not opening all at once, but one careful step at a time,"" Trump told reporters at the White House.
The dollar edged up to a 10-day high on the euro. Gilead Sciences' (O:GILD) shares surged almost 12% in premarket Wall Street trading meanwhile following a report that partial data on its experimental drug remdesivir showed it might help patients with severe virus symptoms.

EURO FIGHTERS
There was still plenty of gloomy news to navigate, however.
Credit rating firm S&P Global downgraded another clutch of countries hit by the coronavirus and warned that even triple-A and other top-rated nations could be cut depending on how they manage the longer-term consequences of the pandemic.
Back in Europe though, Italy's government bonds, which have been under pressure as the country's virus difficulties push its debt-to-GDP ratio towards 150%, rallied again as France expressed support for joint euro zone debt issuance.
European countries have ""no choice"" but to set up a fund that ""could issue common debt with a common guarantee"", French President Emmanuel Macron told the Financial Times on Thursday. Failure to do so would lead to populists winning elections in Italy, Spain, and possibly France, he also warned.
Yields on ultra-safe 10-year U.S. Treasuries (US10YT=RR) and German Bunds rose slightly, while Treasury futures (TYc1) and the dollar rose slightly as investors returned to a cautious view about the economic impact of the pandemic and lockdown measures. The safe-haven yen regained some lost ground. 
Spot gold  fell 1.5% to $1,690 per ounce too and with investors looking to take on more risk, copper's jump put it on track for its best week since February 2019. 
No such luck for battered oil markets, however.
U.S. crude futures (CLc1) slumped as much as 8% to an 18-year low after OPEC lowered its global demand forecast on Thursday.
Brent (LCOc1) was whiplashed too, swinging back under $28 a barrel having been up nearly 3% only to then stage another fight back. 
OPEC now sees a contraction of global demand of 6.9 million barrels per day (bpd) this year due to the coronavirus outbreak. 
""Downward risks remain significant, suggesting the possibility of further adjustments, especially in the second quarter,"" OPEC said of the demand forecast.

670,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 08:30AM ET</span>","After market storm, hedge funds launch to catch the recovery wave","By Olga Cotaga and Maiya Keidan
LONDON (Reuters) - At least eight European hedge funds are launching portfolios betting on a recovery in corporate debt and emerging markets after the coronavirus pandemic triggered the biggest market rout in a generation.
The fund managers are hoping to replicate the success of firms that cashed in when markets rebounded after the financial crisis, a rally that cemented the reputations of major investors such as Brevan Howard, Bridgewater and John Paulson.
""We are seeing a lot of interest in new fund launches, either because of opportunistic managers or those who have a strategy that suits the current environment,"" said Sean Scott, a lawyer at MJ Hudson, which advises fund managers.
Fund managers and service providers told Reuters that seven hedge funds focused on credit and equities have either launched or plan to launch portfolios since the start of March while another credit fund got under way in the past few weeks.
With eight launches since the start of the pandemic and more funds pressing ahead with plans already in place, the industry is on track to at least match the number of credit and fixed income fund launches of recent years.
According to data provider HFM, only 15 were launched in the first half of 2018, though that picked up to 21 in the same period of 2019.
""I've had more enquiries over the last two to three weeks than typical,"" said one hedge fund lawyer. 
As the coronavirus spread and brought economies to a halt, investors sold off riskier assets and piled into cash. 
In the last week of March, investors pulled a record $109 billion out of bond funds followed by data provider Emerging Portfolio Fund Research. During the month, distressed debt and emerging markets strategies lost 13% and 9.6% respectively, according to data provider Eurekahedge.

CHEAP CREDIT?
Now, firms are betting conditions are ripe for a rebound and are seeking assets left undervalued following the market rout.
""People are willing to take advantage of the fact that things are in a highly dislocated fashion in the States,"" said Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management.
Nordea launched its Flexible Credit Fund on March 18 specifically to focus on price discrepancies in U.S. credit markets and raised 15 million euros ($16 million) in days.
Other funds that had planned to launch before the pandemic said they were still in full steam ahead, such as a London-based long-short hedge fund focused on emerging markets which aims to launch before the end of April.
""We think it's a great opportunity to launch now,"" said the firm's founder, who declined to be named. ""What you saw over the last couple years is that bad or good opportunities were up, up, up. What we hope now is there will be a little more dispersion and opportunity within emerging markets.""
A partner at a technology firm that works for hedge funds told Reuters he had two clients looking to launch: a $150 million credit hedge fund and a long-short equities strategy.
Even firms that aren't launching products have managed to raise more capital.
Bellecapital's $30 million Eiger Fund, which focuses on small- and mid-cap European firms, said it took in $13 million in April, saying opportunities created by the coronavirus pandemic were part of the reason for the inflow.
PineBridge Investments' credit and fixed income funds, meanwhile, have received, or are in the process of receiving, new investment capital in excess of $1 billion, said Steven Oh, its global head of credit and fixed income. 

""I think credit is still on the cheap side,"" he said.

671,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 08:26AM ET</span>",Oh brother! Coronavirus calls split family fortunes on Wall Street,"(This story contains language that some readers might find offensive in the 21st paragraph)
By Lawrence Delevingne
BOSTON (Reuters) - After a calamitous two week plunge in stocks as the coronavirus spread globally, Ricky Sandler called into a midday CNBC show on March 16 with a brash, bullish prediction.
“People are totally missing what is happening here. Every new headline, every new hysteria is making people more nervous and it's actually very, very positive,” he said, recommending that viewers borrow against their mortgages to buy stocks.
Andrew Sandler, holed up with family, dogs and pet fish on New York's Long Island, couldn't resist a shot at his little brother on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
“I think he's wrong,” Andrew posted immediately after the TV appearance.
The depth and duration of COVID-19's economic impact is a subject of debate among families the world over. But for Ricky and Andrew Sandler, their diverging views have broader implications: both run multi-billion dollar stock-focused hedge funds.
Their different outlooks -- time to buy or stay cautious -- have meant double-digit losses for Ricky's $7.6 billion Eminence Capital LP and double-digit gains for Andrew's nearly $2 billion unit of Sandler Capital Management.
It's a scenario playing out across Wall Street. The coronavirus killed off the longest-running bull market in equities, meaning most hedge funds are nursing losses, with the average stock-focused fund down about 9.5% in March and 13% lower for the first quarter, according to data tracker HFR. 
A small number of hedge fund managers who positioned in time for the fallout have profited, few more than Andrew Sandler. The elder Sandler brother was one of the best performing hedge fund managers in the world for the first quarter, according to a ranking by HSBC. 
To be sure, when markets recover, investors who held or added to their stock holdings may generate large gains, but the timing of such a payoff is uncertain.
Representatives for Andrew and Ricky declined to comment and would not make them available for interview.
DOWNSIDE RISKS
The Sandler brothers followed their late father, Harvey, into investment management in the 1990s. Andrew joined the family firm while Ricky set up his own fund. Until recently the brothers, now in their early 50s, worked a few blocks apart in midtown Manhattan offices. 
Ricky, a cycling enthusiast who alternates between athletic apparel and power neckties, is comfortable in the spotlight. He routinely appears at gatherings of Wall Street’s elite, such as the Milken Institute's annual confab in Beverly Hills and Allen & Co's Sun Valley conference, and sometimes mounts public campaigns against companies.
Self-described as risk averse, Andrew is more low-key, avoiding the hedge fund speaking circuit in favor of tending to a 17,000 gallon basement aquarium. 
In contrast to his younger brother, Andrew's caution meant he missed out on the full market surge of recent years. His Sandler Plus fund gained just 2.75% in 2019, according to an investor letter, compared to a gain of nearly 14% by the average stock focused fund.
That all changed this year. Andrew had positioned his funds defensively, writing to investors on January 16 that “we remain concerned about valuations and downside risks the market seems to be ignoring.”
Andrew was soon reducing market exposure even further, in part because of a rapidly spreading virus in China. 
“The Coronavirus could serve as a catalyst for disappointing global growth as well as specifically disrupt certain supply chains and consumer businesses,” the firm noted in a January 28 Lyxor/Sandler U.S. Equity Fund report.
Andrew's positioning was ideal when stocks started their rapid decline in late February: his funds had more bets on stocks declining than on them rising that month, according to a February 25 Lyxor report.
It also noted increased bets on healthcare stocks and a reduction in consumer discretionary businesses, which have been particularly hard hit as governments curtailed economic activity to prevent the spread of the virus.
Andrew's Sandler Plus funds surged approximately 9.5% in March, putting its year-to-date performance at nearly 15%, according to an investor update reviewed by Reuters. 
'TAKE HEED'  
On March 16, the same day that Ricky took to CNBC to talk up the markets, Andrew warned a friend that he was not surprised by 1,000 point single day declines for major stock indexes. ""Going to be more. Stay liquid my man. This is fucked up,"" he wrote on Facebook. 
Ricky came out of 2019 optimistic. As U.S. stocks surged, Eminence's main hedge fund gained 21% in 2019 with a bullish net portfolio exposure of 47% in July, according to Institutional Investor.
Eminence's exact positioning in late February was not available, but by the time Ricky went on CNBC in mid-March, his fund had suffered losses of more than 30%, according to an investor with direct knowledge of the performance.
Eminence's top holdings at yearend, according to the most recent regulatory filing, included Versace apparel parent Capri Holdings Limited (N:CPRI), chemical maker Ashland Global Holdings Inc. (N:ASH) and motorsports giant Liberty Media Formula One (O:FWONA); those stocks suffered first quarter price declines of between 35% and 72%.
Ricky told clients on a call in late March that he was leaning into his positions and remained bullish on the portfolio, according to the investor. Eminence performance rebounded slightly by the end of the month, putting the fund down 19% for the first quarter, according to the investor.
Reuters could not determine if Eminence has changed its investment strategy since the end of the first quarter; a representative for the firm declined to comment on that or recent performance.
Ricky was still bullish and predicted a 10% stock market rise from current levels by the yearend in an April 7 video discussion hosted by the University of Wisconsin. 
Major U.S stock indices have risen between 7% and 12% since the beginning of April.
It's not clear how much the Sandler brothers discuss the markets. But on March 20, a long-dormant Twitter account under the name Ricky Sandler responded to criticism of his CNBC appearance earlier in the week.

“Those who think I am an idiot take heed,” he wrote. “This is the buying opportunity of a lifetime.”

Unit sales for iPhones are set to drop by 36% year-on-year in the second quarter as the economy takes a hit from the pandemic, before recovering to just a 2% decline by the fourth quarter of this year, analysts including Rod Hall wrote in a note. Weakness for average selling prices is also likely to linger, he said. Hall cut his price target on Apple to $233 from $250, the second-lowest among analysts tracked by Bloomberg.
Apple doesn’t report unit sales for its smartphone line anymore, but the firm is estimated to sell 28 million iPhones in the quarter ending in June, according to 7 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. A smaller consensus of 3 analysts signals a 27% drop from previous year.
Apple’s shares ticked 1% higher in U.S. pre-market trading, lagging behind a 3% gain on S&P 500 Index futures.

Faury also warned against new tax burdens for airlines.
""Taxes inhibit the industry more than they encourage the departure into the future,"" Faury told Spiegel. 
""The governments should rather support the airlines in the climate-friendly conversion of their fleets,"" said Faury. 
Faury currently does not want to apply for state aid for his company during the coronavirus pandemic, but he was not ruling it out either, wrote Spiegel.
With flights cancelled globally and most commercial aircraft grounded to stop the spread of the virus, Fury added that European governments could help out Airbus with orders in the armaments sector, such as for the ""Eurofighter"" combat aircraft.
Airbus' defence business is smaller than that of its U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA). 

Boeing has said it will resume commercial airplane production next week in Washington state after suspending operations last month in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The company's chief executive told employees the aerospace industry will need financial help from the government.

674,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>","Wall Street Week Ahead: In companies' earnings, words may matter more than numbers","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors gearing up for another week of corporate earnings may give more weight to the words of company executives than headline-grabbing numbers, as Wall Street seeks evidence that corporations can weather the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Around a fifth of S&P 500 companies are expected to report results in the coming week, as investors digest a market surge that has lifted the S&P index 25% from its March lows as of Thursday. Those include major industrial, tech and consumer products companies, as well as streaming company Netflix (O:NFLX), whose shares rose to a record high in the past week.
Estimates for first-quarter profits have worsened: Analysts expect overall S&P 500 profits to drop by 12.8%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv - a far steeper decline than the 4.7% drop projected as of April 1. 
But how companies fare against those expectations may have little ultimate impact on their stock prices this time around.
""It’s all about the commentary, it’s not about the numbers,"" said Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer at Abbot Downing.
Some of the companies reporting are among those worst hit by the pandemic's fallout. They include airlines - such as Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) - after major carriers this week agreed in principle to a $25 billion U.S. rescue package.
Investors will look for any clarity on how the pandemic has affected business and companies' ability to keep operating in the months ahead.
Earnings are expected to fall 13.6% in 2020 before rebounding 22.8% in 2021, according to Refinitiv.
""This is the time when you want to see the emergency plans for companies,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. ""For the vast majority of companies ... the question is, When do they anticipate reopening and how badly were they hurt by this?""
Graphic - S&P 500 earnings estimates for 2020, 2021: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkplemmvbx/SP%20500%202020%202021%20EPS%20graphic.jpg
Another area of focus is likely to be whether companies can become fully operational and take steps such as rehiring workers once shutdowns begin to be lifted and parts of the U.S. economy reopen. 
“It’s just trying to get tidbits of insight into what people are assuming about their business in the remainder of the year,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in South Carolina.
The market reaction to the past week's reports has been mixed. The S&P 500 banks index <.SPXBK> is down more than 15% so far this week following the quarterly reports from big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM),  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) and Bank of America (N:BAC). 
But shares of two bellwether healthcare companies, Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and UnitedHealth Group (N:UNH), moved solidly higher following their respective results. The S&P 500 itself is up 0.3% for the week through Thursday after tallying its biggest weekly percentage gain last week since 1974.
Among the other companies on tap for next week: consumer giant Coca-Cola (N:KO), chip stalwart Intel (O:INTC), defense company  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) and wireless carrier Verizon (N:VZ).
The market's recent rally may be another wild card this earnings season. 
While the S&P 500’s bounce off its March lows has reflected a swell of confidence on the heels of unprecedented stimulus from the Federal Reserve and U.S. government, it may make investors more likely to sell shares of companies that report disappointing results.

""The big question right isn’t how earnings are going to be – they’re going to be bad,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. ""The question from our standpoint is just how much the market has discounted that.""

675,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",Activist hedge fund Engaged to give director fees to corporate employees,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Engaged Capital will donate roughly $500,000 in fees its executives would have earned for serving on public companies' boards this year to those corporations' employees, the hedge fund's founder Glenn Welling told Reuters.
Traditionally corporate agitators including Engaged ask companies to do something for shareholders such as selling divisions, cutting costs, or buying back stock, to help boost the stock price.
Now Welling, who founded $1 billion Engaged eight years ago, said he wants to give rather than take as companies steel themselves for the deepest recession since the 1930s era Great Depression in the wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak.
""Our partners have asked that all remaining 2020 board fees be redirected to support those employees that are most impacted,"" Welling said. The money is earmarked to help ""individuals and their families struggling through this volatile period,"" he said.
U.S. unemployment claims surged to 22 million in the last four weeks, wiping out a decade of job gains, as layoffs mounted in industries spanning retail to restaurants.
While Americans are meant to receive payments of $1,200 or more from the U.S. government as part of a $2 trillion relief package, economists warn there won't be a quick recovery.
Engaged Capital executives currently serve as directors at four companies. Welling sits on the boards at food company Hain Celestial (O:HAIN) and technology company TiVo (O:TIVO). Christopher Hetrick, Engaged's director of research, sits on furniture and electronics rental company Rent-A-Center's (O:RCII) board and analyst Brendan Springstubb is a director at food company SunOpta (TO:SOY).
Directors' fees can vary widely depending on the size and wealth of a company but often average around $125,000 a year.
Although Welling often pushes for companies to sell themselves, he also has a reputation for taking a constructive approach with management at the small to mid-sized American companies he targets. He often holds their stock for years.
Activists have largely moved to the sidelines as the virus has wreaked havoc on the economy and financial markets with just 16 campaigns started in March, data from investment bank Lazard showed. Many fund managers worry about the optics of agitating during the pandemic and are trying to keep a lower profile. It is not clear whether others may have made gifts to their target companies or helped in other ways.

677,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 07:01AM ET</span>","Stocks - U.S. Futures Surge; Gilead Shines, P&G Scrubs up Well","By Peter Nurse
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open strongly higher Friday, as investors look forward to states reopening their economies and grasp at hopes for a cure to the coronavirus.
At 7:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 85 points, or 3.1%, higher, Nasdaq futures up 203 points, or 2.3%. The Dow futures contract rose 770 points, or 3.3%.
President Donald Trump laid out new guidelines late Thursday for states to emerge from a coronavirus shutdown in a staggered, three-stage approach.
The recommendations call on states to show a ""downward trajectory"" of Covid-19 cases or positive tests for the disease over 14 days before gradually loosening restrictions on businesses that have been shuttered to blunt the spread of the virus.
Adding to the positive tone was a media report detailing encouraging partial data from trials of Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) Sciences’ experimental drug remdesivir in severe Covid-19 patients. Gilead played down the report, saying the trials were incomplete, but its shares have soared 13% in premarket trading.
This news has overshadowed continued weak domestic economic data as well as a slump in China’s gross domestic product, which fell 6.8% in the first quarter, the first drop in almost three decades of records. Monthly data showed industrial production rebounding faster than retail sales as China's lockdown eased.
Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG)  fiscal third-quarter earnings beat expectations earlier, with organic sales rising 6%, although it has pulled its guidance for the full year. The company boosted its dividend by 6% earlier this week.
Also in the spotlight will be Boeing (NYSE:BA), after it said it would restart some commercial airplane production next week, and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), which said late Thursday that it will receive up to $483 million from the U.S. government to accelerate development of a Covid-19 vaccine.
Elsewhere, Uber (NYSE:UBER) said late Thursday that it was withdrawing guidance and warned it would write down some $2 billion of investments. 
The oil market has seen strong selling in the front month May WTI contract, with extreme levels of oversupply evident in the physical market for both oil and gas, but this has not been replicated in the subsequent contracts.
This market will get more data on the extent of the slowdown in U.S. production when Baker Hughes releases its rig count at 1 PM ET (17:00 GMT).
The oil rig count came in at 504 last week. It was up around 678 at the end of February.
At 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 5.8% lower at $18.70 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 3.1% to $28.68.

678,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 06:50AM ET</span>",UK to allow company meetings online or on the phone in pandemic,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Companies will be able to hold their annual shareholders' meeting over the phone or online during the coronavirus pandemic under a promised new law, Britain's business ministry and accounting watchdog said on Friday.
British business minister Alok Sharma said last month he would propose urgent legislation for companies to meet a legal requirement to hold their annual meetings without breaching curbs on non-essential travel and social distancing during the lockdown.
The ministry and the Financial Reporting Council, which oversees accounting and corporate governance codes, set out on Friday what companies can expect from the new law when parliament partly returns from recess next week, also on a virtual basis.
""We are working on the detail, but we envisage providing companies with the ability to hold 'closed' meetings with a minimum number of people by way of telephone or other equivalent means of communication,"" the guidance said.
In some cases, companies will have the ability to override for a short period their founding rules or articles - which for many companies only allow for a physical annual meeting - the guidance said in a reference to a company's constitution.
But as virtual meetings are uncommon and largely untested in Britain, mandating their use is likely to create further significant issues, the guidance said.
Articles usually stipulate that two to five people are needed to make an annual meeting ""quorate"" or legally valid.
Companies will be allowed temporarily to form a quorum by telephone or other electronic means to avoid even two people having to physically meet, the guidance said.
Shareholders will only have the ability to vote by proxy at virtual meetings because of the limited number of service providers and sheer number of companies that will need to hold meetings in a short timescale, the guidance said.
Companies also won't have to make available hard copies of AGM notices and other documentation, but they could hold follow-up ""shareholder days"" later in the year after pandemic restrictions have been lifted.
""This will maintain the dialogue between those shareholders who would normally attend and ask questions at an AGM,"" the guidance said.

The FRC and Financial Conduct Authority have already announced that companies can have an extra two months until the end of September to publish their annual reports for the financial year that ended last month.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets are ending the week in highly bullish mood, lifted by evidence of life after the coronavirus from two French heavyweights.
Cosmetics group L’Oreal and luxury group LVMH both reported better-than-expected sales figures for the first quarter, with L’Oreal in particular sounding an upbeat note about its recovery prospects.
“China is already seeing an encouraging recovery in beauty product consumption,” chairman Jean-Paul Agon said in a release.
LVMH’s chief financial officer meanwhile said that sales in China had rebounded by 50% in the last two weeks, according to the Financial Times.
To be sure, all the figures that mattered were negative, with LVMH’s organic sales falling 17% from a year earlier and L’Oreal’s down 5% in constant currencies. And LVMH also warned that the second quarter would be miserable too, as the virus impact moves from China to its other core markets in Europe and North America.
LVMH also cut its dividend by 30%, although it will at least continue to pay out, in contrast to many other companies who have suspended theirs in order to conserve case. L’Oreal deferred a decision on its dividend. With a net cash position on its balance sheet, there is little reason to doubt that it, too, can afford to keep its owners happy.
As with Thursday’s StockBeat post on Zalando and its rivals, the most salient point from L’Oreal was the importance of good online distribution at a time when retail stores are closed. The company said e-commerce sales rose 52.6% on the year, largely compensating losses from physical stores.
By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), L’Oreal shares in Paris were up 3.2%, while LVMH shares were up 5.0%. Both were at three-week highs. The CAC 40 was up 3.5%, while the Stoxx 600 benchmark was up 2.6% at 333.24.
Another standout point was a 13% rise in skincare sales – all that hand-washing has to be good for more than just soap-makers, after all.  Nivea maker Beiersdorf stock also picked up on the news, rising 1.8%.  By contrast, makeup sales underperformed, providing further evidence to sad male suspicions that wives make less effort when they have only locked-down husbands to impress... "
681,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 05:30AM ET</span>","Volkswagen sales down 23% in Jan-March, March alone off 37.6%","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen Group (DE:VOWG_p) on Friday said sales of its cars dropped by 23% on the year to 2 million cars in the January to March period. 
In March alone, deliveries were down 37.6% overall at 623,000 vehicles, the figures showed, reflecting the coronavirus crisis which triggered plant closures and falls in sales as consumers were tied up at home in lockdown measures across the world.
More specifically, March sales were down 44.6% year-on-year in western Europe, down 23.1% in central and eastern Europe, down 42% in North America, and down 35% in China, the company said.
Experts believe that declines in April sales could be steeper as the full impact of the lockdowns works its way through the system.

Volkswagen on Thursday withdrew its outlook for 2020 due to the uncertainty related to the virus outbreak which caused operating profit to drop 81% in the first quarter.

682,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 04:20AM ET</span>",Southwest asks unions to start considering post-aid concessions,"By Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) has approached unions representing pilots, flight attendants, mechanics and other employees to discuss potential concessions to prepare for a slow industry recovery, a company official told Reuters on Thursday.
Southwest, with about 60,000 employees, is set to receive $4 billion in federal payroll aid under the CARES Act, which prohibits any involuntary furloughs or pay cuts until Sept. 30.
But with travel at a virtual standstill, airlines have warned they may need to shrink come October.
In its 49-year history, Southwest has never had any pay cuts, layoffs or furloughs, even following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks and the 2009 financial crisis.
""This is just beyond anything we've ever experienced,"" said Russell McCrady, its vice president for labor relations.
""There are no plans sitting on a desk at the company for anybody to be furloughed, but we’re trying to take advantage of the 5.5 months that the CARES Act has provided us to just get started on: 'What if things don't get better?'"" 
McCrady said Southwest was focused on discussing with unions potential changes that may need to be adopted in October should the industry not recover.
But a union leader told members in a letter that the company was ""asking all employees to provide emergency relief"" until the virus is under control, through pay cuts and other measures.
""While we stand willing to address the need for temporary relief through more thoughtful voluntary measures, we are wary of concessionary changes to the terms of our existing contract,"" the leader said in the letter, seen by Reuters. 

The union official warned that concessions would not guarantee the prevention of furloughs once the CARES Act limits expire in October, however.

684,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 03:54AM ET</span>",Stocks - Europe Climbs as Hope Over Virus Cure Grows,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Friday, as investors dismissed weak Chinese growth data to focus on reports of a potentially promising treatment for the coronavirus and plans for re-opening major economies.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index traded 2.5% higher, France's CAC 40 was up 3.2%, while the DAX rose 2.9%. The broader based Stoxx 600 Europe index climbed 2.5%. 
Earlier Friday, China registered a contraction in its economy in the first quarter - the first in almost three decades of records, as gross domestic product fell 6.8% in January-March year-on-year. 
This offered up a foretaste of what is to come in Europe and the Americas in the second quarter, but investors have been buoyed by a media report on Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) Sciences’ experimental drug remdesivir in severe Covid-19 patients, which detailed encouraging partial data from trials of its experimental drug remdesivir.
This, along with countries starting to open up their economies in Europe and President Donald Trump detailing guidelines for something similar in the U.S., has led investors to take a positive stance Friday.
In corporate news, French cosmetic group L’Oreal SA (PA:OREP) and luxury group LVMH (PA:LVMH) both rose strongly after giving encouraging outlooks for the rest of the year in China, where both generate a large share of sales. L'Oreal's first-quarter revenue also beat expectations, thanks partly to surging sales of skincare products.
The only economic indicator of note due for release Friday will be the final consumer price inflation number for the euro zone in March, at 5 AM ET (0900 GMT).
This “will likely confirm that inflation pressures eased in the euro area during the month,” said Danske Bank, in a research note. “As this coincides with the fall in the oil price and economic activity, deflation worries have returned to the market.”
Oil prices remained under pressure Friday, with the rolling-over of long position in the May WTI contract into June sending the former down as much as 8.3% lower at $18.03 a barrel, a new 18-year low. However, the more representative June contract was down only 6c at $25.47. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.1% to $27.80.

686,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 03:09AM ET</span>",Stock Market Investors Are Too Optimistic,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There has been a V-shaped recovery; in the stock market, not in the economy. That is dividing opinion between the doomsayers who think this divergence makes no sense, and those who believe that the Federal Reserve and its central bank peers have this covered — and that they’ll restore the economy to its former state. That doyen of bargain hunters, Warren Buffett, has been conspicuous by his absence from the recent spate of share buying. Notably, he’s been a net seller of airline stocks.
The S&P 500 lost one-third of its value between its record high on Feb. 19 and March 23. It has clawed back half of that as the Fed chucked out its rule book and went on a shopping spree for assets. Equities are pretty much the only type of security that it won’t be adding to its ballooning balance sheet, although a fresh bout of market mayhem might change that too. America’s central bank is already snapping up exchange-traded funds and junk bonds, after all.
A 27% recovery in equities is surprising given that we still have no idea of the virus’s lasting impact on economic output, with only a very partial return to business activity planned and no vaccine in sight. The surge in jobless claims and companies furloughing staff makes forecasting more art than science, much like Covid-19 statistics. As Torsten Slok, Deutsche Bank AG’s chief economist, points out, a decade of U.S. employment gains have been reversed in a month. The International Monetary Fund's global economic predictions this week were the bleakest since the 1930s.
The monetary and fiscal response has been spectacular but can it prevent a permanent loss of growth if people’s consumption, travel and working practices have been altered fundamentally? A wave of defaults, credit downgrades into junk territory, bankruptcies and price drops in real assets such as aircraft and property would change the more positive stock market narrative quickly, as would a second wave of the virus. Parts of the world, Europe in particular, were at risk of recession before the outbreak. Crude oil prices below $20 per barrel don’t suggest global demand will come roaring back.
The equity market is meant to reflect anticipated corporate earnings, and although it’s often given to wild optimism, this is an entirely new situation. How can anyone say with a straight face that they can estimate future earnings right now? There’s little point scouring through first-quarter results apart from looking at how much provisioning the banks are putting in place for loan losses and how much credit has been drawn down.
Any crisis throws up winners — Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). shares have hit new highs — but most companies are losing. More than half of workers are employed by small- and medium-sized enterprises, which will struggle to get all the financial assistance on offer.
The latest Fed stimulus package adds another $2.3 trillion of support and from this week corporates can go directly to the central bank for commercial paper funding. The ability of the Fed to really sustain stock prices is going to be tested like never before. More stimulus is always being promised but after a decade of quantitative easing, there will be a limit to its effectiveness.
Catastrophe has been avoided but most of the emergency measures are geared toward liquidity and borrowing costs. Growth is the thing that matters most for equity valuations in the medium term, and no one can guarantee that.
Consumers will only return to familiar spending habits if they have regular income and governments don’t raise taxes to pay for the current splurge. More dividends will be cut or cancelled. The hit to earnings will only be partially recoverable as most consumption is immediate and large items such as cars and electrical goods can be put off for other years.
Equity markets are betting big on the lasting results of all the stimulus. A swifter end to lockdowns or a promising vaccine development would be something to get excited about. Until we have that, the confidence looks overdone.

Percy Rockdale, along with hedge fund MG Capital Management and its affiliates, had asked HC2 shareholders in a letter last week to vote in favor of removing the company's entire board and installing the six candidates nominated by them.
The fund, along with its partners, own a stake of about 6% in HC2, which owns varied businesses including a construction company, distributor of natural gas motor fuel and a wholesale telecom service provider.
Activist investor Michael Gorzynski, who runs MG Capital, has been stepping up calls to remove Falcone, as the former hedge fund manager faces mounting legal and financial troubles.
""Gorzynski is distracting stockholders with Falcone's personal matters to mislead investors into thinking that such matters impact his abilities as HC2's CEO,"" the company said in a letter to its shareholders late on Thursday, calling the activist investor's bid a ""smear campaign"".
HC2 said it hired an independent counsel to review the impact of Falcone's private financial matters and ""determined such matters do not detract from his capabilities as CEO in any way.""
HC2 said Gorzynski's claims were false, adding that he intends to be the company's interim CEO but has limited experience.

Euro Stoxx 50 futures (STXEc1) were up 3.3% at 0600 GMT, with German DAX (FDXc1), French CAC (FCEc1) and FTSE 100 (FFIc1) futures jumping between 2.8% and 3.4%, shrugging off data showing China suffered its worst economic contraction in almost three decades.

Passenger vehicle registrations fell 52% year-on-year, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said in a statement Friday. The total of 853,077 cars marks the lowest since at least 1990, when the industry body first started to compile data, and follow similar slumps in China and the U.S.
“With containment or lockdown measures taking hold in most markets from around the middle of the month, the vast majority of European dealerships were closed during the second half of March,” the ACEA said.
Fiat-maker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) and  Peugeot  manufacturer PSA Group (PA:PEUP) saw the largest drop in the month, with registrations down 74% and 67% respectively. Volvo Corp.’s registrations dropped the least, coming in 35% below last year.
This month will likely prove no better as car plants remain idle and government-imposed lockdowns exacerbate an economic crash that looks set to outstrip the 2008/09 financial crisis. In China, the first country hit by the virus, signs of a recovery have started to appear, but some analysts are predicting U.S. sales in 2020 will be the worst in almost a decade.
Some European factories will start up again in coming weeks, with Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG planning to open two sites this month and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (DE:BMWG) looking at the beginning of May.
While many carmakers have pivoted to making face masks and ventilator parts to shore up supplies and help medical personnel, the shutdown has still cratered earnings for the companies. Volkswagen, the world’s biggest carmaker, abandoned its full-year outlook Thursday and reported negative cash flow of 2.5 million euros."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's top airlines are operating a majority of their domestic capacity even though the coronavirus outbreak has left seats on flights mostly empty, amid a lack of clear government directives on the functioning of transport infrastructure in the crisis. 
ANA Holdings Inc (T:9202) and  Japan Airlines Co Ltd  (JAL) (T:9201), Japan's two biggest airlines, have cut around 90% of international flights but left their domestic networks relatively intact, industry data showed. The two normally fly around 800 or more domestic flights daily.
They are currently flying around two-thirds of capacity with 10% of the usual demand, according to the airlines. That is despite Japan declaring a one-month state of emergency in major cities on April 7 which was expanded on Thursday to include the entire country.
The move is set to add further financial strain on the Japanese carriers. Their peers in India, Thailand and the Philippines have grounded all domestic flights under government orders, while those in Australia and New Zealand are flying less than 5% of their normal schedules due to travel restrictions and reduced demand.
Japan has not restricted domestic travel, and authorities in Tokyo and other big cities are only requesting people to stay in and asking bars and restaurants to temporarily close without penalty.
""The government has declared an emergency, but hasn't asked the airlines to reduce flights, rather they want to maintain the transport infrastructure,"" said a person familiar with operations at the airlines, who was not authorised to talk to media.
""Some planes are flying with less than 10 passengers, but we feel we need to keep that transport infrastructure,"" the person added. 
An official at the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau, which oversees the carriers, described it as ""business as usual"", with the airlines setting schedules based on business conditions. The government only requires them to offer refunds or new bookings to passengers affected by cancellations, he said. 
Neither carrier is government owned, but ties with regulators are close, with officials and politicians willing to extend financial help in troubled times to support a domestic aviation network that connects an island archipelago stretching almost 3,000 kilometres (1,864 miles).
In a stimulus package equivalent to a fifth of Japan's annual GDP, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government has promised financial support for the carriers, although it has yet to say how much.
The Scheduled Airlines Association of Japan, which represents ANA, JAL and 17 others, estimates that the pandemic will cost its members some 500 billion yen ($4.64 billion) in lost revenue by the end of May. 
Over a year that deficit could balloon to 2 trillion yen, the industry lobby group predicts. 
ANA has asked commercial lenders and the state-run Development Bank of Japan for 400 billion yen in aid, as it burns through cash during the crisis. 
""I expect current cuts to operations to continue,"" said a second airline industry source familiar with the matter, asking not to be identified. If the coronavirus downturn lasts a year ANA will need at least 1.3 trillion yen, the source said. 
An ANA spokeswoman said the carrier would consider further cuts to domestic flights, but because it was a necessary form of transportation it would continue to cooperate in maintaining basic services. 

""The crucial question is whether there is going to be at least a partial recovery in operations by the summer,"" said Kazuma Ogino, a credit analyst at Nomura Securities in Tokyo.

(Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) Chief Executive Officer James Gorman told shareholders on Thursday he ""can promise"" the bank will miss its medium-term financial targets again in the current quarter, as the economic shutdown caused by the novel coronavirus will continue to upend the global and U.S. economy. 
""We're in a wild period,"" Gorman said on a call with analysts, noting economists predict gross domestic product will fall 30 percent this quarter. ""A CEO who stands by their short-term targets that were set right before this virus hit, I don't know what planet they're on.""
The last of the big U.S. banks to report first-quarter earnings, Morgan Stanley said its profit slumped by 30% and it missed new return targets and cost-cutting goals.
The nation's largest lenders reported sharp declines in profit and higher reserves this week, as they anticipated that the millions people unemployed as a result of the coronavirus will likely struggle to pay loans and credit card bills.
Morgan Stanley, which does not have a significant consumer loan business, faired well by comparison.
After years of steady growth targets, the bank boosted goals in January, saying it could reach a return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of between 13% and 15% in two years. It also set its efficiency ratio at 70% to 72% and pre-tax profit margin for the wealth management business between 28% and 30%. 
It was far from all three in the first quarter, reporting a 9.7% ROTCE, a 77% efficiency ratio and a 26.1% pre-tax margin in wealth. Gorman said that the bank can ""definitely"" beat some of those targets by the end of 2021 but said they were set before the downturn.
""It would be irresponsible of me to recommit to those targets on this call,"" said Gorman, who recently recovered from the illness caused by the coronavirus. ""Those targets are not achievable in the second quarter. They weren’t achievable in the first quarter.""
Targets aside, the bank's trading revenue surged 30% in the quarter ended March 31, boosted by high market volatility last month. The returns were led by a 29% jump in bond trading and a 20% rise in equities trading.
The robust trading mirrored a similar showings by rivals Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and JPMorgan (N:JPM), both of which clocked double-digit growth in equities and bond trading.
However, revenue at Morgan Stanley's wealth management unit, which contributes roughly half of its total revenue, fell 8% to $4.04 billion this quarter, in part because investments associated with employee compensation lost value during the market downturn. These contributed to a roughly $500 million decline in wealth revenue. 
Advisory revenue fell 11% as dealmaking took a beating in the quarter, with businesses bracing for a massive slowdown in the coming months.
Morgan Stanley's $13 billion deal to buy discount brokerage E*Trade Financial Corp also coincided with the spread of the coronavirus, forcing management to justify the buyout to investors. The company said it was on track to close the deal in the fourth quarter.
Investment management revenue at Morgan Stanley fell 14% to $692 million, hurt by valuation mark downs on its investment portfolio and lower interest on loans.

The bank said earnings attributable to common shareholders fell to $1.59 billion, or $1.01 per share, in the first quarter. Analysts had expected $1.14 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

696,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 10:07PM ET</span>",Trump unveils three-stage process for states to end coronavirus shutdown,"By Jeff Mason and Steve Holland
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump laid out new guidelines on Thursday for U.S. states to emerge from a coronavirus shutdown in a staggered, three-stage approach meant to revive the U.S. economy even as the country continues to fight the pandemic. 
The recommendations call on states to show a ""downward trajectory"" of COVID-19 cases or positive tests for the disease over 14 days before proceeding with the plan, which gradually loosens restrictions on businesses that have been shuttered to blunt the spread of the virus.
""We are not opening all at once, but one careful step at a time,"" Trump told reporters at the White House. The president had said earlier this month he wanted to reopen the economy with a ""big bang.""
The plan is a set of recommendations for state governors, not orders. In that sense, it represents a backdown by Trump, who on Monday insisted he had total authority to direct states to re-open or remain closed. The responsibility for such decisions lies with state, not federal, authorities.
With the onus on governors, the plan also gives Trump political cover if not everything goes well. The president, a Republican who is running for re-election in November, has faced criticism for downplaying the seriousness of the virus in the early weeks of the outbreak.
The recommendations drew criticism from Ron Klain, who spearheaded the Obama administration's response to Ebola and has advised former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee. 
""This isn't a plan. It's barely a powerpoint,"" he said on Twitter, noting it did not include provisions to ramp up testing or set a specific standard for levels of the disease before economic opening.
Democrats such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Biden said testing was key to opening the country and criticized Trump's presentation for lacking specifics.
""I wouldn't call it a plan. I think what he's done, he's kind of punted,"" Biden said in an interview on CNN.
The new guidelines effectively end, at least for some states, the 30-day federal virus mitigation rules that were meant to stay in place through the end of April. States that have met the criteria can move into the first phase of re-opening on Friday, Trump said. Some 29 states would be in a position to re-open soon, he said.
'NEW NORMAL'
Before they do that, however, the guidelines suggest hospitals have a ""robust testing program"" that includes antibody testing in place for healthcare workers, the guidelines say. 
States should have the ability to set up screening and testing sites for people with symptoms and as well as contact tracing capabilities, and healthcare facilities should be able to supply personal protective gear independently and handle surges if COVID-19 cases increase again.
In the first phase of re-opening, the guidelines say groups of more than 10 people should be avoided if appropriate distancing measures are not practical. Non-essential travel should be minimized, telework should be encouraged, and common areas in offices closed.
Schools remain closed in phase 1, but large venues such as movies theaters, restaurants, sports stadiums, and places of worship can open with ""strict physical distancing protocols.""
Hospitals, which have been hit hard by the health crisis, may resume out-patient elective surgeries and gyms can re-open with new protocols. Bars should remain closed, it said.
In the second phase, applicable to states and regions with ""no evidence of a rebound"" in cases, the guidelines recommend groups of more than 50 be avoided where social distancing is not practical. Non-essential travel can resume, while schools and youth camps can reconvene and bars with ""diminished standing-room occupancy"" may re-open. Hospitals may also resume in-patient elective surgeries. Such procedures are critical to hospitals' income.
Phase three includes unrestricted staffing of workplaces, but Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force who took a lead role in designing the guidelines, said that a ""new normal"" would remain in place: a need for higher hygiene standards and more space between people to prevent asymptomatic spread of the virus.
White House officials made a point of highlighting the support of Birx, infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci and Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for the plan. Trump thanked them repeatedly from the White House podium.
Trump has been pushing to get the U.S. economy going again after the coronavirus shutdown left millions of Americans jobless. More than 20 million people have filed for unemployment in the U.S. in the past month and over 90% of the country have been under stay-at-home orders.

""A prolonged lockdown combined with a forced economic depression would inflict an immense and wide-ranging toll on public health,"" Trump said, adding it could lead to a sharp rise in drug abuse, alcohol abuse, suicide, and heart disease.

(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures jumped in late trading on Thursday after a report of promising early data related to a potential COVID-19 treatment from Gilead Sciences and as guidelines for re-opening the U.S. economy came from the White House.
S&P 500 e-minis  were last up 3.2% while the SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund (P:SPY) surged 3%.
Early data from two mid-stage clinical trials testing Gilead Science Inc's (O:GILD) antiviral medicine, remdesivir, in severe COVID-19 patients showed rapid recoveries in fever and respiratory symptoms, according to a report from Stat, a science journalism Web site. Its shares were up about 14% after the bell.
""The Gilead news is important because it would diminish some of the downside risk of infection,"" said Jack Ablin, Chief Investment Officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. ""Having this Gilead treatment could perhaps address the downside of getting the virus, make it less severe.""
Also boosting sentiment after hours was President Donald Trump's guidelines that revealed a three-phase plan that could allow some states to begin as early as this month lifting limits meant to contain the disease's spread.
""We're looking for more definition on reopening the economy sooner rather than later, more rather than less,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. 
""I think people sense the economy is restarting, and some voices that have been urging greater caution are going to get overruled.""
Earlier, the shutdown in New York was extended until May 15, even as coronavirus-related hospitalizations and deaths fell to their lowest in more than a week, adding to evidence the hardest-hit state was controlling the virus' spread.
Stocks ended the regular session higher as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) surged to record highs, with sweeping stay-at-home orders driving demand for online streaming services and home delivery of goods.
But trading was choppy during the day as investors worried about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on first-quarter earnings. First-quarter earnings kicked off this week, with U.S. banks preparing for a wave of future loan defaults following a halt in business activity.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 33.33 points, or 0.14%, to 23,537.68, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 16.19 points, or 0.58%, to 2,799.55 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 139.19 points, or 1.66%, to 8,532.36.
Analysts estimate earnings for S&P 500 companies slumped 12.8% in the quarter, which would be the biggest year-over-year quarterly decline since the financial crisis.
Data showed jobless claims fell slightly to 5.2 million last week from an upwardly revised 6.62 million the previous week. But the total figure for the past month still topped a stunning 20 million. 
Economists polled by Reuters had estimated 5.1 million jobless claims for the week ended April 11.
 Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) wrapped up earnings for the big U.S. lenders, reporting a plunge in quarterly profit as its advisory and wealth management businesses took a hit from the economic fallout of the pandemic. Its shares ended down slightly.
Shares of  Boeing Co  (N:BA) fell 8%, limiting gains in the Dow, as its European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) said it was examining requests to defer deliveries after a collapse in travel demand.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.62 billion shares, compared to the 13.94 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

699,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 09:09PM ET</span>",China’s Markets Are Hardly Shaking Before Economic Data Release,"(Bloomberg) -- There’s little sign of nervousness among China’s traders before the release of data that will reveal the depth of the contraction in the economy.
The offshore yuan was last 0.2% higher to trade around its average level for the past month. The $7 trillion stock market is almost stilled, with the Shanghai equity benchmark again stuck at the 30-day average, while turnover is near levels hardly seen all year and volatility is sliding. The yield on 10-year government debt hasn’t moved more than 3 basis points daily in a week.
It’s not like the data doesn’t have the capacity to shock. The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg is for a 6% contraction in the first three months of the year, when the coronavirus outbreak spurred a lockdown across the country. The slump may be as deep as 11%, according to Bloomberg Economics.
The government will also release data for retail sales, fixed asset investment and industrial output for March.
So far the Chinese authorities have been relatively restrained in providing stimulus to offset the impact of the pandemic, especially compared with central banks in the U.S and Europe. That’s disappointed stock traders and helped snuff out February’s sharp rebound in the equity market. Worse-than-expected data may prompt optimism that Beijing will need to take more drastic steps to stimulate the economy.
Still, local officials’ actions may be hampered by concern that additional stimulus will flow into speculative activities and fuel unsustainable debt, rather than aid productive parts of the economy.
This may already be happening. Yields are so low in the country’s short-term debt market -- with one company this month selling bonds as cheaply as 1.74% -- that some firms may be issuing debt and using the proceeds to buy high-yielding asset management products, according to  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA and Citic Securities Co.
The data is scheduled to be released at 10 a.m. local time.

700,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 09:05PM ET</span>",T-Mobile wins final approval for closed merger with Sprint,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - California's Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) voted on Thursday to approve the merger of wireless carriers T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc and Sprint Corp, marking the final approval for a $23 billion deal which closed on April 1.
The deal had closed without a final decision from the California PUC, which gave that on Thursday with a unanimous vote. The CPUC had issued a proposed decision in March to approve the merger with conditions. T-Mobile and Sprint agreed to abide by those conditions.
The biggest hurdle for the companies was a legal battle with state attorneys general who had argued that the deal would mean higher prices for consumers. But a U.S. federal judge disagreed in February, and allowed the deal, which was originally valued at $26 billion, to go forward.
In comments before the vote, two of the commissioners noted the importance of ensuring that conditions that T-Mobile agreed to in order to win the approval be adequately enforced.
The combined company now operates under the T-Mobile name and will trade on the NASDAQ as ""TMUS.""
The deal is designed to enable the combined company to join their high-band and low-band spectrum that could allow a faster roll-out of national 5G.

The Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission signed off on the merger last year. The department had given its approval to the deal in July on condition the combined wireless company sell off assets to Dish Network, making the latter the fourth-largest provider in the U.S. wireless space.

701,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 08:18PM ET</span>",Cantor to Cut Hundreds of Jobs in Break From Wall Street Pledge,"(Bloomberg) -- Cantor Fitzgerald is shrinking its workforce, breaking with firms across Wall Street that vowed not to lay off employees during a pandemic that’s unleashed the worst unemployment crisis in decades.
The private financial services firm run by Howard Lutnick plans to cut hundreds of jobs across divisions as he seeks to shore up his empire, according to people with knowledge of the matter. That would make the reductions the deepest to emerge among Wall Street’s major firms since the outbreak in the U.S.
“We have made prudent headcount and cost reductions to position the firm for the uncertain macroeconomic conditions expected for the remainder of the year,” the company said in an emailed statement.
Investment banks such as  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) have pledged to hold off on such dismissals during the pandemic this year, reassuring employees about their income and health insurance as the economy reels from the spread of the deadly virus. Lutnick is worried about the hit from an extended economic downturn, the people said.
It marks a tempering of ambitions for the 58-year-old, who paired up with former  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) boss Anshu Jain to compete with the biggest players on Wall Street. It’s part of a broader retrenchment by Lutnick, the sharp-elbowed magnate who set out to rebuild the firm into what he called the industry’s “biggest little guy.”
Shares of affiliate firm BGC Partners plummeted after it slashed its dividend last month and announced it had drawn down $230 million from a revolving credit facility since the end of the year. And senior leaders at affiliate Newmark Knight Frank, a commercial real estate firm, have been asked to take pay cuts and eliminate positions, the people said.
Some of the cuts across Cantor’s capital markets and commercial real estate business have already happened, while others are expected over the coming weeks.
At various divisions, senior managers were told to identify people to lay off first, and in some cases they were later ordered to expand those lists, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are private. While the cuts will amount to less than 5% of the company’s workforce, reductions in some units will be significantly higher than the firm-wide average. Cantor’s website says it employs about 12,000 people around the world.
The 75-year-old company has withstood challenges before. Cantor Fitzgerald was almost destroyed when airliners struck the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, killing 658 people who worked at the company. The brokerage was rebuilt, making it a Wall Street success story. In late 2016, Lutnick enlisted a new president, Jain, as they sought to expand in investment banking and prime brokerage.
On Thursday, Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said it was a “no brainer” to decide against cutting jobs inside the firm he runs while a crisis rages. “Psychologically I think it would be a disaster,” Gorman said. “The worst possible thing.”

702,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 07:54PM ET</span>",Fed Preparing a Plan to Publish Transactions for Crisis Programs,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve is working on a plan to publish transactions on its website for its coronavirus emergency lending facilities, as pressure builds for transparency over what could be trillions of dollars of support, according to the central bank.
Congress allocated $454 billion to backstop Fed lending that could expand to as much as ten times that amount in the $2.2 trillion virus relief bill signed into law by President Donald Trump on March 27. The Fed has announced nine programs to help get businesses through the pandemic shutdown, spanning assistance from bridge loans for municipalities, to helping banks push out billions in loans to small- and medium-sized businesses.
The Fed says it is working on a system of robust reporting, though it’s not clear if that will include specific details on which companies received aid. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will face intense congressional scrutiny on who got money and why.
Congressional Pressure
Mike Crapo, the Idaho Republican who chairs the powerful Senate Banking Committee, wrote to Powell and Mnuchin on Thursday to highlight the panel’s role in providing “robust” oversight of the programs, while urging that they work quickly to get them up and running.
That call came a day after the sole member of a congressional oversight board -- a former top staffer for Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren -- asked Powell directly for information on who was getting cash. Bharat Ramamurti said in a letter to Powell that the central bank had not “announced what information it will publicly release” about its dealings with private companies, or even whether it would release the names of individual beneficiaries.
The Fed launched its initial emergency facilities on March 17 when it offered support to primary dealers in U.S. government bonds and the commercial paper market. It continued to expand the aid as pressure mounted from the virus lock-down. On April 9 it unleashed more measures, including a Main Street loan program, and announced it would buy certain types of high-yield debt. By Thursday, four of the nine programs were fully operational.
Report Due
Bharat, who previously led Warren’s investigations into  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co., is already preparing for the committee’s first public report on Powell and Mnuchin’s work, due around May 8. The legislation requires the report 30 days after the Treasury and Fed exercise the emergency lending authority. The committee is subsequently required to provide an update monthly.
But the committee’s investigation contains what critics view as an irony. Congress could have set up its own lending board made up of Fed officials and other technocrats to oversee and dole out money. Instead, they gave the Treasury and Fed wide discretion.
The virus-relief bill provides the Treasury Department with funds that can be leveraged up to $4.5 trillion in liquidity through the Fed.
Strings Attached
Congress attached strings to any funding Mnuchin doles out in some programs, ranging from prohibitions against interfering with union organization to limitations on off-shoring jobs. The Fed is adhering to some of the restrictions, asking companies to adhere to limitations in the law on stock buybacks, dividends, compensation, and to make “reasonable efforts” to retain employees during the term of the loan.
“As Congress contemplates loan forgiveness or direct support to firms that are on the brink, it’s reasonable for some conditionality to be attached,” said Nathan Sheets, who has worked at both the Fed and the Treasury Department and is now chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income.
But lending by the Fed is “geared toward broad classes of firms, not to a single sector, and with an explicit expectation that the firms are otherwise solvent and that the lending will be repaid,” he said.
Fed programs that buy securities directly in the market are aimed at a broad universe of companies, and it would difficult to apply constraints. “As businesses get larger, the struggles to apply the regulations to the international aspects” of their operations “becomes more difficult,” said Charles Morton, a partner at the law firm Venable LLP.
Step Removed
“With the Fed programs, they can claim to be one step removed and the assistance is provided through a facility rather than being directly negotiated with each company,” the way Treasury’s loans and loan guarantees are set up, according to Stephen Myrow, a former Treasury official during the global financial crisis.
Congress’ limitations on aid from Treasury or the Fed were hotly debated between lawmakers and the Trump administration, according to another person familiar with the matter. Congress had the opportunity to change some of the restrictions on the Fed that were imposed under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act -- specifically a provision that banned bailouts of individual companies -- but lawmakers ultimately decided against it.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department said on Thursday it had rejected most requests by JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) and  Spirit Airlines  (N:SAVE) to halt additional flights in the wake of the pandemic that has sent passenger traffic down by 95%.
The department last week issued final rules setting minimum flights requirements for airlines receiving government assistance allowing airlines to dramatically cut and consolidate but not eliminate service.
Spirit must resume flights to the New York City area and outstate New York airports after it suspended service to all New York, New Jersey and Connecticut airports it serves in early April, including New York LaGuardia, Newark, New Jersey; Hartford, Connecticut; Niagara Falls, New York, and Plattsburgh, New York.
Airlines can petition to temporarily eliminate service to airports. The department is reviewing requests from another eight airlines.
The department said it would allow the airlines to stop flying to Puerto Rico, but would require JetBlue to keep flying to nine destinations, including Albuquerque, New Mexico; Portland, Oregon; Bozeman, Montana; Reno-Tahoe, Nevada; Dallas/Fort Worth; Sacramento, California; Houston; and Minneapolis.
Spirit must resume flights to a total of about two dozen locations, including Austin, Texas; Columbus, Ohio; Kansas City, Missouri; Indianapolis; and the San Francisco area within a week of getting government assistance.
Spirit said it would ""fully comply with the U.S. Department of Transportation requirements and will continue to take care of our Guests during this unprecedented time.""
JetBlue did not immediately comment.
This week the U.S. Treasury had reached agreements in principle with 10 major airlines as it moves to award $25 billion in cash grants to help carriers with payroll costs. The carriers could get the funds as early as this week and will need to repay 30% in a low-interest loan over 10 years and grant the government warrants equal to 10% of the loan.
JetBlue said this week it expected to receive $935 million in payroll assistance. Spirit said it has not yet reached agreement with Treasury on payroll assistance but said Tuesday it expected to agree on terms soon.
United Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and others have sought exemptions before resuming some flights, especially some seasonal flights to vacation destinations.

American Airlines (O:AAL) wants to delay resuming flights to airports that serve Colorado ski resorts such as Vail and Aspen, as well as to several Hawaiian island airports.

""Our industry will need the government’s support, which will be critical to ensuring access to credit markets and likely take the form of loans versus outright grants,"" Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told employees in a letter seen by Reuters. ""Our team continues to focus on the best ways to keep liquidity flowing through our business and to our supply chain until our customers are buying airplanes again,"" it said.
About 27,000 Boeing workers in the Puget Sound area will return to production of the 747, 767, 777 and 787 jet programs.
Employees in the Puget Sound for the 747, 767 and 777 will return starting April 20, while employees on the 787 program will return April 23 or April 24.
In January, Boeing halted production of the 737 MAX after two fatal crashes in five months. Employees on the 737 program in Puget Sound are returning to work starting April 20 as they resume working toward restarting MAX production, the company said.
Boeing, which said around 200 employees globally have tested positive for the coronavirus, is instituting a series of safeguards including staggering shift start times, adding floor markings and signage to create physical distance and requiring face coverings for employees at company sites in Washington.
Boeing is asking employees to perform self-health checks before coming to work and to stay home if ill. It will conduct employee wellness checks before every shift and voluntary temperature screening at many manufacturing locations. 
A Boeing spokesman declined to say whether the company would seek government assistance.
Boeing said last month it wanted the government to ""ensure a minimum of $60 billion in access to public and private liquidity, including loan guarantees, for the aerospace manufacturing industry.""
Calhoun said in March he did not want the U.S. Treasury to take an equity stake as a condition of government loans.
At the same time, U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly vowed to help Boeing.
""Boeing has not asked for aid yet but I think they probably will,"" Trump said last week. ""We can’t let anything happen to Boeing.""
Last week, Boeing hired investment banks Lazard and Evercore Inc to assess potential U.S. government assistance or private sector loans, Reuters reported.
Calhoun noted Treasury and 10 airlines agreed on an aid package of nearly $25 billion, while 2,500 U.S. aircraft have been idled and passenger volume is down more than 95%. 
""Knowing that the U.S. airline industry has critical financial support through this devastating wave of the virus allows us to plan our production system for the medium- and long-term impact on air travel,"" Calhoun said.
Congress set aside $17 billion in direct loans for national security-related companies that could be tapped by Boeing and it could also take part in a Treasury-backed Federal Reserve lending program.
Last week, Boeing suspended production of its 787 airplane at its facilities in South Carolina.
Boeing’s airline customers have deferred taking new aircraft and making pre-delivery downpayments, compounding the crisis over the grounding of Boeing’s previously fast-selling 737 MAX.

Boeing on Tuesday reported another 75 cancellations for its 737 MAX in March. Boeing's 50 planes delivered in the first three months of the year were the lowest since 1984 for the first quarter.

He returned empty-handed, for now.
In a statement, Banxico said that both Lopez Obrador and Diaz de Leon discussed the importance of following the existing procedure and timing regarding the surplus as laid out in the central bank’s own regulations.
The surplus -- which is scheduled to be paid out in April next year -- may eventually represent a windfall for Mexico’s government as it tries to hold its fiscal position amid shocks from an oil slump and the coronavirus.
“Banxico won’t know how much is left over until the end of the year,” said New York-based Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) economist Carlos Capistran. “It seems appropriate to me that Banxico respects the timing established by the law.”
Lopez Obrador had said that he would ask about a possible advance payment on that funding in a morning press conference on Thursday. In a tweet after the meeting, the president said that discussions were cordial and that he had reiterated his absolute respect for the central bank’s independence.

706,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 05:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: FDA may have dropped standards too far in hunt for chloroquine to fight coronavirus - sources,"By Katherine Eban
(Reuters) - On March 21, two days after President Donald Trump first touted chloroquine drugs as a “gamechanger” in the fight against COVID-19, administration officials privately described what they felt was a “win” in the president’s efforts to build an emergency stockpile of the drugs: a hefty donation of pills from  Bayer AG . (DE:BayGn)
In an exchange of enthusiastic emails among federal health officials reviewed by Reuters, Keagan Lenihan, chief of staff of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), cautioned that “3-4 days” of testing would be needed.
“Potentially serious issues with product so let’s be careful when we take that win,” she wrote.
Bayer has since donated three million tablets of the drug, called Resochin, to the U.S. national stockpile for treatment of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. After a brief period of testing, its use in the United States was approved on an emergency basis.
But three U.S. government sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that there is reason to be concerned about the quality of Resochin and its makers, located in India and Pakistan.
Although some rules can be waived in an emergency, the FDA dropped its quality-control standards too far as it scoured the world for scarce supplies of chloroquine drugs, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The plants that make Resochin ingredients and finished doses in India and Pakistan have never been registered with, or inspected by, the FDA, according to the three government sources, as well as FDA documents compiled in the private online database FDAzilla.com. Some chloroquine drugs were already approved by the FDA before the pandemic as antimalarial medications, a process that required plant inspections. Resochin was not approved.
Pakistani regulators, who inspected Bayer’s Resochin plant in Karachi in 2015, found a “gross failure” in manufacturing processes there, according to documents from the Drugs Regulatory Authority of Pakistan, reviewed by Reuters. And though the FDA has never screened the Indore, India, plant that supplies ingredients for Resochin, the U.S. agency has inspected other Indian plants run by the same Indian supplier and found serious deficiencies, including falsification of records, inspection documents spanning 2014 through 2019 show.
Responding to questions from Reuters about Resochin, FDA spokesman Michael Felberbaum said that the agency “sampled and tested the donated drugs to evaluate acceptability for importation” and they met appropriate standards.
Asked about Lenihan's March 21 email, the FDA spokesman said the agency ""does not comment on alleged, leaked emails.” 
In a statement to Reuters, Bayer said that the FDA had tested Resochin “and found it to be of appropriate quality for release to the (stockpile) for emergency use. We are proud to make this donation to the U.S. government in the fight against COVID-19.”
Resochin is part of a class of medications containing one of two active ingredients - chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine - that the Trump administration has praised as a potentially lifesaving treatment. But the effectiveness of chloroquine drugs against coronavirus has not been proven. Though in use for years in the United States as a treatment for malaria and autoimmune conditions such as lupus, the medicines can have serious side effects, including heart arrhythmias.
The three U.S. sources who spoke with Reuters, as well as an independent expert, said spot-testing is not always sufficient to ensure a drug's safety and effectiveness, and plant inspections normally done by the FDA are crucial to ensuring overall quality.
“If you’re talking about millions of doses, you can’t test every product,” said Stephen Payne, who for years chaired a practice group specializing in the FDA and health care at a global law firm. “You have no idea what you don’t know.”
A PHOTO OPPORTUNITY
Trump first endorsed chloroquine drugs to treat COVID-19 from the White House podium on March 19, citing “very, very encouraging early results” and downplaying any risks. “If things don’t go as planned, it’s not going to kill anyone,” he said.
The statements came as the administration was being hammered for its slow response to the growing coronavirus crisis, which to date has infected more than 637,000 people in the United States, killing almost 31,000. His comments set high public expectations for the drugs, which are now being snapped up all over the globe.
In emails two days later, federal health officials greeted the Bayer donation of chloroquine phosphate, or Resochin, with eagerness.
Cicely Waters, director of external affairs for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), saw a media opportunity. A shipment of two million tablets was due to arrive at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City.
“I would like to get photos of the product coming off of the FedEx (NYSE:FDX) plane so we can be prepared to support the story with visuals if this turns out the way we hope,” wrote Waters.
Lenihan of the FDA told the group of health officials that ""if it is the product we think it is and it is not toxic we will release it to ASPR” - the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, a division within HHS.
Reached by email, Lenihan referred Reuters back to the FDA press office. Waters did not respond to an email seeking comment.
One of the participants in the March 21 email discussion appeared to raise the issue of which agency should get credit for the deal. Joseph Hamel, ASPR’s manager of strategic innovation and emerging technology, asked in an email to the group: “How do you want to handle? FDA win? ASPR win? Happy either way, please let us know.” 
Hamel did not return an email seeking comment.
Asked about the email exchanges, an HHS spokesman echoed the FDA's statement, saying the agency would not comment on “alleged, leaked emails.”
‘GROSS FAILURE’
The pills and ingredients welcomed by the administration had origins that should have raised red flags and prompted greater scrutiny, said the three sources who spoke to Reuters.
In 2015, Bayer’s plant in Pakistan, Bayer Pakistan Private Ltd, was cited by that country’s regulators for making Resochin that was lower in potency than labeled, according to inspection documents reviewed by Reuters. 
A whistleblower complaint led to the discovery of more than 21 million Resochin tablets that were too weak, more than 12% under the specified weight of 400 milligrams, according to the Pakistani regulatory records. 
Officials blamed the problem on a “gross failure” of manufacturing operations, citing improperly calibrated machines, poorly trained workers and insufficient staffing. Weak medications can fail to treat the illness for which they’re prescribed and harm patients.
The investigation was ultimately resolved with Bayer’s agreement to destroy the 21 million doses.
Regarding the 2015 incident, the company told Reuters: “All batches produced with lower content due to an error in production were never released, the corresponding batches destroyed.”
According to FDA records reviewed by Reuters, the active ingredients for the drug are made at a plant in Indore, India, run by Ipca Laboratories Ltd, an Indian drug manufacturer and ingredient supplier that exports its products globally.
In 2016, the FDA issued a warning letter to Ipca regarding three of its plants in India that make chloroquine ingredients and finished pills for companies other than Bayer. The plants did not include the one making the active ingredient for Bayer’s Resochin. Nonetheless, the U.S. government sources said, Ipca’s troubled history calls into question its general practices.
The FDA found the company was deleting, manipulating and fabricating laboratory data, according to the agency's records. The company vowed at the time to “resolve these issues at the earliest.”
In 2017, the agency restricted drugs and ingredients from those three plants from entering the U.S. market, a regulatory sanction called an import alert. Then in August 2019, the FDA accused one of the Ipca plants of a “cascade of failure” for not properly maintaining its quality data, agency records show.
Ipca did not respond to questions from Reuters about its track record with the FDA.
On March 20, a day after Trump praised the antimalarial drug from the podium, the FDA lifted its import alert for Ipca’s chloroquine ingredients and completed tablets from the three restricted plants, according to a March 21 statement filed by Ipca with the Indian stock exchange.

The company pledged in the statement to adhere to stringent manufacturing standards, “and thus help mankind in the best possible way in these testing times.”

707,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 05:50PM ET</span>",French state may call on banks to contribute to Air France bailout,"PARIS (Reuters) - The French government may call on banks to contribute to a bailout of Air France KLM if it offers state support to the struggling airline, the finance minister said on Thursday.
The government has earmarked 20 billion euros ($21.7 billion) to recapitalise - or nationalise if necessary - big French firms that cannot make it alone through the coronavirus crisis and has indicated that Air France is first in line.
""You say that Air France (needs) 7 billion euros, we can very well imagine that the effort is shared between the state and the banks,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on BFM TV.
""There's nothing that says that the state has to provide capital to Air France all alone,"" he added.
Sources previously told Reuters that Air France KLM is in talks with banks to receive up to 6 billion euros ($6.5 billion) in state-backed bank loans. 
French website La Tribune has since reported that the group was seeking up to 10 billion euros, and nearly 8 billion specifically for Air France.
The 20 billion euros in state bailout funds are part of a broader 110 billion euro package of economic rescue measures, which also includes tax and payroll charge deferrals and funding for state-subsidised furloughs.
The government is also offering state guarantees of up to 90% on business loans from commercial banks worth a total of 300 billion euros. Guarantees are capped at 70% and 80% of the loan value for big groups under the programme.
Le Maire said that rescue package also included 1 billion euros that could be loaned directly by the state to the most fragile companies that cannot get bank loans and on condition they agree to restructure.

Meanwhile, Le Maire said he had asked property owners to cancel three months of rent for companies with less than 10 employees and said bigger firms should seek to negotiate similar deals with their landlords.

709,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 05:18PM ET</span>",Thailand’s Big Stimulus Borrowing Could Spur Yield-Curve Control,"(Bloomberg) -- Follow Bloomberg on LINE messenger for all the business news and analysis you need.
Thailand’s 1 trillion baht ($30.6 billion) borrowing program for economic stimulus could spur central bank steps to keep a lid on bond yields.
The government is set to start raising money as early as May, stoking questions about the outlook for bonds. A plausible scenario is that the Bank of Thailand deploys unconventional policies to temper borrowing costs if necessary, according to DBS Group Holdings Ltd.
“The borrowing is quite sizable and will put upward pressure on longer-term government yields, all else equal,” said Eugene Leow, a fixed-income strategist at DBS in Singapore. “The Bank of Thailand could embark on quantitative easing or yield-curve control. At this point, yields still seem low.”
A senior director at the central bank, Don Nakornthab, said earlier this week it’s studied unconventional options such as a large-scale asset purchase program and some form of yield-curve control, should they be needed. The government is looking at a mix of instruments, not just sovereign bonds, for the fund raising program that could run up to September 2021.
‘Huge’ Borrowing
At 1 trillion baht, the additional borrowing is more than double the average annual budget deficit of recent years, according to Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
“How this huge borrowing plan will affect liquidity is the big question in the market now,” said Nunmanus Piamthipmanus, chief investment officer at Bangkok-based SCB Asset Management Co. “The hope is that it’s done in steps, using a variety funding sources.”
The Bank of Thailand has stepped in with a liquidity backstop for the fixed-income mutual fund and corporate bond sectors after the coronavirus pandemic stoked investor panic.
Thailand has the biggest Southeast Asian local-currency bond market, worth $446 billion at the end of 2019, according to the Asian Development Bank. Foreign ownership is low, at about 6% of outstanding debt, Thai Bond Market Association figures show.
A Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) index of Thai bonds has climbed almost 1% in dollar terms so far in April, after plunging more than 7% in March. The yield on the 10-year sovereign bond has declined to 1.35% from a recent peak of 1.79% on March 19.
Thailand relies on tourism and exports, but both are slumping amid the coronavirus outbreak, adding pressure for government stimulus.
The nation is on course for a 6.7% contraction in gross domestic product this year, the worst outlook among leading Southeast Asian economies, the International Monetary Fund estimates.

710,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 05:09PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for April 17,"By Kim Khan
Investing.com - Some late buying today left the broader market higher and the Dow cutting losses to close slightly in the green.
But it was a tentative session of trading, with investors digesting what has been (jobless claims) with what could be (the economy reopening).
Details of the plan for reopening will come later tonight and have a big effect on Friday’s market tone.
There will also be earnings form the consumer product space and more data on what is happening with demand destruction for crude.
Here are three things that could move the market tomorrow.
1. Will Trump Recommendations Encourage Investors?
U.S. futures on Friday will be heavily influenced by what President Donald Trump has to say and what details he offers at his press conference on his plan to reopen the U.S. economy.
 The press conference is expected to start at 6 PM ET (22:00 GMT).
Trump’s guidelines on reopening the U.S. economy, backed by medical experts on his coronavirus task force, will serve as recommendations for states, a senior White House official told Reuters.
""The president's new guidelines are in fact that. They are recommendations. They are flexible. They are data-driven,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""They are layered,"" the official said. ""They are signed off on and in full agreement by the medical experts on the task force.""


2. P&G Anxious to Report Earnings
Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) headlines the earnings reports tomorrow, with investors looking for a dose of encouraging news after the dive in profits from banks.
P&G, which reports fiscal third-quarter results before the bell, has already given the market a reason to be bullish.
On Tuesday, the company said it would boost its dividend by 6% and also moved up its earnings date to tomorrow from April 21. P&G said the acceleration of the reporting should not be seen as positive or negative for results, but to report as quickly and transparently as possible, Briefing.com reported.
But bulls are betting on lots of panic-buying for brands like Charmin toiler paper and Bounty paper towels.
Analysts are looking for a profit of $1.12 per share and sales of about $17.2 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Also reporting ahead of trading is oil services company Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB).
The company was downgraded by  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and Scotiabank this week as crude faces a huge drop in demand.
Schlumberger is seen posting a profit of 26 cents per share and revenue of about $7.6 billion.
3. Rig Count Could See Another Drop
Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) also faces an environment where its customers are ramping down production.
The oil market will get more granular data on this when Baker Hughes releases its rig count tomorrow at 1 PM ET (17:00 GMT).
The oil rig count came in at 504 last week. It was up around 678 at the end of February.
WTI futures settled below $20 a barrel following another round of dour U.S. economic data and concerns about the cost and difficulty of storing oil.

711,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 04:50PM ET</span>",Coronavirus set to usher in big changes at U.S. offices,"By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The novel coronavirus may do to U.S. office rentals what e-commerce did to malls, or so goes a line of thinking running through commercial real estate circles.
If anything, millions more Americans working from home may hasten corporate moves to downsize their offices, a decade-old trend partially responsible for the office sector underperforming other property asset classes in recent years.
This has come even as the leasing business boomed in New York with a surging jobs market and economic expansion that was upended by orders to close offices to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Now technology threatens to further reduce the amount of square footage companies lease after seeing how well the work-from-home experience has fared.
Apps such as Zoom, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Hangouts have made it possible to collaborate remotely and for staff to be as productive as they are in the workplace, said Gina Szymanski, a portfolio manager at AEW Capital Management LP in Boston, one of the largest real estate investment managers.
""Work collaboration apps will likely have a long-term impact on office (space) similar to the impact that mobile shopping had on retail,"" she said. ""Corporate footprints will continue to shrink."" 
In Manhattan, whose skyscrapers have long been the most valuable U.S. property class, further downsizing could pressure leasing prices that soared to record highs during the good times but now may slip as they typically do in a recession.
Space per worker slid in half to about 150 to 125 square foot (14 to 11.5 square meters) since the financial crisis, according to conventional estimates, and coworking cut that by about half again. 
LANDLORDS NOT IN DRIVERS SEAT
Publicly traded owners of office buildings have been challenged in New York for some time. 
The share prices of SL Green Realty Corp (N:SLG) and  Vornado Realty  Trust (N:VNO), two of the city's largest landlords, slid about 20% in the five years through the end of 2019 when the S&P 500 index rose 57%. Their stock fell twice as fast in the recent downturn on concerns some tenants would be unable to pay their rent.
The age of buildings is another important factor that could hinder investment returns. Landlords have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into rejuvenating Manhattan skyscrapers built as recently as the late 1990s. Such spending has been seen in many U.S. cities to protect an asset values.
""It's going to accelerate this move to newer office space and it's going to suck the life out of non-quality assets, this transition from older stock,"" said Scott Crowe, chief investment strategist at real estate-focused CenterSquare Investment Management in Philadelphia, who added that the premium between new and old space has been increasing ""exponentially.""
Manhattan is in the midst of the biggest boom of new office towers since the 1980s. Data from brokerage Newmark Knight Frank shows 13.1 million square feet (1.22 million square meters) still under construction - just 3% of the city's stock but a big factor if the economic slump increases office vacancies.
Office space in the tony Far West Side, Plaza District and Park Avenue, where many hedge funds reside, costs more than $100 a square foot, while older buildings just south of Times Square (NYSE:SQ), and swaths of downtown, rent for half that rate.
Companies typically lease 20% more space than they need, to allow for workforce growth. 
Utilization studies show that often just 40% to 60% of workspace is occupied, which has led some companies to sublease extra space or turn it into collaborative areas, said Steven South, design director at architectural firm Spectorgroup in New York.
""If you're not utilizing your space all the time, it has an impact on revenue costs,"" South said.
SOCIAL DISTANCE 
Professional and financial services firms may reduce space more than others because so much work is done at functions outside the office. But not all firms will downsize.
Tech companies, a major driving force in new job creation, want their workforce at the office, South said. For every dedicated spot at a hot desk, an equal amount of space is assigned in common areas for collaborative work, he said. 
Scott Nelson, chief executive of occupier services at Atlanta-based brokerage Colliers International, said that while office space demand overall will slacken as companies accommodate a workforce that chooses to work from home, some will rent the same amount of space, but design it less densely for fewer workers to maintain social distancing.
Elevators get complicated. Maintaining six feet of distance means long ground-floor lines to get to the office, a certain discouragement for commuters, unless more elevator banks are installed. 
""Companies are going to reevaluate everything from the size of their locations to the concentration of their locations to the actual location of markets they're in,"" Nelson said. 

""It will be a tenant market,"" he said. ""There is the potential that urban centers become less attractive too.""

712,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 04:18PM ET</span>",Chubb CEO Warns Retroactive Measures Would ‘Bankrupt’ Industry,"(Bloomberg) -- Chubb (NYSE:CB) Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Evan Greenberg has a stark warning for policy makers pushing insurers to pay out some uncovered business-interruption losses.
“The insurance industry is a fundamental part of the economic plumbing of this country,” Greenberg said in an interview Thursday. Forcing insurers to foot the bill for losses not covered by policies “would do great damage. It would bankrupt the industry.”
The coronavirus pandemic has stirred up a debate among insurers, policyholders and other stakeholders about who will be responsible for the estimated billions of dollars in losses that companies face from widespread shutdowns across the country. Insurance companies have warned that many business-interruption policies aren’t designed to cover pandemics, which create catastrophic losses.
“Pandemics, unlike other catastrophes such as a hurricane or an earthquake, are not limited by geography or time,” Greenberg said. “The loss potential from a pandemic, in practical terms, is infinite, and insurance companies have only finite balance sheets.”
Lawmakers in states including New Jersey have considered legislation forcing insurers to pay out certain interruption losses for small businesses, with some bills requiring insurers to pay out even if policies explicitly excluded losses from viruses. The American Property Casualty Insurance Association has estimated that companies with 100 employees or fewer could see business continuity losses of as much as $431 billion a month, compared with the $800 billion in total surplus for all U.S. home, auto and business insurers.
The industry would be damaged by any measures to retroactively force insurers to pay out for losses that policies didn’t cover and weren’t priced for, Greenberg said. He argued that the insurers would fight back, and called it unconstitutional to try to rewrite contracts. The only entity that has the financial resources to deal with the tail risk of a pandemic is the government itself, he said.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
“P&C insurers, including Travelers (NYSE:TRV) and Hartford, face a bigger risk from states potentially forcing the payment of uncovered claims versus early business interruption lawsuits, where they have the edge, in our view.”
--Matthew Palazola, senior industry analyst, and Elliott Stein, senior litigation analyst
Greenberg said that a potential way to handle pandemic risks in the future would be to create a public-private partnership, where insurers could start covering that risk for a proper price and the government could take on the tail-risk exposure. That model would echo efforts by the government and insurance industry to deal with terrorism risks after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
He cautioned, however, that affordability would become a major question. Insurers will need to set prices to appropriately account for the heightened risk, but that could mean policyholders might shy away from coverage because of the higher cost.
Greenberg has built Chubb into a huge insurer, with a market capitalization more than double that of rival American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG)., once run by his father, Maurice “Hank” Greenberg. Chubb insures high-net-worth individuals and corporations across the globe, offering companies coverage for risks such as cyber, environmental and professional liability.
President Donald Trump recently named Greenberg to the economic revival industry groups as the government tries to figure out how to restart the economy. Chubb’s CEO said that executives he’s spoken with are thoughtful about prioritizing the safety of workers. It will be key that there’s the ability to test for the coronavirus in a rapid and accurate manner to help contain it, he said.
Certainty Needed
Also necessary for getting the economy back on track will be giving businesses certainty around legal risks that could crop up from Covid-19, he said. He urged Congress to consider granting limited immunity from litigation that arises from coronavirus-related issues, except in cases of gross negligence. While his company offers some coverage for corporate liability risks, the threat of litigation affects a wider swath of businesses, he said.
“There are things that we can and should do to provide a greater degree of certainty, and relieve the economy and business of unnecessary financial burden in the short and medium term,” Greenberg said. “I’m not talking about giving immunity to insurance companies. I’m talking about business and corporate America and nonprofits.”
Greenberg warned that the economy will likely face a deep recession, with some companies and industries faring better than others, and cautioned that a timeline for reopening businesses is uncertain. But if the economy starts opening in a prudent way in the near future, some meaningful economic activity could return by the third quarter with more normalcy in the fourth, he said.
The country’s ingenuity and ability to innovate offers hope for a way back, he said.
“In that regard, I’m optimistic and I don’t count Americans out,” Greenberg said. “I think we can have a pretty darn good 2021.”

713,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 04:14PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Cuts Losses as Traders Eye Trump Update on Reopening Economy,"By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com – The Dow cut its losses and ended higher Thursday, shrugging off a surge in jobless claims as investors awaited an update from President Donald Trump on the prospect of reopening the economy, even as several states extended lockdown measures.
The Dow rose 0.14%, or 33 points, theS&P 500 was up 0.58% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.66%.
Trump is set to detail guidelines for opening up America again in a news conference at 6 PM ET (2200 GMT). The press conference comes as the president has recently claimed ""ultimate authority"" on making the call to restart the economy, much to the bemusement of several governors, including New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.
Cuomo, as well as several other governors of Northeastern states, agreed to extended current lockdown measures into mid-May.
The lockdown measures across the country to stem the Covid-19 pandemic have wreaked havoc on the economy, particularly in the labor market, as shuttered businesses have led to a surge in unemployment claims.
Jobless claims surged by 5.2 million last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday, taking the four-week total to 22 million, wiping out nearly all of the 22.442 million jobs created since November 2009.
In manufacturing, the Philadephia Fed's manufacturing index fell to a reading of -56.6, the lowest reading since reading since July 1980.
The gloomy economic background was reflected in the earnings seen so far this week from Wall Street banks.  
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) ended down 0.1% after reporting a 30% drop in profit, adding to a string of poor quarterly results from Wall Street banks, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), showing steep declines in profit.
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), meanwhile, rose 3.5%, even as the asset manager reported that funds under management fell below $7 trillion after profit slumped 23%.
Just days after agreeing a  $50 billion bailout package with the Treasury, airline stocks slumped sharply amid concerns the sector is set for a long road to recovery.
""I don’t think air travel will snap right back to where it was here this year, maybe it will come back next year,"" said Southwest CEO Gary Kelly. ""If this is a real recession and a bad recession, it could take four or five years.""
United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) fell 11%, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) dropped 10% and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) slipped 6.5%.
Tech, however, was up sharply thanks to a surge in chip stocks underpinned by encouraging quarterly results from chip bellwether Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM).
For the quarter, Taiwan Semi reported earnings and revenue that topped analysts' consensus estimates.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was also in the spotlight as the streaming device maker is expected to report a jump in new users amid a favorable backdrop as more people turn to streaming giant to pass the time during the government-imposed lockdown measures. Shares rose nearly 3%."

PARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - L'Oreal (PA:OREP) is counting on consumers rushing back to hair salons to help its business recover quickly once European and U.S. coronavirus lockdowns are lifted, it said on Thursday, adding that beauty sales were bouncing back already in China. 
Like peers, the French firm, which makes Garnier shampoo and Lancome creams, has been hit by the closure of airport duty-free shops, department stores and salons as countries restrict people's movements to fight the pandemic. 
Confinement measures have dragged on make-up sales, with about 90% of women shunning their cosmetic routines while working from home, according to a survey by Jefferies. 
But L'Oreal, the world's biggest beauty firm by sales, provided an upbeat outlook despite a 4.8% fall in comparable first-quarter sales, in a potential boost for some rivals like U.S.-based  Estee Lauder  (N:EL). 
It pointed to a turnaround in China, where sales rose 6.4% in the January to March period, and lockdown measures have eased.
Skin and hair-care products did well during the confinement period there as e-commerce sales surged, L'Oreal Chief Executive Jean-Paul Agon said, and other items are now in demand too, even if some make-up products are lagging as Chinese consumers wear face masks to return to work.
""It is not of course a great incentive to wear lipstick,"" Agon told analysts. 
""Once stores will be open again ... I think we will be back to a consumption pretty similar to what we have seen before,"" he said of other countries. 
L'Oreal did not provide an earnings forecast for 2020, and analysts expect the sales drop will worsen in the second quarter as the European and U.S. closures bite. But revenue from China, L'Oreal's biggest market, could increase over 10% in the April to June period, Agon said. 
The company also provides products for professional hairdressers, which could be a bright spot later this year, with Agon citing a ""dire need"" expressed by many women to touch up their hair colour. 
""This frustration will create a strong return trend (to salons),"" he said. 
NAIL CARE IN, FAKE TAN OUT
Beauty treatments like hair cuts and eyebrow waxing were the activity people were most looking forward to once lockdowns are lifted, research by consultancy Kantar showed last week. 
Cosmetics firms, meanwhile, have been trying to make up for lost business by selling more online.
Zalando (DE:ZALG), Europe's biggest pure online fashion retailer, said on Thursday that beauty items were performing well. 
""We receive three times as many orders of skin care, nail care, hair care, and beauty accessories compared to the same time last year,"" a Zalando spokeswoman said, adding that detox products and candles were also popular. 
Not all products are garnering the same demand, however, and unlike Estee Lauder and Guerlain-owner LVMH (PA:LVMH), which are largely focused on luxury cosmetics, L'Oreal has the advantage of also selling its lower-end ranges in supermarkets, which remain open. 
LVMH reported a steeper 18% fall in comparable first-quarter revenues for its perfume and cosmetics business on Thursday. 
Britain's PZ Cussons (L:PZC) said demand for its Carex hand wash and Imperial leather soap was surging due to the pandemic, but products like its fake tan lines were struggling.
L'Oreal's first-quarter sales reached 7.2 billion euros ($7.8 billion), down 4.3% on a reported basis from a quarter earlier, and dropping 4.8% drop like-for-like, which strips out the effects of acquisitions and currency swings.
Online sales accounted for nearly 20% of revenue.

The group said it had put off some product launches planned for the second quarter and would slash advertising spending temporarily to keep a lid on costs.

715,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 04:08PM ET</span>","Intuitive Surgical Earnings, Revenue Beat in Q1","Investing.com - Intuitive Surgical on Thursday reported first-quarter earnings that beat analysts' forecasts and revenue that topped expectations.
Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) rose 0.5% in after-hours trade.
Intuitive Surgical announced earnings per share of $2.69 on revenue of $1.10 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $2.68 on revenue of $1.06 billion. That compares to to EPS of $2.61 on revenue of $973.7 million in the same period a year before. Intuitive Surgical had reported EPS of $3.48 on revenue of $1.28 billion in the previous quarter.
Higher first-quarter revenue was driven by increased procedures and systems placements as well as higher service and operating lease revenue, the company said.Instruments and accessories revenue increased by 12% and systems revenue increased by 14% to $283 million.
""For the first two and a half months of the first quarter of 2020, procedure performance was trending at the higher end of our expectations. However, as noted in the company's April 8 press release, the company experienced a significant decline in procedure volume and postponements of system placements in the latter half of March in the U.S. and Western Europe, as healthcare systems in those areas diverted resources to meet the increasing demands of managing COVID-19,"" Intuitive Surgical said in a release.
Analysts were expecting the company guided EPS of $2.26 and revenue of $1.01 billion in the upcoming quarter, but the company decided against offering guidance due to a lack of visibility caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
""Due to the uncertain scope and duration of the pandemic, and uncertain timing of global recovery and economic normalization, we cannot, at this time, reliably estimate the future impact on our operations and financial results,"" Intuitive Surgical added.

716,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 04:00PM ET</span>",Your Money: Why you might be afraid to spend your stimulus check,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - If you got your stimulus payment this week from the IRS and it is still in your account, are you afraid to spend it? 
Many recipients immediately deployed the money they received as part of the CARES Act - up to $1,200 per adult and $500 per child - for urgent necessities, including food, rent and unpaid bills. Some did not even have the deposit register before it was swept away to cover overdrafts, unless they use a bank which pledged not to do this https://reut.rs/2KaB32r.
If you are lucky enough to not to need the money right away, it may just sit there staring at you from your balance sheet. There are all sorts of suggestions for ways to make use of it: buy gift cards from local businesses, prepay your mortgage or fund a Roth IRA contribution - but that may not encourage you to budge. 
When it comes down to it, you may be too anxious to spend it anyway. Sarah Newcomb, director of behavioral science at fund research firm Morningstar, studies how people react to sudden influxes of cash, known as the windfall effect, and this is not it. 
""This is different, coming at a time when people are feeling financially stressed,"" Newcomb said. 
People generally put found money in a category of ""fun"" and spend it accordingly. When it is expected money like a tax refund, they tend to be practical and do things like pay down debt or make a large planned purchases. 
Newcomb said she did not yet know what she was going to do with the deposit that had just landed in her own account. Her behavior is akin to those she has studied - it is not something she is going to spend frivolously. 
""I had thought, if I get anything, I want to find a family that needs it, and give it to them,"" Newcomb said. ""But once it hit my bank account, it was there. It's hard to let go of money when you feel scared.""
Personal finance guru Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, chief executive of AskTheMoneyCoach.com and author of “Zero Debt,"" is a proponent of simply saving it. Do not tie it up in prepayments and do not feel bad about not contributing it back to the local businesses. 
""It’s nobody’s job individually to act as a financial Hercules. You don’t have to single-handedly hold up the U.S. economy,"" Khalfani-Cox said. ""Right now, we just don’t know how protracted this crisis will be, and more people will be better off conserving cash.""
Not spending has consequences, too. The government intended the stimulus to help get the economy going again. People need money to move and change hands, and every transaction that gets halted ripples out to affect many people.
One way Newcomb has found that shifts behavior in situations like these is to turn anxiety into excitement - a theory called anxiety reappraisal in a paper by Harvard Business School professor Alison Wood Brooks that Newcomb cites in her work. 
""If we could trust that we will find a solution to the virus, then I think we would all feel easier about letting that money go. There has to be a sense that you’re going to be OK. That’s the missing piece,"" Newcomb said. 
Until that happens, some people are being motivated by the spirit of philanthropy. Certified financial planner Monica Dwyer, based in West Chester, Ohio, has a client who is giving away his check to charity. 

""He said that he was going to donate his check to a fund for local people in the restaurant industry, such as waitresses and waiters who have lost their jobs. I thought that was so inspiring, considering that this client is a regular guy who could use the money,"" Dwyer said.

717,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 03:45PM ET</span>",U.S. High Yield Funds See Record Inflow With Fed Poised to Buy,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. junk-bonds saw a record $7.66 billion fund inflow as investors followed the Federal Reserve, which plans to buy the debt. The increase through April 15 is the third straight weekly gain this month, including the prior peak of $7.1 billion on April 1, according to Refinitiv Lipper.
Risk assets have benefited from stimulus programs enacted to shore up the economy as the fallout from the virus continues to wreak havoc. The extra yield investors demand to own junk bonds instead of Treasuries narrowed to 740 basis points as of Wednesday, according to the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) U.S. Corporate High-Yield index. Spreads had reached 1,100 basis points on March 23, the widest since the 2008 global financial crisis.
“You can thank the Fed,” said Greg Zappin, a money manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management. “High-yield spreads have tightened about 300 basis points and the market is open to issuance, so I’m not surprised money is flowing in.”
Investment-grade funds saw an inflow for the first time since February, taking in $5.8 billion, the Refinitiv Lipper data show. Leveraged loan funds took in $30 million, the first net gain since January.

718,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 03:09PM ET</span>",BofA Gets States That Want to Borrow Now Rather Than Wait on Fed,"(Bloomberg) -- Some states aren’t waiting on the Federal Reserve to help with the historic hits to their budgets. Instead, they’re working with a lender that they have a much longer history with: Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).
At least three -- Hawaii, Massachusetts and Rhode Island -- have taken steps to borrow from the bank to cover temporary cash shortfalls as the shut down of broad swaths of the economy crimps their tax revenues.
On Wednesday, Hawaii disclosed in a regulatory filing that Bank of America would purchase $600 million in general-obligation bond anticipation notes, the same type of debt that the Fed will purchase in its first ever move into the $3.9 trillion municipal-bond market. Massachusetts Treasurer Deb Goldberg is considering taking out a loan of about $1 billion from Bank of America and other banks. At the end of March, before the Fed announced its lending program, Rhode Island also entered into a $150 million note purchase agreement with Bank of America, according to a regulatory filing.
The moves come as states and cities are bracing for what may be the biggest fiscal crisis they’ve seen in decades, with budget shortfalls expected to outstrip those brought on by the real-estate collapse that set off the last recession. Anticipating a surge in borrowing that could destabilize the municipal securities market, the Fed last week said it would extend as much as $500 billion of loans to states, Washington, D.C., and some of the most-populous cities and counties.
The central bank hasn’t released details about the intricacies of the program, including how much it will charge for the loans, and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). has estimated it could take weeks for the program to start dispensing funds.
Municipal Market Analytics, an independent research firm, said in an April 13 report that it’s seen a growing number of governments selling debt directly to banks or taking out lines of credit. It’s an understandable and prudent move by states given that working with a bank is a fast way to get cash, said Matt Fabian, a partner at the firm.
“It also puts them at the front of the line of other issuers who might want to take out lines of credit later,” he said.
For lenders like Bank of America, the biggest underwriter of municipal bonds, such loans will help them offset a steep drop in the pace of debt sales since the market was rattled by a record-setting sell-off as investors pulled billions from mutual funds. Even with the market rebounding, in part because of the Fed’s moves, long-term bond sales this month have declined 40% from a year ago.
Goldberg, the treasurer of Massachusetts, told lawmakers that the state is in the “final stages” of securing a working capital borrowing facility with a syndicate of banks led by Bank of America. That will give the state flexibility to draw down funds as needed during a time of delayed revenues as the tax deadline is pushed back, she told lawmakers during a hearing on April 14.
Hawaii’s taxable notes mature in October 2021 and yield 1.76%, according to terms included in the regulatory filing.

Investing.com – The S&P continued to swing between gains and losses on Thursday, as a rally in Netflix and Amazon supported investor sentiment even as the latest surge in weekly jobless claims and plunge in manufacturing activity underscored the Covid-19 impact on the economy.
Dow fell 0.26%, or 60 points, theS&P 500 was up 0.17% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.91%.
Jobless claims surged by 5.2 million last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday, taking the four-week total to 22 million, wiping out nearly all of the 22.442 million jobs created since November 2009.
Adding to the round of dire manufacturing data seen this week, the Philadephia Fed's manufacturing index fell to a reading of -56.6, the lowest reading since reading since July 1980.
The gloomy economic background, driven by the Covid-19 pandemic, has prompted some to bet on companies expected to thrive in the new, albeit eerier, environment, like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), both of which hit all-time highs intraday, up about 3%.
Energy, meanwhile, weighed on the broader market as oil prices headed toward the lows of the day amid ongoing worries about a glut in supply.
Investor sentiment on oil, however, had been helped by reports the U.S. is mulling plans to pay domestic drillers to stop production in a bid to trim supply and save jobs.
Financials also contributed to the selling on Wall Street as the parade of weak earnings from the banks continued to stoke investor jitters.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) was flat after the bank reported a 30% drop in profit, adding to a string of quarterly results from Wall Street banks, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), showing a steep decline in profit.
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), meanwhile, rose 4%, even as the asset manager reported that funds under management fell below $7 trillion after profit slumped 23%.
A 7% fall in Boeing (NYSE:BA) and a plunge in airline stocks, meanwhile, pushed industrials down more than 1%. 
United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) down 11%, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) off 9% and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) off 6%, were among the biggest declines. "

Measures to curb the movement of people, imposed to contain the spread of the virus, have hit car sales hard, leading Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) on Thursday to abandon its full year outlook and issue a profit warning.
As Germany prepares to ease lockdown measures which will allow car dealerships to reopen, lobby group VDA said demand needed to a boost. 
""There is currently no reason for optimism. It is likely that economic support measures will be necessary in order to revive overall economic demand and, in particular, the demand for vehicles,"" Hildegard Mueller, president of German auto industry association VDA said in a statement on Thursday. 
How such incentives should be structured and funded depends on how well demand rebounds after Germany loosens lockdown measures, Mueller said. 
""We will only be able to estimate what is actually necessary once the car dealerships have opened. Then we will see how customers will behave.""
Politicians and the auto industry need to act in a timely fashion, she cautioned. ""It will be too late to talk about possible demand impulses in autumn.""
Mueller's remarks, made on Wednesday and published by the VDA on Thursday, follow calls for state aid made by Bavarian premier Markus Soeder on April 8. 
At the time, he called for a cash-for-clunkers scrappage scheme to boost low emission cars, an idea which was immediately endorsed by BMW’s Chief Executive Oliver Zipse. 
“We need to have another very specific discussion about how we can strengthen the automotive sector. And I think it is necessary to develop a model similar to the scrappage scheme in order to give a massive boost to domestic demand,"" Soeder said, adding that measures were needed to boost demand for low emission vehicles in particular. 
""Let's be quite honest, all the new engines have not yet been as successful on the market as we thought. Now is the chance to start a project in which we can promote cars in Germany with an innovation premium.""
Stephan Weil, the premier of Lower Saxony, the German state which owns a 20% stake in Volkswagen, this week told Hannoverschen Allgemeine Zeitung that the country needed an ""eco scrappage scheme"" to boost demand for electric and hybrid cars.
Tobias Austrup, a transport specialist at environmental lobby group Greenpeace, also welcomed the idea.

""It is good that Weil and Soeder link any state aid for the car industry to ecological progress this time. If all taxpayers make this money available, then everyone must benefit from it - for example through better air, less climate damage and secure jobs.""

Once struggling with the first large outbreak outside China, South Korea has largely managed to bring its coronavirus cases under control without major disruptions thanks to a massive testing campaign and intensive contact tracing.

""For customers who want to make a purchase, we have several options including ordering online for delivery or pick up in store."" 

Apple's plan of reopening the store in Seoul comes a day after it released a smaller iPhone priced at $399, to broaden its appeal to budget-conscious customers as the COVID-19 pandemic hobbles the global economy.

Globally, the tally of 'fallen angels' -- companies or countries whose ratings have been cut to below investment-grade -- has already jumped to 23, the highest since 2015, from just 2 at the end of January.
The list of potential fallen angels has grown substantially as well, especially in sectors where revenues are under pressure from measures to halt the spread of the new coronavirus, such as social distancing and the abrupt shutdown of travel.
S&P said that in March alone, 43 names were added to the list of potential fallen angels, and with 20 more in the first two weeks of April, the total now stands at 96 -- the highest count since the financial crisis.
Becoming a 'fallen angel' can set off a wave of problems.
It automatically excludes the country or company's bonds from certain high-profile investment indexes, which means conservative funds -- active managers as well as passive ""trackers"" -- are no longer able to buy and sell them. 
It can also cut the bonds' value as collateral in central bank funding operations.

Italy has extended limits on movement and manufacturing to curb the spread of the coronavirus until May 3, although Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said he would continue to assess daily infection trends and ""act accordingly"".
This has raised expectations that some manufacturing, even though not deemed essential, could resume beforehand, provided health and safety measures were in place to protect workers. 
CNH, which makes farm machinery, Iveco commercial vehicles, construction equipment and powertrains, has shut most of its assembly plants in Europe, North America and South America. 
The FIM, FIOM, UILM, FISMIC, UGLM and AQCFR unions said in a joint statement that the measures agreed with CNH were the same as those in a similar deal finalised last week with automaker  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA).
They include rearranging assembly layouts, staggering shifts, testing workers' temperatures and providing face masks. 
""The deal will be in force until the end of the emergency and is open to future amendments,"" the unions said.
CNH (MI:CNHI) will start offering employees voluntary blood tests at its pilot plant in the northern Italian city of Bolzano, where it produces military vehicles, unions said. 
Both CNH and Fiat Chrysler (FCA) are controlled by  EXOR  (MI:EXOR), the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family.

729,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 01:18PM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley Sees the Wealthy Sticking With Cash,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Count Morgan Stanley’s wealth-management clients among those who aren’t entirely convinced that the worst of the market turbulence is over.
The bank was the last of the top Wall Street firms to report first-quarter earnings, and its results Thursday were largely more of the same. It posted its best trading performance in more than a decade, helping to soften the blow across other divisions. The one area that  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) could provide further insight was a peek into the minds of wealthy individual clients. It didn’t disappoint.
Jonathan Pruzan, Morgan Stanley’s chief financial officer, said in conference call with analysts that deposits increased by almost $30 billion in March alone, with people in its wealth-management system shifting out of equities and into cash. “Most of that excess cash is undeployed,” he said. “Our expectations are it will be sticky for a while.”
Gerard Cassidy at RBC Capital Markets snuck in a final question, asking Pruzan to elaborate on clients’ 23% cash allocation and when he’d expect them to start investing in equities or other risk assets again. Here’s what the CFO said:
“That’s a great question, in terms of how our retail clients are going to re-engage with the market.
The 23% is cash or cash equivalents including money market and short-term fixed-income securities. That number is probably up 3 to 4 points in the last quarter or two and if you look at the totality of the money, the $2.4 trillion, the equity allocation has gone from 55 down to 50 and most of that has gone into this cash and short-term securities.
How long people feel the need to stay in short-term and cash is going to be a function of some of the things we’ve been talking about on this call. People’s perspective on when the economy opens up again, or the work from home ceases and some of the restaurants and businesses get back into business and people feel more comfortable with the outlook.
That’s why we’re also not fully deploying those deposits, because again they are generally very sticky, but they’re also based on the investment decisions of our clients.”
It’s no secret, of course, that money-market funds have experienced huge inflows in recent weeks. Assets under management have grown by almost $1 trillion just since the end of February, reaching $4.47 trillion as of April 8, easily topping the prior record of $3.92 trillion in January 2009, according to Investment Company Institute data.
Still, you’d be forgiven for forgetting that many people are still skittish, given that the S&P 500 bounced back as much as 30% from its intraday low on March 23. Plus, it seems like every day another investment firm is raising billions of dollars for an opportunistic credit fund. Just on Wednesday, for instance, Bloomberg News reported that Fortress Investment Group is talking to investors about amassing at least $3 billion to wager on high-yield bonds and rescue capital situations, while Oaktree Capital Group LLC is seeking $15 billion to start the largest-ever distressed-debt fund.
Morgan Stanley’s vantage point suggests a chasm between individuals and institutions in when and how they choose to allocate money during the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
As I wrote last month, distressed-debt funds have been sitting on cash for years waiting for the kind of chaos in credit markets during March. Their biggest fear is the best bargains will be gone in a few months. Indeed, Howard Marks, the co-founder of Oaktree Capital Group, wrote a letter this week blasting the Federal Reserve for buying junk-rated bonds under the guise of “moral hazard,” but reading between the lines it boils down to frustration that debt prices won’t tumble further and give his firm a chance to sift through the wreckage.
Who is backing these strategies? It’s hard to know for sure, but it’s well-known that underfunded public pensions have been focusing more on riskier corners of fixed income to juice returns. At the onset of the last recession, some turned specifically to distressed-debt investments. These are huge pools of money whose managers seem to think they can’t afford to wait until there’s an all-clear on the economy to start taking risks.
If Morgan Stanley is right, wealthy individuals will be more patient. That means watching these investors might just be the better indicator of when confidence in the U.S. and global economic outlook has truly taken a turn for the better. People who are well-off financially don’t need to be overly cautious. But they also don’t need to blindly swing for the fences and risk striking out, either.

731,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 01:05PM ET</span>",Italy's fashion leaders urge Rome to lift restrictions on industry,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's fashion leaders called on the government on Thursday to loosen restrictions imposed in response to the coronavirus crisis to allow them to resume some production, warning that a prolonged lockdown risked irreparably damaging the sector.
""Fashion is a seasonal industry, and certain dates are not compressible. Not reopening shortly would mean giving up almost a year's turnover,"" said Carlo Capasa, the chairman of Italy's National Fashion Chamber (CNMI), in an online interview on the website of daily Corriere della Sera.
Current lockdown measures in Italy - the country with the third highest number of confirmed cases after the United States and Spain - have been imposed until May 3.
The government has not disclosed how and when it will start easing a nationwide ban on business activities deemed as non-essential. 
Fashion and textile plants throughout the country have shut as they do not fall into the category of essential businesses.
Many labels have reconverted production to make medical devices such as masks and medical overalls to meet rising demand during the emergency.
With a turnover of 95 billion euros ($98 billion) and 600,000 workers, Italy's fashion and textile industry is the second most important nationwide. 
It accounts for a 41% share of the sector in Europe, followed by Germany, which represents 11% of the total. 
Capasa suggested April 20 as a date to gradually reopen manufacturing activities in order to deliver fall/winter collections on time to shops around the world, and start production of spring/summer collections.
""We are closed, but other countries like France, Spain, Portugal, Turkey are starting to reopen"" said Claudio Marenzi, who is in charge of fashion at business lobby Confindustria, pointing out that the ban also had implications for Italy as a supplier. 
""This means that some brands may decide to switch to another supply chain, which in Italy is mainly made up of small companies. And once a company closes, you lose the know-how and you never recover,"" he added.
Confindustria Moda represents 65,000 companies in the textile, fashion and accessories sectors. Most are small firms with only 15-20 employees, with sales highly dependent on foreign buyers. 
Marenzi said Confindustria Moda had signed an agreement with unions over stringent health and security measures to adopt at production sites once these are allowed to reopen. 
""(The deal) shows that entrepreneurs and workers are aligned in their will to restart activities and save the Italian fashion industry,"" he said.

""An economic epidemic could cause more lasting damage than the health one. If we have to live with this virus for so long, then let's live with it,"" Marenzi said, adding that if the industry could safely make masks and gowns, it could also make clothes.

733,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>",Explainer: The Russell index reconstitution is coming up. What is it?,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Market participants are beginning to gear up preparations for the annual reconstitution by FTSE Russell of its indexes at the end of June. The event often results in the highest volume trading day of the year.
Recent market volatility has heightened the likelihood for more changes than usual in this year's revamp, although FTSE Russell currently intends to move forward as planned. 
WHAT IS THE RECONSTITUTION?
Every year, FTSE Russell reconstitutes, or refreshes, the components in its range of indexes, such as the Russell 2000 (RUT) index of small-cap stocks and Russell 1000 (RUI) index of large-cap names. Together they make up the Russell 3000 <.RUA> index. There are also style indexes such as the Russell 1000 growth (RLG) and Russell 200 value <.RUJ>. FTSE Russell says more than $15 trillion is currently benchmarked to its indexes globally and about $9 trillion to its U.S. indexes. 
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE MARKET?
While some index providers choose to constantly refresh their indexes in order to keep a fixed amount of components in them, FTSE Russell only reconstitutes once per year, with the exception of adding initial public offerings on a quarterly basis. This once-a-year change prompts fund managers to adjust their portfolios to reflect the new weightings and components. The telegraphed fashion of the reconstitution also creates additional demand for buying and selling stocks as some investors may see the additional liquidity as an opportunity to take advantage of any price dislocations that may result. 
This additional trading volume reaches its apex right at the close of the trading session before the reconstitution is final towards the end of June. During the June 2019 reconstitution, Nasdaq (O:NDAQ) said 1.279 billion shares representing $42.59 billion were executed in its ""closing cross"" in 1.14 seconds across Nasdaq listed stocks. 
WHAT IS THE SCHEDULE?
Given the size of the trade and amount of stocks involved, FTSE Russell takes steps to be transparent https://www.ftserussell.com/press/ftse-russell-announces-2020-russell-us-indexes-reconstitution-schedule regarding the rules for inclusion, which are announced starting in May with its ""rank day,"" which determines the market capitalization bands a stock must be within for inclusion. Steps after that include the publishing of preliminary shares and free float information for constituents along with a query period, and preliminary lists of the additions and deletions from the indexes. The list becomes official this year after the close of trading on June 26. Jefferies anticipates the range for the Russell 2000 between $4.1 billion to about $60 million, with the market cap band for the Russell 1000 between $1.26 trillion and $1.5 billion. 
WHAT ARE THE RULES/CHANGES?
In years past, Russell announced various rule changes to its methodology which allowed investors to anticipate some stocks that were candidates for inclusion or deletion. One rule change allowed companies with multiple share classes to be included or remain in the indexes, such as Google parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL). Domicile rules dictate that a company will be allocated to a single country, which in the past brought about the removal of Restaurant Brands (N:QSR), the company formed by the takeover of Tim Hortons by Burger King, as it was reclassified as a Canadian company. 
WHAT IS DIFFERENT THIS YEAR?
FTSE Russell has not announced any significant rule changes for 2020, reiterating its 2019 rule on suspended stocks, minimum voting rights and equity offerings. And while some index providers delayed their quarterly rebalancing at the end of March due to the coronavirus-driven market volatility, Russell has no current plans to change the schedule, but said they ""continue to monitor the environment."" 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) anticipates a very high turnover this year due to the volatility, with 42 Russell 2000 stocks moving up to the Russell 1000 and 47 Russell 1000 stocks moving down to the Russell 2000. Some of those names include  Zoom Video Communications  (O:ZM), Slack Technologies (N:WORK) and Crowdstrike Holdings (O:CRWD), which have risen in price thanks to government lockdowns designed to stem the coronavirus spread, and no longer are excluded because of Russell's rule requiring at least 5% of a company's voting rights to be in publicly traded shares.

738,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 12:00PM ET</span>","Argentine black market peso hits low, risk rises before debt proposal","By Cassandra Garrison and Walter Bianchi
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's black market peso and its official currency both hit new lows on Thursday ahead of the country's long-anticipated offer to creditors for restructuring about $70 billion in debt. 
Latin America's third largest economy is set to make its proposal to international creditors later on Thursday in order to push back payments on bonds issued under foreign law.
With the proposal already delayed from Argentina's target date of March 31 due to the coronavirus pandemic, bondholders said they are preparing for steep losses amid a lack of information from the government.
Traders said the black market peso fell to 100 per U.S. dollar, a historic low which marked a 15% loss since March 19. 
Argentina's official peso  was 0.18% weaker at 65.74 per U.S. dollar, also hitting a new low. Country risk rose by 37 basis points to 4,031, according to the JP Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus <11emj>.
Meanwhile, Argentina's over-the-counter bonds  rose by 0.6% on speculative buying of stocks and bonds, traders said.
The government has told its creditors the country will need substantial debt relief and that any offer will have to be sustainable, even as the pandemic underscores the prospect of a deep recession for the country this year.
Investors have said they expect haircuts and coupon reductions in Argentina's initial offer, though the proposal could be just a first step in a lengthy negotiation process.
Nikhil Sanghani, a London-based economist at Capital Economics, said analysts will be watching the offer closely for signs of debt sustainability. 

""We think that Argentina needs debt relief of around $85 billion to $100 billion, as opposed to the International Monetary Fund's estimate of $50 billion to $85 billion, to return its public debt to a sustainable level,"" Sanghani said.

739,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",U.S. Stocks on Brink of Record Versus World While Virus Rages,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. might lead the globe in coronavirus infections, but that’s done little to dent its leadership in the financial world.
Investors are flocking to their “America First” playbook, belying the worst plunge in industrial production since 1946, the historic slump in retail sales and a 5 million surge in the jobless total.
The MSCI USA Index is trading near a record two-decade high versus the rest of the world. For the first time ever, the Nasdaq 100 is more valuable than the European benchmark. Emerging-market shares are the cheapest versus the S&P 500 since 2008.
Thank the famed resilience of tech giants, the mercifully low weighting of cyclical sectors in U.S. stock indexes and the biggest Federal Reserve put in history.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). is among those telling rich clients to hide in American shares as the global downturn takes hold.
It’s a high-risk strategy. While the peak of the outbreak may be near, the economic pain is far from easing if this week’s data is anything to go by. America First trades are no-sure thing in the grip of this once-in-a-century shock.
“U.S. stocks are pricing in a V-shaped economic recovery even more keenly than elsewhere in the world, so are vulnerable in the case that exits from lockdowns globally and in the U.S. prove more complicated,” said Edmund Shing, head of global equity derivative strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA.
Under the surface, signs of nervousness abound. Risky investing strategies including small caps and cheap cyclical firms have lagged the recovery while short interest in junk bonds to stocks has risen again.
It’s doing little to dent the haven appeal of American equities. Investors surveyed by Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). this month were overweight U.S. assets along with cash and tech stocks, and underweight the euro zone as well as emerging markets.
Similarly, the greenback has extended gains, while U.S. junk bonds have rebounded more sharply than similar global notes thanks to the Fed’s pledge to scoop up riskier debt to ease financial conditions.
All that means the S&P 500 is down just 14% this year, roughly matching benchmarks in Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, economies touted as exemplary in their virus response.
That’s put Fabiana Fedeli, global head of fundamental equities at Robeco, in an allocation bind. While the fundamentals of such northeast Asian markets are recovering faster, dollar assets typically outperform in a recession.
Overall, earnings revisions have been worse for developed markets than emerging ones this year, a trend that’s likely to continue, she said.
“It is very unlikely that we will see a straight line up from here, and we should get ready for another correction,” she wrote in a note.
Given the uneven toll wrought by the virus, stock picking by country selection is key. While emerging markets such as Brazil or India may struggle to stem the fallout, North Asian markets will prove more resilient than developed nations, she said.
With growth equities trading at the highest versus value names since the dot-com era, American shares are also more vulnerable to a rotation in investing styles. An equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 is close to the lowest versus the benchmark since 2009, proof that the largest names have fueled most of the gains.
“What we are not seeing yet is a return to a market fueled by a preference for higher-risk investment targets such as small caps, high-beta stocks, and value stocks,” said Masanari Takada, a quantitative strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc.
Equity hedge funds, he estimates, are still bullish on defensives but bearish on cyclicals. Companies with global sales have also outperformed those that sell locally over the past month as domestic consumption vanishes, Goldman baskets show.
The upshot: the old rule of taking refuge in U.S. stocks should get more scrutiny this time around. At  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA, strategist Sophie Huynh reckons the market has only priced in a “soft lockdown” lasting up to 1 1/2 months, so anything longer could hit prices further.
“The sell-off was indiscriminate -- the rally is really discriminate,” she said. “For the rally to be sustainable, we would need other sectors.”

Investing.com -- The broader market was slightly higher in morning trading Thursday, helped by some solid gains in tech stocks.
By 11:30 AM ET (1530 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 98 points or 0.4%. The S&P 500 was up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5%. All three had fallen heavily on Wednesday in response to figures that showed acute drops in retail sales and industrial production in March.
Another gain from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), up 5%, helped the tech sector, while Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 4.9%.
That countered some of the pessimism caused by another huge jump in weekly jobless claims.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said earlier that 5.245 million Americans filed initial claims for jobless benefits last week, down from the previous week's 6.62 million. The number of continuing claims came in comfortably below economists' forecasts at 11.98 million. States such as California and New York, which went into lockdown earlier, showed declines in new claims.
Additionally, fresh figures showed the housing market starting to buckle under the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Housing starts in March fell 22% to their lowest since August, a figure that Oxford Economics analyst Greg Daco said was ""the tip of the iceberg.""
""Starts and permits will likely plunge in April,"" Daco said via Twitter.
However, the market is gradually getting accustomed to data that would have been unimaginable only weeks ago. 
Among individual stocks,  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) rose 0.3% after it agreed to buy BlueJeans Network, a maker of video conferencing software and rival to Zoom Video. Zoom has surged in the last few weeks, riding a wave of new users working from home. Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) stock was slightly higher after an endorsement from Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) CEO Larry Ellison, who called it an ""essential service"" on Wednesday.
 Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock rose another 16.4%, extending gains after its impressive quarterly update earlier in the week.
ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stock fell 3% after it announced further cuts to its capital spending for this year and revised down its production estimate by 225,000 barrels a day – the latest in a series of market-driven output cuts by producers who are hurting from 18-year lows in crude prices. U.S. crude prices managed to stay just above the $20 a barrel mark on Thursday.
Elsewhere, gold mining giant Newmont Goldcorp (NYSE:NEM) rose another 2% to an eight-year high after saying that gold could hit $2,000 an ounce as a result of government efforts to reflate the world economy.
Earlier,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) had rounded off the bank earnings season with a 32% drop in profit and a warning of more pain to come. Morgan Stanley stock was down 0.3%.

PARIS (Reuters) - Peugeot-owner PSA and  Renault  are planning new safety measures in a push by France's major industrial groups for a breakthrough with workers to reopen some factories before the government lifts its lockdown from mid-May, unions said. 
Japanese carmaker Toyota Motor Corp. (T:7203) on Wednesday became the first auto company with a plant in France to agree with unions a gradual restart of production from April 21 at its factory in northern France, where it makes the Yaris model.
The ramp-up comes as auto rivals elsewhere look to resume manufacturing from next week, including in Germany where some restrictions to contain the new coronavirus outbreak will be eased shortly.
In France, negotiations with labour unions have been tough, however. PSA (PA:PEUP) and Renault (PA:RENA) told Reuters they were preparing for a restart of operations, but no date had officially been set yet.
At PSA's gearbox factory in Valenciennes, where a first plan to resume production on a voluntary basis was rejected by unions in March, management and workers' representatives are to hold fresh talks on Friday.
New safety protocols are being developed by the carmakers, union members said.
These could include wearing masks, giving out individual ashtrays so that smokers do not gather in one area, and keeping the doors open to avoid contact with the handles. 
They would also entail disinfecting tools and work surfaces every 60 minutes and doubling the number of buses that pick up workers.
ENCOURAGEMENT
The French government has encouraged companies to resume production, mindful of a major hit to the economy, already expected to contract 8% this year. 
""I believe that there is a way to do it: it is not about choosing either the resumption of activity, or the health of the employees, it is both at the same time, it is doable,"" French labour minister Muriel Penicaud told LCI radio on Thursday, citing Toyota as a potential model. 
Restrictions on movement in France will not be eased until at least May 11, starting with the reopening of some stores and schools. 
French train maker  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) told Reuters on Thursday it had been progressively ramping up its activities since the beginning of April at its plants in France.
The hard-left CGT union, however, has said it still considers it premature for carmakers to resume production in late April or early May, arguing that masks are still reserved as a priority for the health workers and may not be available. 
The country's metals lobby said on Sunday that French companies in the automotive, aerospace and steel sectors were ready to return to work and assure ""impeccable, sanitary conditions"".

Renault already restarted production in Portugal and Russia on Monday.

In a video message for the company's annual shareholder meeting, which was staged remotely because of lockdowns across Europe, Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said the planemaker was wrestling with ""the gravest crisis in the history of the aviation industry"".
Airbus is talking to customers about their requests to delay deliveries and is seeking solutions case by case and aircraft by aircraft, Faury said.
The company has suspended its 2020 forecast for aircraft deliveries as airlines contend with the coronavirus-related economic and logistical challenges of taking delivery of aircraft. 
The planemaker this month said it would also cut production of its best-selling narrow-body aircraft by a third, to 40 a month, and issued targets implying a 37-43% cut in wide-body output.
Faury said the targets involved a ""reasonable"" level of production as Airbus also works to manage a backlog containing several years of unfilled orders.
Industry sources say production has slowed to a trickle for the time being as the company stabilises its supply chain and factory practices to preserve social-distancing measures, meaning it must speed up in order to reach the new goals.
France's Force Ouvriere union on Thursday said that operations were also being hampered by a shortage of personal protection equipment in the aerospace supply chain and called on Airbus to ensure those workers are protected.

With Thursday's meeting being held remotely, only a handful of investors were expected to attend in Amsterdam, where lawyers of the Dutch-registered company were on hand to field questions before the formal adoption of a new chairman.

756,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 09:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Hedge fund Elliott says stocks could fall 50% from February highs - letter,"By Lawrence Delevingne and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire Paul Singer’s Elliott Management said global stocks could tumble more -- ultimately losing half of their value from February's high -- as the world braces for the deepest recession since the 1930s-era Great Depression, according to a letter sent to clients on Wednesday and reviewed by Reuters.
The New York-based hedge fund firm, which controls $40.4 billion in assets and whose views on markets and economics are closely watched by investors, wrote that the sharp market decline seen between late February and late March ""provided a heavy bookend to a dozen years of basically nonstop positive returns in global stocks, bonds and real estate.""
And the rout is likely not yet over. 
""Our gut tells us that a 50% or deeper decline from the February top might be the ultimate path of global stock markets,” the letter said.
The benchmark U.S. S&P 500 stock market index tumbled 36% over four weeks but reversed course and rallied 31% from the March 23 low, leaving it 16% below the high set on Feb. 19, Elliott wrote.
Elliott's portfolio managers have bought some stocks and bonds recently, but the firm said it was too soon to call an all-clear for markets. 
""To us there does not appear to be a gilded cornucopia of shining bargains,"" the letter said.
The novel coronavirus erupted against a backdrop of record low interest rates coupled with record high leverage as markets were propped up by excessive government debt, the fund said. 
Elliott, founded in 1977 by Singer, is known for its founder's relatively pessimistic economic views and for warning about economic dangers long before others see them.
It is also known for carefully protecting capital over decades with some of the industry's best returns. Its Elliott International fund gained 2.2% in the first quarter while its Elliott Associates fund was up 1.6%.
The average hedge fund lost roughly 8% percent during the same time, data from Hedge Fund Research show. 
The firm said it hedged its portfolio with protection trades on credit, equities, rates and gold. This helped offset declines in distressed debt and equity trades.
A spokesman for New York-based Elliott Management Corp did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
While Elliott invests in a variety of instruments, it is especially well known as an activist investor that has pushed for changes at companies such as Twitter (N:TWTR), SoftBank (T:9984) and AT&T (N:T). 

The average activist hedge fund lost 33% in the first quarter, Hedge Fund Research data show.

758,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>","Coronavirus hurts corporate activism as M&A, buybacks decline","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist shareholders are likely to scale back campaigns in coming weeks as target companies brace for a deep recession and their favorite calls for change - ranging from mergers to returning cash - are ignored during the coronavirus outbreak.
The year started on a strong note with firms like Third Point and Elliott Management committing billions to push for change at 42 companies in January and February. 
But the pace fell 38% in March from February with only 16 campaigns launched, data released on Thursday by investment bank Lazard show.
New campaigns last month were launched at the slowest pace since 2013 and corporate agitators put the smallest amount of money to work since 2016.
Activity is expected to remain slow in the weeks ahead, the bank said. 
""We saw COVID-19's impact on activism show up in March,"" said Jim Rossman, who heads shareholder advisory at Lazard. ""Lower M&A activity and companies focused on conserving cash will mean that activists are likely to increase their focus on operational performance and how management teams react to the crisis as the basis for new campaigns.""
Activists, who often call on target companies to sell themselves or spin off units, pulled back last month and of the 16 campaigns launched in March, only five had an M&A component, Lazard said.
Similarly companies now worry about conserving cash and 123 U.S. companies ranging from  Hilton Worldwide  (N:HLT) to  Home Depot  (N:HD) have suspended or cut back share buyback programs as management braces for the worst downturn since the 1930s Great Depression.
For activists used to pressing for buybacks such requests would likely fall on deaf ears now. Only one campaign launched in the first quarter included a request for the return of capital, Lazard said.
Some activists, including Carl Icahn and Starboard Value LP seized on coronavirus-inspired panic selling to buy more stock in target companies but others pulled back, suggesting a generally gentler tone, for now.
Elliott dropped its opposition to consulting firm Capgemini's (PA:CAPP) friendly takeover of rival Altran (PA:ALTT), citing market conditions. Land & Buildings withdrew its director candidate at real estate investment trust American Homes 4 Rent (N:AMH), saying management needs to focus on running the business during the current turmoil.

Many activists are careful to avoid looking overly aggressive during the pandemic, Rossman said, noting they don't want to offend other investors whose help they might need in pushing their case later.

British supermarket groups' online delivery businesses accounted for about 8% of the grocery market before the health crisis.

They are being rapidly ramped up to meet some of the extra demand. But even if delivery capacity doubled, some 85% of the market would still need to be served by stores.

Shares of the company, which makes products ranging from laboratory test kits to children's protein drink PediaSure, rose 2% in premarket trading.
Abbott has launched three coronavirus tests in the United States, including an on-site diagnostic kit that can deliver results within minutes and heralded as a game changer by President Donald Trump.
However, sales in its diagnostics unit fell nearly 1% to $1.83 billion, as increased use of its tests for the fast-spreading virus could not offset the decline in demand for its other diagnostic tests. 
Sales at the company's nutrition products division rose 6.3% to $1.90 billion, benefiting from increased demand for children's products in late March as U.S. states began to impose shelter-in-place restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. 
The company's net earnings fell to $564 million, or 31 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $672 million, or 38 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, it earned 65 cents per share, above the average analyst estimate of 58 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data.

Net sales rose 2.5% to $7.73 billion, ahead of the average estimate of $7.34 billion.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) new iPhone SE for the budget-conscious is unlikely to be a major driver of sales in China, a Weibo survey suggested, with analysts noting its lacks of 5G capability.
In a poll conducted on social media site Weibo, 60% of roughly 350,000 respondents said they would not buy the new $399 model, the cheapest iPhone available.
But roughly a fifth said they would buy it, while the rest said they would consider a purchase. Though respondents were not asked for reasons for their choices in the poll, many commented that they would be interested if the price drops further.
""If you don't buy it and I don't buy it, tomorrow the price will drop another 200 yuan ($28),"" said one Weibo user whose comment got more than 10,000 likes.
Apple's market share in China - its third-biggest market, accounting for roughly 15% of its sales - has shrunk over the past several years as Chinese Android brands increasingly release higher-end phones. 
The reception for the iPhone SE was similarly muted in Europe, where almost 1 million people have caught the coronavirus and many countries have closed shops or ordered people to stay at home.
Despite the inauspicious backdrop, the new Apple device will offer owners of the ageing iPhone 6 an affordable way to get onto the latest and most secure version of Apple's iOS smartphone operating system, one industry analyst said.
""These are people who keep their phones for four or five years, until they either break or the battery dies,"" said Annette Zimmermann at consultancy Gartner.
5G RACE
Competition has intensified in China as rivals are now releasing 5G devices compatible with the country's upgraded telecoms networks while Apple has yet to launch an iPhone with 5G capability.
Last week several Chinese online retailers reduced iPhone 11 prices by as much as 17%. Apple occasionally lets its Chinese seller partners cut prices to spur demand, though it seldom allows pricing leeway for vendors overseas.
Three China-based analysts said the iPhone SE would mainly appeal to Apple brand loyalists who don't want to spend about $700 for the high-end iPhone 11.
""The new iPhone SE will, for sure, attract mid-range users who don't take 5G connectivity as a necessity,"" said Mo Jia, who tracks the global smartphone industry at research firm Canalys.
Tech investors will nevertheless be watching its reception in China to gauge how demand for consumer devices may rebound once the coronavirus pandemic subsides and whether iPhone sales in China can soften the blow of lost purchases elsewhere.
China is the only major market where Apple's stores have reopened as the spread of the virus prompts governments around the world to impose lockdowns and other social distancing measures.
Government data showed that Apple shipped 2.5 million iPhones to Chinese vendors in March, nearly a fifth higher than the same month a year earlier and a sharp jump from only 500,000 in February, when the virus outbreak was at its peak in China.

The company will start taking orders for the phone on its website on Friday, with deliveries expected from April 24.

Operating profit fell to 0.9 billion euros, which would be an 81% drop from 4.84 billion last year, and the group's return on sales margin is expected to be around 1.6%, down from 8.1% in the first quarter of 2019.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Wall Street stocks pause for breath following a blistering three-week surge, signals from the options market are suggesting that some investors believe the gains may endure. 
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as ""Wall Street's fear gauge,"" ended below 40 on Tuesday for the first time since March 5, after rising as high as 82.69 during a sell-off that took the S&P 500 down as much as 34% from its peak. 
That 40 level is a significant one for some VIX watchers: The previous bull market began in March 2009, when the VIX fell to similar levels after having hit a closing high of 80.86 in November 2008. 
Investors are digesting a rally in which the S&P 500 (SPX) benchmark index has soared 24% from its March lows in the midst of the spreading coronavirus pandemic. While some market participants have taken heart from unprecedented stimulus measures from the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government, few can predict when the state-by-state lockdowns that have virtually shut down the entire country will ease, what trajectory the pandemic will take or the scope of its damage to the economy.
While plenty of uncertainty remains, the majority of options indicators ""are pointing in the right direction,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.
Volatility crept higher on Wednesday. The VIX moved back above 40 as the S&P 500 (SPX) fell following data on steep drops in U.S. retail sales and factory output.
Even so, other bullish signals formed over the last few days have not been obscured.
Movement in ratios comparing the volume of put options, used for downside protection, to that of call options, used to position for market gains, has suggested easing demand for portfolio hedges. One such measure, the ISEE Sentiment Index, jumped to its highest level since late November on Monday, even as U.S. stocks fell.
VIX futures also reflect expectations that the coming weeks are unlikely to feature the sort of turbulence that rocked markets in March. The inversion - or backwardation - of the VIX futures term structure, in which prices for front-month contracts are higher than those for later-dated contracts, has become less steep over the past few weeks.
Graphic - Flattening the curve: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegpbwyrvqz/SPX%20v%20VIX%20futures%20spread.jpg
Yet there are few signs that markets will soon return to the kind of placid trading that was a hallmark of the months leading up to the coronavirus outbreak. The term structure has not reverted to its usual upward slope, where later-dated contracts are more expensive than earlier-dated ones, indicating that expectations of near-term volatility persist, analysts said.
At the same time, benign configurations in VIX futures have not always held up, analysts warned. 
In March 2008, for instance, the term structure flattened after the VIX momentarily peaked amid the collapse of Bear Stearns, but it eventually inverted again. Stocks made deeper lows in October of that year amid the fallout from the global financial crisis.
""There's still uncertainty about whether front-month volatility spikes again,"" said Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics.
Other strategists have noted that as the term structure has flattened, volatility expectations have stayed high for later months, in a possible signal of concerns about lingering effects of the coronavirus outbreak.
The first-quarter earnings season could also ratchet up market turbulence, especially when smaller, more volatile companies report results, said Matt Amberson, principal at ORATS.

""We're not out of the woods from a volatility standpoint,"" he said.

“The coronavirus pandemic has produced an environment which is both negative and positive for Abbott,” said Haris Anwar, an analyst with Investing.com.
“ While the outbreak is likely to hurt its medical device business due to the postponement of  minor and routine surgeries all over the country, the company is well-positioned to make incremental sales due to its work on the new point-of-care COVID-19 testing device, which can produce positive results in five minutes.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to push higher Thursday as confidence grows that some states will open their economies in the near future, but gains will be limited ahead of the latest unemployment data and as the earnings season continues.
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 12 points, or 0.4%, higher, Nasdaq 100 Futures were up 67 points, or 0.8%. The Dow futures contract rose 79 points, or 0.3%. 
The U.S. has ""passed the peak"" of new coronavirus cases, President Donald Trump said in his daily White House briefing late Wednesday, and predicted some states would reopen this month.
Trump added new guidelines would be announced later Thursday after he had spoken to governors.
However, this good news is likely to be put into context with the release of the weekly initial jobless claims figure, seen as the key economic indicator of the Covid-19 era, at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
While a drop from the record claims number the week before, economists are still expecting a staggering 5.12 million people filed for first-time unemployment benefits
A total of “16.8 million Americans already filed for unemployment benefits in the previous three weeks and there is no reason to believe numbers stopped surging last week,” said Danske Bank, in a note to investors.
As the earnings continue to come in, the banking sector will remain in the spotlight in what has proved so far to be a difficult quarter.  The banks which have already reported earlier this week have set aside over $25 billion combined for loan losses, as they brace for a deep recession, but have posted some stellar numbers for trading revenue.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) steps up next.
Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK)’s first quarter earnings beat forecasts and revenue topped expectations, with EPS of $1.05 on revenue of $4.11 billion.

768,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>","United cuts May flights by 90%, tells employees to brace for job cuts","By Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) said on Wednesday that it has cut its flight schedule by 90% in May and expects similar cuts for June as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, and warned that travel demand that is now ""essentially at zero shows no sign of improving in the near term,"" making job cuts likely.
United disclosed its outlook in a memo to employees that it publicly released. The memo was from Chief Executive Oscar Munoz and President Scott Kirby.
Like other U.S. airlines, travel demand for Chicago-based United has cratered as most U.S. states have ordered residents to stay at home in order to contain spread of the coronavirus. 
United said it flew less than 200,000 people in the first two weeks of April, a 97% drop from the more than 6 million people it flew during the same time in 2019. It expects to fly fewer people during the entire month of May than it did on a single day in May of last year, Munoz and Kirby said.
""The historically severe economic impact of this crisis means even when travel demand starts to inch back, it likely will not bounce back quickly,"" they said.
""We believe that the health concerns about COVID-19 are likely to linger which means even when social distancing measures are relaxed, and businesses and schools start to reopen, life won't necessarily return to normal.""
While the $5 billion that United expect to receive in government payroll support under the CARES Act bars its from involuntary furloughs before Sept. 30, the airline indicated that it expects to have to cut payroll after that. It said it will be offering new voluntary leave packages in the coming weeks and voluntary separation programs.
United said that the government money does not cover its total payroll expense, and noted that payroll is only about 30% of total costs, which also include airport rent and supplies.
So far more than 20,000 United employees have volunteered for unpaid leaves of absence.
United's efforts to further cut payroll costs are similar to moves by peers Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) and  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL).
United is among airlines eyeing a separate $25 billion federal loan package for U.S. passenger carriers given expected favorable terms, Reuters reported on Wednesday.
United said last week it plans to start daily service on May 4 from Chicago to London, Newark to Amsterdam, and Washington to Frankfurt, and three flights a week between Washington and Buenos Aires starting on May 5.

It is canceling planned seasonal summer service from Newark to Prague; Stockholm; Palermo, Italy; and Reykjavik, Iceland; but continues to operate flights between the United States and Frankfurt, Brazil, Sydney, Tel Aviv and Tokyo, as well as cargo and repatriation flights.

770,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>",Huawei chip unit orders up more domestic production as U.S. restrictions loom: sources,"By Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd is gradually shifting production of chips designed in-house away from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) and towards a mainland Chinese firm in preparation for more U.S. restrictions, sources familiar with the matter said. 
The move towards Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) comes as Washington readies new rules which would require foreign companies using U.S. chipmaking equipment to obtain a license before supplying chips to Huawei - rules that would directly affect TSMC.
It also highlights how U.S. restrictions against Huawei can act as an impetus for Chinese companies to accelerate the development of homegrown technology. 
The U.S. government alleges Huawei, the world's biggest maker of telecom network equipment and a major smartphone manufacturer, is a national security risk as its equipment could be used by Beijing to spy, and has barred U.S. firms from selling to the Chinese firm without a licence. Huawei has repeatedly denied its products pose a security threat.
Huawei's chip unit, HiSilicon, began to direct some of its engineers towards designing for SMIC rather than TSMC in late 2019, said one of the sources, who was not authorised to speak to the media and declined to be identified.
""Before, Huawei wanted to work with top notch manufacturers, and SMIC was just second-tier,"" the person said. ""We are now moving resources to SMIC to speed up our help to them.""
A Huawei spokesman called the shift ""common industry practice"" in a statement to Reuters. ""Huawei considers carefully issues such as capacity, technology and delivery when choosing semiconductor fabrication plants,"" it said.
TSMC, the world's top contract manufacturer of semiconductors, said it does not comment on individual customers. SMIC declined to comment.
It was not immediately clear how much more production is being outsourced to SMIC. Huawei has also said it would look at South Korean firms, other Taiwanese and mainland Chinese firms as alternative sources for chips. 
KNOW-HOW GAP
While SMIC is seen as the strongest mainland China alternative to TSMC, it remains well behind TSMC in its technological expertise and U.S. authorities have already taken measures to prevent it from acquiring the most advanced chip-making equipment.
TSMC does not reveal how much revenue each customer provides but analysts estimate that by late 2019 Huawei accounted for 13% to 15% of TSMC's sales. Chip production that could be shifted to SMIC likely only accounts for 1 to 3 percentage points of that, they said.
""Right now, there's a still sizeable gap between TSMC and SMIC in terms of skills, stability, and reliability,"" said Gu Wenjun, senior analyst at Shanghai-based consultancy ICWise.
TSMC, for example, is currently perfecting its 5 nanometre process node technology. SMIC recently introduced 14nm technology in late 2019, which TSMC rolled out officially years earlier.
Experts say HiSilicon's latest Kirin processors, used exclusively in Huawei mobile phones, can only be made by TSMC at the moment, although they add that earlier Kirin processors could be outsourced to SMIC.
Other chips produced by HiSilicon, such as those for so-called IOT devices, power management, or set-top boxes, could be sent to SMIC, they said.

Gaining more business from Huawei would also help SMIC improve its processes as Huawei would be able to pass on valuable knowledge gained in working with TSMC, the analysts added.

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe led world stock markets back to higher ground on Thursday as tentative moves to reopen parts of the some of its larger coronavirus-hit economies offset some truly stinking global economic numbers.
Asian equities and U.S. futures had wilted earlier in the day after warnings of a Great Depression-style slump in the world economy, a record plunge in U.S. retail sales, oil near an 18-year low [O/R] and the prospect of a sky high jump in U.S. jobless claims later in the session.
But the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose over 1% in early trade, spurred by a drop in the virus death tolls in both Spain and Italy and reassuring statements from two of the continent's big budget airlines about their survival prospects. (EU)
Wall Street futures (ESc1) recovered, too, and in the currency and bond markets both the dollar  and benchmark German Bund and U.S. Treasury yields shifted higher in the more 'risk-on' mood. [/FRX] [GVD/EUR]
""We have had this big wave of big announcements by governments and central banks and now we need to get into the nitty gritty of how it all works,"" said AXA Investment Managers chief economist Gilles Moec. 
""We need to see if it is working, how it is working and if we need to do more.""
Markets may be seizing on the fact that policymakers, however reluctantly, are starting to allow stringent lockdowns to ease.
Germany is proposing to reopen schools and some retailers starting May 4, while around 20 U.S. states spared the worst of the coronavirus pandemic may start reopening their economies by President Donald Trump's May 1 target date.
Firms are looking to restart as well. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has said its factories in Germany and Slovakia will resume some production from April 20 with others following a week later.
But the economic figures are dire. After the IMF’s forecasts for this year, markets are expecting China to report on Friday that Q1 GDP contracted for the first time on record, and hopes for a quick rebound are fading fast.
A Reuters survey showed that most Japanese firms feel stimulus announced so far are insufficient and Wednesday's U.S. data also showed manufacturing output there dropping the most in over 74 years. 
OIL IN A RUT
Asia had had a difficult day as a result. Tokyo's Nikkei dropped 1.3% and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) lost almost 1%, wiping out early week gains that had taken it to a one-month high. 
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar  fell to a one-week low and oil prices struggled to rise against the expectation of cratering demand. 
U.S. crude (CLc1) sat at $20.22 per barrel, just over $1 above an 18-year low hit on Wednesday, and Brent crude (LCOc1) rose 37 cents or 1.3% in European trade to $28.02 per barrel.
The International Monetary Fund is predicting zero growth in Asia this year for the first time in 60 years, as exporters are pounded by slumping demand and anti-virus measures force consumers to stay home and shops to shut down.
Benchmark indexes in Australia (AXJO), Hong Kong (HSI) and Shanghai (SSEC) also posted falls between 0.4% and 1.3% and some emerging markets fell harder.

774,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 06:26AM ET</span>",No end in sight yet for Amazon shutdown in France,"PARIS (Reuters) - Amazon (O:AMZN) has no clarity yet on when its warehouses in France might reopen, the head of its French business said on Thursday, after the e-commerce giant clashed with unions over the measures taken to limit the risks of coronavirus contagion. 
Amazon closed six French warehouses used to stock and package goods for shipment on Thursday until at least April 20, in one of the biggest fallouts yet from a growing stand-off with its workers over safety measures during the pandemic. 
The world's largest online retailer is facing mounting scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic as it juggles a surge in online orders during unprecedented lockdowns during the pandemic and employees' safety.
France is the only country where it has shut down all of its so-called fulfillment centres after unions complained that they were still too crowded and filed a legal challenge. 
A court sided with the workers on Tuesday, ordering Amazon to focus only on delivering essential items like food while it revised health protocols. 
Amazon's French Chief Executive Frederic Duval rejected the court's order on Thursday, saying the company had spent ""colossal amounts"" on health precautions including sanitary gels and face masks. The firm will appeal, he said. 
Duval added that rather than limiting its activities, Amazon had temporarily suspended trade through the warehouses because the court order, which included a 1 million-euro ($1.1 million) per day penalty for non-compliance, was too vague. 
The court did not order the closure of the warehouses but requested they limit deliveries to groceries, medical supplies and hygiene products.
""There is a huge ambiguity,"" Duval told RTL radio. ""Is a nail clipper a hygiene product? Is a condom a medical item? I'm not able to define that.""
He said the company would work with unions to ensure the sites could reopen quickly, but added: ""I cannot confirm at this stage on what date they will reopen."" 
Amazon's vice president of the European Union segment, Roy Perticucci, has stepped down, the company confirmed on Wednesday, a day after the French court's ruling. 
The French shutdown could pile more pressure on small businesses and third party vendors which use Amazon's site and logistics to reach clients, and especially so after France introduced store closures in March to try and combat the pandemic.
The six warehouses employ 10,000 permanent and temporary employees. Amazon will tap a state partial unemployment scheme to pay its employees, according to an internal document seen by Reuters. 

""I hope, for the sake of Amazon employees and French clients, that business can resume as soon as possible, but with security protocols in place,"" French Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud told LCI radio on Thursday.

776,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 06:11AM ET</span>","Canadian banks ease credit rules for energy companies to stave off defaults, bankruptcies","By Nichola Saminather and Jeff Lewis
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian banks are beginning to relax lending standards for energy firms struggling to operate with oil prices at half the level needed to cover costs, seeking to keep them afloat until the industry recovers from its deepest slump ever.
Banks are extending credit and waiving covenants for some energy companies to avoid forcing defaults and bankruptcies that leave the lenders holding assets, in contrast to some U.S. counterparts preparing to seize oil and gas fields.
A 2019 Canadian Supreme Court ruling requiring bankrupt oil companies to prioritize clean-up of inactive wells over paying creditors is also an incentive, analysts said.
While the measures would help stem banks' loan losses during a difficult year, a slower-than-expected recovery or oil prices consolidating at lower levels could lead to more soured loans longer term in an already challenged portfolio.
By renegotiating credit agreements, banks don't have to consider the loans impaired, ""but the concern is that maybe they’re just kicking the can down the road,"" said Brian Madden, portfolio manager at Goodreid Investment Counsel. 
Obsidian Energy (TO:OBE),  Pembina Pipeline Corp  (TO:PPL) and  Baytex Energy  (TO:BTE) are among the companies that have obtained or extended credit facilities from their lenders recently.
But Obsidian's lenders - including ATB Financial, BMO (TO:BMO), Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce  and  National Bank of Canada  (TO:NA), according to Refinitiv data - waived debt-to-adjusted EBITDA covenants while renewing https://www.obsidianenergy.com/press-releases/obsidian-energy-announces-completion-of-agreements-with-our-banking-syndicate-noteholders-and-landlord its credit facility, despite debt of C$461 million at 2019 end, up 10% from the prior year. 
 Bonavista Energy Corp  (TO:BNP) in March got approval under a temporary waiver to tap its credit line for a reduced amount after a CIBC-led banking syndicate rejected an earlier drawdown request.
Still, the majority of banks' energy loans are to larger diversified companies and lenders are not relaxing requirements across the board. 
Calgary-based  Delphi Energy Corp  (TO:DEE) on Tuesday sought creditor protection after a syndicate of banks, including ATB Financial, Bank of Montreal (TO:BMO) and Bank of Nova Scotia (TO:BNS), balked at waiving a debt covenant.
REDUCED LENDING
Banks could lower lending amounts as they recalculate energy companies' borrowing bases through to May, the total collateral against which they can lend.
Royal Bank of Canada (TO:RY) analysts said in a Wednesday note they wouldn't be surprised to see between 20-40% drop in borrowing bases on average, though it could be more case specific.
Those reviews are playing out as Ottawa considers ways to backstop banks to keep them lending to energy companies, Reuters reported.
For banks, standing by their clients, who are also a source of non-lending revenues, is the best strategy for now.
CIBC is providing new credit lines, helping companies restructure where needed and ""is ensuring they have the financial strength to deal with this very unique challenge,"" CEO Victor Dodig told Reuters.
U.S crude has slumped almost 70% since January to less than $20 a barrel despite an agreement over the weekend between Saudi Arabia and Russia to slash production. Although highly variable, the majority of the Canadian industry needs oil prices above $40 to maintain volumes and cover costs, according to  RBC .
Oil producers have responded by cutting spending and laying off workers.
 Toronto-Dominion Bank  (TO:TD) expects stresses in the industry if prices fail to recover, but the bank continues to ""be there for them,"" CEO Bharat Masrani told reporters this month.
 Scotiabank  declined comment. BMO did not offer an immediate comment.
ARC Financial, Canada’s largest energy-focused private equity manager, screened 140 oil producers in February, and found two-thirds were already insolvent. 
Larger, more diversified companies are seen as better able to survive the current crisis, and banks are continuing to provide liquidity to them, RBC CEO Dave McKay told media last week. 
But some analysts expect even the bigger companies to face pressure if prices stay soft for long.

 Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst John Aiken said that, while he's not overly concerned about banks now, ""even if we’re not seeing any cracks being formed, the outlook is more negative, and banks are going to be required to put up more reserves against these loans.""

778,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 06:00AM ET</span>","U.K. Earnings Could Halve This Year Due to Covid-19, Citi Says","(Bloomberg) --
Profits and dividends at Britain’s publicly traded companies are set to halve this year due to the Covid-19 outbreak,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). predicts.
The bank warned clients that the pandemic’s economic impact will be greater in the U.K. due to the country’s dependency on its services industry, which is deeply affected by social distancing efforts.
While consensus is for a 20% decline in earnings, “we think that this is not low enough,” strategists including Robert Buckland wrote in a note. Citi expects U.K. gross domestic product to drop 7.6% this year versus a 2.3% decline globally.
British stocks have underperformed their European peers in the recent rebound. The FTSE 350 Index has risen about 6.5% over the past month versus a 12% gain for the Stoxx Europe 600 benchmark. The gauges remain 26% and 21% lower for the year, respectively.
Payouts too are under pressure, and for pension funds heavily invested in income strategies, the blow is likely to be particularly harsh. U.K. companies distributed $106 billion in dividends last year, according to Janus Henderson.
Investors should favor less-risky, or defensive sectors, such as telecoms, food and beverage, pharma and utilities, Citi says. Cyclical industries such as banking and energy look expensive amid likely “major” cuts to dividends, although oil shares could be supported by a rebound in crude prices later this year, the strategists write.
Britain, which has the fifth-highest death toll worldwide, is expected to extend a nationwide lockdown later on Thursday. Having faced criticism for not implementing containment measures quickly enough, the government is now under increasing pressure to explain its exit strategy.

779,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 05:37AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Zalando Jumps as Locked-Down Consumers Get Into Exercise,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -  Germany’s decision to allow certain stores to reopen from next week is the biggest sign yet from Europe’s biggest economy that it is on the road to recovery, but it's storeless fashion retailer Zalando that is the country's biggest gainer on Thursday.
Zalando (DE:ZALG) shares rose 5.5% to their highest since February after the company said that, actually, the first quarter wasn’t going to be as bad as it had warned.
Analyst consensus had coalesced around a loss of 10 million euros before earnings and taxes for the quarter after the company’s vague profit warning in March, but it said after the close on Wednesday that it now expects a profit, albeit of less than 10 million euros. Gross merchandise value and revenue won’t be too far away from analyst expectations for growth of 23% and 15% respectively.
The surprise seems due to customers paying more attention to keeping fit during lockdown. Zalando said its customers had doubled their purchases of sportswear from a year earlier, specifically in the area of running, yoga and fitness wear.  
Online retailers have, inevitably, done better than their brick and mortar rivals in the age of Covid-19 lockdowns. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has marched to all-time highs, while traditional chains, from Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) to the U.K.’s Debenhams, have languished. With today’s gains, Zalando is down only 5.7% for the year, while U.K.-based boohoo.com (LON:BOOH), another online only name, is down only 7.7%.  By contrast,  Next  (LON:NXT) and H&M (ST:HMb) are down over 30% while Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) is down nearly 20%.
The bifurcation has sharpened this week as Zalando,  Boohoo  and Asos (LON:ASOS) have all risen by between 6% and 10%. Assuming that customers haven’t spent all their reduced pay checks on yoga bottoms, the first reopenings may arrive just in time to save this year’s spring collections from total ruin.
Whether they are enough to encourage purchases of a new Audi is another matter. But, with all of Germany's auto dealerships also allowed to reopen from next week, at least there's hope. 
Germany’s big auto names were at the top of the DAX on Thursday morning, with Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) preferred stock up 3.4%,  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) stock up 2.4% and BMW (MI:BMW) stock up 2.3%. Infineon (DE:IFXGn), which depends in large measure on selling chips to those names, is the biggest gainer, up 3.6%. The DAX pared early gains to be up 0.9% while the STOXX 600 was up 0.7%."

LONDON (Reuters) - Sherborne Investors (L:SIGC) said on Thursday it would withhold its vote to reappoint  Barclays  (L:BARC) Chief Executive Jes Staley in the bank's annual general meeting to prevent fresh boardroom turmoil as the bank grapples with the COVID-19 fallout.
The rebel shareholder said it still believed Staley ""to be unsuitable to continue"" as a director of the bank but it had chosen ""with great reluctance"" not to vote against him in recognition of the ""complexity of the management situation"" presented by the pandemic.
""It can be tempting, especially during a crisis, to compromise ethical or moral standards on the basis that 'the trains must run on time'"", Sherborne said.
""Under the Stewardship Code, institutional shareholders should publicly disclose their rationale for voting decisions, and we believe that a 'withhold' vote would, in the current circumstances, stand up to any reasonable scrutiny."" 
Sherborne, which controls a 5.8% stake in the bank and is its largest investor, also called on the board to announce an orderly succession timetable for Staley. 
It said ongoing regulatory probes into his relationship with U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein and historic misdeeds including the attempted unveiling of a whistleblower had tainted Barclays by association.
A spokesman for Barclays referred Reuters to a Feb. 13 statement in which the bank's board said it was satisfied Staley has been ""sufficiently transparent"" about the nature and extent of his relationship with Epstein. 
""Mr. Staley retains the full confidence of the Board, and is being unanimously recommended for re-election at the Annual General Meeting,"" the statement read.
Speaking to reporters in February, Staley said he deeply regretted having had any relationship with Epstein. 

Barclays is due to hold its AGM on May 7.

Investing.com - European stock markets were mostly higher Thursday, helped by a number of countries in the region moving towards reopening their economies on growing signs that the peak of the coronavirus outbreak may have passed.
At 4:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index traded flat, France's CAC 40 was up 1.2%, while the DAX rose 1.3%. The broader based Stoxx 600 Europe index climbed 1.0%. 
The Covid-19 outbreak has marked another grim milestone, reaching 2 million cases around the world. It took about four months for the virus to infect 1 million people and only 12 days for that number to double.
That said, a number of European governments are looking to ease social distancing measures, including Germany, the region’s economic powerhouse. 
The idea that the worst of the economic contraction may be over has put a spring into the steps of investors Thursday, even though the shape of the future recovery remains highly uncertain.
Gains are being limited ahead of the release of the U.S. initial jobless claims later, an indicator which has become key in measuring the extent of the economic slowdown. This is expected to show another 5 million people have claimed unemployment benefits in the last week.
In corporate news, shares in easyJet (LON:EZJ) climbed 5% after the low cost carrier said it expected to be able to survive a lengthy fleet grounding as it had taken steps previously to shore up its finances. It also pointed up the possibility of not renewing current aircraft operating leases as they expire.
Rival Ryanair  (LON:RYA) told Reuters on Wednesday it was steeling itself for an airline price war that it expected to win once coronavirus restrictions are lifted and passengers flock back to tourist destinations. Ryanair shares climbed 3.2%.
German online fashion retailer Zalando (DE:ZALG) also jumped 5% as it said it was optimistic about the second quarter after sales picked up in April.
On the flip side, Electricite de France (PA:EDF) shares slumped 6% after cutting its forecasts for generation by its nuclear fleet for the next two years by some 10%. The company pulled its financial guidance for this year and 2021 last week.
Oil prices remain at low levels Thursday, after Wednesday’s U.S. oil inventories posted a record rise of 19 million barrels last week. Oil services company Petrofac (LON:PFC) fell 21% after saying Abu Dhabi had cancelled a $1.5 billion order due to the low price environment.
At 4:15 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $19.98 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.5% to $27.57.

788,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 01:40AM ET</span>",Lazard boosts restructuring team as coronavirus-hit firms run into trouble,"By Pamela Barbaglia
LONDON (Reuters) - Lazard Ltd has bolstered its senior restructuring team as it seeks to win business from companies struggling to stay afloat in the midst of the economic turbulence caused by the global coronavirus pandemic.
The U.S. investment bank has created a new London-based role for former Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom partner, Chris Mallon, to join as a senior adviser to its global restructuring practice.
""Chris will be involved on complex restructuring situations as a key part of our global team,"" Lazard's co-head of restructuring for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) David Burlison told Reuters.
The International Monetary Fund has predicted the global economy will contract by 3% during 2020, a stunning collapse of activity that has forced companies into negotiations with lenders and governments to seek emergency aid.
Independent advisory firms with restructuring capability such as Lazard and Rothschild are in high demand as boardrooms scramble to mitigate the damage of a downturn that has been compared to the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Mallon has handled corporate restructurings for more than three decades, holding a senior role at Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP as well as Skadden.
He worked on the demise of American energy company Enron and also advised the likes of Eurotunnel, operator of the tunnel linking Britain and France, Italian dairy group Parmalat and Danish shipping firm Torm A/S in their debt restructuring efforts.
The 63-year-old Briton serves as non-executive director of London-based IT network firm Global Cloud Xchange (GCX) which completed a Chapter 11 financial restructuring in December under Lazard's advice.
In his new post he will support Lazard UK boss Cyrus Kapadia as well as Lazard's most senior dealmakers around the world.
RESTRUCTURING 'BOON'
The surge in demand for restructuring work has proven a boon for advisory firms that need to offset lost opportunities from a sharp slowdown in mergers and acquisitions (M&A), which dropped 28% in the first quarter of the year and remains in freefall.
Lazard, which also advises governments in restructuring their sovereign debt, has seen its corporate pipeline grow significantly since lockdowns were enforced in Europe and the United States, winning mandates for  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Macy's Inc (N:M), among others.
""We're working with a range of companies to help them assess the impact of coronavirus and to think through their business plans and liquidity positions,"" Burlison said.
Global debt restructuring deals have totalled $26.4 billion since the start of the year, according to Refinitiv data, down 70% from the same period last year.
But more business is in the pipeline as most companies are expected to ask their lenders to relax covenants, prompting a new wave of mandates on behalf of creditors in the coming months.
The 172-year-old bank has engaged various teams across its global network to woo cash-strapped clients with a range of options, including tapping equity capital markets and enhancing debt-raising capabilities.

""It's not just about restructuring,"" Burlison said. ""Ultimately companies across sectors want to ensure that they're doing everything they can to protect their businesses.""

793,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 09:05PM ET</span>","Tesla, Musk must face shareholder lawsuit over going-private tweet","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - A federal judge said Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Chief Executive Elon Musk must face a lawsuit claiming they misled shareholders when Musk tweeted that he had secured funding to take his electric car company private in a $72 billion transaction.
U.S. District Judge Edward Chen ruled on Wednesday that shareholders could try to prove Musk intended to defraud them with his Aug. 7, 2018 tweet and follow-up messages about plans for his Palo Alto, California-based company.
The judge said shareholders could also try to prove Musk's tweet was the ""proximate cause"" of volatility in Tesla's stock price that caused billions of dollars of losses.
Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The lawsuit arose after Musk stunned investors on Aug. 7, 2018 by announcing on Twitter: ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.""
Musk’s tweet helped push Tesla's stock price more than 13% above the prior day's close. But it soon gave those gains back, and by Aug. 17, 2018 had fallen 11% below where it was before the original tweet.
Some investors called the tweet a ploy to squeeze short-sellers, long an irritant for Musk, who were betting Tesla's stock would fall.
Musk tweeted on Aug. 24, 2018 that Tesla would remain public.
A month later, he agreed to pay a $20 million civil fine to settle fraud charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The SEC also required Musk to step down as chairman, and Tesla lawyers to vet some of his tweets in advance. Tesla reached a separate $20 million settlement with the regulator.
Tesla's stock price has since roughly doubled, and Musk is worth $37.6 billion according to Forbes magazine.
In letting the shareholder case, which combined nine lawsuits, go forward, Chen said reasonable investors could have viewed Musk's Aug. 7 tweet as signaling he had unconditionally obtained enough financing to take Tesla private.
""So read, the statement is not true,"" Chen wrote.
The judge rejected Tesla's and Musk's argument that the tweet was not false or misleading because Tesla's directors would have still had to approve the transaction.
The proposed class action covers shareholders who bought and sold Tesla stock from Aug. 7 to Aug. 17, 2018. Their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Tesla shares closed up $19.94 at $729.83 on Wednesday.

The case is In re Tesla Inc Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-04865.

794,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 09:00PM ET</span>","Brazil government, banks in talks about bailing out companies","By Marcela Ayres and Carolina Mandl
BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's Economy Ministry is talking with banks about providing bailouts to sectors such as airlines, automakers, power companies and large retailers to help them survive the coronavirus crisis, bank executives confirmed on Wednesday in live presentations.
Reuters reported earlier on Wednesday that Brazil's biggest lenders - such as Banco Bradesco, Itau Unibanco Holding SA (SA:ITUB4),  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil and Banco do Brasil SA (SA:BBAS3) - have discussed with the country's central bank and development bank BNDES how and which financial instruments could be used to rescue embattled companies.
The auto sector is demanding in talks with government and banks a 100 billion reais ($19.10 billion) bailout, three people with knowledge of the matter said. Still, sources doubted that the package would reach that amount.
""Talks among banks, BNDES and the Treasury have been very productive,"" Banco Santander Brasil SA (SA:SANB11) CEO Sergio Rial said in a live presentation to discuss the impact of coronavirus on the economy, mentioning sectors such as airlines, hotels and automakers.
In another live presentation, Bradesco CEO Octavio de Lazari said a bailout for the power sector is likely to be concluded over the next two weeks.
The ministry wants BNDES, whose role Economy Minister Paulo Guedes had previously been seeking to scale back, to lead talks. The development bank could use part of its roughly 80 billion reais ($15.23 billion) cash position to buy conventional or convertible bonds sold by troubled companies, alongside other banks and investors under the ministry's plan.
A source close to the government said BNDES does not plan to take all the risk in a given company alone, because that would limit the total outreach of bailouts. By sharing risks with more banks and investors, more companies could be helped. 
To receive the funds, companies would have to present a restructuring plan to BNDES. 
The participants discussed using either convertible debt or loans partially guaranteed by the Treasury, the sources said. But the Treasury is unwilling to directly inject funds into companies.
Divisions remain in the ongoing talks, with the banks willing to cooperate in some way but insisting the government take most of the risk in some cases, the sources said. 
BNDES and the Economy Ministry did not comment on the matter.
ONGOING DISCUSSIONS
Rial said discussions with listed airlines and retailers include the use of convertible bonds, which could be redeemed in shares or money in the future. 
Airlines including Gol Linhas Aereas Intelligentes (SA:GOLL4),  Azul SA  (N:AZUL) and  Latam Airlines  Group SA (SN:LTM) have previously been reported to be in talks with BNDES about funding.
Azul CEO John Rodgerson said on Wednesday the carrier was still ""somewhat far away"" from reaching a deal on a loan from the BNDES.
Santander Brasil's CEO said carmakers are more likely to use debt with collateral, without specifying how it would work. Rial added that hotels could use their real estate assets as collateral for debt.

796,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 07:40PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Major U.S. airlines eyeing government loans after grants - sources,"By Tracy Rucinski and David Shepardson
(Reuters) - Several major U.S. airlines are preparing to apply this week for a $25 billion U.S. government loan program after winning billions in federal payroll grants, people familiar with the matter said, as the industry braces for a slow recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL), which unlike other major carriers had not yet disclosed its allotted payroll relief, said on Wednesday it would receive about $3.5 billion in direct grants and about $1.5 billion in a low-interest loan and issue warrants for Treasury to purchase about 4.6 million shares of common stock. 
While some airlines had initially planned to tap only the $25 billion in federal payroll grants, there is now a growing realization that the terms of the separate $25 billion loan package may be significantly better than those available in capital markets, the people said.
Treasury agreed in principle on Tuesday to award the payroll assistance to airlines but will not release the funds all at once. 
It told airlines to apply by Friday if they want priority consideration for the loan package, according to documents posted on its website, and by April 30 to be ensured consideration. If there is any money left over, late applicants could receive funds at a later date.
Cargo carriers also face the same timetable to apply for a $4 billion pool of funds.
An airline official told Reuters most airlines were expected to apply, partly because they would not be required to draw down the loan before the end of September and because the terms are favorable. Airlines will need to offer collateral like planes, spare parts and routes in exchange for the loans and warrants equal to 10% of the value of the loan.
The expected applicants are in addition to  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), which confirmed on Tuesday it planned to apply for a $4.75 billion loan ahead of the Friday deadline for priority consideration. Alaska Airlines Inc [ALKAIR.UL] also said it would apply for $1.1 billion in federal loans.
Among other large carriers, Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) will likely apply, while United and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) were still considering, the people said. 
 Spirit Airlines  Inc (N:SAVE) is considering applying for the loans, a spokesman said. The budget carrier said on Tuesday it expected to ""agree on terms soon"" on the payroll assistance grants.
Airline shares closed mixed on Wednesday, with American ending 2.9% higher and United up 3.1%, while Southwest closed 5.6% lower and Delta was off 0.8%.
Major airlines must repay 30% of the grant funds provided in the form of low-interest loans over 10 years and issue Treasury warrants equal to 10% of the value of the grants.
American, which will issue warrants on the payroll loan for the federal government to purchase 13.7 million shares at the April 9 closing price of $12.51, said on Wednesday that it would also issue warrants linked to the separate $4.75 billion loan for about 38 million shares at the same April 9 price. The warrants do no have any voting rights, it said.
On the loan application due by April 30, airlines must describe any changes they expect to make in employment levels through the end of the year. Under the terms of the payroll aid, airlines must keep their workforce until Sept. 30.
Airlines must refrain from paying dividends or stock buybacks, and set limits on executive compensation until a year after the loans are repaid in full.

""Those are absolutely fair things that we were asked to do and we're certainly not complaining about them,"" American Chief Executive Doug Parker told CNBC on Wednesday.

Coury will also partner with Mylan CEO Heather Bresch to work on the merger, which aims to bring the company's emergency allergy shot EpiPen and Pfizer's blockbuster treatments, Viagra and Lipitor, under one umbrella. 

The deal, previously expected to close in mid-2020, was delayed to the second half of this year due to the pandemic. Coury will stay on as executive chairman of the combined company, to be named Viatris.

799,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 06:20PM ET</span>","Smithfield Foods shuts U.S. bacon, ham plants as coronavirus hits meat sector","By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Smithfield Foods Inc, the world's largest pork processor, said on Wednesday it would shutter two U.S. plants that process bacon and ham, after closing a separate hog slaughterhouse because of an outbreak of the coronavirus among employees.
The latest shutdowns show the domino effect that can occur when the closure of a major slaughterhouse removes raw materials that are turned into food for consumers.
Smithfield, owned by China's WH Group Ltd (HK:0288), is shuttering a plant that processes bacon and sausage in Cudahy, Wisconsin, for two weeks, according to a statement. A facility in Martin City, Missouri, that processes spiral and smoked hams will also close.
The Missouri plant, which employs more than 400 people, processes pork from the Smithfield slaughterhouse in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, that the company closed indefinitely. More than 200 employees became infected with the coronavirus at the South Dakota slaughterhouse, which produces 4% to 5% of the nation's pork.
""Without plants like Sioux Falls running, other further processing facilities like Martin City cannot function,"" Smithfield Chief Executive Ken Sullivan said in a statement.
Demand for meat at grocery stores has climbed as consumers are staying home to protect themselves from the contagious respiratory virus. Restaurant demand has evaporated as dining rooms have closed.
A small number of employees at the Wisconsin and Missouri facilities have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, according to Smithfield. Both plants are located near areas where ""community spread of COVID-19 has been prevalent,"" the company said.
Such processing facilities are less important to maintaining the U.S. food supply than slaughterhouses, said Steve Meyer, economist for commodity firm Kerns and Associates.
""The key for food supplies is getting animals converted to meat,"" he said.
 Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) this week extended the closure of a pork slaughterhouse in Columbus Junction, Iowa, that it shuttered last week due to coronavirus cases among employees. Companies like Cargill Inc, JBS USA and National Beef Packing Co have also shut meat plants.
""Our country is blessed with abundant livestock supplies, but our processing facilities are the bottleneck of our food chain,"" Sullivan said.

Airbus plans to start picking up production of the narrowbody jet from the current four per month by mid-2021 at its Mirabel facility near Montreal, Airbus spokeswoman Marcella Cortellazzi said.
The company, which acquired the jet program from Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb), had planned to produce 10 of the jets per month in the country by the middle of the decade.
Airlines are preserving cash as air travel plummets, with coronavirus cases topping 615,000 in the United States and 2 million globally, according to a Reuters tally.
Airbus' planned ramp-up of the jet at a second site in Mobile, Alabama, to four a month remains unchanged.
Production at the company's Quebec plant has been paused from March 24 until at least May 4 after the provincial government ordered an end to all non-essential business operations. 
Cortellazzi said the company planned to restart operations on May 5.
Airbus announced this month it would cut narrowbody production by a third to 40 a month. It also issued figures showing a roughly 40% cut in wide body production.

Airbus did not announce production cuts for the A220.

Earnings continue from banks and there will also be results from Abbott Labs, which is making Covid-19 tests.
And the head of the New York Federal Reserve will hold a video conference.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Jobless Claims Seen Climbing Sharply Again
The key economic indicator of the Covid-19 era will be the focus before the bell Thursday.
The Labor Department will issue weekly initial jobless claims figures at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).

DETROIT (Reuters) - Canadian auto supplier  Magna International Inc  (TO:MG) is planning for a return to production in North America on May 4, with a subsequent gradual increase in output as the industry recovers from the shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic, a top executive said on Wednesday.
Most U.S. states have stay-at-home orders in place through the end of April, but many automakers and suppliers hope evidence of an easing in the COVID-19 infection rate will lead to a re-opening of factories. President Donald Trump has expressed a desire to get Americans back to work soon.
""As we stand today, we have everything in place as if the plants are coming back on May 4,"" Magna President Swamy Kotagiri said in a telephone interview.
The auto industry has already reopened in China, where Magna has some plants back at 80% capacity, and is just now restarting operations in Europe. In the United States, General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and other companies are waiting for the go-ahead from various governors but are aiming for an early May restart.
Kotagiri said there is ""no written play book"" for the pandemic and understands production could be further delayed, but he is ready if that happens. What would worry him more would be restarting and then having to stop again.
""The most important thing is, How can we as an industry coordinate and minimize the start-stops?"" he said.
""If someone comes and says, 'It's not May 4, it's May 10.' That's OK. It's easy to deal with,"" said Kotagiri, who was promoted to president in January. ""But if somebody comes and says to start on the 4th and we stop again on the 12th, that's a bigger problem.""
Magna, which makes parts such as body structures, chassis and powertrain for customers including Ford and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), has about 70 employees globally recovering from COVID-19 and has seen three in North America die from the virus.
Last month, Magna withdrew its financial outlook, citing the pandemic, but said its liquidity was strong. After increasing a revolving credit facility on Tuesday, Magna has $1 billion in cash and $3.7 billion in available credit lines.
As for the restart, Magna is planning heavily for it, including drawing up an almost 60-page ""Smart Start Playbook"" to help with the transition, talking about best practices, and details like disinfecting guidelines, the use of personal protective equipment like masks and face shields, as well as treating and tracing infected employees.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday as dismal economic data and first-quarter earnings reports compounded concerns over the extent of damage from the coronavirus outbreak. 
Shares of Bank of America (N:BAC) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) dropped as they joined JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) in reporting a slump in first-quarter profits.
Also,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc's (N:GS) quarterly profit nearly halved, as it set aside more money to cover for corporate loans expected to go bust in the coming months.
In further evidence of economic damage from the coronavirus, U.S. retail sales plunged 8.7% in March, manufacturing output dropped by the most in over 74 years and a survey showed manufacturing activity in New York state plunged in April to its lowest in the series' history.
Disappointing bank earnings are adding to worries about prospects for the rest of the corporate reporting period, said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago.
In the coming weeks, ""it's going to be more important to look at companies... from a debt perspective,"" he said, noting: ""I'm not sure the recovery is going to be as strong as everybody is saying.""
The International Monetary Fund has predicted that this year the global economy would witness its sharpest slump since the 1930s.
U.S. stocks have recovered from their March trough, boosted by a raft of U.S. monetary and fiscal stimulus and on early signs that coronavirus cases were peaking in some hotspots. However, the S&P 500 is still down about 18% from its Feb. 19 record closing high.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 445.41 points, or 1.86%, to 23,504.35, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 62.7 points, or 2.20%, to 2,783.36 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 122.56 points, or 1.44%, to 8,393.18.
J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) shares dropped 27.3% as sources said the retailer was exploring filing for bankruptcy protection after the virus outbreak upended its turnaround plans.
Shares of Citigroup and Bank of America were down more than 5% each on the day, while Goldman's stock ended nearly flat. ""Loan loss reserves were greater than expected in the first quarter, and it sounds like it might continue into the second quarter. We saw it yesterday and got a confirmation of the trend today,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Jason Goldberg. 
Goldman did better, he said, because ""lending is a smaller component of their business.""
Analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to have fallen 12.8% in the first quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The biggest U.S. health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc (N:UNH) rose 4.1% as it maintained its 2020 profit outlook at a time when major companies have withdrawn forecasts due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The CBOE volatility index (VIX) also climbed after closing Tuesday at its lowest level since March 5.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.95 billion shares, compared to the 14.28 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 4.74-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.43-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 8 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 26 new highs and 27 new lows.

807,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 04:55PM ET</span>",U.S. companies walk legal tightrope as earnings season kicks off,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. companies are grappling with how best to provide guidance on their earnings outlook as the novel coronavirus takes uncertainty to new heights and exposes them to potential shareholder lawsuits if forecasts prove misplaced. 
Measures to contain the virus have shuttered businesses, wiped nearly $5 trillion off U.S. stock markets, put 16 million Americans out of work, and plunged the country into recession, posing unique challenges as companies head into earnings season.
With the future clouded in doubt, the securities regulator last week urged companies to discuss in disclosures and investor calls how their operations and financial conditions may change as efforts to fight the virus progress with testing and monitoring. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said that by providing broad guidance, corporate America would help paint a clearer picture of when the country could get back to work -- a dilemma the White House is eager to resolve as soon as possible. 
That could put companies in a legally risky position, however.
""The SEC may not second guess issuers' good-faith attempts to provide this limited information, but the plaintiffs' bar may not take the same approach,"" said Christopher Bellini, chair of the private equity practice at law firm Cozen O’Connor. 
The SEC has encouraged companies to use legal safe harbors specifying that certain statements do not violate securities law. But while those should protect companies from an SEC penalty, they may not shield them from investor litigation, lawyers said. 
False forward-looking statements were cited in roughly half of federal class action lawsuits over the past five years, excluding those related to mergers and acquisitions, according to data compiled by Cornerstone Research. 
Lawyers said companies should disclose potential areas of future capital raising, but that they were otherwise urging clients to use extra cautious language when providing an outlook, including specifying precisely when management is making assumptions, and weaving in additional caveats. 
For example, Bruce Newsome, a lawyer at Haynes & Boone, said that for ""added cover"" he was advising clients to include the following caveat: ""These projections are based on current thoughts given coronavirus restrictions, but the extent of the risk cannot be confirmed.""
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), the first major U.S. drugmaker to report earnings, on Tuesday cut its 2020 profit forecast and predicted a year-end recovery in its medical device business, while also dedicating its cautionary note on forward-looking statements to the spectrum of uncertainties caused by the virus.
Likewise on Tuesday,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's CEO Charlie Scharf provided some heavily couched guidance on future loan loss reserves, while the bank also added the pandemic to its safe habor statement listing factors that could cause actual results to differ from its outlook.
""Sitting here today, there are many unknowns,"" he told analysts. 
Contrary to the SEC's request, some lawyers said that at least for the first quarter they were encouraging clients to consider removing outlook estimates altogether.
""It is too big a risk for issuers to provide meaningful forward-looking statements,"" said Bellini.

(Reuters) - Investors withdrew record amounts of money from bond and equity funds in March while money market funds showed record inflows, as the prospect of a massive economic downturn due to coronavirus rattled nerves, according to the latest data from Lipper. 
While investors withdrew $132.6 billion from stock and mixed equity funds - a record outflow going back to at least 2008 - they also pulled an unprecedented $265 billion from bond funds in the same timeframe, according to Lipper.
Although bonds are often seen as a safer bet than equities in a downturn, people were so ""ultra nervous"" they became concerned about whether even high quality debt could be serviced because of the downturn, according to Tom Roseen, the head of research services at Refinitiv Lipper. 
""It's mom and pop investors saying they were concerned the bond funds could go into default and they'd lose their money,"" said Roseen.
But he noted that record inflows of $681 billion into money market funds showed investors were still not ready to put their cash under the mattress. Money market funds hold debt instruments with maturities of less than a year with the average maturities being around 90 days, Roseen said.
""People are still wanting to put money to work somewhere. Once the market starts turning around a lot of people will be ready to put money back to work,"" Roseen said. 
The massive flows into money market funds meant that purchasers of mutual fund assets, for the second consecutive month, put $283.7 billion into conventional funds, which exclude Exchange Trade Funds.

""The company's fiscal 2019 fourth quarter was favorably impacted by the Cyber Monday holiday week, which occurred during the fourth quarter this year, but occurred in the company's third quarter in the prior year period,"" the company said.
Adjusting for the calendar shift to exclude Cyber Monday week in both periods, comparable sales for the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter declined 11.0%.
The strong end to the fiscal year, however, did not reflect the full impact from the coronavirus as the company's fourth-quarter ended on Feb. 28, with stores closed since March 23.
In an effort to conserve cash, the company said it would or planned to suspend prior plans to spend up to $600 million in fiscal 2020 for share repurchases, future dividends, and debt reduction and postpone approximately $150 million in planned capital expenditures out of fiscal 2020.
Looking ahead, the retailer conceded that its outlook was murky at best due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
""The company's first-quarter and full-year 2020 results will be unfavorably impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The duration and extent of the pandemic is highly uncertain, and Bed Bath & Beyond's results could be impacted in ways that are difficult to predict today. Due to the level of market uncertainty, the company will not provide further financial guidance for fiscal 2020 at this time,"" Bed Bath & Beyond said.

Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) said on Wednesday it will not make a $12 million interest payment on its long-term corporate bonds, a day after Reuters reported the department store operator was considering filing for bankruptcy protection.
In a regulatory filing, the company said it had a 30-day grace period to make the payment, on Senior Notes maturing in 2036, that was due on Wednesday, before it constitutes a default.
The 118-year-old company, which was already grappling with competition from online and off-price retailers, has taken a severe hit from the coronavirus crisis. It recently shut its 850 department stores, furloughed some employees and slashed spending.
Now as one way to rework its unsustainable finances and save money on looming debt payments, which include significant annual interest expenses, the company is contemplating a bankruptcy filing, sources told Reuters. 
The virus outbreak has hammered traditional brick-and-mortar department store operators and other retailers that had to close their doors to customers to curb its spread, while demand has also plunged with millions of Americans out of work.

Earlier this year, J.C. Penney attempted unsuccessfully to persuade creditors to restructure and push out due dates on portions of its nearly $4 billion of long-term debt.

Investing.com – The Dow closed above session lows on Wednesday, but investor sentiment got a gut check as dire economic data and earnings dampened hopes of a quick economic recovery.
The Dow fell 1.86%, or 445 points, but had fallen by as many as 716 points at the lows of the day. TheS&P 500 slipped 2.2% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1,44%.
Growing expectations the economy is set to open sooner rather later has underpinned investor hopes it could be set for a robust recovery, but economic data, including a record plunge in retail sales, suggested the optimism may have been overdone.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that retail sales fell 8.7% last month, confounding economists’ forecasts for an 8% decline. But the retail sales control group – which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP – rose  1.7%, compared with a forecast for a 2% decline.
Manufacturing activity in New York, which had already been under pressure pre-coronavirus pandemic, deteriorated further, also fell a record low reading of -78.2.
Underscoring the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book economic report warned further job cuts are expected in the coming months and the economic conditions are set to worsen.
The bleak outlook on the labor market comes just a day ahead of the weekly jobless claims report due Thursday.
On the earnings front, meanwhile, Wall Street banks continue to flag further economic uncertainty ahead.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) reported a widely-expected plunge in profit, with latter closing more than 6% lower.
The trio of banks also increased their reserves for credit losses by billions of dollars amid expectations for a jump in loan defaults from customers in the coming months.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some investors are wary about buying into a recent stock market rally. Even with hopes for a quick reopening of the economy, they want more evidence that the United States will not restart, only to have to fall back under another coronavirus lockdown soon.
The benchmark S&P 500 is up more than 25% from its March lows thanks to a combination of extraordinary intervention in the bond market by the Federal Reserve, a $2.3 trillion stimulus package passed by Congress and signs that the rate of infection in hot spots such as New York City is slowing. Those developments have led some analysts and investors to anticipate a reopening and forecast that the market has seen the worst of the selling.
However, other investors say that they will not believe that the U.S. economy can safely reopen until there are more medical reassurances put in place, ranging from widespread testing for the virus itself to the rollout of antibody tests that can show if a person is no longer at risk for infection. 
Testing in many parts of the United States remains far behind other industrialized nations in coronavirus tracking, beset with long wait times and poor availability.
""The market seems to be pricing in a light switch reopening in May or June, and it's more likely to be a slow, staggered reopening that will cause more economic damage the longer the shutdown lasts,"" said David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Investment Managers. 
John Briggs, Head of Strategy, Americas, at NatWest Markets, and other analysts said in a research note that ""testing is everything"" but cautioned that ""compared to other developed nations, the U.S. testing rate is, so far, terrible.""
""I do not think you can open the economy without more testing, and, if the U.S. tried to, it risks a double hit from the virus,"" NatWest said. 
President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he is close to completing a plan to end the shutdown with some parts of the country likely to be ready to go before a May 1 target date. However, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he would not abide by any order to reopen his state in an unsafe manner. [L2N2C22R0] 
Barry James, president of the James Advantage Funds, said that he will not be confident that the U.S. economy can restart until there are signs that hard-hit European countries such as Italy, France and Spain have successfully reopened. 
""They were several weeks ahead of us in dealing with the virus and they should be weeks ahead of us in the recovery,"" he said. 
Economic data points such as U.S. jobless claims or factory orders are ""worthless to people other than the fact that it scares the heck out of us all,"" he said.
James is preparing for the market to retest its March lows, and has been moving away from any travel-related stocks and increasing his positions in companies such as Kimberly-Clark Corp (N:KMB) that specializes in personal care products and  Kroger Co  (N:KR), which makes and processes food for sale in supermarkets.
A study by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health published Tuesday said that the United States may need to continue social distancing measures until 2022 unless critical care treatment is increased substantially or a treatment or vaccine is developed.
Hercules Investments, an RIA/hedge fund based in Los Angeles, California, with about $200 million under management said the assumption of an ""unobstructed return to normalcy"" is ""fallacious reasoning.""
Still, there are fund managers who remain bullish about the U.S. getting back on track. George Young, portfolio manager of the Villere Balanced Fund, said that he has been buying shares of trucking company J B Hunt Transport Services Inc (O:JBHT) and medical technology company  Stryker  Corp (N:SYK) in anticipation of a resumption of the economy. 

""This isn't 2008 and 2009, when people were scared of losing their homes,"" he said .""There's still a lot of capital out there that wants to be deployed.""

817,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>",Coronavirus unmasks Amazon's stumbles at Whole Foods,"By Lisa Baertlein and Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - Amazon's moves to reduce strain on its grocery businesses by putting new online shoppers on wait lists and switching more Whole Foods resources to filling orders, is unmasking limitations at the company that was expected to upend the supermarket industry. 
The coronavirus pandemic should be Amazon's moment to shine. Some 90% of U.S. shoppers are under stay-at-home orders and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) offers grocery delivery through its 487 U.S. Whole Foods stores. 
Instead, Whole Foods has been overwhelmed. Amazon Prime subscribers, who pay $119 a year for free delivery, are having difficulty finding Whole Foods delivery windows, according to interviews with a dozen customers and numerous posts on social media. And when their orders do arrive, many desired products are unavailable, they say. 
""I'm really surprised that they weren't able to scale for this. I was expecting them to perform better. It seems like more than anything Amazon is a supply-chain company,"" said Ellen Sullivan, 37, a Chicago-based office manager. 
Sullivan was a regular Amazon food delivery user before COVID-19 spread widely in the United States. Her last successful order was March 12, and even then, 10 of the 27 items were sold out and had to be replaced. 
""Now I'm sitting on 6 pounds of frozen corn,"" Sullivan said. 
Amazon told Reuters the setbacks are due to the spike in demand and social distancing constraints in its facilities and stores. 
Amazon has said it would hire an additional 75,000 people for jobs ranging from warehouse staff to delivery drivers and switched a California Amazon grocery store and a Manhattan Whole Foods to online-only as demand for orders surges. 
Whole Foods said its distribution network is strong and that it is working with suppliers to overcome increased demand and supply chain constraints without compromising quality standards that ""further limit the number of products we can source"". 
DISRUPTOR DISRUPTED 
The world's biggest online retailer sent a shock through the stodgy U.S. supermarket business in 2017, when it bought Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. Some experts predicted that Amazon would hasten the move to online grocery shopping and doom traditional operators like Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and  Kroger Co  (N:KR). 
But now Amazon is buckling under unprecedented COVID-19 supply-and-demand disruptions that sent the entire grocery industry scrambling to adapt. After expanding and speeding up Whole Foods delivery, the company is retrenching. 
On Sunday Amazon told Reuters it would put new grocery delivery customers on a wait list and curtail shopping hours at some Whole Foods stores to focus on orders from existing online customers. 
The company - which also delivers food from its own warehouses through Amazon Fresh - last month suspended its Prime Pantry delivery service for non-perishable groceries. 
""They were separating themselves from the pack and that's not happening anymore. This doesn't happen to Amazon ... they don't screw up like this,"" said Bill Bishop, co-founder of supermarket consultancy Brick Meets Click. Amazon inherited - and failed to address - many of the problems that are now plaguing its grocery business, a half dozen experts told Reuters. 
In particular, they said the e-commerce giant with $55 billion on its balance sheet did not fortify Whole Foods' foundation, which relies on outdated technology, outside suppliers and real estate unsuited for the unprecedented surge in demand. 
As a result, the chain's systems ""creak very badly under the strain,"" Bishop said. 
Walmart and Kroger are also fighting to keep in-demand products like flour, toilet paper and cleaning supplies on shelves, but their regular technology investments and tight control over supply chains have been a competitive advantage over Amazon and Whole Foods, experts said. 
Those companies - the top two U.S. grocery sellers - operate fleets of trucks and own dozens of large warehouses, while Amazon is more apt to outsource. 
Whole Foods depends on  United Natural Foods  (UNFI), a debt-laden grocery distributor, to supply dry grocery items like canned goods and toilet paper. 
UNFI (N:UNFI) told Reuters it has ""greatly increased"" routes and hired over 1,000 employees to support clients.
REAL ESTATE RISKS
Whole Foods has 10 small regional warehouses for perishables like fruit, vegetables and meats. UNFI has a network of 59 distribution centers, which average about 500,000 square feet. 
Walmart and Kroger, which have significantly more stores, have bigger distribution centers designed to swiftly move pallets of goods. 
While a Walmart distribution center can deliver two full truckloads of goods to a store from a single driver, Whole Foods has difficulty digesting even one truckload, Strategic Resource Group managing director Burt Flickinger said. 
Whole Foods' ""center store was never the big money generator for them,"" supermarket analyst David Livingston said, referring to the area where dry groceries are sold. 
Indeed, many stores have wine bars, hot food stations and cafes that made them popular gathering places but are of little use right now. 

""They're (Whole Foods) a restaurant alternative. It's really tough,"" Livingston said.

818,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 03:27PM ET</span>",Tesla Can’t Duck Lawsuit Over Musk’s Take-Private Tweet,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. must face an investor lawsuit over Elon Musk’s notorious 2018 tweet about taking the electric car maker private.
The ruling means Tesla will have to provide documents and other evidence to the plaintiffs as the case moves forward. Musk will probably have to submit to a deposition. The judge’s ruling also increases the plaintiffs’ leverage in settlement talks, as investors seek billions of dollars in damages to cover their losses.
The company claimed that Musk’s Twitter post on Aug. 7, 2018 -- “Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured” -- was “aspirational,” not fraudulent. But a San Francisco federal judge ruled Wednesday that shareholders’ lawsuit claiming the tweet was an intentional deception that jolted Tesla’s stock price can go forward.
“Nothing in the statement suggested it was merely aspirational,” U.S. District Judge Edward Chen wrote. “It appears factual,” and according to the complaint, “was not true,” he added.
Musk and Tesla each agreed to pay $20 million to settle a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission suit over the tweet, without admitting guilt. But as Musk continued to tweet about the company, the settlement was amended a year ago to add specific topics he can’t tweet about without advance approval from a Tesla lawyer.
Chen ruled on Wednesday that shareholders made a strong enough case that Musk made false statements “in the scope of his role as CEO of Tesla, with knowledge of the inaccuracies of his statements -- or was, at minimum, deliberately reckless when making such public disclosures” for the lawsuit to move forward.
Tesla didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on the ruling.
In his defense, Musk has pointed to conversations he had with the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund a week before the tweet. Investors argued the potential deal was thin on details and might have required Tesla to build a Middle Eastern production facility.Tesla’s stock surged as much as 13% after the tweet, hammering short sellers who hadn’t covered their positions. Other investors who read Musk’s message as a buy sign sustained losses when doubts mounted about his ability to follow through and the company’s share price plummeted. Weeks later, Musk abandoned the idea of going private.
The case is In re Tesla Inc. Securities Litigation, 18-cv-04865, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).

In a note published Wednesday, Morgan Stanley strategists led by Todd Castagno said only 13% of companies in the S&P 1500 Composite Index have confirmed their earnings release date or announced earnings in the month of April. That stands in stark contrast to 45% of S&P 1500 companies reporting earnings in the same period last year.
“Delayed announcements likely signals continued volatility as the information flow is extended,” the strategists wrote. They warned that those delays could snarl investment strategies dependent on fundamental data.
So far, 35 firms have taken advantage of a Securities and Exchange Commission program that provides companies a 45-day extension for filing 10-K and 10-Q forms, the research shows.
“We expect to see a significant flow of extension filings the last week of April/first week of May, as companies file extensions” for the first quarter, the note said.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) said on Wednesday it had temporarily laid off most of its global production employees and implemented salary cuts in a bid to lower costs as the coronavirus pandemic has hurt its business.
The announcement comes weeks after the motorcycle maker withdrew its earnings forecast for this year, saying pandemic-induced disruptions could dent its ability to supply and sell motorcycles.
Harley's shares were last trading down 5.7% at $18.25.
With the pandemic hitting their revenues and drying up cash flows, companies of all sizes are trying to conserve cash and bolster liquidity.
However, worries about the impact of the highly contagious virus, which causes a respiratory illness called COVID-19, on Harley's business have prompted both Fitch and Moody's to downgrade its credit ratings.
Harley has yet to quantify the impact, but Fitch says the company could see a 25% decline in sales this year.
Separately, Moody's expects declining sales to undermine Harley's liquidity position. At the end of 2019, the Milwaukee-based company had $2.6 billion in cash and committed credit facilities, which the rating agency says would marginally cover the $2.3 billion of debt that is due to mature in the coming twelve months at Harley's financial arm.
As part of the cost cuts, Harley said it would ""significantly"" reduce all non-essential spending.
Its chief executive officer and board of directors will forgo their salaries, the company said, though it didn't say for how long. 
Salaries of the executive leadership would be cut by 30%, while most other salaried employees would see a reduction of between 10%-20% in their paychecks.
Outside the United States, it will take similar actions.
Harley said salary reductions will be reassessed at the end of the second quarter.

The company said it will also not hand out merit increases for 2020 and will freeze hiring.

821,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 03:18PM ET</span>",Broken Bond Markets? Biggest Banks Do Just Fine.,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- While investors across U.S. bond markets were bedeviled by a lack of liquidity last month during the most volatile days of the coronavirus crisis, the purported culprits were bringing in huge amounts of money.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. each reported sharply higher first-quarter revenue from fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading compared with results in the quarter a year earlier. Citigroup led on a year-over-year basis, jumping 39% to $4.79 billion. Goldman Sachs had the biggest gain from the last three months of 2019, with FICC revenue surging by 68% to $2.97 billion.
On a conference call Wednesday, Bank of America Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio cited macro trading, and rates in particular, as a bright spot for the company. Citigroup said revenue from trading rates and currencies specifically jumped 56%, better than other fixed-income assets. Goldman experienced higher client flows across the board. JPMorgan highlighted its rates, currencies and emerging-market businesses while providing charts that showed rates and commodities traders were dealing with volume in March that tripled the average from January. 
A month ago, this would have sounded impossible, judging by how money managers were reacting. I wrote on March 10 that the $17 trillion U.S. Treasury market was malfunctioning, with 30-year yields swinging by the most since the federal government began issuing the maturity in the 1970s. That same day, John McClain, portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital Management, told Bloomberg News’s Sonali Basak that in certain markets, “the traditional liquidity provider in times of stress — the bank — really isn’t there.”
Soon thereafter, Bloomberg’s John Ainger and Liz Capo McCormick (NYSE:MKC) spoke with fixed-income investors about the unprecedented volatility, who also promptly pointed fingers at the banks:
“Liquidity is still atrocious,” said Mark Holman, chief executive officer at TwentyFour Asset Management, an investment firm with about $23 billion in assets that specializes in fixed-income securities. “We were just trying on Monday to trim a long position in the 30-year Treasury because it had moved so far in our favor, and were unable to get bids from several major dealers. We’ve never seen that before.”
“I understand that dealers don’t have the risk appetite and budget they normally have,” said Holman, who has been working in financial markets since 1989. “But I’ve never seen that before, the inability to trade a U.S. Treasury.”
I don’t doubt that happened on the one day in history that the 30-year bond traded at a yield of less than 1%. At one point, the rally was so extreme that the yield touched 0.7% in what was nothing short of a broken market.
Still, it’s worth a reminder to bond traders that just because they can’t sell a security at the price they want in a highly volatile market doesn’t mean that liquidity is nonexistent. Of course dealers are going to quote much wider bid-ask spreads than normal when markets are whipsawing day after day — they need to mitigate their own risk, after all. Clearly, judging by banks’ trading revenue, they were very much open to transacting, but on their terms.
That shift in market dynamic is exactly the point of regulations set up after the 2008 financial crisis. The last thing anyone wants with markets in flux is for large banks to suddenly find themselves saddled with large losses. Bloomberg’s Michelle F. Davis put it nicely:
But the results also mark a win for regulators’ post-crisis moves, which pushed Wall Street banks to act more like middlemen and take less risk on their books. That allowed them to capitalize on volatility rather than focus on offloading bulky positions in declining markets. The firms remained well above regulatory capital minimums, even as they indicated corporate clients drew down far more than $100 billion on credit lines to weather the crisis.
Now, of course, after the Federal Reserve’s drastic intervention across bond markets, investors like Scott Minerd at Guggenheim Partners and Howard Marks at Oaktree Capital Group have turned to casting blame on the central bank for bailing out risky investments. Asset prices have stabilized from those actions and, as a result, investors can move in and out of positions at tighter prices. Now it seems as if no one cares. When it comes to liquidity, there’s no way to win in the eyes of investors.
Bank trading desks, on the other hand, look as if they’ll come out just fine either way.

822,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 03:18PM ET</span>","Wells Fargo, Citi Pause Overdraft Collections as Stimulus Payments Hit","(Bloomberg) --  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). said they’re making adjustments to ensure stimulus payments are received in full by checking-account customers with negative balances.
Wells Fargo is setting aside negative balances for 30 days, while Citigroup said it will provide a temporary provisional credit against a negative balance to give customers full access to their payments. The firms are deviating from the typical practice of deducting a negative balance from incoming payments.
“The goal is to get money in consumers’ hands as easily and quickly as possible,” Ed Kadletz, Wells Fargo’s head of the deposit products group, said in an interview.
This week, millions of Americans began receiving payments of as much as $1,200 through government efforts to rejuvenate the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. For many, payments were automatically deposited into checking accounts. Banks had faced criticism amid speculation that those with overdrawn accounts would lose part or all of their payments.
Wells Fargo gathered a record amount of deposits on Wednesday as customers received the payments and tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service, Kadletz said. The San Francisco-based lender said it will also cash stimulus checks for people without Wells Fargo accounts -- and won’t charge them fees -- at its sprawling network of bank branches.
At JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., some customers with negative balances will see their payment returned to the Treasury Department in full. That allows the government to mail the check instead, JPMorgan said in an email.
Consumers can also receive stimulus payments through a prepaid card, or in their  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL). and  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ). digital wallets.
“The number-one preferred method is direct deposit into a current banking account,” said Kim Bynan, head of prepaid and government solutions at financial-technology firm FIS. “But it doesn’t hit on all of the individuals in America. There are individuals that are under-banked or unbanked. From a prepaid perspective, we’ve pushed the need for another disbursement tool.”

823,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 03:06PM ET</span>",Apple has a $399 iPhone SE for the budget-conscious as coronavirus stalls economy,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) on Wednesday released a smaller iPhone priced at $399, cutting the starting price for the company's smartphone line in a move to broaden its appeal to budget-conscious customers as the coronavirus hobbles the global economy.
The lower-cost model could also attract more consumers to Apple services, a growing driver of revenue. Shares of Apple fell 0.8%, less than the 2.1% decline of the S&P 500 index.
Apple will start taking orders for the phone on its website on Friday, with delivery of devices expected to start April 24.
The iPhone SE will start at $50 less than what was previously the cheapest iPhone available, the iPhone 8, which will be retired. The SE comes with a 4.7-inch display and the same processor chip as Apple's most advanced phone, the 11 Pro. The SE lacks Apple's facial recognition system to unlock the device, instead relying on a fingerprint sensor similar to older models. While the new iPhone adds features such as wireless charging and a high-end camera, it lacks connectivity for 5G, the next generation of mobile data networks.
The announcement comes as the United States and much of the world is reeling from the novel coronavirus, although U.S. political leaders have begun to talk about ending stay-at-home orders and restarting the economy, hoping record deaths and falling hospitalizations represent a peak.
Previous iPhones have been unveiled in a polished presentation in front of fans, but large events remain banned in Apple's home base of Santa Clara County, California, where public officials ordered the first lockdowns in the United States to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Apple's cheaper phone reflects the coronavirus-driven economic downturn and job loss.
Ben Bajarin, principal analyst for consumer market intelligence at Creative Strategies, said that Apple likely realized many customers were buying older models such as the iPhone 8 rather than the newer iPhone 11 Pro at $999, ""and a big part of that is probably price."" Those budget-minded iPhone buyers may have been turned off by the iPhone 8's aging chips and camera.
Apple is ""addressing that head-on with a device and price that can still get people on the latest technology,"" he said. ""Having a device you're sure is going to last a long time is exactly what (consumers) want.""
The new aluminum-and-glass SE - which comes in black, white and red, looks much like an iPhone 8.
The cheaper phone enters a cut-throat market for value phones, especially in China, where Apple derives about 17% of sales. In China, rivals such as  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810) last month announced models with 5G features starting at about $425.
But Bajarin said buyers interested in 5G may gravitate toward flagship phones, while budget buyers “are not people that would give a hoot about 5G.”
With wavering hardware sales, Apple has been investing in subscription services such as its Apple TV+ streaming television service, Apple Music and iCloud. The new SE will come bundled with a one free year of the streaming television service, similar to Apple's flagship devices released last fall.
""Given its price tag, (the iPhone SE) is unlikely to be that impactful for Apple’s financials, but could help widen the installed base, which will be helpful long term for Apple’s services revenue,"" said James Cordwell, an analyst with Atlantic Equities.
Horace Dediu, an analyst with Asymco, said that budget-minded phone buyers may not pay attention to whether a device has Apple's latest chips, but third-party app developers do. If more iPhone users have powerful hardware, he said, it could encourage developers to create apps with augmented reality and artificial intelligence that could help the devices stand out against competitors.
The coronavirus has created a volatile start to the year. Sales in China, the first nation hit by the virus, plunged, then rebounded as the country began to reopen. Sales of 500,000 phones in February rose to 2.5 million phones in March, according to government sales data there.
Apple will begin selling the new model online while its stores around the world are closed, except those within its greater China sales region.
Apple gets about 31% of its sales from its elegant stores and website, with 69% coming from partners such as mobile carriers and other retailers.
Apple said partners would decide whether to sell the phones in their physical stores. Many of Apple's resellers are trying to guide customers toward online sales. Major partners such as  Best Buy  Inc (N:BBY) have reduced their hours, and AT&T Inc (N:T) has closed about 40% of its U.S. retail stores.

Best Buy said customers would be able to pre-order the new iPhone on its website and either have it shipped to their home or use the company's curbside pickup option.  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ), which has stopped selling any phones in physical stores, told Reuters on Wednesday that it will not sell the iPhone SE in stores. T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS) did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

825,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 02:35PM ET</span>","Stocks - Dow Moves off Lows, but Earnings, Record Retail Plunge Weigh","By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com – The Dow moved off session lows on Wednesday, but remained under pressure as a trio of headwinds, including ugly economic data, worrisome earnings and a plunge in oil prices to an 18-year low, triggered a sea of red of across stocks.
The Dow fell 1.60%, or 383 points, but had fallen by as many as 716 points at the lows of the day. TheS&P 500 slipped 1.97% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.06%.
Underscoring the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, retail sales in March plunged to their lowest ever reading as stay-at-home orders across several states and the closure of non-essentials business wreaked havoc on demand.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that retail sales fell 8.7% last month, confounding economists’ forecasts for a 8% decline. But the retail sales control group – which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP – rose  1.7%, compared with a forecast for a 2% decline.
Manufacturing activity in New York, which had already been under pressure pre-coronavirus pandemic, deteriorated further, plunging to a record low reading of -78.2.
Earnings from corporates, meanwhile, offered little reprieve, with quarterly results from Wall Street bank flagging more pain ahead
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) reported a widely expected plunge in profit, with latter leading the downside, falling more than 6%.
The trio of banks also increased their reserves for credit losses by billions of dollars amid expectations for a jump in loan defaults from customers in the coming months.  
The selloff on Wall Street was paced by rapid selling in energy, as oil prices slipped below $20 a barrel to an 18-year low amid worries the recently agreed co-ordinated production cut will do little to offset the coronavirus-led to demand. The U.S. also reported a record build in weekly inventories.
In Europe, meanwhile, Germany said it will begin reopening its economy next week. 
Germany will start reopening its economy on April 20, Chancellor Angela Merkel said, according to published reports. Large public events will be banned until August 31 at the earliest, while schools will start in early May."

832,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 12:55PM ET</span>",Tesla shares extend rally after China registration surge and nod from Goldman,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Tesla's (O:TSLA) stock extended its recent rally on Wednesday following a surge in China car registrations and after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) initiated coverage of the electric car maker with a ""buy"" recommendation.
Shares of the Silicon Valley automaker rose nearly 2%, bringing their gain this week to 26% as traders look beyond the short-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced Tesla to close its California factory, furlough workers and cut salaries.
Tesla's China car registrations jumped 450% in March, month on month, data from auto consultancy LMC Automotive showed. Overall auto sales in China plunged 43.4% in March, as a coronavirus pandemic continued to depress demand.
In a note late on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney started coverage of Tesla with a $864 price target, compared to its latest price of $723.
""We believe that the combination of Tesla's product leadership (including its over-the-air updates to continue to improve vehicle performance), brand/early-mover advantage, vertical integration, and the long development cycles in autos (new cars can take 2-4 years to develop) will help Tesla to maintain a strong market position,"" Delaney wrote.
Wall Street has long been divided over Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk. Supporters expect Tesla to become a dominant global car maker, with a fleet of driverless taxis, while many skeptics doubt Tesla can become sustainably profitable.
Goldman Sachs' previous Tesla analyst, David Tamberrino, had a ""sell"" rating and a $158 price target as of last June, the lowest on the street at that time.
Previously, in 2016, Goldman Sachs attracted attention when it upgraded Tesla to ""buy"" just hours before the car maker announced a $2 billion stock offer with Goldman Sachs and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) acting as joint lead bookrunners. 

Tesla's stock has doubled from its March low and remains down 20% from its record high close in February, before fears about the impact of the coronavirus on the global economy triggered a deep stock market sell-off.

835,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 11:50AM ET</span>","Stocks - Wall Street Heads Lower Midday, Coming to Terms With Dour Data","By Geoffrey Smith  
Investing.com -- U.S. stocks extended their losses midday Wednesday as grim economic data and earnings finally overshadowed Federal Reserve dollars and underscored how much repair the global economy will need when it restarts.
By 11:45 AM ET (1545 GMT), all three major indices were extending earlier losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 660 points, or 2.75%. The S&P 500 was down 2.9% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 2%. They had posted rises of between 2.4% and 4.0% on Tuesday, all hitting their highest levels in over a month.
The market was brought down to earth by the biggest-ever monthly drop in retail sales in March, a set of data that didn't even include the full impact of the lockdowns that have been imposed across the country in stages. Retail sales fell by 8.7%, with autos and discretionary items hit particularly hard. Core sales, which exclude autos, fell by a slightly better-than-expected 4.5%. 
There was equally bad news from the nation's factories. Industrial output fell 5.4% in March, another number that far exceeded even the worst monthly falls during the 2008/9 recession. Manufacturing output fell even more acutely, by 6.3%. The Empire State Manufacturing index, which tracks factory activity in New York state, likewise plummeted to a record low of -78.2.
Those numbers were also reported in a raft of sharp falls in earnings at the country's biggest banks, which all reported spikes in provisions against bad loans. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock fell 6.3% and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock fell 4%.
There was positive news from the airline sector, where stocks rose across the board early on in response to the bailout agreement secured late on Tuesday with the federal government. But even in this sector, stocks reversed early gains to trade broadly mixed. 
United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock fell 2.8%, while Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock was down 4.5% and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock was down 2.8%. 
Among the outperformers was UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) stock, which rose 2.1% after the health insurer said it had seen no substantial impact to profitability from the pandemic so far. It thus was able to stick to its guidance for the year, in contrast to many companies that have had to pull theirs due to the acute degree of uncertainty.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was also among the gainers after a report showing its factory in China returned to life in March as lockdowns eased. Tesla stock rose 1% to its highest in five weeks.
Oil and gas stocks remained under pressure as crude futures fell below $20 again after the International Energy Agency warned that the world market would remain extremely oversupplied in the near term and the Energy Information Administration reported a record rise in U.S. crude stockpiles. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock was down 12.4%, while  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock was down 6.8%"

838,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 11:27AM ET</span>",Quants Fight ‘Greedy Black Box’ Rep With Ride Into ESG Wild West,"(Bloomberg) -- When Gideon Smith and his AXA Rosenberg colleagues set up their quant fund in 2013, they called it “Sustainable Equities” since the original goal was to deliver sustainable earnings.
But its penchant for the environmentally sustainable is what made things really take off.
With the pitch that it could deliver a clean conscience as well as returns, the fund’s assets have defied the pandemic-induced market turmoil to triple over the past year to $789 million.
Welcome to the ethical gold rush in quantland, where systematic managers are morphing into evangelists for environmental, social and governance investing. It’s woke. It’s popular. It’s earnest.
And no one can agree whether it works.
Smith will tell you it does. He retooled his value model to make it consider each stock’s carbon footprint, based on his thesis that capital markets will increasingly punish polluters. Even through the coronavirus crisis, his fund has dropped just 2% over the past year compared with a 5% decline for its benchmark.
“If I can build an equity fund that has ESG integrated into it and delivers the same investment outcomes, why would I not?” Smith said in an interview. “There is a sweet spot where you can maximize both.”
He’s in good company, as the biggest names from Dimensional Fund Advisors to PanAgora Asset Management tout ESG as the next frontier in a brand of quant trading known as equity factor investing.
This is a cohort that typically devises investment rules by crunching decades of data to find strategies with proven profitability. So there’s a fierce debate surrounding the outperformance -- or otherwise -- of this newfangled allocation style.
For one, ESG scores are notoriously inconsistent across providers, and most such indexes in the U.S. more or less performed in line with benchmarks through the recent bout of turbulence. QMA and Robeco -- quant shops integrating ESG in one form or another -- are among those conceding there’s little historic evidence of alpha.
At AQR Capital Management, founder Cliff Asness has argued that sacrificing performance is the whole point of it all. By screening out the bad, investors raise the cost of capital for these companies, he said at a London conference last year. That translates into higher returns for those willing to buy the stock.
That line of reasoning fits right into quant orthodoxy but sits awkwardly with the ESG boom.
“If a company is truly a good company, that’s probably already priced in,” said Stacie Mintz, a fund manager at QMA, which oversees $127 billion. “We don’t believe that tilting toward ESG is going to help your portfolio. Theoretically, it may hurt, which is why we think it’s important to pair it with” other processes, she said.
$20 Trillion
But for all these academic questions, quants can hardly afford to watch the green bandwagon hurtle past.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). estimates investors will pour an astonishing $20 trillion -- not much less than the value of the S&P 500 -- into ESG funds over the next 20 years. Inflows into such products notched new records in the U.S. and Europe last year, Morningstar data show.
“These things are important in changing the image of quants,” Etienne Vincent said as head of global quantitative management at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management, before joining Ossiam. “Quants are not just greedy black boxes.”
Increasingly, many are willing to part with conventional wisdom to bet on a future where historical data may offer little guidance. Guido Baltussen, co-head of quant allocation at Robeco, says while the 10 to 15 years of numbers it’s looked at shows there’s little added value from using ESG, there’s still a good case for it.
“Qualitatively, from a risk perspective, it helps because stocks that, for example, pollute the environment quite a bit or have high greenhouse gas emissions will most likely in the future face higher costs,” he said. “It’s purely a belief -- there’s not enough evidence for that yet.”
Diverse Approaches
Like Smith and his carbon footprints, some quants say they’ve found trading signals in pockets of ESG, even if it’s still far from what they would call a factor, or a stock characteristic like how cheap companies look that predicts long-term outperformance.
That means different firms can draw radically different interpretations. Some are developing proprietary ESG measures across the board and scraping news articles, social media and earnings reports for intel.
Others like AQR dabble in ESG more selectively only when the data flash reliable trading signals. Right now, it uses sustainability and governance signals to guide stock picking in its regular strategies but not environmental, the firm’s head of responsible investment Chris Palazzolo says.The good news for those who want to make money from shifts in regulation and consumer spending friendly to ESG companies is that they actually might not need new strategies.
Researchers at BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). found that a multi-factor portfolio already has lower carbon emissions and a slightly higher ESG score than a market benchmark, partly because investing styles such as low volatility and quality are inherently skewed toward better-behaved firms.
Still they also found that a fund aimed at maximizing ESG scores would have skewed style exposures and trail a regular factor strategy. The upshot: ESG may offer returns in key areas but only up to a point.
Meanwhile the market meltdown this year spurred both by the oil collapse and the spreading virus is doing little to settle these existential questions.
While the largest ESG exchange-traded funds did hardly better than the S&P 500 this year, QMA’s sustainability strategy outperformed in part because of its defensive tilt and avoidance of carbon-intensive industries such as airlines and oil, according to fund manager Gavin Smith.
All that means recent performance is shining little light on key issues like whether the ESG hype offers long-term alpha or if it’s just been lucky of late.
“It may be the case that ESG has actually been successful this year but one year of course doesn’t tell you everything you need to know,” said Palazzolo at AQR. “It’s very difficult to say ESG has performed this or that because there are lots of different approaches.”

845,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 11:09AM ET</span>",The Fed Can Now Buy ETFs. That Alone Means It Might Not Have To,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s planned foray into the $4 trillion exchange-traded fund market may be over before it ever began.
The U.S. central bank’s surprise announcement that it intended to purchase investment-grade ETFs as signs of a liquidity crunch mounted drove up demand from investors trying to front-run the central bank. The March 23 decree sparked a $5.7 billion stampede into high-grade funds in the weeks since, reversing a disconnect that saw the ETFs trade at a discount to the underlying bonds.
For now, the Fed’s signal alone has been enough to loosen the cash crunch that had squeezed global bond markets amid spreading coronavirus fears. The high-grade credit ETFs traded at a premium to their net-asset values after selling off more quickly than their underlying bond holdings in the weeks prior. The same dynamic took place in junk-bond ETFs just a few weeks later after the Fed included high-yield debt in its plans. With the fixed-income market stabilized, the central bank may not have to step in, according to Franklin Templeton.
“Certainly anecdotally, finding buyers of the underlying bonds was becoming harder,” said David Mann, head of global ETF capital markets at the issuer. “The market has interpreted that announcement by the Fed as ‘OK, they’re going to be stepping in, so we can go back to normal,’ and if the threat of them acting was sufficient, then they don’t necessarily even have to act.”
The Fed’s Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facilities allows the central bank to purchase of up to 10% of an issuer’s outstanding bonds and up to 20% of the assets of eligible ETFs.
The impact of the March 23 announcement was immediate, with the $44 billion iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, ticker LQD, taking in the most cash and is up 15%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Junk-bond ETFs have attracted roughly $1.5 billion in new assets this week alone after the Fed expanded its program last Thursday. The two biggest junk ETFs surged the most since 2008 in the aftermath.
The Fed’s pledged foray helped restore order to the creation and redemption process, which keeps ETF prices in line with the presumptive value of their holdings. Normally, specialized traders known as authorized participants buy shares of a falling ETF in order to exchange for the underlying bonds with the fund’s issuer. That market maker will then sell those securities to pocket a virtually risk-free profit. The ETF’s price usually snaps back to the fund’s net-asset value as the supply of ETF shares is reduced.
Rampant volatility soured the appeal of that arbitrage opportunity as trading in the underlying bond markets effectively froze, with the ETFs trading at a steep discount as a result. Those price discrepancies were quickly repaired in the wake of the Fed’s announcement. LQD’s price closed 5% below its net-asset value on March 19, before soaring to a 5% premium on March 25. The fund is now trading a modest 0.7% above its net-asset value.
The Fed’s pledge also threw a lifeline to some of the biggest fixed-income mutual funds, which saw $240 billion of outflows in March. The withdrawals have slowed to roughly $34 billion in April.
“Just stating their support and willingness to step into the market may have been enough to stop the outflows and prevent NAVs from printing down from both ETFs and mutual funds,” said James Seyffart, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.
As of April 10, the Fed has yet to make use of its new corporate bond buying program. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said last week that the facilities were likely “a few weeks away,” and that the announcement alone has “helped provide support” for companies by reducing volatility in those markets.
In the meantime, cracks in the credit market continue to mend. New issuance in investment-grade markets has surged 67% ahead of last year’s pace, while speculative-grade borrowers have started to return to the primary market. With the “healing process” already taking place, the Fed may not have to follow through with ETF purchases, according to Barings.
“Unless that high-yield market rolls over and comes under additional pressure, the Fed may never venture into buying high-yield ETFs,” said Scott Roth, a high-yield portfolio manager at Barings. “The signal that they could buy may be enough to achieve its desired effect.”

The company said that starting next week, some corporate employees would also participate in voluntary reduced work weeks and furloughs, while its top management and board would take a pay cut. 
Best Buy, however, would retain about 82% of its full-time store and field employees. 
The company said sales grew about 25% during an 8-day period ended March 20, a day before the company announced its decision to switch to a curbside delivery model, as people shopped for work-from-home equipment, gaming-related products as well as products needed to freeze food.
Best Buy added that domestic online sales surged over 250% from a year earlier, with half the sales coming from customers who picked-up their products from stores.
However, store closures and decreased footfall have dented demand, and sales dropped 30% from March 21 through April 11, Best Buy said.
""The situation remains very fluid and there is still a great deal of uncertainty, particularly as it relates to depth and duration of store closures and consumer confidence over time,"" Chief Executive Officer Corie Barry said. 
The company has already withdrawn all financial forecasts for fiscal 2021 and drawn down the full amount of its $1.25 billion revolving credit facility.
Best Buy had nearly 125,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, at the end of fiscal 2020, according to an annual filing.

Shares of the company, which will report its results for the first quarter ending May 2, late next month, were down about 6% in early trading on Wednesday.

850,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 10:56AM ET</span>",Amazon to close French warehouses until next week after court order,"By Mathieu Rosemain and Gwénaëlle Barzic
PARIS (Reuters) - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will close its warehouses in France until at least early next week after a court ordered it to limit deliveries to essential goods such as food and medical supplies.
In an internal document sent to French unions ahead of a meeting on Wednesday afternoon, Amazon said it planned to close the country's six warehouses, which employ 10,000 permanent and interim workers, from April 16 until April 20 at least. 
""The company is forced to suspend all production activities in all of its distribution centers in order to assess the inherent risks in the COVID-19 epidemic and take the necessary measures to ensure the safety of its employees (during that period),"" Amazon said in the document seen by Reuters.
During the suspension, Amazon will tap a state partial unemployment scheme to pay its employees, the group said in the internal document.
Amazon's French subsidiary did not return calls seeking comments.
The world's largest online retailer is facing mounting scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic of the health measures it has put in place to protect employees from the coronavirus while it deals with a surge in online orders.
With most shops in France shuttered as the government tries to contain the pandemic, the closure of the warehouses will likely disrupt deliveries across the country.
In a ruling on Tuesday, a French court said Amazon had to carry out a more thorough assessment of the risk of coronavirus contagion at its warehouses and should restrict its deliveries in the meantime, or face a fine.
""We're puzzled by the court ruling given the hard evidence brought forward regarding security measures put in place to protect our employees"", Amazon said in a statement.
""Our interpretation suggests that we may be forced to suspend the activity of our distribution centres in France,"" the group said, adding it would appeal the decision.
The case followed a complaint filed by Union Syndicale Solidaires, a French group of trade unions. 
Some of them had called for the complete closure of Amazon's activities in France, or at the very least a clampdown, after raising concerns over health standards at its shipping sites, arguing they were too crowded.
Amazon currently employs close to 10,000 people at its six French warehouses, 6,500 of whom are on permanent contracts, according to the court decision.

Cases of COVID-19, the flu-like infection caused by the virus, have been reported among staff from at least 19 Amazon warehouses in the United States and the company has been hit by high-profile protests at several warehouses there.

Brushing off forecasts of a sluggish recovery, O'Leary predicted a swift traffic rebound, with the pain coming instead from ""massive price-dumping"" that traditional airlines now seeking bailouts would struggle to keep up with.
""When this thing is over there is going to be such massive discounting going on that there will be a large spike upward in travel and tourism for a period of time,"" O'Leary said.
""How long it will take pricing to recover ... we think that's out into 2021, but who knows?"" 
Asked if 2021 would see weak profits, he said: ""No. I think 2021 has every prospect of being a bumper year in terms of earnings. Prices will be lower, but oil prices will be lower. There will be much more incentives at airports for growth"".
O'Leary also said he would hold onto orders for the grounded Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX, which would be needed for future growth, and hinted at a possible new aircraft order at a time when manufacturers are willing to offer low prices.
O'Leary said he saw ""more opportunities than obstacles"" to placing a new order, with keen pricing for aircraft expected in the next 12 months. Ryanair would not defer or cancel planes.
He expected Boeing would resume 737 MAX production in the second half of the year, with the first of 135 MAX jets on order expected to reach Ryanair in late 2020 or early 2021.

O'Leary said he was hearing ""more optimistic noises from Boeing"" on 737 MAX wiring and other issues lately.

854,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 10:45AM ET</span>",Franklin Templeton grabs more Gulf government debt amid oil crash,"By Yousef Saba and Davide Barbuscia
DUBAI (Reuters) - Franklin Templeton has recently bought more bonds issued by governments in the Gulf, including high-yield names like Oman and Bahrain, seeing value as yields spiked on the back of plunging oil prices and the coronavirus outbreak.
Gulf governments are raising billions of dollars in the debt markets to offset the impact of lower oil revenue on their budgets, but a recent sell-off due to plunging oil and the coronavirus pandemic has pushed up their borrowing costs.
Abu Dhabi and Qatar sold $17 billion in bonds between them last week and Saudi Arabia is expected to close a multi-billion dollar issue later on Wednesday.
Since the beginning of March, Franklin Templeton's GCC Bond Fund increased exposure to sovereigns to 39% from 29% and slashed financial institutions to 12% from 19%, Dino Kronfol, Franklin Templeton's chief investment officer of global sukuk and MENA fixed income, told Reuters.
The investment firm, which managed about $580 billion in global assets as of end-March according to its website, cut exposure to Gulf government-related entities to 18% from 20% and edged up corporates to 27% from 25.5% in the same period.
""We came into the coronavirus crisis relatively defensive but the oil price came as a surprise,"" Kronfol said. ""At the depth of the crash, we shifted around 20% of the portfolio, with a strong bias towards sovereigns.""
Oil prices have tumbled on the back of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as oversupply, worsened by the collapse last month of an agreement between OPEC and allies led by Russia. On Sunday, they agreed a new output curb deal but it has done little to lift oil prices.
Franklin Templeton increased its exposure to Oman by 7% and Bahrain and Saudi Arabia by 3% each since mid-March, he said.
""At the depth of the crisis, we shifted slightly down from higher-quality names into higher-yielding names. For example, selling some Abu Dhabi to buy some Saudi or to be able to buy Oman and Bahrain,"" Kronfol said.
He said given where Bahrain and Oman's debt was trading, investors were expecting them to restructure within two years, which he saw as too simplistic. Kronfol expects decisive action from both countries on spending, for them to have enough resources to navigate the next two years, the Gulf states to express support for Oman and oil to recover.
The yield on Bahrain's 30-year bonds due in 2047 rose to a peak of 10% on March 20 from about 6% at end-February. Oman's similar bonds due in 2048 rose to a peak of 12.1% yield from 7% in the same period. They have since recovered to 8% and 10% respectively.
""The GCC Bond Fund was at about $205 million before this crisis and is now closer to $165 million,"" he said, with about half lost due to the market and half due to redemptions.
Kronfol expected Gulf assets under management to rise and said outlook for business remained positive for the year.

Banks are under pressure to speed up the granting of loans to companies trying to stay afloat during a national lockdown to slow the spread of COVID-19.
Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, told lawmakers that checking the ability of companies to repay a loan takes time compared with the system in countries such as Germany, where similar loans are 100% state-backed.
The biggest backlog was for loans of less than 25,000 pounds, and issuing these would be faster if the government did not require banks to take on 20% of the risk, Jones said.
Jones said banks were making progress on the backlog, and that loosening the rules would increase the risk to taxpayers.
""I would urge a few more days of patience... before any re-engineering of the scheme is done,"" Jones he told parliament's Treasury Select Committee.

860,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 10:18AM ET</span>",Homebuilder Confidence Takes Record Plunge on Hit from Virus,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. homebuilder sentiment plunged in April to the lowest level in more than seven years as the coronavirus pandemic kept potential buyers quarantined and paralyzed construction in much of the country.
Confidence among builders tumbled to 30 from a measure of 72 in March, according to the latest National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index released Wednesday. It was the biggest monthly decline in the 30-year history of the index and the lowest reading since June 2012.
The unprecedented drop “is due exclusively to the coronavirus outbreak across the nation, as unemployment has skyrocketed and gaps in the supply chain have hampered construction activities,” Dean Mon, the group’s chairman, said in a statement.
April’s measure was the first time the index fell below 50 since June 2014. A reading below that level indicates more builders view conditions as poor than good. The gauge reached 76 at the end of 2019, the highest in two decades.
Before the pandemic hit, the market for newly built houses was showing signs of strength, with sales in January and February at their fastest pace since the Great Recession, according to Robert Dietz, the group’s chief economist.
But with stay-at-home orders in place across much of the country, “builders have seen very significant declines in buyer traffic and they’re facing a variety of different business challenges, including some states that have deemed home construction not an essential activity,” Dietz said in an interview before the survey was released. “We’re expecting significant declines in all kinds of housing activity during the second quarter, stabilization in the third and then recovery in the fourth.”
There’s no historical precedent for the precipitous plunge in housing and economic activity, Dietz said.
“I can’t think of an example of such a sudden stop of the economy,” he said. “But at the same time, that suggests the potential to come back online. So I think we’re kind of in uncharted waters.”

868,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 09:54AM ET</span>",Automakers Will Need Months to Get Factories Back Up and Running,"(Bloomberg) -- Automakers are anxious to get their assembly lines rolling again, especially since leaving factories idle is costing them billions of dollars by the week.
But the experience many of them have had in China illustrates just how long a slog it’s going to be before plants are producing at anywhere near pre-shutdown levels. It took almost two months for most of China’s industry to return to some semblance of normalcy -- and that was with the benefit of mobile apps the government installed on citizens’ cell phones to track their movements and potential exposure to Covid-19 infected people.
North American factories may have the benefit of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) trying to start a similar contract-tracing effort, but participation will be voluntary. And the tensions brewing already between President Donald Trump and state governors indicate U.S. government efforts won’t be nearly as centralized as China’s was, suggesting that already cash-strapped suppliers may also have to deal with a patchwork of state-by-state orders dictating when businesses can reopen.
“Discipline is the key to success,” Jim Tobin, the president of Asia operations at auto-parts maker Magna International Inc., said last week. “In China, there’s mandates that come out. Here, there are requests.”
Magna and other companies implemented dozens of protocols -- including worker-temperature screenings and physical distance barriers -- to open factories on single shifts, Tobin said during a webinar hosted by the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Many vehicle and parts plants in North America had been running multiple shifts to meet demand that’s held steady near all-time highs for years. Now, sales have cratered and are unlikely to recover quickly.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) both are planning to begin reopening U.S. plants on May 4 after idling them in mid-March. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. have refrained from scheduling restart dates for their facilities, while  Toyota  Motor Corp. (NYSE:TM) and  Honda  Motor Co (NYSE:HMC)  have said theirs will be down through at least May 1.
While setting dates to reopen sends a signal to suppliers to start getting their parts inventories ready, doing so won’t be simple, with new layers of precautions and complications that didn’t exist before shelter-in-place orders came into effect nearly a month ago.
Here’s a rundown of what the industry is grappling with as it prepares for a restart:
Patchwork of Orders
A typical vehicle has thousands of parts, and as automakers survey their supply chains, they now have to look not just at inventories, but at health orders across the country. What the virus curve looks like in Illinois compared with Michigan or Ohio could determine whether or not a vehicle will have all the components needed to resume production.
“What the manufacturers need to do is be able to map out state by state, county by county, where manufacturers are with regards to local lockdown stay-at-home orders,” said Brian Collie, head of Boston Consulting Group’s U.S. automotive practice.
Even in states where people are allowed back to work, auto companies will likely use staggered shifts to increase social distancing and allow for more frequent deep cleaning. They’ll also likely deal with high rates of absenteeism, especially among older workers who fear getting infected, Collie said.
Supply Chain
Suppliers typically need a week or two of advance work to support an automaker’s ability to start running their assembly lines again, said Anne Marie Uetz, a Detroit-based partner at the law firm Foley and Lardner LLP, which represents parts manufacturers. And there are at least two major impediments the supply chain will be dealing with: kids and cash.
With many school systems closed until the end of the year, parents within the workforce will have to find some form of child care before reporting back to plants. Many will be wary of bringing the virus home to their families.
The other problem is cash flow. With production already having been shut down for roughly a month, suppliers’ coffers are starting to run dry and many need help with the expenditures necessary to restart, Uetz said. Some are getting assistance from the federal government, but automakers also are negotiating ways to help.
The dire financial straits many suppliers are in doesn’t leave much room for error in deciding on when to resume output, Magna’s Tobin said.
“Start-stop does not help liquidity, because we start buying material, employing people, then they say, ‘We’re going to push it out another two weeks,’” Tobin said, referring to supplier-carmaker relationships.
PPE Needs
Much of the auto industry has pivoted to supporting the health-care industry by making ventilators, masks, face shields and medical gowns. Some of those efforts to make personal protection equipment -- or PPE -- will come in handy for their own workforce, which pushed back against keeping factories open last month.
Social distancing and barriers will be go-to tools, but for workers who can’t avoid close interaction, they’ll need face shields, said Aaron McCarthy, Magna’s chief of human resources. Companies may be unable to provide them until front-line health care workers have enough.
Ford is already tallying up the equipment needs for its workplaces, Jim Farley, the automaker’s chief operating officer, said in a podcast interview with Automotive News last week.
“We’re identifying all the PPE requirements, which is millions and millions and millions of equipment we’re going to need to bring people back,” Farley said. “We’re not going to bring anyone back or even think about it before we have the sufficient supplies.”

875,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 09:35AM ET</span>",Citigroup profit tumbles as loan defaults loom,"By Imani Moise and David Henry
(Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) reported a 46% plunge in quarterly profit on Wednesday as the bank set aside nearly $5 billion to prepare for an expected flood of defaults on loans due to a virtual halt in economic activity caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The novel coronavirus outbreak has temporarily shuttered businesses around the globe, put millions out of work in the United States alone and is expected to cause the deepest recession in recent memory.
Wall Street banks are bracing themselves for a sharp rise in loan defaults as rising unemployment rates leave Americans cash- strapped and unable to make payments on their credit cards, mortgages and other loans.
Lenders with more exposure to unsecured loans such as credit cards are more susceptible to hefty writedowns, as credit card delinquencies have historically risen in lockstep with unemployment.
Citigroup recorded a $4.89 billion expense in the quarter, up from $20 million in the year-ago period, to boost reserves against anticipated losses on loans, primarily in its credit cards. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) said on Tuesday its profit plunged by more than two-thirds mostly because of a $7 billion addition to loan loss reserves, half of which were for credit cards.
""Our earnings for the first quarter were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Citi's Chief executive Officer Michael Corbat said in the earnings statement. 
""The deteriorating economic outlook and the transition to the new Current Expected Credit Loss standard (CECL) caused us to build significant loan loss reserves.""
The blow to earnings was cushioned by a surge in fees as trading desks cashed in on the turbulent markets in February and March. Both equities and fixed income trading reported a 39% jump from a year earlier. 
Total revenue rose to $20.73 billion, topping Wall Street's estimate of $19 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Total net income fell to $2.52 billion, or $1.05 per share, in the three months ended March 31, from $4.71 billion, or $1.87 per share, a year earlier. Earnings per share were also boosted by a 10% reduction in shares outstanding. 
Analysts on average had expected Citigroup to earn $1.04 per share.
Total end-of-period loans grew 8%, excluding foreign-exchange fluctuations, while deposits jumped 17%.

Shares fell 4% in premarket trading as concerns about rising credit costs overshadowed the trading gains, which are expected to fade following government intervention to stabilize markets.

886,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 09:30AM ET</span>","Goldman's corporate loans, balance sheet investments eat away at profits","By Anirban Sen and Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc's (N:GS) quarterly profit nearly halved, as it set aside more money to cover for corporate loans expected to go bust in the coming months and booked heavy losses on its debt and equity investments.
The Wall Street trading powerhouse on Wednesday also warned that it expects reduced revenue in its asset and wealth management businesses and a higher rate of client defaults in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic.
While total net revenue was flat at $8.74 billion, three out of the bank's four business lines reported higher numbers. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $7.92 billion.
""Our quarterly profitability was inevitably affected by the economic dislocation,"" said Chief Executive Officer David Solomon. ""As public policy measures to stem the pandemic take root, I am firmly convinced that our firm will emerge well-positioned.""
Under Solomon, Goldman has been attempting to reduce its reliance on its flagship trading business and build out its consumer bank, although trading made a comeback in the quarter on that back wild swings in financial markets and accounted for nearly 60% of overall revenue.
Even as Goldman, under Solomon, has been trying to rework its business for the long term, this unusual period proved to be a lucky one for a bank without a major consumer lending arm.
""GS has less NII & credit risk than the big banks and it was good to see incremental profitability shine thru in the global markets and investment banking segments on the better volumes this quarter,"" Evercore ISI Glenn Schorr said in a note.
Solomon has made growing Goldman's consumer bank, Marcus, a top priority, and this quarter the division reported a $12-billion increase in deposits. He hopes to get Marcus deposits reach $125 billion in the next five years.
The bank's net earnings applicable to common shareholders fell to $1.12 billion in the first quarter ended March 31 from $2.18 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share tumbled to $3.11 from $5.71.
Analysts on average had expected a profit of $3.35 per share, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv.
On Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) said its profit plunged by more than two-thirds in the first quarter as the largest U.S. bank put aside nearly $7 billion in reserves to protect it from a wave of potential loan defaults in the months ahead.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) also reported dismal numbers due to loan loss provisions.

TRADING COMEBACK
The bank's bond trading business had its best quarter in nearly five years. Fixed income revenue surged 33%, while equities trading revenue jumped 22%.
The strong performance in trading, however, was offset by weakness in its asset management reporting line, where it booked losses of $868 million from lending and debt investments.
Provision for credit losses was $937 million for the first quarter, compared with $224 million a year earlier and $336 million in the fourth quarter.
Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for the first quarter of 2020 were $184 million, compared with $37 million in the year-ago quarter.
Goldman also saw a 10% rise in operating expenses from a year earlier, primarily due to significantly higher expenses related to brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees. 
In January, Solomon also set goals that the bank achieve a 13% return on equity (ROE), over 14% return on tangible equity (ROTE) and a 60% efficiency ratio within the next three years. 
The bank fell far short of those return targets this quarter, reporting an annualized ROE of 5.7% and ROTE of 6%.
Most brokerages tracking the investment bank had factored in a slump in macroeconomic conditions as the fallout of the coronavirus crisis whipsawed the broader economy, and expectations were muted on key financial metrics. 
Goldman's main rival  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) will report quarterly results on Thursday.

Goldman's shares were down over 3% in premarket trade.

The plan still needs to be voted on by shareholders, but it is likely to be approved, as the company has a controlling shareholder, the Cueto family.
LATAM's closest competitors, Colombia's Avianca Holdings (CN:AVT_p) and Brazil's Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (SA:GOLL4), posted losses in 2019 so they do not have a dividend to distribute.
Avianca's board initially proposed to distribute a dividend based on pre-2019 profits but then walked back the proposal in early March amid backlash and as the coronavirus began to spread fast in Latin America.
Under Chilean law, companies are expected to distribute 30% of their net profits to shareholders. LATAM's proposal would still distribute the 2019 dividends but sometime in the future.

LATAM has suspended all of its international flights this month and is only operating a small number of domestic flights in Chile and Brazil.

The ISS recommendations, seen by Reuters, come as a boost for the Swiss bank after Glass Lewis advised shareholders to deny its leadership a discharge following a spying scandal that cost ex-boss Tidjane Thiam his job.
Financial market supervisor FINMA is probing the bank's conduct in the affair, and has appointed an independent auditor to investigate whether management control failures led to Switzerland's second-largest bank snooping on two former executives last year.
""Whilst the company is currently subject to an ongoing FINMA probe, we note that no formal charges have been brought against the company, and it has not been confirmed that any individuals are subject to proceedings. Furthermore, it appears that the responsible individuals were identified and subsequently dismissed,"" ISS said in its statement.
However, it noted that its position on the matter could change should charges be brought against members of Credit Suisse's governing bodies or ""in case of other significant concerns"".
ISS recommended investors approve all of the bank's proposals, barring one on additional voting instructions, since it said it did not know what such new items or counterproposals might entail.

It also backed Credit Suisse's plan to split up its 2019 dividend, following a request from FINMA, and propose just half its initially planned payout at the AGM, saying such a move was warranted given the global health crisis and surrounding financial uncertainty.

The company said Andrew Witty, head of UnitedHealth's pharmacy benefit unit, Optum, will take a leave of absence to help lead the World Health Organization's new initiative for COVID-19 vaccine development.
UnitedHealth said it will continue to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 as the year progresses.
""UNH's outlook demonstrates how well protected managed care sector earnings will be from the COVID-19 crisis in near term from the unprecedented restrictions on elective health care,"" Stephens analyst Scott Fidel said.
The largest U.S. health insurer said it continues to expect adjusted net earnings of $16.25 to $16.55 per share for the year, the mid-point of which is above analysts' estimate of $16.22, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Health insurers including UnitedHealth,  Cigna Corp  (N:CI) and Anthem Inc (N:ANTM) have announced measures to reduce patient cost sharing on COVID-19 testing and care.
For the quarter ended March 31, earnings attributable to UnitedHealth shareholders fell 2.5% to $3.38 billion, or $3.52 per share, hurt by a 7.1% jump in operating expenses. 
However, the company reported medical loss ratio - the percentage of premiums paid out for medical services - of 81.0%, a decrease of 1% from a year earlier, benefiting from the return of the industry-wide health insurance fee. 
The ratio beat analysts' estimates of 81.57%.
""Deferred and avoided care from the broad economic shutdown likely more than offset the narrower direct costs of COVID-19 patients,"" Evercore ISI analyst Michael Newshel said.
Revenue from its Optum unit, which manages drug benefits and offers healthcare data analytics services, rose 24.6% year-over-year to $32.84 billion.
UnitedHealth's core business that sells health insurance plans brought in $51.07 billion in sales, a 4.4% rise from a year earlier.

The company reported adjusted earnings of $3.72 per share, beating estimates of $3.63. Total revenue for the quarter rose 6.8% to $64.42 billion, beating Street estimates of $64.32 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks fell on Wednesday as oil prices dropped and warnings of the worst global recession since the 1930s underscored the economic damage done by the coronavirus pandemic.
European stock markets faltered, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index down 1.9% after five days of gains fuelled by suggestions the health crisis was ebbing and lockdown measures may soon start to ease.
Much of the damage was felt by oil companies.  Total  SA (PA:TOTF), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc and  BP  (LON:BP) Plc all sank, pushing the European energy index to its lowest this month as oil prices fell.
Benchmark Brent crude futures traded down 4% to $28.46 after the International Energy Agency on Wednesday forecast a drop in oil demand of 29 million barrels per day in April, to levels not seen in 25 years. It warned no output cut by producers could offset the decline.
Much economic damage has also already been done, with the International Monetary Fund predicting the world this year would suffer its steepest downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
China earlier moved again to cushion its economy, cutting a key medium-term interest rate to record lows, paving the way for a similar reduction in benchmark loan rates, while reducing the amount banks must hold as reserves.
Those moves are injecting a combined $43 billion into world's second largest economy, but they failed to boost for world shares. MSCI's All-Country World Index, which tracks shares across 49 countries, was down 0.6%.

Focus is now starting to shift to the corporate results due in the coming weeks. Signs of stress caused by the pandemic are already widespread.
""A lot of good news has been priced in and we're due for some consolidation, particularly as we head into earnings season, as we all know the numbers will not be good,"" said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners.
PERSISTENT WORRIES 
Dutch navigation and digital mapping company TomTom shed 2.7% after saying it expected negative free cash flow this year and lower revenue from its automotive and consumer businesses due to the pandemic.
London-based asset manager Jupiter Fund Management dropped 5.6% after reporting an 18.3% drop in assets under management in the first quarter as fears over the pandemic rattled financial markets.
In the United States, E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 fell 1.8%, following a 3% rise in New York.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) recorded a 48.5% fall in quarterly profit as the bank set aside $3.6 billion for potential loan losses tied to the coronavirus pandemic.
Even as some U.S. states considered relaxing restrictions, the country's death toll rose by at least 2,228, a single-day record, according to a Reuters tally.
President Donald Trump responded by saying some states could still open shortly or even immediately. He also temporarily halted funding to the World Health Organization, saying it should have done more to head off the pandemic.
Italian bonds remained under pressure amid disappointment over the half-a-trillion-euro plan to support coronavirus-hit economies agreed by euro zone finance ministers last week.
Italy's two-year bond yield was last up 11 basis points at 0.95% after rising nearly 20 bps on Tuesday. Ten-year yields were up 4 basis points at 1.83%.
The gap with Germany's 10-year bond yield, effectively the risk premium Italy pays investors, continued to rise, to 225 bps, retracing much of the tightening since the European Central Bank announced emergency bond purchases in mid-March.
In currencies, the dollar rebounded as concern persisted that the damage to the global economy. The U.S. currency gained across the board, particularly against currencies considered riskier bets, such as sterling, where it was around 1% higher.

Gold prices fell as investors locked in profits after recent gains. It was last at $1,721 an ounce.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co (T:7267) said it has remodeled 50 of its minivans to transport COVID-19 patients to hospitals and quarantine facilities in Japan, sealing off the rear section of the vehicles to keep drivers safe from infection.
The Japanese automaker has placed an airtight divide between the driver and the rear passenger areas of the vans and tweaked their air conditioning systems to enable fresh air to enter through the front near the base of the windshield wipers, pass through to the rear passenger area through vents and exit through the back. 
The company said that the one-way ventilation system installed in its Odyssey and Step WGN minivan models ensures that air from the rear section does not enter the driver’s space, reducing the risk of infection. 
The company began lending these cars to health authorities in Tokyo, and as of Tuesday, two vehicles had been delivered, a company spokesman said. Eventually, it plans to also supply the vehicles to nearby Saitama prefecture, he added.
Honda will consider making more available depending on demand, adding that they were not ambulances. 
Japan had 8,885 cases of infections of the coronavirus as of Wednesday morning, excluding those from a cruise ship quarantined in February, with 174 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. 
Toyota Motor Corp <7301.T> has also said it is considering ways to equip its JPN Taxi models used by taxi operators in the country to transport infected patients. 
Both companies have also set up production lines at their plants at home and abroad to manufacture face shields, masks and other medical equipment, much like other carmakers around the world. 

Last week, Japan's powerful automaking lobby said it will try to avoid suspending operations during the coronavirus pandemic, and that the industry was considering financial support for struggling firms.

Hirt called on executives to ensure the safety and wellbeing of their workforces, to treat suppliers fairly and support the efforts of governments in dealing with COVID-19.
He also said companies needed to be better prepared for rapid crisis responses in the future. 
""Business and governments will need to learn from and comprehensively act on the lessons from this crisis, not only for future pandemics, but for other known risks, such as the climate crisis – an emergency that requires far greater planning, resolve and commitment than we have seen so far in addressing the Coronavirus pandemic in most countries.""

903,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Lower as Bank Earnings Show Spike in Loan Provisions,"By Peter Nurse    
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to head lower Wednesday, paring recent gains, with weak earnings data from the pivotal banking sector illustrating the impact on the economy from the Covid-19 shutdown.
At 7:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 48 points, or 0.7%, lower, futures for the Nasdaq down 87 points, or 1%. The Dow futures contract fell 343 points, or 1.4%. 
The Dow and S&P cash indices recorded Tuesday their highest closes since March 10, and the Nasdaq since March 6. Stocks are having their best month since October 2011.
Recent gains have been driven by optimism that Western governments are getting a handle on the deadly pandemic, with discussions starting to emerge over when to restart these economies. 
But overshadowing this was a warning from the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday that this year would see the weakest global growth since the Great Depression.
First-quarter numbers from the country’s banking giants have shown the trend, starting with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Tuesday.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) reported a drop of 45% in first-quarter profit and added $3.6 billion to loan loss reserves in the quarter. PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) and US Bancorp, two more big Main Street lenders, also missed expectations after similar rises in provisions.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) also missed forecasts with EPS of $3.11 compared to expectations of $3.75. Provisions against credit losses rose to $937 million.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) is still due to weigh in, with analysts looking for earnings of $1.59 per share and revenue of about $19 billion. 
 March retail sales, at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT),should also confirm a grim picture. The headline figure is expected to have dropped 8%, which would be the largest drop recorded, while core retail sales, which exclude auto sales, are seen posting a drop of 4.8%, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
 Industrial production and manufacturing output will follow at 9:15 AM. 
Additionally, the U.S. airline sector will be in the spotlight after the Federal government agreed a $25 billion rescue package for 10 of the country's biggest airlines. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), Delta (NYSE:DAL) and Southwest (NYSE:LUV) are among the recipients.
Oil prices were slammed after the International Energy Agency said it expected a record fall in global oil demand of 9.3 million barrels per day in 2020. This would wipe out almost a decade of growth.
U.S. stockpiles of crude are expected to have risen by 11.7 million barrels last week alone, after having risen 30.6 million barrels over the past three weeks.
At 7:30 AM ET, Crude Oil WTI futures traded 2.3% lower at $19.64 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 4.2% to $28.36.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.9% to $1,752.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded at $1.0913, down 0.6%."

“Fiscal deficits in Europe are said to increase by about 6% of GDP in 2020. This is large, but it’s entirely appropriate in the current crisis,” European Department Director Poul Thomsen said in a press conference Wednesday. “All countries have the space needed to react forcefully and appropriately to the pandemic.”
The IMF on Tuesday warned of the worst global recession in almost a century, and predicted the euro area will be particularly hard-hit. Output in the bloc is seen shrinking 7.5% this year, compared to a global contraction of 3%. While the fund expects a recovery in 2021, it cautioned that much depends on the longevity of the crisis and how it affects business activity.
European Central Bank officials speaking earlier on Wednesday expressed hope that negative effects as a result of wide-ranging lockdowns will be short-lived.
France’s Francois Villeroy de Galhau said “if we manage the exit from the crisis well, it will be a very severe but temporary shock.” ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos gave similar views in a Spanish radio interview.

Acting Chief Executive Suzanne Heywood will halve her salary for three months while members of the Global Executive Committee will take a 20% pay cut for the same period, a statement said.
Board members will not be remunerated for the rest of the year, it added.
CNH Industrial this month said it was cancelling its planned dividend of 0.18 euros ($0.20) per share on last year's results, amounting to a total payout of 234 million euros.

The company also said that its available liquidity at the end of last year amounted to $11.2 billion, the highest level in its history.

911,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 05:29AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Oil & Gas Stocks Take Another Dive After IEA Report,"Oil and gas stocks tumbled in Europe again on Wednesday after the International Energy Agency warned that the recent global deal to cut supply won’t be enough to rebalance the market any time soon.
By 5:25 AM ET (0925 GMT), the Euro Stoxx Oil & Gas index was down 4.6%, after the IEA warned that there soon won’t be anywhere to store the world’s surplus oil, something that will force producers to stop producing. The Stoxx 600 was down only 1.7%, while the FTSE 100 was down 2.2% and the CAC 40 down 1.9%.
“The implied stock build-up of 12 mb/d in the first half of the year still threatens to overwhelm the logistics of the oil industry – ships, pipelines and storage tanks – in the coming weeks,” the IEA said.
Forced shut-ins can be particularly serious for oil companies because they can damage oil reservoirs, permanently reducing the amount of oil recoverable. The IEA expects non-OPEC+ supply (mainly the U.S. and Canada) to fall by some 3.5 million barrels a day in the coming months, something that may well include forced shut-ins.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) shares lost 4.4%, while  BP  (LON:BP) shares fell 6.3% and  Total  (PA:TOTF) shares fell 5.3%. The worst hit were, as usual, the companies already in a precarious financial position: independent U.K. upstream company  Tullow Oil  (LON:TLW) shares fell 20.8% while Norwegian services company  Seadrill  (OL:SDRL) stock fell 13%. Austria's OMV  (VIE:OMVV) - which is mainly a refiner - fell 9.8%.
The sector had recovered strongly in the last couple of weeks as momentum built towards a global deal on cutting global supply and ending a damaging price war over market share, triggered in March by Russia and Saudi Arabia.
The deal, concluded at the weekend, envisages a cut of nearly 10 million barrels a day of output and concerted purchases by countries including the U.S., India and China for their strategic reserves.  However, both crude itself and energy stocks sold off when markets reopened on Tuesday after the Easter weekend.
The IEA’s message was far from being all doom and gloom. Its analysis suggested that demand will start to pick up as early as next month as lockdown restrictions in some countries start to ease. While April demand will be some 29 million barrels a day below year-earlier levels, that will ease to 26 million b/d in May and 15 million b/d in June, it said.
“There is no feasible agreement that could cut supply by enough to offset such near-term demand losses,"" it argued. ""However, the past week’s achievements are a solid start and have the potential to start to reverse the build-up in stocks as we move into the second half of the year.""
Indeed, if - possibly a big 'if', given the stress that the pandemic is putting on international cooperation - producers cut as expected, strategic reserves are topped up and demand starts to recover, then the world market may swing back to a deficit in the second half of the year and draw down some of an enormous overhang of commercial stocks that will have built up between January and June.
The IEA said the daily draw on stocks could be 4.7 million b/d in the second half, albeit that still doesn't unwind an average build of 12 million b/d in the first half.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) has lost a bid to block an auditor appointed by Switzerland's financial supervisor as part of its probe into the bank's spying scandal, court documents show, with judges ruling the Swiss bank's objections were unfounded.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank had sought to scuttle watchdog FINMA's appointment of Thomas Werlen, of international law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, on grounds the firm and Werlen lacked sufficient independence, the decision showed, but a Swiss federal court found the move fulfilled necessary requirements. 
""The complainant fears an inappropriate use of business secrets,"" court documents outlining Credit Suisse's appeal show.
In its probe, FINMA is examining whether management control failures led to Switzerland's second-largest bank snooping on two former executives in an affair which toppled former CEO Tidjane Thiam and sent shock waves through Swiss finance.
Credit Suisse, also under scrutiny from shareholder groups after the spying scandal, in an emailed statement on Wednesday said it took note of the decision and would analyse it.
The bank had contended that the law firm had been involved in several proceedings or foreign claims against the bank in the past, and its website featured ""antagonistic statements.""
The Swiss Federal Administrative Court panel ruled against Credit Suisse, however, deciding the appointment by FINMA ""fulfills all the necessary requirements and is suitable for carrying out the specific test mandate for the complainants"".
""There is no objective evidence to support the suspicion that the auditor could use the information it collected in an illegal fashion or pass it on to unauthorized persons,"" the judges wrote in their 17-page ruling. ""There are no concrete indications that the auditor would misuse information, which would be a violation of his duties and be subject to penalty.""

Werlen and FINMA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Valuations of Chinese unicorns have fallen below levels reached in the firms' most-recent fundraising rounds, secondary market offerings by existing investors show, highlighting the strain on backers amid the coronavirus outbreak and volatile markets.
Potential acquirers of privately held shares have been more actively approached about buying into the billion-dollar startups since China started reporting high numbers of virus cases in February, said two investors offered such shares.
Face recognition technology developer SenseTime, backed by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, and DJI, the world's largest commercial drone maker, have seen valuations fall 10% since funding rounds in June 2019 and April 2018 to $6.84 billion and $14.5 billion based on secondary market offerings, the people said.
Stakes in online education provider VIPKID, backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd, and bike-share firm HelloBike, backed by Ant Financial [ANTFIN.UL], have also been offered at reduced valuations. VIPKID's $3.95 billion represents a 15% discount while HelloBike's $3.2 billion is 20% lower, said the people.
HelloBike, DJI and SenseTime declined to comment on the secondary market valuations. VIPKID did not respond to a request for comment.
The change in direction for China's once-buoyant private market comes as investors fear that takeovers and initial public offerings (IPO) - common ways of realising profit from early investment - will be harder to achieve, or at best take longer partially due to the coronavirus-induced economic downturn.
The coronavirus outbreak has greatly interrupted economic activity, prompting financial and corporate investors to exit investments early to ease liquidity pressure.
""Two years ago, we were joking 'cash is trash', but now cash is definitely king,"" said Robert Qiu, chief executive of Unicorn Selected, a Chinese platform focusing on private equity's secondary trading market.
""Some investors see no immediate way to exit through stock markets, but they need cash at hand so they're turning to sell shares in secondary markets.""
Secondary trades are usually conducted through platforms such as Unicorn Selected, or marketed by well-connected bankers and corporate lawyers.
Venture capital investors exited 25 Chinese deals valued at $13.36 billion in the first quarter of 2020, versus just nine worth $5.34 billion in the same period last year, showed data from PitchBook.
Venture funding in Chinese firms also dropped 33% to $8.39 billion over the same period.
IPO BLOW
While not all valuations are falling, investors are frank about difficulties they face, particularly in industries such as catering, retail and tourism that have been hardest hit by restrictions on movement aimed at stopping the virus spreading. 
""Our portfolio firms face significant challenges. Many are seeing revenues drop, which will have a massive impact on their cash flow,"" said David Tang, a partner of venture capitalist NGP Capital.
Investor confidence in Chinese unicorns has also been weakened by Nasdaq-listed Luckin Coffee Inc, a self-declared challenger to Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) in China, which earlier this month said some of its 2019 sales were fabricated. 
Luckin's shares, which floated in May, fell more than 80% on the news. Trading of the shares has been halted since April 7.
""The Luckin scandal will likely put a temporary freeze on U.S. IPOs by Chinese companies. Global investors will become far more cautious about investing in such companies,"" said one senior China-focused investment banker at a Wall Street bank.
Shareholders in Chinese unicorns are also worried that soggy performance of many Chinese listings in the United States could also dent their portfolio firms' IPO prospects.
While the Nasdaq Composite has gained 15.2% over the past two years, the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which tracks Chinese firms listed on the exchange, has dropped by the same amount.
""Some existing investors now would rather exit earlier than wait any longer for portfolio firms to go public,"" said Zhou Liang, head of UniSharesClub, a private shares trading platform of investment bank China Renaissance. ""A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.""

917,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 03:20AM ET</span>",Proxy advisers split over endorsing Bayer management at AGM,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Shareholder advisory groups are divided over whether to endorse the management and directors at German drugs and pesticides company Bayer (DE:BAYGn), according to recommendations submitted by proxy voting firms.
Bayer is due to host its annual general meeting on April 28 but the company still faces potentially huge litigation risks stemming from its $63 billion purchase of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in 2018. 
One leading shareholder advisory firm, ISS, on Tuesday backed a motion to support the actions of the management and supervisory board. 
""Qualified support for both discharge proposals is warranted as there does not appear to be any evidence that the boards have not fulfilled their fiduciary duties for the 2019 fiscal year,"" it said. 
However another large advisory group, Glass Lewis, said on April 6 that investors should abstain because of ongoing proceedings regarding pesticide Roundup, acquired via the takeover of Monsanto.
Shares in Bayer have shed more than a quarter of their value since mid-2018 when the company lost a U.S. lawsuit claiming that glyphosate-based Roundup causes cancer. 
Bayer denies that glyphosate or Roundup cause cancer and is appealing. The company has received tentative backing from some legal and regulatory experts. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also reaffirmed this year that glyphosate was safe.
In December, the U.S. Justice Department said in a so-called amicus brief that a federal appeals court should reverse the lower court verdict finding Bayer liable in a Californian Roundup case. 
Major regulators, including those overseeing European and U.S pesticide markets, have deemed it safe but the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded in 2015 that glyphosate probably causes cancer.
Glass Lewis said the ongoing proceedings could have a bearing on how the boards' performance is viewed, so recommended that shareholders abstain from voting on a ratification proposal.
""We continue to believe that shareholders are not currently in a position to meaningfully assess whether the ratification of the acts of management board members for the past fiscal year is currently in their best interests,"" it said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced in February that the line, known as HS2 which connects London to northern England, would go ahead.
The government on Wednesday issued formal notification to the companies tasked with construction, allowing them to start work and providing them and their suppliers with business at a time when the pandemic has caused the economy to grind to a halt.
""This next step provides thousands of construction workers and businesses across the country with certainty at a time when they need it, and means that work can truly begin,"" HS2 minister Andrew Stephenson said. 
Companies with HS2 contracts include Skanska Construction UK (ST:SKAb) , Costain (L:COSG), Sir Robert McAlpine, Eiffage Genie Civil, Kier (L:KIE),  Balfour Beatty  (L:BALF) and VINCI (PA:SGEF).
Companies will need to follow Public Health England's guidance on social distancing at construction sites during the coronavirus outbreak, the Department for Transport said in its statement. 
Some preparatory work for HS2 has already started, such as clearing land and demolishing buildings, but to date, no tracks have been laid. 
In approving HS2, Johnson, defied critics who said it was overbudget and not necessary, showing his willingness to invest in infrastructure. 

He said HS2 would slash journey times and add capacity to Britain's crowded rail network, and help with his plan to ""level up"" the country by investing in transport links outside London.

920,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 02:10AM ET</span>",Activist hedge fund Starboard pounces on U.S. companies in turmoil,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Most activist shareholders have refrained from challenging the boards of U.S. companies during this season of annual shareholder meetings, as businesses reel from the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak.
Not Starboard Value LP.
The New York-based hedge fund, which Jeffrey Smith spun out of investment firm Ramius in 2011, is pursuing proxy contests against five U.S. companies, even as rivals remain largely silent, according to a review of regulatory filings.
Starboard, which built its reputation as a powerful player by winning more board seats than any other activist, is betting companies will be willing to settle during the crisis, so they can concentrate on their business and the safety of their employees.
Last week Starboard nominated six candidates at data management software provider Commvault Systems (O:CVLT), adding another fight to a lineup that already includes e-commerce company eBay (O:EBAY), construction and building materials supplier GCP Applied Technologies (N:GCP), healthcare services company Mednax (N:MD) and medical devices manufacturer Merit Medical (O:MMSI). Starboard is looking for roughly two dozen board seats in total, according to the filings. 
All these companies saw their shares slide at the onset of the pandemic, and are bracing for a hit in their business as a result of the economic downturn.
""What Starboard is doing stands in stark contrast with other activist investors who are holding back and have reached settlements,"" said Jill Fisch, a University of Pennsylvania Law School professor and corporate governance expert. 
""We have never seen a shareholder nominate directors at so many companies at the same time. Starboard is blazing a path for more aggression.""
Starboard, eBay, Commvault, GCP, Merit and Mednax declined to comment.
Last year Starboard won 20 board seats at seven companies, and since 2013 it has won 118 seats, according to data from Activist Insight. It secured the vast majority of them through settlements with companies keen to resolve the board challenges prior to a shareholder vote. It is a track record the roughly $5 billion hedge fund boasts about when it courts investors, according to some of them who discussed the pitch on condition of anonymity. 
The firm made history in 2014 when shareholders voted to throw out all 12 directors at Darden Restaurants Inc (N:DRI) and install Starboard's slate, a rare feat for a hedge fund at a major U.S. company.
""Their thesis is they don't mind people being afraid of them,"" said Mark Gerstein, a partner at law firm Latham & Watkins LLP who advises companies on their defense against activist hedge funds such as Starboard.
WINNERS AND LOSERS
The performance of Starboard's targets is mixed. Total shareholder return (TSR) at Darden surged 227% between Starboard joining the Olive Garden restaurant owner's board in 2014 and February 2020, when the coronavirus crisis started weighing on the U.S. stock market. Semiconductor maker Marvell Technology Group's TSR jumped 166% in the period between Starboard joining the board in 2016 and the end of February 2020.
But there were losers, too. In two situations where Starboard appointees comprised at least half of a company's board, online data tracking service Comscore (O:SCOR) and drug maker Depomed, which renamed itself Assertio Therapeutics in 2018, TSR tumbled 87% and 94%, respectively, in the period between Starboard directors joining the boards and the end of February.
Starboard declined to disclose or comment on the returns of the hedge fund.
It is not yet clear how the crisis will affect the corporate world's defenses against Starboard. Board members are aware of how high the stakes are this year and are tallying the potential cost of losing experienced directors, bankers, lawyers and investors said. 
GCP has called the nomination a ""self-serving proxy fight that is out of touch with the realities of the current operating environment and global crisis.""
""Activist shareholders who overreach for the sake of a win and who aggressively and reflexively push to remove key board members and leaders... will be remembered as failing to meet the moment,"" said Sabastian Niles, a partner at law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz LLP who defends companies against Starboard and other hedge funds.

Price swings are getting muted as central banks and governments around the world provide unprecedented packages of stimulus to cushion the economic hit from Covid-19. That’s improving conditions in funding markets, market liquidity and deleveraging by value-at-risk sensitive investors -- three key areas for volatility -- according to strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou.
“Following the deterioration in market functioning and liquidity in March, with liquidity conditions in some markets worse than during the financial crisis, there are some tentative signs of improvement in liquidity across asset classes,” Panigirtzoglou wrote. The normalization of volatility is reversing “previous negative feedback loops.”
The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, closed below 40 on Tuesday after having surged as high as 85 during the most chaotic period last month. The ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA MOVE Index, which measures swings in Treasury options, was just below 70 on Tuesday after having soared above 160 on March 9.
Read more on risk-parity funds edging back into markets
The drop since the end of March has reversed around half of risk-parity funds’ previous selling of around $90 billion in bonds, about $30 billion in equities and $30 billion in commodities, JPMorgan said.
U.S. high-grade domestic corporate bond issuance rose in March to over $190 billion, more than twice its previous high over the past two decades, and the re-opening of the primary market for high-yield corporate bonds is boosting expectations that the default cycle might be much less severe than in the prior recession. Market depth and liquidity are recovering as well, though at different paces in different asset classes, according to the report.
The drop in VIX to below its 50-day moving average has “usually led to shorter-term chop, but was typically a sign that the worst was over long-term,” Sundial Capital Research Inc. President Jason Goepfert wrote in a note Tuesday."

925,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 10:40PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Stay off Zoom and Google Hangouts, Standard Chartered chief tells staff","By Anshuman Daga and Imani Moise
SINGAPORE/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Standard Chartered  Plc (L:STAN) is the first major global bank to tell employees not to use  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (O:ZM) during the coronavirus pandemic due to cybersecurity concerns, according to a memo seen by Reuters.
The message, sent by Chief Executive Officer Bill Winters to managers last week, also warned against using Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google Hangouts platform for virtual gatherings.
Neither service offers the level of encryption of conversations that rivals like Cisco System Inc's (O:CSCO) Webex,  Microsoft Corp 's (O:MSFT) Teams or Blue Jeans Network Inc do, industry experts said. 
A Standard Chartered spokeswoman declined to comment on a Reuters query on the memo. She said cybersecurity remains a top priority and that staff can use several authorized tools for audio and video conferencing.
The London-based bank is the latest entity to distance itself from Zoom after interlopers exposed security flaws by bursting into strangers' video chats in the nude, inserting lewd images into presentations, or hurling racial slurs at participants.
These ""Zoombombing"" incidents have rattled all kinds of users, as hoards of business people, students, families and friends flocked to the service to stay connected while isolating during the pandemic. Zoom in March had about 200 million people using its system every day, up from 10 million at the end of last year.
Banks have particular worries about cybersecurity because of regulations that can penalize them for exposing customer information, even if inadvertently.
Standard Chartered staff are mostly using Blue Jeans, said two employees who were not authorized to speak on the matter.
The bank joins others ranging from Elon Musk's SpaceX to New York City's public school system and governments in Taiwan and Germany in placing restrictions on Zoom.
In a statement, Zoom said many global customers including financial firms, telecommunications companies, universities, and government agencies had performed ""exhaustive security reviews"" of its technology and chosen it as a service.
Founded and headed by former Cisco manager Eric Yuan, Zoom last week tapped former  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) security chief Alex Stamos as an adviser on safety and privacy concerns to quell the global backlash against its perceived flaws.
TRICKY CHOICE
Choosing a communications provider is tricky for banks, which have to balance security concerns, data-access needs and the preferences of clients and employees, who may wander off to another service outside official channels if rules are too stringent.
Industry workers described a mixed experience with video chats in the age of the coronavirus.
Two JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) employees said they regularly hold meetings on Zoom. It is one of a few videoconferencing tools the bank allows, including Blue Jeans.
Some  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) employees have been holding virtual ""pub outings"" on Zoom, where they connect after work with a cocktail or beer in hand to chat, a source said. The bank's chief technology officer told staff in an April 3 video that they could use Zoom and Blue Jeans. 
 Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) employees are also allowed to use Zoom, among other options, a source there said.  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC) only uses Zoom if a client requests it, according to a source. People at  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) said Zoom is not a familiar option at their banks, which rely on other services.
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a self-regulatory group for U.S. brokers, is also still using Zoom after security experts worked through some issues with the company, Thomas Gira, who heads market regulation, said in an interview.

926,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 09:46PM ET</span>",Major U.S. airlines accept government aid for payrolls; American and Alaska also seeking loans,"By Tracy Rucinski and David Shepardson
(Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said on Tuesday that major passenger airlines have agreed in principle to a $25 billion rescue package, ensuring airline workers have jobs until October while the industry battles its biggest-ever crisis.
Airlines are hopeful that U.S. passenger traffic, which has dropped by 95% due to the coronavirus pandemic, will begin to recover by October but have warned that the slowdown in air travel could extend into next year and even longer. It's possible they will need another round of government bailouts to survive.
Major carriers will receive 70% of the funds for payroll in cash assistance that will not need to be paid back, while smaller carriers receiving $100 million or less will not need to repay any funds. 
The six largest U.S. airlines - American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc, United Airlines Holdings Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, JetBlue Airways Corp and Alaska Airlines - as well as four other airlines accepted the support, Treasury said.
Agreements should be finalized soon and funds disbursed quickly, it said.
Carriers were told they could apply for the total salaries and benefits paid in the second and third quarters of 2019, an amount that surpasses American Airlines' current market value.
Under the terms laid out by Treasury officials last week, the government would receive repayment on 30% of the funds awarded to large carriers and warrants equal to 10% of the loan amount that were priced at last week's close.
Delta said it will receive $5.4 billion in grants, of which $1.6 billion will be an unsecured 10-year low-interest loan that has to be repaid, and will provide the government with warrants to acquire about 1% of Delta stock at $24.39 per share over five years.
American Airlines said it would receive $5.8 billion in grants, of which it would need to repay $1.7 billion. 
Southwest said it had agreed in principle and expects to receive $3.2 billion in grants and will have to repay nearly $1 billion over 10 years. Southwest will issue 2.6 million warrants to the Treasury.
JetBlue said it will receive $935.8 million in payroll grants. Alaska and its regional carrier Horizon Air will receive $992 million in funding, including $267 million in the form of a loan, that the airline expects will cover about 70% of budgeted costs through Sept. 30.
Alaska said the Treasury will receive the right to buy 847,000 non-voting shares of parent Alaska Air Group at a price of $31.61 per share.
United was eligible for about $6 billion but did not disclose on Tuesday how much it would receive.
Spirit Airlines Inc, a low-cost carrier which was not listed by the Treasury as reaching agreement, said it expects ""to agree on terms soon"" for payroll grants.
PAYCHECK, BENEFITS
""We are closer than ever to almost a million airline workers knowing they will receive their paycheck and keep their healthcare and other benefits, at least through September,"" said Association of Flight Attendants President Sara Nelson, who is widely credited for the idea of aid specifically for payroll.
""At the same time, we were able to rein in the worst corporate practices by tying this aid to restrictions on stock buybacks, executive compensation and dividends.""
According to the statute, companies receiving funds cannot lay off employees before Sept. 30 or change collective bargaining agreements and must agree to restrictions on buybacks, executive compensation and dividends. 
The statute gave the Treasury the authority to demand compensation for the grants, but did not require it.
A Treasury official working on the program, Brent McIntosh, told Reuters on Monday that the government had done a ""substantial analysis ... we believe approximately 70% of those payments becomes a direct benefit to taxpayers."" He cited ""avoided unemployment benefits, taxes that come back to the federal government, and the benefits of continued air service.""
Senator Ed Markey, a Democrat, criticized the Treasury's decision to ""require repayment for some of the payroll grants. The Trump administration is unnecessarily endangering jobs.""
In addition to the grant program, U.S. passenger airlines can also apply for a separate $25 billion loan scheme under the government's $2.3 trillion stimulus package. American said it plans this week to apply for a $4.75 billion loan under that program, while Alaska and Horizon intend to apply for $1.1 billion in federal loans.
Estimated global airline losses from the coronavirus pandemic have climbed to $314 billion, 25% more than previously forecast, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Tuesday.

Alexandre de Juniac, the Geneva-based organization's CEO, said leaving the middle seat vacant was among likely conditions for a resumption of air travel to be discussed with governments.

927,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 09:46PM ET</span>",McDonald's and its U.S. franchisees at odds over financial relief as crisis weighed,"By Hilary Russ
NEW YORK (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) rejected a request from its U.S. franchisees to delay collecting some March rent and royalty payments, prompting claims that the world's largest fast-food company is not providing enough support during the coronavirus crisis, according to several letters seen by Reuters.
Franchisees that lead negotiations with the company asked McDonald's for a blanket 14-day reprieve in their March rent during weeks of negotiations over financial help. But on April 3, that request was denied, according to a letter from the franchisee leadership. The correspondence provides a snapshot of growing internal tensions between McDonald's executives and franchisee organizations amid an unprecedented global health crisis.
""Because so many owners are alarmed over their financial viability and have been waiting for clarity on a positive, tangible company decision, many believe the trust in the relationship has plummeted,"" the National Owners Association of franchisees wrote to McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski and McDonald's USA head Joe Erlinger, on April 7.
Franchisees' faith in management ""seems predicated on unlimited financial support,"" Erlinger wrote back two days later. ""If that's how the NOA seeks to define its relationship with McDonald's, then in reality, we don't have a relationship, and I am extremely disappointed and disheartened by this.""
The National Owners Association represents at least 75% of McDonald's more than 1,600 franchisees, which own and operate 95% of the fast-food chain's nearly 14,000 U.S. restaurants. While a few franchisees own scores of stores, many have only a few. 
A separate group of franchisees works officially with the company to negotiate over these and other issues, while the NOA is an independent advocacy organization.
McDonald's is the landlord for most of its franchisees, who pay a flat base rent on the first day of each month and another rent and service fee payment on the 10th, based on the previous month's sales.
Franchisees are ""deeply passionate about the McDonald's brand, and this is their livelihood, and we understand that this is certainly a stressful time,"" David Tovar, McDonald's vice president of U.S. communications, told Reuters. ""The company has provided unprecedented levels of financial support to U.S. operators to inject liquidity into the system during this crisis.""
Some franchisees now fear they could go out of businesses because most locations have had to switch operations to drive-through, delivery and carry-out only as states have imposed strict measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
McDonald's reported last week that its sales plunged 13.4% in the United States in March.
U.S. fast-food sales are down 30-40% in recent weeks, with sales at full-service chains dropping as much as 80%, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) estimates on Monday.
To be sure, franchisees affiliated with big brands get more support than independent restaurants, and most franchisors have offered some relief.
Subway restaurants, which has about 19,700 U.S. locations, cut royalty payments in half, suspended advertising funds for four weeks and is canceling or reducing some rent payments.
Darden Restaurants Inc (N:DRI), which owns the Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and a half dozen other full-service restaurant brands, is among publicly traded companies hurt by the pandemic that have suspended dividends to shareholders.
While McDonald's suspended share buybacks, it has been criticized for paying its annual dividend as it reduces employee hours during the crisis.
In his letter, Erlinger suggested franchisees could offer a 10% ""hero pay"" bonus for workers over 60 days and scan employees' temperatures when they start their shifts - proposals the franchisee source said amounted to ""grandstanding"" considering how few stores the company operates itself.
TIMELINE OF TENSION In mid-March, the group of franchisees who officially negotiate with the company in the United States proposed a 10-point economic relief plan, asking McDonald's executives to cancel rent payments for April and May - not just defer them, according to a copy of their proposal seen by Reuters.
For about two-thirds of franchisees - those whose sales fell by more than 25% during the last two weeks of March - their March rent and service fees were not collected on April 10, for a total of about $180 million in payments deferred for four months, the company said.
Tovar said in ""several"" cases, individual owners were on the cusp of the 25% sales loss for the end of March, but McDonald's agreed to defer those payments anyway to help the franchisee.
March, April and May base rent payments have been deferred for four months for all operators. 
The company also reduced national advertising fees by 0.5%. It is halting store renovations and some new openings, which will save $1 billion in 2020 capital expenditures, it said in regulatory filings. The cuts will save franchisees some money.

""We reserve the right to make additional changes down the road,"" Tovar said.

928,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 09:45PM ET</span>",Exclusive: J.C. Penney explores bankruptcy as hopes for recovery fade - sources,"By Mike Spector
NEW YORK (Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc is exploring filing for bankruptcy protection after the coronavirus pandemic forced the U.S. retailer to temporarily shut its 850 department stores, upending its turnaround plans, according to people familiar with the matter.
The Plano, Texas-based company has access to enough cash to survive in the months ahead, even as revenue dries up because of the store closures, the sources said. Still, the company is contemplating a bankruptcy filing as one way to rework its unsustainable finances and save money on looming debt payments, which include significant annual interest expenses, the sources added. 
Concerns about prolonged store closures and customers remaining sparse even when outlets eventually reopen have also factored in to J.C. Penney's deliberations, some of the sources said.
J.C. Penney has not made any final decisions on how to address its strained finances, the sources said. The retailer is also considering asking creditors for breathing room through transactions that would rework debt outside of bankruptcy court proceedings, the sources added. There is also a possibility that J.C. Penney will be able to secure rescue financing, one of the sources said. 
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations. 
J.C. Penney ""has been engaged in discussions with its lenders since mid-2019 to evaluate options to strengthen its balance sheet and maximize its financial flexibility, a process that has become even more important as our stores have also closed due to the pandemic,"" a company spokeswoman said in a statement.
The pandemic ""has created unprecedented challenges,"" she said, adding the company remains focused on its turnaround plan and looks forward to reopening stores. 
J.C. Penney attempted unsuccessfully to persuade creditors earlier this year to restructure and push out due dates on portions of its nearly $4 billion of long-term debt without the need for bankruptcy proceedings. It hoped to buy time for Chief Executive Jill Soltau's turnaround plan to bear fruit, as it faced fierce competition from e-commerce firms as well as discount retailers such as the TJX (NYSE:TJX) Cos Inc's Marshalls and T.J. Maxx chains.
J.C. Penney had recently made some strides in its turnaround attempt, meeting or exceeding guidance on financial objectives for 2019 and improving sales at some stores. The company has been reducing inventory and refocusing on its core higher-margin business of selling mid-priced apparel to middle-class families. 
The novel coronavirus outbreak threw a wrench in its plans. The 118-year old company, which has had to furlough some of its roughly 85,000 employees and slash spending, is now considering skipping looming debt payments and filing for bankruptcy to address its debt, the sources said. Its online business is still running, though it does not contribute to the lion's share of the company's sales.
The coronavirus outbreak has hammered traditional brick-and-mortar department store operators and other retailers that had to close their doors to customers to curb its spread. They were already struggling as consumers shifted to online shopping, before the coronavirus infected more than half a million Americans, resulting in more than 23,000 deaths. 
Macy's Inc (NYSE:M), the largest U.S. department store operator by sales, has tapped advisers at investment bank Lazard Ltd and law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP to explore options including new financing, Reuters reported this week. Last week, peer Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) said it borrowed $600 million against its real estate. Neiman Marcus Group, another department store operator, is advancing bankruptcy preparations, Reuters reported earlier this month.
DEBT PAYMENTS DUE
J.C. Penney needs to make a debt payment of roughly $12 million on Wednesday, followed by a $105 million bond repayment due in June. The retailer must also contend with about $300 million in annual interest expenses, and faces more than $2 billion of debt maturing in 2023, according to regulatory filings.
J.C. Penney in March drew down $1.25 billion from its revolving credit line. On March 31, it said it was also ""evaluating other financial options,"" without providing further details. 
But in another sign of J.C. Penney's financial woes, the company has added corporate turnaround experts at AlixPartners LLP who specialize in urgently addressing stressed finances to its roster of advisers, one of the sources said. Bloomberg News reported on that appointment on Monday. 
J.C. Penney's revenue could plunge more than 25% this year, according to Fitch Ratings Inc. The credit ratings firm predicts that could cause J.C. Penney's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to turn ""materially negative"" to the tune of $400 million in 2020. 

J.C. Penney bonds due in 2023 were trading at roughly 43 cents on the dollar on Tuesday, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, indicating investor concerns about the company's ability to repay its debts.

Sentiment plummeted 17.7% to 75.6 in April and Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said in an accompanying statement that the details were “very disturbing and reflect the large shocks to jobs and spending.” He also noted the “surprising message” of a collapse in confidence in the housing market.
“While the drop in confidence this month is severe, it could well have been worse,” he said. “Despite the bleak and threatening backdrop, Australia’s pandemic experience to date has been much less debilitating than that of the hardest hit areas abroad.”

930,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 08:10PM ET</span>",Boeing 737 MAX cancellations pile up during production halt,"By David Shepardson and Rachit Vats
(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) on Tuesday reported another 75 cancellations for its 737 MAX jetliner in March, as the coronavirus crisis worsened disruptions from the grounding of its best-selling jet.
The U.S. planemaker posted a total of 150 MAX cancellations in March, including 75 previously reported from Irish leasing company Avolon. New cancellations came from buyers including 34 of 135 aircraft ordered by Brazil's GOL (SA:GOLL4). 
GOL confirmed the 34 cancelled planes and said it reached agreement with Boeing on ""cash compensation and changes to future orders and associated payment schedules.""
""GOL remains fully committed to the 737 MAX as the core of its fleet and this agreement further enhances our successful long-term partnership with Boeing,"" said GOL chief executive Paulo Kakinoff in a statement. GOL now has 95 remaining firm orders for 737 MAX aircraft.
The cancellations come as Boeing seeks to untangle delivery commitments after halting output of the MAX in January, following delays in returning it to service.
Boeing shares closed down 4.3% to $141.00, off $6.33.
Boeing, facing a 13-month-old freeze on deliveries of the MAX and now disruption to deliveries of larger planes due to the coronavirus epidemic, said it had delivered 50 planes in the first quarter, barely a third of the 149 seen a year earlier.
That was the lowest since 1984 for the first quarter.
The company posted orders in March for 12 787 Dreamliners, one 767 freighter and 18 pre-MAX versions of the 737 for the P-8 maritime patrol program. For the first quarter, it posted 49 new orders, or a negative total of 147 after cancellations. 
After further accounting adjustments representing jets ordered in previous years but now unlikely to be delivered, Boeing's adjusted net orders sank to a negative 307 airplanes.
The pandemic has forced Boeing and European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) to cut production in the face of plunging demand, cash problems at airlines and logistical difficulties in delivering aircraft.
Boeing remains in talks with regulators seeking approval to return the plane to service. Last week, Boeing said it was addressing two new software issues with the MAX flight control computer.

Major U.S. airlines, suffering an unprecedented downturn in demand due to the coronavirus, on Wednesday said they agreed in principle on the terms of $25 billion U.S. government payroll aid.

931,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 06:36PM ET</span>","Airlines, Treasury Reach Tentative Deal for Billions in U.S. Aid","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. airlines reached preliminary agreements with the Treasury Department to access billions of dollars in aid as the government attempts to shore up one of the industries hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
The deal covers all major carriers, the Treasury said in a statement. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc., for example, said it would get $5.8 billion in total support while Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co. said it would receive $3.2 billion. The government is doling out $25 billion in payroll assistance allocated for passenger carriers in the $2.2 trillion stimulus package signed into law March 27.
“We welcome the news that a number of major airlines intend to participate in the Payroll Support Program,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the statement. The program “will support American workers and help preserve the strategic importance of the airline industry while allowing for appropriate compensation to the taxpayers.”
The aid represents a temporary lifeline for airlines after the outbreak and government travel restrictions erased all but 5% of daily passenger demand in the U.S. Forced in some cases to pay more in refunds than they were taking in from new ticket sales and fees, carriers have cut capacity as much as 80% and parked thousands of planes in the industry’s worst-ever disruption.
Shares of American, United, Delta and Southwest all surged on the news in extended trading.
This Week
The Treasury expects to start doling out the funds as soon as this week, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Airlines that agreed to participate also included Alaska Air Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL)., JetBlue Airways Corp, United Airlines Holdings Inc., Allegiant Airlines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines and SkyWest, according to the Treasury.
The sometimes contentious process of hammering out agreements with the airlines was “neither easy nor perfect,” but it was needed to protect about 750,000 airline industry jobs, said Representative Peter DeFazio, the Oregon Democrat who is chairman of the House Transportation Committee.
DeFazio, who has been critical of previous bailout programs, said the use of funds to cover payrolls should be the model for all future assistance programs.
Airlines aren’t depending on federal funds alone, having tapped credit markets for billions of dollars in new loans, as well as existing revolvers. Tens of thousands of employees have volunteered for time off, from unpaid short-term voluntary leaves to early retirement.
Aid Details
The government is requiring large carriers to repay some of the assistance through low-interest loans. The Treasury also has the ability to take stock warrants representing a portion of the aid, a provision initially met with some pushback from airlines, their unions and some members of Congress.
Not all airlines have disclosed the details of their aid packages yet. But in Southwest’s case, the company will receive $2.3 billion in direct payroll support and a nearly $1 billion unsecured loan with a 10-year term. The Dallas-based carrier will issue 2.6 million warrants to the Treasury.
American’s package includes a payroll grant of $4.1 billion and a loan of $1.7 billion. The carrier said it also will seek a separate $4.75 billion loan from the Treasury. The company said it would disclose warrants for the government in a subsequent regulatory filing.
“With this level of assistance, we now believe we have the financial resources necessary to help us withstand this crisis and be in position to serve the traveling public when they are ready to start flying again,” American Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker and President Robert Isom said in a message to employees.
The Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier said it would further reduce its flight schedule for June and beyond. About 32,000 employees have chosen to retire early, take reduced work or take paid leave, and American will re-open opportunities for more to do the same.

Princess Cruises had previously said it would suspend the voyages of all its 18 ships till May 10, but the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week extended its ""no sail order"" for all cruise ships for up to 100 days.
Carnival's Chief Executive Officer, Arnold Donald, said the company is ""working very hard"" at seeking more liquidity options, as the cruise industry gets upended by travel bans and thousands of cancellations driven by the virus crisis.
However, the company can get through till the end of 2020 with its current cash reserves, even with no revenues coming in, Donald said in a CNBC interview, adding that bookings for 2021 are strong.
Princess Cruises' Ruby Princess ocean liner is currently part of a homicide investigation in Australia as the country's deadliest virus infection source.
Two other cruise ships operated by Princess, in California and Japan, have also been in the spotlight as major concentration centers of the virus.

The government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak set up the 1MDB fund in 2009. The DOJ estimated $4.5 billion was siphoned out of Malaysia by high-level fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014 in a scandal that has also embroiled  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS). 
The funds were laundered through financial institutions in several jurisdictions, including the United States, Switzerland, Singapore and Luxembourg. 
The Justice Department last year said it had recovered $1 billion in assets associated with the corruption scandal, its largest-ever civil forfeiture.
Some of those funds have already been returned to Malaysia, though Reuters reported last month that the United States had delayed the return of the latest installment. The funds were originally scheduled to be returned in February but were delayed first due to technical issues and then because of uncertainty over political upheaval in Kuala Lumpur.
The latest repatriation brings the total the United States has returned or assisted Malaysia in recovering to more than $600 million (2.6 billion ringgit), the DOJ said in a statement.
""The payment reflects the United States’ continuing commitment to the Malaysian people to hunt down, seize, forfeit, and return assets that were acquired in connection with this brazen scheme,"" Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the agency's Criminal Division said in the statement.
Assets recovered included high-end real estate in Beverly Hills, New York and London and tens of millions of dollars in business investments made by fugitive financier Low Taek Jho, or Jho Low, allegedly using funds traceable to misappropriated 1MDB money.  
The Department of Justice's efforts to recover funds appropriated from Malaysia's 1MDB are continuing, the agency said.

934,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 05:27PM ET</span>","In hard-hit Florida, jobless workers struggle to get state aid","By Andy Sullivan and Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - With cruise ships idled and airplanes almost empty, Florida travel adviser Nick Pena has been out of work for nearly a month, spending his days trying to secure jobless benefits from a state seemingly unable to provide them.
""I can't tell you the emotional toll, the anxiety of not being able to log in,"" said Pena, 44. ""The only comfort is seeing that I'm not alone.""
Thrown out of work by a coronavirus pandemic that has killed at least 25,000 Americans, workers across the country have encountered downed websites and busy phone lines as they try to secure benefits that will help them pay for groceries and other essentials.
The problem has been especially acute in tourism-dependent Florida, where hundreds of thousands of idled workers have run up against a glitch-ridden system that provides some of the lowest payments in the United States -- when it functions properly.
Pena was able to file a claim more than three weeks ago, but has not been able to get into the system since. Others have been unable to file a claim at all. 
Critics say the failure is intentional.
""The system was broken from the very beginning and designed that way so you had fewer people making claims,"" said Democratic state Representative Geraldine Thompson, who says hundreds of constituents in her Orlando district have told her they have been unable to file claims.
Facing widespread outrage, Republican Governor Ron DeSantis says he has taken steps to bolster the system but has not said when it will be operating properly.
""There have been claims paid and there's a lot in the hopper right now and people are working hard,"" he said at a Monday news conference. His office did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.
Some states, like Minnesota and Utah, say they have kept up with the crush of applications and several say they are distributing additional federal aid of $600 per week.
MIDNIGHT CALLS
Florida has managed to answer only 2% of incoming phone calls, according to state records obtained by local media. Pena says he has set his alarm for the middle of the night to try to access the website, which is otherwise inaccessible.
The 553,000 jobless claims Florida has recorded over the past three weeks likely amount to a fraction of those trying to get in to the system, according to Thompson and other officials.
Neighboring Georgia, where the workforce is half as large, processed 644,000 claims over the same period.
Florida's Department of Economic Opportunity, which processes jobless benefits, said last week it would add hundreds of workers to tackle a backlog of applications. A department spokeswoman did not answer questions submitted by Reuters.
Meanwhile, job losses continue. Disney World will furlough 43,000 employees on Sunday, adding to the list of applicants. 
""Our members live paycheck to paycheck. What happens when unemployment is delayed for many weeks?"" said Eric Clinton, president of Unite Here Local 362, a labor union that represents Disney workers.
Florida created a paper form for people like Sabino Jarquin, 52, who has been unable to apply for benefits through his iPhone since he lost his restaurant job at Miami International Airport over a month ago.
""I'm going to fill out the paper and mail it to see if I have better luck,"" he said.
That has created its own problems. State officials say paper forms will take longer to process, and local media have reported lines of hundreds of people at sites where the forms are being distributed. 
Florida's problems date back to 2013, when a new computer system locked out thousands of recipients and delayed payments by weeks. Auditors last year found many problems had not been fixed.
Then-Governor Rick Scott also scaled back benefits. Florida's maximum weekly payment of $275 is among the lowest in the nation, and benefits expire after 12 weeks -- less than half the nationwide norm.
Only 11% of jobless workers in Florida received benefits last year. Massachusetts and New Jersey, by contrast, provided aid to more than half their unemployed before the crisis hit.
Pena said he was reconsidering his support for Republicans like Scott and DeSantis, saying they had failed to show empathy for workers like him.

""I put my trust into a party, and into an administration that I now realize is slapping me in the face, doesn't have my best interest in mind,"" Pena said. ""So, we'll be voting differently in the future.""

937,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 05:12PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for April 15,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Wall Street shrugged off the more granular numbers to focus on the future again today.
The major indexes all rose sharply, despite sharp drops in profit from major banks to kick off earnings season.
But the “current relief rally might end up faded if there is a (second) wave of infections, and if recession lingers,” J.P. Morgan said in a note. “Bond yields are likely to stay subdued for longer on further QE and very weak activity prints.”
More bank quarterly earnings come tomorrow, while more dour economic data is also expected. And oil inventories will be reported after a punishing day for crude.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. More Results From Big Banks Arrive
Financial earnings continue ahead of trading Wednesday. The sector struggled today after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) reported losses after setting aside large amounts to cover the high number of expected loan defaults due to the economic lockdown.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) will be reporting, with analysts predicting a profit of $3.75 per share on revenue of about $8.5 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
One highlight for Goldman could be trading revenue, with volatility in markets increasing sharply in reaction to the pandemic.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) will weigh in, with analysts looking for earnings of $1.59 per share and revenue of about $19 billion.
“Along with the bottom-line numbers, investors will also be eyeing Citigroup’s efficiency ratio, or expenses as a percentage of revenue,” Investing.com’s Haris Anwar said. “This metric has come in at less than 60% for the past four years, making Citi the only major global bank able to maintain such a winning streak.”
 Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is also on the calendar.
BofA is seen earning 59 cents per share, with revenue coming in at about $22.7 billion.
After the bell, retailer Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) will issue numbers. The struggling retailer has seen shares fall nearly 70% year to date.
2. Big Drop in March Retail Sales Seen
The economic calendar is also busy tomorrow, with last month’s retail sales numbers taking the spotlight.
The Commerce Department reports the latest figures at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
March retail sales are expected to have dropped 8%, while core retail sales, which exclude auto sales, are seen posting a drop of 4.8%, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The headline drop would be the largest drop recorded by far.
“No, hoarding of toilet paper and hand sanitizer does not begin offset the blow of lost paychecks and shutting much of retail down,” Grant Thornton Chief Economist Diane Swonk tweeted.


At the same time the New York Federal Reserve will report the April Empire State Manufacturing index.
Economists are looking for a reading of -35, close to its lowest level of -38.2 during the Financial Crisis.
At 9:15 AM ET, the Federal Reserve will report on March industrial production, expected to have fallen 4%, and capacity utilization, expected to have ticked down to 73.8%.
3. Inventories on Tap After Oil Prices Tank
Oil prices were slammed as the market saw more evidence of how hard it is to coordinate oil production cuts, this time with Texas adding some confusion into how much the U.S. may be adding to global cuts.
Tomorrow, the official weekly government oil inventory numbers are released.
The Energy Information Administration is expected to report that U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 11.7 million barrels last week, after having risen 30.6 million barrels over the past three weeks.
Gasoline stockpiles are expected to have gained by 6.4 million barrels last week, after a net build of 16.5 million barrels over three weeks.
The American Petroleum Institute said today its measure of crude inventories for the week ended April 10 jumped by 13.1 million barrels."
938,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 04:50PM ET</span>",Oklahoma oil regulators set May 11 hearing on oil cuts,"(Reuters) - Oklahoma oil regulators on Tuesday agreed to meet on May 11 to hear from state energy producers urging officials to use their authority to limit crude output in times of economic hardship. 
The Oklahoma Energy Producers Alliance, along with other small producers, last week formally asked the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, which regulates the state's oil and gas industry, to consider that low oil prices had made current production a waste of the state's resources. 
U.S. crude futures were trading around $20.75 a barrel on Tuesday, off more than 60% from the start of the year as the coronavirus pandemic eroded demand. Tuesday's price fell about 8% despite a deal this week by major producers to curb global output. 

Texas regulators on Tuesday heard similar arguments from dozens of oil producers, pipeline companies and others. Shale producers  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) and Parsley Energy proposed a 20% cut, drawing opposition from large oil companies including  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY).

Investing.com – The Dow racked up gains on Tuesday, as investors weighed up the prospect of an eventual economic restart against earnings from banks that point toward further coronavirus-induced pain for the economy.
The Dow jumped 2.39%, or 559 points, theS&P 500 gained 3.06% and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.95%.
Growing signs that some of the Covid-19 hotspots in the country like New York appear to be winning the battle to slow the pandemic have increased calls for the economy to reopen, boosting investor sentiment on risk.
Gross new daily hospitalizations in New York state fell to 1,649 from 1,958 a day earlier, the lowest since March 24, with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo recently suggesting the worst of the pandemic was over.
Governors across New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Rhode Island said they would work together on reopening plans.
But the reopening of the U.S. is unlikely to avert a widely-expected slump in global growth.
The International Monetary Fund said it now expects the global economy to contract by 3% in 2020, compared with a previous estimate for global GDP to expand 3.3% for this year.
Earnings from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) underscored the expected economic damage that lies ahead as both banks reported a steep contraction in earnings on loan loss provisions and warned they may need to sock away more money to offset anticipated loan defaults from customers.
Bucking the trend of weaker earnings, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) rasied its dividend and reported a jump in profit, led by increased demand for over-the-counter medicine.
The rally on Wall Street was led by technology, with FAANG and chip stocks catching a strong bid.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rallied more than 3%.
Energy, meanwhile, proved an exception to the rally, paced by a sharp decline in oil prices just days after OPEC and its allies agreed to cut production by about 10 million barrels a day."

943,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 04:00PM ET</span>",Apple launches site to show how coronavirus lockdowns affect movement,"By Stephen Nellis and Paresh Dave
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) said on Tuesday it would release data that could help inform public health authorities on whether people are driving less during lockdown orders to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.
The data is gathered by counting the number of routing requests from Apple Maps, which is installed on all iPhones, and comparing it with past usage to detect changes in the volume of people driving, walking or taking public transit around the world, Apple said.
The information is being updated daily and compared with a date in mid-January, before most U.S. lockdown measures were in place, Apple said. More than 90% of Americans are under stay-at-home orders and various lockdowns are underway in other countries around the globe.
The data would be aggregated so that requests from individual users would not be shown, and it does not track individual users or their locations, the company said.
The information, available on a public website https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility , will show changes for major cities and 63 countries or regions, Apple said.
In the San Francisco Bay area, requests for driving directions as of April 12 were down 70% versus Jan. 13, and requests for transit directions plunged 84%, the data showed. In New York City, driving direction requests were down 69% and transit requests were down 89%.
Public health officials in California said April 11 they were using data to track the effectiveness of the state's lockdown order, although they did not say whether they were using Apple data.
Apple does not provide the absolute number of requests or a specific number of people moving, instead expressing the data as a percentage of requests compared with its mid-January baseline. 
Aggregate data helps to protect identity and still identifies individual travel patterns thus avoiding some of the mistakes of countries like South Korea, criticized for privacy violations, said Jason Farley, professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing. 
Farley, who is an infectious disease-trained nurse epidemiologist, said the data from the app offers insights into movement right now, yet its impact on maintaining social distancing and making public health decision remains unclear. 
Apple's data is more limited than what Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google has made available to public health officials.
Google nearly two weeks ago released data on more than 131 countries, comparing trips in recent weeks to recreational venues, train and bus stations, grocery stores and workplaces with a five-week period earlier this year. 
For several countries, Google offers county-level data, which is helpful in countries such as the United States where lockdown orders are issued by county officials.
The Apple data, by contrast, shows only data for some cities, regions and countries and does not show results for entire U.S. states, including those without lockdown orders such as North and South Dakota.
The Apple data also does not capture trips where the user has not asked for directions from the Maps.

Apple said it is continuing to work with public health officials to identify what other data types or trends may be helpful.

947,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 03:05PM ET</span>",Strength of U.S. consumer staples stocks shows cracks as market recovers,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A broad rebound in U.S. stocks is leaving behind shares of some supermarkets, household product makers and other staples companies that provided a haven in last month's coronavirus-fueled selloff.
The U.S. consumer staples sector is up 22% since March 23, as of Tuesday afternoon, lagging a rally that has seen the S&P 500 gain nearly 27% in that period. 
Consumers stocking up on groceries, cleaning supplies and other essential goods last month helped boost the sector's performance and bolstered its reputation as a hideout during uncertain times.
The group is down only 7.5% since the S&P 500 hit its closing high on Feb. 19, buoyed by gains in stocks such as Clorox (N:CLX),  General Mills  (N:GIS) and Kroger (N:KR). The S&P, by comparison, has lost 16% from its high. 
But the sector could stall if investors believe that unprecedented stimulus efforts from the Federal Reserve and more than $2 trillion in government bailouts can help the economy recover quickly from the damage caused by the lockdowns that have accompanied the coronavirus. 
""You want to have some exposure to the staples but you don’t want to be overly exposed,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC.
""They are not going to be the group that leads when the market begins to see a turnaround in the economy."" 
(Graphic: Staples stocks vs market in 2020 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakveyegvrd/2020-04-14_11h10_37.jpg)
Pavlik manages portfolios at SlateStone that have shares of Procter & Gamble (N:PG) and Costco Wholesale (O:COST) but are slightly underweight the sector.
First-quarter earnings start for the group next week, including reports due from P&G, Coca-Cola (N:KO) and Kimberly-Clark (N:KMB). Consumer staples companies in the S&P 500 are expected to post a 0.8% rise in quarterly earnings compared to a decline of 12.3% for companies in the index overall, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Sales may already be fading, however. After soaring during the initial weeks of the lockdown in March, U.S. spending on consumer products has begun to normalize compared with a year ago, according to a report from market research firm IRI. 
Still, investors' outlook for the sector could hinge on how quickly they believe the economy and market could bounce back. Indeed, there's still little clarity on the trajectory the pandemic will take in coming months or the full extent of the financial damage it will cause.
While sales of some products could slow if fears related to the pandemic subside, even some growth could make the group a standout in a downturn, said Arun Sundaram, an equity analyst at CFRA Research. His firm rates the staples sector ""overweight.""
""Moderation isn’t bad as long as sales don’t go negative, which you could see in some other industries,"" Sundaram said.
The sector also offers a dividend yield of 3%, according to Refinitiv data. That is above the 2.6% yield for the overall S&P 500 at a time when bond yields near record lows have stoked investors' thirst for streams of income. 
Dividends are one reason David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors, owns staples despite his view that stocks in the sector will not rise as much as others in a recovery. Matrix added to its holding in Kellogg (N:K) and initiated a position in Coca-Cola during the recent selloff, Katz said.
Owning staples allows investors who are ""uncomfortable"" in the market to stay with stocks because of staples companies’ relatively strong balance sheets and business models that can help them navigate a deep recession, Katz said.

""For people who think they should be in the stock market but don’t want to be in the stock market,"" Katz said, ""that’s a great way to be involved.""

Investing.com – Wall Street traded near session highs on Tuesday as investors seemingly upped bets on large-cap tech stocks that are well equipped to benefit from an eventual economic restart, even as the first wave of quarterly earnings indicated there is plenty of coronavirus-led uncertainty ahead.
The Dow jumped 2.23%, or 521 points, theS&P 500 gained 3.01% and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.94%.
The recent wave of optimism on the economy reopening sooner rather than later appears to have drummed up investor appetite for technology stocks that had led the previous bull market, with FAANG names, in particular, up sharply.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rallied more than 4%, with investors appearing to favor companies with strong liquidity at a time when the current pandemic has many firms scrambling to save cash.
""A weak balance sheet means going out of business,"" Hussein Kanji, a partner at venture capital firm Hoxton Ventures told The Telegraph in March. ""The FAANG companies are all huge cash producers.""
Consumer discretionaries also contributed to the wave of green across Wall Street, led by Tesla.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) surged 12% after  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) upgraded its rating on the stock to outperform from neutral and hiked its price target on the stock to $580 from $415.
Financials, however, lagged the broader market rally, as quarterly results from banking stocks flagged further economic pain ahead.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  NYSE:WFC) reported a widely-expected slump in first-quarter profits as they put aside billions of dollars for a potential flurry of loan defaults from customers. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), meanwhile, surged 4.6% after reported a jump in profit, led by increased demand for over-the-counter medicine.
Earnings aside, investor optimism on an economic restart sooner rather later has also supported sentiment, with governors across New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Rhode Island expressing a willingness to work together on reopening plans.
Calls for the economy to restart have been underpinned by signs of slowing infections in hotspots like New York, which is the epicenter of the global pandemic, with gross new daily hospitalizations in the state slowing to 1,649 from 1,958 a day earlier, the lowest since March 24.
Against the backdrop of recent optimism, however, top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said on Tuesday that a May 1 target date for reopening the economy was ""a bit overly optimistic,"" Reuters reported.
Energy, meanwhile, proved an exception to the rally, paced by a sharp decline in oil prices just days after OPEC and its allies agreed to cut production by about 10 million barrels a day."

958,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 12:09PM ET</span>",Short Bets on Biggest Junk ETF Near Record After Fed’s Backstop,"(Bloomberg) -- Bearish wagers against the largest junk-bond ETF are building as skepticism grows that the Federal Reserve’s support will be enough to protect investors.
Short interest on the $16.3 billion iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond exchange-traded fund -- a rough indicator of bearish bets -- is near 38% of shares outstanding, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd. That’s close to a record of 39% reached in late February for the fund, which uses the ticker HYG.
Skepticism is returning after last week saw the biggest rally on record for the ETF, which soared on the back of the Fed’s plan to buy corporate bonds recently cut to junk, known as fallen angels, and certain high-yield funds. While the Fed’s support will help keep credit flowing amid the coronavirus pandemic, it does little to lessen the risk of cash-strapped companies declaring bankruptcy, according to Principal Global Investors.
“Actions to backstop high-yield eases the liquidity strain segment of high-yield spread widening, but it has less impact on the ‘insolvency risk segment’ of high-yield spread widening,” said Seema Shah, Principal’s chief strategist. “It doesn’t necessarily improve the outlook for bankruptcies.”
While the majority of the Fed’s purchases in the corporate bond market will be aimed at ETFs whose primary objective is U.S. investment-grade exposure, another portion will go to corporate high-yield ETFs, according to a primer.
HYG surged 6.6% in the aftermath of the announcement, capping its best week since the fund was created in 2007. The fund was little changed Tuesday as of 11:44 a.m. in New York, after dropping 1.4% Monday.
Not all junk-bond ETFs have seen a spike in short interest. The $10 billion SPDR Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) High Yield Bond ETF and iShares Broad USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF both soared last week, but short interest has fallen. Shorting shares could also reflect moves by investors to hedge other parts of their portfolios, rather than an outright bet on declines.
The fact that the Fed will only be buying falling angels means that the program isn’t necessarily a positive for the entire high-yield asset class, according to Columbia Threadneedle.
“Fed purchases will not extend into the tail of high-yield, and there is an argument to be made that default rates are not fully priced-in yet,” said Ed Al-Hussainy, a senior strategist.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks rose Tuesday, with hopes for a quick restart to the U.S. economy defying another barrage of bad news and gloomy forecasts on the Covid-19 front. 
By 11:40 AM ET (1540 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 430 points or 1.8%. The S&P 500 was up 2.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.9%. 
The move came on the back of another bullish briefing by President Donald Trump on Monday, who amped up the pressure on state governors to ensure that state-wide lockdowns don't drag on through the summer. 
However, the news from the economy itself continued to be bad. The International Monetary Fund predicted the worst global recession since the 1930s, including a 5.9% drop in gross domestic product for the U.S.
Two of the country's biggest banks, meanwhile, reported big jumps in provisions against bad loans as they kicked off the first-quarter earnings season, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) booking $6.8 billion in provisions and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) booking $4 billion. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that provisions could rise further in the coming quarters. 
JPMorgan stock fell 3.2% while Wells Fargo stock lost 4.9%. 
Among the winners was Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), whose stock rose 3.9%, setting a new all-time high on hopes that it had removed a bottleneck that had stopped it maximizing sales in the early days of the U.S. lockdowns. The company said it will relax restrictions on shipping non-essential goods on Monday."
962,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 11:36AM ET</span>","JPMorgan, Wells Fargo Offer Reality Check as Virus Mauls Profit","(Bloomberg) -- With the biggest U.S. banks facing an unprecedented economic standstill and new accounting rules, most analysts expected them to double what they set aside for bad loans a year ago.
Those predictions weren’t nearly pessimistic enough.
Both JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. posted their highest loan-loss provisions in a decade, setting aside more than $12 billion to cover defaults across the economy, but especially from credit-card borrowers and oil companies. Banks faced criticism in the last crisis for being slow to recognize the coming pain, and Tuesday’s results show they intend to avoid that this time.
“This is the reality check,”  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG bank analyst Susan Katzke wrote after JPMorgan’s results. “More to come.”
JPMorgan’s profit fell 69% to the lowest in more than six years, even as the firm’s traders seized on record volatility to deliver their best quarter ever. Wells Fargo posted earnings of 1 cent per share, down from $1.20 a year earlier.
“If we can help the country get through this, everybody’s better off. If we lose a little more money in the meantime, then so be it,” JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said on a call with analysts. “We’re adults, we know that if the economy gets worse we’ll bear additional loss. We know we can handle really, really adverse consequences.”
JPMorgan set aside $8.29 billion for bad loans, more than double what many analysts expected. That was on top of a $4.3 billion increase in total reserves that the bank had previously announced, prompted by a new accounting standard this year known as CECL, which requires banks to set aside provisions earlier in a cycle. Wells Fargo’s $4 billion provision was also well beyond expectations.
The reports give a first glimpse of what’s likely to come as the rest of Wall Street reports results this week. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). are set to report Wednesday, with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) coming a day later.
Banks are also grappling with lower interest rates that will likely cause lending revenue to slump at the same time that slowing economic activity causes loan losses to spike.
While the provisions were eye-popping, the first quarter didn’t actually feature significant pain. JPMorgan’s net charge-offs fell from the fourth quarter, and Wells Fargo’s nonperforming assets were lower than they were a year ago.
Still, banks tried to anticipate how the global lockdown to stem the spread of the new coronavirus would impact businesses and consumers. JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said the firm would likely add more to reserves in the second quarter after boosting them by more than $11 billion in the first quarter, but the bank is still trying to gauge how government relief programs will impact defaults.
“We haven’t actually seen the stress emerge,” she said on a call with analysts. “What we took in the first quarter was our best estimate of future losses.”
Banks also have to determine how many lending commitments will turn into funded loans as companies tap previously unused revolving credit facilities. Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said commercial clients had tapped $80 billion of loan commitments just in March. JPMorgan said customers had drawn more than $50 billion of existing revolvers and were approved for $25 billion in new credit in March.
U.S. banks have maintained that they are much better positioned for this crisis than in 2008. JPMorgan’s key capital ratio was 11.5%, within its medium-term target range. Wells Fargo’s was 10.7%, above its internal target. Still, shares of both banks slipped in New York trading by 10:30 a.m. in New York as the broader market rose, with optimism the pandemic is slowing driving up the S&P 500 more than 2%.
“We like to be conservative in reserving,” Dimon said. “Plan for the worst so you can handle it.”

963,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 11:30AM ET</span>",Boeing Has 150 737 Max Jet Orders Canceled in March,"Investing.com - Boeing (NYSE:BA) saw customers cancel 150 orders for its troubled 737 Max jetliner last month, according to published reports Tuesday.
Shares of Boeing fell 2.4% in morning trading.
Net cancellations for March were 119 taking into account orders for wide-body jets and military aircraft, CNBC reported. Total cancellations for the first quarter were 307.
Boeing has currently stopped production due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The 737 Max jet has been grounded since two fatal crashes last year.
“We are working closely with our customers, many of whom are facing significant financial pressures, to review their fleet plans and make adjustments where appropriate,” the company said in a statement. “At the same time, Boeing continues to adjust its order book to adapt to lower-than-planned 737 MAX production in the near term.”"
964,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 11:18AM ET</span>",JPMorgan Braces for 450% More Pain from the Coronavirus,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Last week, JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon gave shareholders his perspective on the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the U.S. economy. “We assume that it will include a bad recession combined with some kind of financial stress similar to the global financial crisis of 2008,” he wrote.
The biggest U.S. bank backed up Dimon’s outlook with some staggering numbers on Tuesday.
Most prominently, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) reported a jaw-dropping first-quarter provision for credit losses of $8.3 billion, which compared with the same period in 2019 represents a $6.8 billion increase in dollar terms or a 450% jump in percentage terms. It’s understandable now why Dimon evoked the specter of the 2008 crisis last week — the amount set aside for bad loans is just shy of the bank’s record $8.6 billion at the beginning of 2009.
That kind of headline number sent shockwaves through the rest of JPMorgan’s earnings figures: First-quarter profit dropped for the first time since the end of 2017, to the lowest in more than six years. The bank cut its full-year estimate for net interest income to $55.5 billion from $57 billion. It expects net reserves to build even further in the current quarter, which of course started with much of the U.S. economy shut down.
These are huge expectations for losses, especially considering that JPMorgan’s economic outlook, as detailed by Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak, is for the unemployment rate to rise “above 10%” and then recover. At this point, it’s very much an open question whether those assumptions will hold. Bloomberg Economics noted last week that jobless claims point to a 15% figure in April “and possibly higher later in the quarter unless the torrent of jobless filings starts to subside.” As each day goes by, that seems increasingly unlikely.
If there’s a silver lining, it might be that JPMorgan can afford to be conservative on setting aside reserves while also extending billions of dollars to companies in crisis because it profited from the unprecedented financial-market volatility in the final weeks of the quarter. The bank brought in $7.23 billion from trading stocks and bonds, the most on record.
JPMorgan also appears to be doing right by its staff. The bank said it’s paying branch employees normally even if they’re working less and will pay up to $1,000 to eligible employees. During a period in which weekly initial jobless claims began smashing through previous records, it’s encouraging to see that Dimon’s famous “fortress balance sheet” is helping to support employees closest to the front lines.
I wrote three months ago that JPMorgan was the king of Wall Street but that it would have a hard time topping its results from 2019. It goes without saying that transitioning from record annual earnings to weathering a controlled economic collapse was not on anyone’s radar.
Early indications suggest that preparing for the worst won’t be limited to JPMorgan.  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. also reported first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, setting aside $4 billion for losses on loans and debt, up about 373% from $845 million a year ago. It said it would make a one-time cash payment to roughly 165,000 employees this week. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo Chief Executive Charlie Scharf detailed steps taken to support customers, such as suspending residential property foreclosure sales and deferring or waiving fees. Just because the economy has weakened doesn’t mean the competition for market share is any less intense among the biggest U.S. banks.
Obviously, Wall Street can’t withstand the economic shutdown forever. JPMorgan’s Piepszak warned of potentially “meaningfully higher” provisions for potential loan losses in the months to come because of the coronavirus pandemic. It should be little surprise that one of the main topics of Dimon’s letter last week was that Americans “need a plan to get safely back to work.” The bank’s results look fine in the context of a short-lived spike in joblessness — but what about a longer-than-expected shutdown, with a 20% unemployment rate?
“We know we can handle really, really adverse consequences,” Dimon said on a conference call with analysts. Anything the bank can do to help the country move forward leaves everyone better off, he said. “If we lose a little bit more money in the meantime, so be it.”
If anything, JPMorgan’s earnings at least affirm that this crisis — dubbed the “Great Lockdown” by the International Monetary Fund — is different from 2008. The banks are comparatively well-positioned to absorb body blows from multiple directions and still come out standing.

The luxury timepiece companies along with Chopard and Tudor said they would create a new trade show in Geneva with the Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie, an industry group that organises the rival Watches & Wonders fair, in April next year. 
Rolex said it was unhappy with changes at Baselworld and recent decisions of exhibitions company MCH Group, which postponed the 2020 edition of Baselworld planned for April 30-May 5 due to coronavirus. 
MCH carried forward 85% of the fees for exhibitors to next year, while keeping 15% to offset out-of-pocket costs, among options it offered exhibitors as it sought to manage the financial impact.
""We have taken part in Baselworld since 1939,"" Rolex said in a joint statement with the other watch makers. ""Unfortunately, given the way the event has evolved and the recent decisions made by MCH Group...we have decided to withdraw.""
Geneva-based Patek Philippe cited a breakdown in relations with Baselworld organisers, saying the company ""is not in line with Baselworld’s vision anymore"" and that ""trust is no longer present"". 
MCH Group, which last month predicted sales losses of up to 170 million Swiss francs ($177 million) for 2020 as the epidemic wreaks havoc on events, declined to comment. 

Swatch Group, the maker of Omega watches, left Baselworld in 2019, citing issues including costs.

968,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 11:05AM ET</span>","Indian banks issue gag orders to employees over branch overcrowding: documents, sources","By Nupur Anand
MUMBAI (Reuters) - State-owned banks in India have barred employees from posting pictures, video clips or messages on social media on issues such as overcrowding at bank branches during the coronavirus crisis, according to multiple sources and documents seen by Reuters.
Banks have seen a surge in traffic after Prime Minister Narendra Modi outlined a package of anti-crisis measures including direct cash payments to millions of poorer Indians, who have been queuing at branches to access the funds.
Some branch staff have complained on social media of the difficulty in imposing social distancing in such conditions, earning a rebuke from employers and even from the police.
 State Bank of India  (NS:SBI), the country's largest lender, said in a notice sent to its employees that disciplinary action would be taken for violating the code of conduct if they spoke on social media about the functioning of its branches.
""On scrutiny of these posts it is observed that many of these social media users are our employees,"" said the letter, adding that some posts had made disparaging comments about the bank, its management and policies.
A similar memo warning employees against social media posts has also been issued by other state-owned banks including  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK), a communication seen by Reuters said.
Emails sent to both banks seeking comment remained unanswered.
Asked about the memos, a spokesman for the Finance Ministry said the Department of Financial Services, which oversees state-owned banks, had not issued any gag orders and was ""always looking for honest feedback to improve the customer services"". 
THREAT OF ARREST
Bankers say they are now also being harassed by police for failing to ensure the social distancing required to help curb the spread of coronavirus.
""Instead of helping us the police are threatening to arrest us,"" said one bank official, who asked not to be named due to the restrictions imposed by the state-owned bank where he works.
The All India Bank Officers' confederation, a union of bank employees, has raised the matter with federal and state authorities, requesting them not to penalize bank employees.
""So far we're neither getting help to manage the crowds, nor are we being allowed to voice complaints... about the critical lapses and failures of social distancing at banks,"" said another bank employee who also requested anonymity. 
The Finance Ministry spokesman said the government had ordered state authorities ""to render all possible help to the bankers in implementing social distancing"".
Bank unions said they had also asked for protective gear for branch officials but this had not yet been provided as India is still struggling to meet the safety requirements of health workers.

India has extended a lockdown on its 1.3 billion people until at least May 3 to combat the spread of coronavirus. India has so far reported more than 10,000 cases of the COVID-19 disease caused by the virus, including 358 deaths.

In the primary market, where new debt is sold, issuers in sectors hard-hit by the coronavirus like energy and retail came to market with high-yield bonds. Burlington Coat Factory (BCF.UL) came to market with a $300 million bond that priced at the low end of the expected range on Monday, signaling investor demand. Ferrellgas Partners  also priced a $125 million high-yield bond on Monday. 
Prices on existing junk bonds also jumped and the spread of yields over safer Treasuries narrowed as demand picked up. High-yield exchange-traded funds have risen, like the iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond Fund (P:HYG) which is up 6% since the market close on Wednesday, before the Fed's announcement. 

The spread of the ICE/BofA high-yield index <.MERH0A0> has narrowed by 111 basis points over safer Treasury yields since Wednesday.

983,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 09:55AM ET</span>","Hyundai first to restart Czech production, others still shut","PRAGUE (Reuters) -  Hyundai Motor  Co's (KS:005380) Czech car plant was the first in the central European country to get back to work on Tuesday after a three-week outage, potentially easing some of the strain on the hard-hit economy.
The car sector accounts for a tenth of economic output and a quarter of exports in the Czech Republic, and employs 150,000 directly and even more indirectly.
All three of the country's major carmakers have been offline since around the middle of March as part of efforts to curb the coronavirus and authorities have forecast at least a 5% economic contraction this year.
Yet while Hyundai's plant in the east of the country returned to work, there was gloomier picture elsewhere. TPCA, a joint venture of Toyota Motor Co (T:7203) and  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP), said it would extend its outage to May 4, scrapping plans to relaunch later this week.
The country's top exporter, Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) Skoda, is for now planning to leave workers at home until April 27.
By contrast tiremaker Continental (DE:CONG) relaunched its Czech plant employing over 5,000 in the east of the country with limited production on Tuesday, having temporarily halted it last month.
Hyundai, whose output of 309,500 cars last year was nearly all for export, said it would run two out of three shifts. The down shift will be used for disinfecting operations.
The virus's outbreak has put most of Europe on lockdown and left numerous factories idled. The car plant closures have hit auto part makers along the supply chain.
The Czech government has introduced aid schemes for companies and workers hit by measures to curb the virus.

The Czech Automotive Industry Association said at the beginning of April that 90% of the sector was crippled by the crisis and a third was forced to halt operations.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks gained on Tuesday after Chinese trade data came in better than expected and as some countries tried to restart their economies by partly lifting restrictions aimed at containing the coronavirus pandemic.
European stock markets opened stronger, with the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index rising 0.5% to its highest since March 11. U.S. stock futures were up nearly 1%. (ESc1)
Analysts said the threat of a much deeper and prolonged downturn was starting to dissipate as new coronavirus cases declined in major economies and a raft of monetary and fiscal stimulus measures took effect globally.
Spanish shares (IBEX) gained as much as 1.5% as some businesses reopened, although shops, bars and public spaces were set to stay closed until at least April 26.
""Although further slowdown in the pandemic's spreading may keep sentiment supported, we are still reluctant to trust a long-lasting recovery, and we prefer to take things day by day,"" said Charalambos Pissouros, analyst at JFD Group.
Market sentiment was boosted by data showing China's exports fell only 6.6% in March from a year ago, less than the expected 14% plunge. Imports fell 0.9% compared with expectations for a 9.5% drop.
The gains in Europe took MSCI's All-Country World Index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares across 49 countries, up 0.5%.
Graphic - World stocks vs. COVID-19 confirmed cases: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkplkmkvbx/Pasted%20image%201586848940390.png
Chinese shares gained, with the blue-chip index (CSI300) up 1.2%. Australian shares (AXJO) were up 1.7% and Japan's Nikkei (N225) rose 2.8%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) was up 0.9%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares excluding Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 1.3% to its highest in a month, up 20% from a four-year low on March 19.
Investors are now eyeing the easing of virus-related restrictions in some regions for further trading cues.
In Europe, thousands of shops across Austria are set to re-open on Tuesday. Spain recorded its smallest proportional daily rise in the number of deaths and new infections since early March and let some businesses return to work on Monday.
In the United States, which has recorded the highest number of casualties from the virus in the world, President Donald Trump said on Monday his administration was close to completing a plan to reopen the U.S. economy. However, some state governors say the decision to restart businesses lies with them.
Wall Street indexes ended mixed on Monday. The Dow and S&P 500 fell, but a 6.2% gain in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares helped the Nasdaq end higher.
""The pull-back in U.S. equities should come as no surprise in light of last week's historic rally,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management, noting the S&P 500 had posted its best weekly performance since 1974.
""Sentiment will zig-zag until there is more clarity on formal measures to reopen major economies. More broadly, even though global markets have rebounded, it is difficult to say with any certainty whether the bottom has been reached.""
Oil prices edged lower, with investors apparently unconvinced that record supply cuts could soon balance markets pummelled by the coronavirus pandemic, though a predicted plunge in U.S. shale output provided some support.
Brent (LCOc1) futures fell 0.95% to $31.46 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) fell 2.3%to $21.89, having dropped 1.5% in the previous session.
Gold prices  clung to highs not seen in more than seven years at $1,720.1 an ounce.
In currencies, the dollar extended losses on the back of the U.S. Federal Reserve's massive new lending programme. It weakened against the Japanese yen  to 107.7. 

The euro (EUR=) was up 0.2% at $1.0929. The risk-sensitive Australian dollar  jumped 0.6% to $0.6420.

Investing.com - JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM) earnings  plunged in the first quarter as the bank was forced to make huge provisions against bad loans arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.
The bank said net income fell 69% from a year earlier to $2.87 billion, or 78c share, on a 3% drop in revenue to $29.07 billion. That was due largely to $6.8 billion in provisions against possible losses on its loan book, along with $951 million of losses related to funding spread widening on derivatives and $896 million of markdowns in the so-called 'bridge books'. While retail loans accounted for $4.4 billion of the reserves, the bank also set aside $2.4 billion for corporate loans, with the largest impacts in the oil & gas, real estate, and consumer and retail industries.
Total credit costs for the quarter were $$8.3 billion.
Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $2.28 on revenue of $29.53 billion.
“The company entered this crisis in a position of strength, and we remain well capitalized and highly liquid,"" CEO and chairman Jamie Dimon said in a statement.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to push higher Tuesday, as investors react to signs the coronavirus outbreak may be peaking while maintaining a degree of caution ahead of the start of the new earnings season.
At 7:35 AM ET (1135 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 29 points, or 1.1%, higher, futures for theNasdaq up 110 points, or 1.3%. The Dow futures contract rose 292 points, or 1.3%. 
The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the U.S. is approaching 600,000, while over 23,000 people have died, but talk is now turning to when states will start reopening their economies.
At least 1,500 new U.S. fatalities were reported on Monday, below last week's running tally of roughly 2,000 deaths every 24 hours. Likewise, the number of additional confirmed cases counted on Monday, about 23,000, was well below last week's trend of 30,000 to 50,000 new cases a day. However, Monday numbers have dipped, only to rise again as the collection of data from the weekend was completed.
Eyes are now turning to an earnings season that kicks off in earnest Tuesday, starting with a pair of big banks .JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) both issued results before the bell, JPMorgan reporting a 68% slump in first-quarter profit as the coronavirus forced the largest U.S. bank to boost reserves against a wave of potential loan defaults.
Wells Fargo is seen earning 61 cents per share with revenue of about $19.4 billion, although consensus forecasts are vulnerable to being rapidly overtaken by events. 
Elsewhere, drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) reported a healthy first quarter and raised its dividend, helped by increased demand for its pharmaceuticals.
After the bell, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) is expected to report a loss of $2.29 per share for the quarter, with revenue coming in at about $8.4 billion.
Additionally,  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) will be in the spotlight after the oil giant borrowed $9.5 billion in the U.S. corporate bond market on Monday, building up a war chest of cash amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Oil prices have edged lower Tuesday as the deal reached over Easter by the world’s major oil producers to cut output by 9.7 million barrels per day in May and June failed to convince.
The American Petroleum Institute will report its measure of U.S. oil inventories after the bell, giving traders a glimpse into the extent of the demand destruction. Last month it reported a rise in crude stockpiles of nearly 12 million barrels.
At 7:35 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.1% lower at $21.94 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.6% to $31.54.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,760.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded at $1.0948, up 0.3%."
1003,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 07:06AM ET</span>","Pandemic survival plans: U.S. businesses scramble to conserve cash, boost liquidity","By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Charlie Straface, president of Norwegian aluminum maker Norsk Hydro's North American extrusion operations, convenes a coronavirus task force every other day to draw up cost-cutting measures to offset declining revenues and protect the unit's cash balance during the economic slump related to the outbreak. 
With little clarity on when the U.S. economy will reopen, companies of all sizes have been bracing for at least months of limited revenues. With about $500 billion of corporate debt due to mature this year and in 2021, many businesses must conserve cash and bolster liquidity.
""Things are changing day to day,"" said Straface. His unit, headquartered in Rosemont, Illinois has already furloughed employees and slashed operating expenses, and he said: ""We have to anticipate everything that could go wrong relative to our cash flow situation.""
Straface said cash balance looks positive for six months. 
The picture was shakier for Lake Zurich, Illinois-based CCTY Bearing. The supplier of bearings to automakers and construction and agriculture equipment manufacturers, said it could face a problem if the economy remains shut even into May.
Forty-one states have ordered people to stay at home to contain the coronavirus outbreak. As a result, many of CCTY's customers are unable to take their deliveries. 
If the gridlock persists, CCTY expects to have a 50% increase in inventory in May, locking up millions of dollars.
""I am having sleepless nights,"" said Evan Poulakidas, CCTY's director for North America.
At Hydro's North American extrusion unit, slumping revenues have boosted the need for working capital 15% over the past month, and the worst is yet to come.
The unit has projected that sales will dip by up to 30% in April and May, causing a ""significant"" jump in inventory.
To protect its cash balance, Hydro has furloughed about 10% of employees in the United States and Canada and asked all 23 facilities to cut operating expenses by as much as 20%.
If the situation worsens, Straface says the unit could consider ""draconian"" steps such as halting all the capital spending for the year, temporary plant closures and salary cuts.
Hydro is not alone. Heavy equipment maker  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) has withheld annual salary increases and bonuses for employees. Furniture maker Steelcase has asked nearly all U.S.-based salaried employees to temporarily take a 50% base pay cut.
United States Steel Corp has slashed capital spending for the year and idled some operations.
Economists believe the U.S. economy already slipped into recession last month. Further cuts would almost certainly worsen the unemployment rate that in March posted the largest single-month increase since January 1975.
DEBT BINGE
David Berge, an analyst at rating agency Moody's, said ""good and deep sources"" of liquidity are needed to survive a prolonged disruption. Companies, therefore, have been racing to raise as much credit as possible.
Tractor manufacturer Deere & Co has tapped the market to raise $2.5 billion in new debt and renewed $8 billion revolving credit facilities. Plane maker Boeing (NYSE:BA) last month drew down its entire $13.8 billion credit line.
But the credit market has tightened. The spread between risky high-yield corporate debt and U.S. Treasuries has widened sharply to about 9 percentage points now from 3.5 percentage points in January.
The Federal Reserve last week announced it would expand its corporate bond-buying program, leading to a rally in prices of junk bonds. Matthew Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management, said while the move ""can't stop companies from defaulting"", it at least helps them manage borrowing costs.
A $350 billion government loan program for small businesses also offers a lifeline to those facing a liquidity crunch, but its rollout has been marred by confusion over funding terms.
The chief operating officer of HiberSense said the government loan could help the small startup, which sells internet-connected home climate control systems, stay afloat until business rebounds. COO Bob Fields, however, said the company was still waiting to hear back from its bank about the loan request. 
The Pittsburgh-based company has been operating under a ""Pandemic Survival Plan"" after the virus-induced lockdown led to a 75% drop in revenues last month. $300,000 of its capital is tied up as customers are struggling to take deliveries.
Fields said cash requirements have already tripled, forcing it to carry out layoffs and freeze discretionary spending.
When the first wave of stay-at-home orders hit HiberSense's operations, Fields hoped normal business would resume in a week. After that he knew the company needed a plan to survive.

""We couldn't afford to spend money on hope,"" Fields said. ""Hope is not a strategy.""

1004,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 07:05AM ET</span>",China's stocks short-selling at a record high,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The value of shares that investors in China's onshore stock markets have borrowed to sell short held close to record levels set last week, amid bearishness over the new coronavirus pandemic, market data released on Tuesday showed.
The value of shares used for shortselling was around 20 billion yuan ($2.83 billion) on Monday, just a touch below the record 20.3 billion yuan set on April 9, according to the latest data from China Securities Finance Corporation, a financial institution cofounded by Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange.
That is double the level seen before the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, when the scare over the epidemic in China began impacting global markets.
China's benchmark Shanghai stock index (SSEC) has lost 7% so far this year. 
Among the shares most targeted for short-selling by Chinese investors were Kweichow  Moutai  (SS:600519), the country's largest liquor maker by market capitalisation, and an ETF tracking China's CSI300 blue-chip index (SS:510300). 
The data showed stocks on China's newly launched STAR Market, were more heavily shorted than main board peers, as investors have more ways to borrow stocks in the STAR Market.
Despite being at record levels, the shortselling has little impact as China's stock markets have a total market capitalisation of more than $8 trillion, according to Song Jing, analyst with Nomura Orient International Securities.

The amount of shortselling is also dwarfed by the near 1 trillion yuan worth of stock purchases investors have made on margin, wherein they borrow to fund these investments, revealing the heavy skew in the country's equities market.

The world's second-biggest tobacco group on Tuesday said it was cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) without elaborating and declined to say whether the case was a criminal investigation.
""As the investigations are ongoing, it would be inappropriate for us to provide further comment at this time,” company spokeswoman Anna Vickerstaff said in an email. 
Neither the DoJ nor OFAC responded immediately to Reuters' requests for comment.
BAT, which makes Lucky Strike and Dunhill cigarettes, last month disclosed in its annual report that it was aware of the investigation by the DoJ and OFAC, a financial intelligence and enforcement agency under the U.S. Treasury department. It did not provide detail on the nature of the investigation.
Shares in the company fell 5.5% to 28.54 pounds in early trading, erasing gains made last week. 
BAT's annual report for 2019 said the group has operations in a number of nations that are subject to various sanctions, including Iran and Cuba, and that operations in these countries expose the company to the risk of ""significant financial costs"".
With respect to the U.S. investigation, the company said in its annual filing that ""the potential for fines, penalties or other consequences cannot currently be assessed but may be material"". 
Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is conducting a separate ongoing investigation into BAT, relating to ""suspicions of corruption in the conduct of business by group companies and associated persons"". 
Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett said on Tuesday that the U.S. investigation could be linked to the SFO inquiry but that it ""likely sounds worse than it is"". 

""If we are right, and it (the U.S. probe) does relate to the same accusations (as in SFO probe), the fact this has been ongoing in some form since 2017 with no apparent conclusion, we would not worry too much about it for now,"" Bennett wrote.

1011,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 05:41AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Preparing for the No-Visibility Earnings Season,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- What can investors hope to learn from the first-quarter earnings season about to begin?
At first glance, not much. The news flow about the Covid-19 outbreak has been so overwhelming, so relentless in the last couple of months that corporate summaries will have lost their ability to shock, or even maybe to be even mildly surprising.
The U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission last week warned U.S. companies not to dwell on the historical stuff and concentrate on “where the company stands today, operationally and financially...and how its condition may change as efforts to fight COVID-19 progress.”
Such advice, of course, immediately runs into the problem that few companies have any clear idea of the future.
None will be have a clear view of the progress of the medical emergency. Will it return as lockdown measures are lifted? Will reinfections prevent a smooth return to normal? Will herd immunity or a miracle drug consign Covid-19 to the past within months? No-one knows.
Few will have a clear handle on the efficacy of financial support measures announced so far by governments. Can the bureaucratic delays to getting cash out to households and businesses be reduced?  Can the programs be sustained, especially if not properly backstopped? That applies less to the U.S. than to the euro zone, whose finance ministers again shelved a decision on joint debt issuance before Easter. It applies even more to emerging economies, which need the support of the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral organizations to avoid ‘sudden stops’ in their economies. It seems too much to think that fiscal and monetary measures will be equally effective the world over.
But the biggest open question of all will be how companies judge the future behavior of their customers. For businesses with an essentially B2B model, the signs are not encouraging. Every business to have updated in recent weeks has been determined to cut “discretionary” expenditure to conserve cash. That means an effective stop to business investment, except in some niche areas like medical equipment. A gloomy update last week from SAP, which faces a broad spectrum of business customers, illustrated that point well.
Consumer stocks – especially those exposed to staples – have the better visibility. Food and drink stocks, and supermarkets, have been the best performers of the year to date, but some of Europe’s stronger fashion names such as  Inditex  (MC:ITX), Zalando and Adidas (DE:ADSGN) have also bounced particularly sharply in recent weeks as the light at the end of the tunnel has got a little broader.
But a (U.S.-focused) note from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) underlines the potential risks still out there.
“The level of 2021 earnings matters for 2020 stock prices,” the bank’s equity strategists wrote. U.S. stocks currently trade on an implicit valuation of 16 times 2021 earnings, which doesn’t seem a particularly conservative discount to historical averages, given the size of the uncertainty.
“If consensus EPS forecasts are revised lower, as we expect, the implied market multiple will become even more elevated. Put differently, our macro valuation model indicates that either the S&P 500 index should be 25% lower, consensus 2021 EPS should be 25% higher.
The only other explanation they offer is that “equity valuations today are tied more closely to policy support and investor sentiment than to the traditional drivers captured in our model,”
That’s a polite way of saying ‘blind trust in the Fed and the U.S. administration”.
Hmmm."

The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced as much as 1.3%, led by miners and chemical resources. AstraZeneca Plc rallied 5.3% after announcing the Tagrisso Phase III ADAURA trial will be unblinded early after “overwhelming efficacy.”

The market was also weighing the Federal Reserve’s decision to dial back its support for the market through repurchase agreements following signs that the recent upheaval in dollar funding has eased.
“The better-than-expected China macro data and the latest Fed announcements improved the sentiment further,” said Ulrich Urbahn, head of multi-asset strategy and research at Joh Berenberg Gossler & Co. “Many investors gradually fear missing out.

In addition, many countries are now beginning to ease some restrictions. Spain has allowed around 300,000 nonessential workers to return to their jobs, while Italy will allow a narrow range of businesses to resume operations this week.
Helping the tone Tuesday was the release of better-than-expected Chinese trade data for March as year-on-year exports and imports contracted less than expected.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was up 1.1% at 0703 GMT, after a strong finish last week that was powered by another aggressive round of stimulus and tentative signs of the virus peaking in some hot spots.
The focus this week will turn to U.S. corporate earnings, with investors bracing for a rough season as the health crisis crushed business activity and sparked mass furloughs. 
In Europe, first-quarter earnings for STOXX 600 firms are expected to decline 15.7%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Lifting sentiment on Tuesday, data showed a decline in China's exports and imports slowed in March after plunging in the previous two months, but analysts warned a sure-footed recovery was months away.
Spanish shares (IBEX) gained 1.5% as some businesses re-opened, although shops, bars and public spaces were set to stay closed until at least April 26.

Swedish rare disease drugmaker Sobi (ST:SOBIV) jumped 7.6% to the top of the STOXX 600 after reporting stronger-than-expected first-quarter earnings as the pandemic spurred higher demand for some of its pharmaceuticals.

1021,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 02:40AM ET</span>",SoftBank record loss estimate renews asset sale focus,"By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp's (T:9984) estimate it will post a record $13 billion full-year loss, dragged down by its spluttering $100 billion Vision Fund, has renewed attention on a planned asset sell-down aimed at raising cash and restoring confidence.
SoftBank shares fell as much as 4% on Tuesday before recovering to close up 5% after the group late on Monday said it sees a 1.8 trillion yen ($16.7 billion) full-year loss at the Vision Fund as its tech bets crumble.
The disastrous performance at the fund on which Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has staked his reputation will drag the entire group to its largest annual loss, underscoring the need for his plan to raise up to 4.5 trillion yen through asset sales.
While domestic carrier SoftBank Corp (T:9434) is seen as a possible target, SoftBank is dependent on its dividends for cash flow, leaving its stake in  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) the most likely to be sold down or monetized, UBS analyst Kei Takahashi wrote in a client note.
SoftBank's biggest asset, its 26% stake in the Chinese e-commerce leader, has already been used as collateral to borrow more than a trillion yen, with collar transactions contributing a further 200 billion at the end of December.
The Alibaba stake could be used to raise 3 trillion yen, Takahashi wrote, along with using its stake in wireless carrier T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS), which just completed a merger with SoftBank's Sprint, as collateral for loans.
The move comes as SoftBank is under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management to improve shareholder returns, with the group announcing a share buyback of up to 2.5 trillion yen. 
The rise in SoftBank's shares on Tuesday followed comments from the Japan Credit Rating Agency which said the impact of the expected annual loss on SoftBank's credit rating is limited as it will not greatly affect debt ratios.
OPAQUE
SoftBank's willingness to leverage its investments adds to a lack of transparency around its finances, contributing to its persistent conglomerate discount. A third of its stake in SoftBank Corp has also been used as collateral, with Vision Fund investments similarly employed to raise cash.
The Vision Fund recorded a loss of around 800 billion yen in the nine months to December.
SoftBank did not provide details on which tech bets account for the wider loss in the quarter through March - a practice which is a long-standing irritant for analysts and investors who complain of the conglomerate's opaque accounting methods.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to edge higher Tuesday, as traders return from the Easter break hopeful the coronavirus outbreak may be peaking. Sentiment though remains cautious with the start of the earnings season set to illustrate the extent of the damage done to the corporate sector.
At 2:15 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% higher. CAC 40 futures were up 1.7%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%. 
The number of confirmed cases of the Covid-19 virus is rapidly approaching two million globally, but Italy – the worst hit country in Europe in terms of deaths - reported Monday that the number of its new cases slowed to 3,153 from a previous 4,092, the lowest since April 7. 
In addition, many countries are now beginning to ease some restrictions. Spain has allowed around 300,000 nonessential workers to return to their jobs, while Italy will allow a narrow range of businesses to resume operations this week.
Helping the tone Tuesday was the release of better-than-expected Chinese trade data for March as year-on-year exports and imports contracted less than expected.
Still, any enthusiasm may be tempered by the start of the earnings season, which will likely deal a severe blow to corporate profits.
U.S. banking giants JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) are due to issue first quarter results before the bell, and their numbers are likely to be studied carefully as banks tend to be viewed as bellwethers for the wider economy because of their central position in the financial system. 
In Europe,  Renault  (PA:RENA) announced plans Tuesday to sell its stake in its Chinese joint venture with Dongfeng Motor Corporation to Dongfeng. The French company's debt was downgraded to junk just before Easter.
Swiss wealth manager  Julius Baer  (SIX:BAER) said Tuesday it will propose splitting its 2019 dividend payment into two halves. The announcement follows similar proposals by UBS and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) after requests from Swiss financial supervisor FINMA that they conserve capital amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Oil prices have edged higher Tuesday following the weekend’s deal to cut output by 9.7 million barrels per day in May and June, However, gains are limited as the cuts are still dwarfed by the likely drop in demand in April given the global economic shutdown.
The American Petroleum Institute will report its weekly U.S. oil inventoriy data after the bell, updating traders on he extent of the demand destruction.
Last week the API reported a rise in crude stockpiles of nearly 12 million barrels.
At 2:15 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.0% higher at $22.63 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.5% to $32.20.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,767.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0940, up 0.3% on the day.

Renault has been one of many leading global automotive companies that has been hit hard by the impact of the coronavirus, which has led to factory closures and a slump in demand.
Renault and Dongfeng said they would continue to cooperate with Nissan on new generation engines such as the supply of components to Dongfeng Renault Automotive Company (DRAC) and diesel licences to Dongfeng Automobile Co Ltd. 
Renault and Dongfeng will also co-operate in the field of hi-tech 'intelligent connected' vehicles, while Dongfeng Renault Automotive Company (DRAC) will stop its Renault-branded activities.

Smartphone companies are hoping for a strong recovery in demand in China, where the deadly coronavirus is subsiding, just as it spreads overseas and looks set to trigger a global recession.
Mobile phone shipments in China in March totalled 21 million units, according to data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), a government think tank. 
That was a more than three-fold increase from February, yet still down roughly 20% compared with March 2019.
Chinese retailers largely resumed operations by early March, with brick-and-mortar outlets re-opening and e-commerce logistics getting back in gear after the virus and tough containment measures brought much of the economy to a standstill in the first two months.
Apple shipped roughly 500,000 phones in China in February, according to the CAICT.
Many smartphone makers are now hoping that sales in China can cushion declines in overseas markets in coming months.
In its quarterly earnings call, the then-CFO of  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810) said that the Chinese market had recovered to roughly 80% of its normal levels.
The company later wrote a letter to the government of India, one of its largest markets, requesting that it consider smartphones an essential commodity and therefore exempt from shipping restrictions.
Earlier this month several Chinese online retailers slashed prices on iPhone 11 models. Apple has let third-party sellers in China offer discounts in the past in order to spur demand.
The company announces its quarterly earnings results on April 30.

1030,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 01:20AM ET</span>",Fed to launch commercial paper liquidity backstop Tuesday,"By Karen Pierog
(Reuters) - A funding backstop the U.S. Federal Reserve launches on Tuesday should help address liquidity problems that have lingered in the coronavirus-roiled commercial paper market, although participation by debt issuers may be short-lived, analysts said. 
The Commercial Paper Funding Facility's special purpose vehicle will purchase higher rated, three-month unsecured and asset-backed paper from eligible bank, corporate, special-purpose entity, and municipal issuers using financing from the New York Federal Reserve. The vehicle, which was announced on March 17, will begin making purchases on Tuesday according to the New York Fed.
The program is similar to an operation used during the 2008 financial crisis, in which the central bank acts as a lender of last resort for companies otherwise unable to borrow in the short-term market. 
Short-term credit markets had come under strain amid worries that companies hit by efforts to slow the spread of the virus would not be able to repay their IOUs. That spurred the Fed to take steps aimed at thawing out markets frozen by spiking lending rates.
A Monday Citi Research report said that the program ""should ultimately be successful at restoring liquidity to (commercial paper) markets."" 
Deborah Cunningham, chief investment officer at Federated Hermes in Pittsburgh, said the move will provide a backstop for the market. 
""I don't know that it's going to get a whole lot of utilization,"" she said. ""Having said that, I think it's good that it's there and it adds sort of a floor if spreads started to get too wide for whatever reason."" 
Cunningham added that issuers may not like the fee they are required to pay to participate in the program. The 10-basis-point ""facility fee"" is based on the maximum amount of an issuer's commercial paper that the special purpose vehicle may own. 
The Federal Reserve said on March 17 that each user must pay a fee of 10 basis point of the maximum amount outstanding over last year.
Kevin Giddis, co-head of fixed income capital markets at Raymond James, agreed that the costs will dampen demand. 
""The facility does help to support the market and the Treasury’s $10 billion backstop has meant that there is help there (should) things get worse,"" he said in an email.
The facility is funded with $10 billion in equity from the U.S. Treasury, which the Fed is expected to leverage as much as 10 times should demand warrant.
John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics, said the Fed's announcement of the program has helped ease rates and that he expects ""significant"" initial demand for the loans.
""The (commercial paper) market is clearly not back to normal despite the recent improvement though, so I still expect an initial burst of interest after it opens, but the facility open will allow the slow improvement to continue over the near-term,"" he said in an email. 
Companies rely on commercial paper as a source of short-term cash for payrolls, inventory and accounts payable as well as unanticipated funding needs.
Since the introduction of its facility, rates across maturities for both high-grade and lower-grade paper have fallen. 
The average rate for overnight AA nonfinancial paper, was 1.56% in February, 0.86% in March and is currently at 0.06% for April. For lower-grade A2/P2 overnight nonfinancial paper that rate dropped from 2.31% in March and is currently at 1.58% for April. 
Earlier this month, the New York Fed announced it hired Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO) to serve as investment manager for the facility and retained  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Bank & Trust Company to be the custodian and accounting administrator.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) on Monday raised $9.5 billion in new debt, with the largest U.S. oil producer seeking to bolster its finances while debt markets remain open to new deals. 
Exxon paid a lower price to borrow than it did in a similar debt deal almost four weeks ago, a sign of how investor confidence is gradually returning after a rout in energy prices and a stock market collapse fueled by the coronavirus outbreak. 
Nevertheless, borrowing costs for Exxon were still higher than prior to the coronavirus outbreak.
Exxon raised $9.5 billion by selling five different bonds with a variety of durations ranging from five years to 31 years, up from $9 billion which it had originally planned to raise, indicating robust investor demand. 
In an example of how the company's borrowing costs have come down in recent weeks, it priced a 10.5-year bond worth $2 billion at a 185 basis-point premium to U.S. Treasuries with a 2.61% yield. On March 17, Exxon sold $2 billion in debt with a 10-year duration where the premium to U.S. Treasuries was 240 basis points and the yield was 3.482%.
In August last year, Exxon raised $1.25 billion through a 10-year bond with a premium to U.S. Treasuries of just 75 basis points and a yield of 2.44%.
The new issue by Exxon comes as highly rated U.S. companies have been tapping debt markets for cash at a record clip, stocking up on cash due to the uncertainty surrounding the economic impact from coronavirus.
The logic behind Exxon's deal was to stock up further on cash while the market is still open to issuers of new debt, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Exxon's stock has been hammered this year by the collapse in oil prices, with its share price down 38.7% so far in 2020, a steeper fall than the 14.5% drop in the benchmark S&P 500 Index. 
In a regulatory filing, Exxon said it planned to use the proceeds for ""general corporate purposes.""
Oil prices were mixed on Monday, as the historic production-cut deal signed by major global oil producers was not enough to assuage existing worries about the demand destruction brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.

Other companies to issue new debt on Monday included U.S. industrial conglomerate  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co, drug store chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc and movie theater operator Cinemark Holdings Inc.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Stage Stores Inc  (N:SSI) is asking vendors for more time to pay bills and other concessions as the discount department store chain seeks to avoid a bankruptcy filing because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to correspondence seen by Reuters.
""We will require concessions from you, our vendor partners,"" Chief Executive Michael Glazer and Chief Merchandising Officer Thorsten Weber said in an email to vendors on Monday.
""We would not be reaching out to you today if these concession requests were not vital to keeping our company out of Chapter 11.""
Stage Stores closed all its 738 stores and three distribution centers late last month, along with other ""non-essential"" retailers, as part of efforts to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus throughout the United States.
The Houston, Texas-based discount department store operator also furloughed almost all of its store, field support, and distribution center associates, as well as 87% of employees at its Houston support center.
In the email to vendors, Glazer and Weber said the company needed relief on unpaid bills and terms from some vendors demanding faster payments.
The executives also said Stage Store's advisers at investment bank PJ Solomon seeking a restructuring partner to infuse the company with additional money or refinance its debt.
Internally, the company is cutting costs, examining the possible benefits from government bailout packages and requesting lower rent payments from landlords, they said.
Stage Stores did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Following the widespread store closures, retailers including  Ross Stores Inc  (O:ROST) and Macy's Inc (N:M) have had no choice but to cancel orders with suppliers. Some have fallen behind on their payments.
""We are no different, as we ask you to partner with us on existing payables and support us with shipping on new standard terms,"" Glazer and Weber said in the letter, while acknowledging its vendors were also experiencing difficulties.
""We also recognize that with little or no revenue coming in, you have had to make difficult decisions of your own with your teams and your factory partners,"" they said.
Stage Stores said on Monday it had reached an agreement with its lenders that permits the retailer to not have to make repayments on a loan until April 24, unless it defaults or other events occur, according to a filing with regulators.

The Securities and Exchange Commission said https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-88 that Asante Berko arranged the bribes for a Turkish energy company to funnel the money to a Ghana-based intermediary, which then paid the local officials.
The Wall Street Journal reported the news earlier in the day and said that Berko was a former banker at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS).
Goldman Sachs, which was not named in the SEC lawsuit, terminated its involvement with the project after the energy company refused to explain the intermediary firm's role, the report had said https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-goldman-banker-arranged-bribes-to-ghana-officials-sec-says-11586817542?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1. 
""Goldman Sachs fully cooperated with the SEC's investigation and as stated by the SEC in its press release, the firm's compliance personnel took appropriate steps to prevent the firm from participating in the transaction,"" the WSJ report added citing Nicole Sharp, a spokeswoman for Goldman. 
Berko helped the Ghana-based intermediary pay more than $200,000 in bribes to various other government officials, and personally paid more than $60,000 to members of the Ghanaian parliament and other government officials, the SEC statement said, adding that Berko took deliberate measures to prevent his employer from detecting the bribery scheme.
The regulator filed the complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York and is seeking monetary penalties, among other remedies, against Berko.

Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.

(Reuters) - Some large U.S. passenger airlines are close to accepting the terms of a $25 billion offer for government coronavirus payroll aid, with announcements possible as early as Tuesday, people briefed on the matter said.
Airline industry officials expect all major airlines to accept the grants in coming days, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday he expects decisions to come out ""very quickly.""
Brent McIntosh, the Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, told Reuters on Monday the agency was not planning to change the terms laid out on Friday, which require 30% of the funds allotted to each airline to be repaid. 
The U.S. government would also receive warrants equal to 10% of the loan amount.
""We've attempted to come up with an equitable methodology that works for all passenger air carriers, and we don't want to engage in individual negotiations that would require us to make changes across the carriers,"" he said.
Based on wages and benefits in the second and third quarters of 2019,  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) were each eligible for about $6 billion in grants, Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) about $5.6 billion and Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) about $4 billion.
However, one airline official said major carriers may receive only about 75% of the payroll assistance sought because the total amount of funds sought exceeded $25 billion.
Earlier, officials told Reuters all of the large U.S. airlines were increasingly resigned to the terms.
Once they accept, the money could arrive soon.
""We intend to get as much money out as quickly as possible, consistent with our obligation to taxpayers to know that it's going for the right purposes,"" McIntosh said.
U.S. passenger airlines, suffering an unprecedented downturn in demand due to the coronavirus, are also eligible for a separate $25 billion loan package under the CARES Act. 
They had lobbied for the grant portion to be free cash for employee payrolls to prevent layoffs through Sept. 30, helping to ensure a trained staff is on hand for flights to resume and support an economic rebound once consumer sentiment recovers.
American, United, Delta and Southwest have said they were evaluating the aid terms but had no additional comment.
On Sunday, just 90,510 travelers went through U.S. security checkpoints, down from nearly 2.5 million a year earlier.
McIntosh said Treasury arrived at the compensation plan after a substantial analysis that it said shows ""approximately 70% of those payments becomes a direct benefit to taxpayers"" in the form of avoided unemployment benefits, taxes that come back to the federal government, and the benefits of continued air service.
EQUITY STAKES 
Under Treasury's terms, Reuters calculates that the government could end up with about 3% of American, which has the most employees of the U.S. carriers and has said it was seeking about $6 billion in payroll support.
American also has the lowest market capitalization of the four main U.S. carriers at about $5.3 billion, less than the amount it would receive in aid. 
One airline official said the warrant price had been locked before Monday. According to airlines' market capitalization on Friday, the government could end up owning about 2.3% of United, 1% of Delta, 1.3% of JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU), and 0.6% of Southwest.
The calculations assume that each carrier gets the amount it requested and that the government exercises the warrants, which allow purchase of shares at a set price, to the full extent possible. It is likely, however, that the government simply cashes them out by getting the appreciation in share price at a date in future.
The potential equity dilution is lower than many analysts had feared and warrants do not generate any balance sheet debt.
Still, airline shares fell sharply on Monday on disappointment that a portion of the supposed grants would have to be repaid.
Treasury has agreed to allow airlines to continue using any extra funds after Sept. 30 for payroll, people said. Some airlines' payroll costs could decrease given significant voluntary furloughs, early retirements, reduced work hours and an unprecedented reduction in flight schedules.

Treasury is not demanding compensation from small carriers receiving $100 million or less in payroll support. McIntosh said those carriers will receive a form very soon. Once signed, ""they can get money in days,"" he said.

1037,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2020 08:10PM ET</span>","Grubhub, DoorDash, Postmates, Uber Eats are sued over restaurant prices amid pandemic","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - GrubHub, DoorDash, Postmates and Uber Eats were sued on Monday for allegedly exploiting their dominance in restaurant meal deliveries to impose fees that consumers ultimately bear through higher menu prices, including during the coronavirus pandemic.
In a proposed class action filed in Manhattan federal court, three consumers said the defendants violated U.S. antitrust law by requiring that restaurants charge delivery customers and dine-in customers the same price, while imposing ""exorbitant"" fees of 10% to 40% of revenue to process delivery orders.
The consumers, all from New York, said this sticks restaurants with a ""devil's choice"" of charging everyone higher prices as a condition of using the defendants' services.
They said this made it harder to keep tables full even before the pandemic wiped out most dining in restaurants, at least temporarily.
""Plaintiffs bring this claim for relief on behalf of all Americans who would still [like] to enjoy a nice dinner out with their family before defendants make that impossible,"" the complaint said.
 Grubhub Inc  (N:GRUB), whose businesses include Grubhub and Seamless, and  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER), which owns Uber Eats, declined to comment.
DoorDash and Postmates did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a similar request.
The lawsuit seeks triple damages, including for overcharges, since April 14, 2016 for dine-in and delivery customers in the United States at restaurants using the defendants' delivery apps.

The case is Davitashvili et al v Grubhub Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 20-03000.

1038,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2020 08:10PM ET</span>",Asia shares seen higher but economic woes may cap gains,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Asian stocks were set for a modest bounce on Tuesday as U.S. stock futures edged higher, although fears the coronavirus could drag on the global economy for months are likely to temper investor confidence.
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 nudged 0.3% higher, while Nikkei futures pointed to an opening gain of about 70 points.
All eyes will be on China's trade data, to be released on Tuesday, which is expected to show exports tumbling 14% in March from a year ago, as the coronavirus shutters businesses around the world, crippling demand and economic growth.
Indeed, some analysts are saying any optimism over signs the outbreak may be peaking in hard-hit cities is quickly being offset by concerns that it may be awhile yet before businesses recover.
""Signs of the outbreak peaking -- or at least slowing in some regions -- have started to turn the talk to when restrictions on activity can be eased,"" analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said in a note.
""Short of the unlikely near-term event of a vaccine or significant herd immunity, restarting economies...may be challenging,"" the analysts wrote.
Wall Street indexes ended mixed on Monday with the Dow and S&P 500 falling while a 6.2% gain in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares helped the Nasdaq end higher.
In Asia, an expected trade slump in China will reinforce views that the world is headed for a global recession this year, despite an unprecedented burst of stimulus from policymakers in the last two months to shore up growth. 
Many analysts already expect China's economy, the world's second-largest, to have contracted sharply in the March quarter for the first time since at least 1992. China reports its first-quarter gross domestic product data on April 17.
Elsewhere, Britain's finance minister told colleagues the UK economy could shrink by up to 30% this quarter due to the coronavirus lockdown that has shuttered businesses.
In another sign of worries about struggling global demand, oil prices barely reacted to a global deal to cut output by a record amount of nearly 10% of world supply. U.S. crude was up just 39 cents at $22.8, well under its January peak of $63.27.
A skittish market helped gold prices to cling to highs not seen in more than seven years at $1,718.46 an ounce.
In the United States, which has recorded the highest number of casualties from the virus in the world, President Donald Trump said on Monday his administration was close to completing a plan to re-open the U.S. economy, even though some state governors have signalled that the decision on when to restart businesses lay with them.
The dollar continued to extend losses on the back of the U.S. Federal Reserve's massive new lending programme. The dollar index fell 0.105%, while the Japanese yen was flat versus the greenback at 107.68 per dollar. The euro was also little changed against the dollar at $1.0917.

The yield for benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes edged higher to 0.7697%.

1039,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>",Telco shares are surprise losers as lockdown drives internet boom,"By Tom Westbrook and Douglas Busvine
SINGAPORE/BERLIN (Reuters) - As lockdowns worldwide drive a surge in internet use, boosting online sales for businesses as varied as gaming and food delivery, the stocks of internet providers are an unlikely laggard on global markets.
In Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas, a combination of high fixed costs, debt and market disruption has left telcos significantly underperforming the data-hungry businesses their networks carry.
""It's a bit of a surprise,"" said Kasper Elmgreen, equities head at Europe's biggest fund manager, Amundi Asset Management.
""The traditional defensive sectors have played defensive, but telecoms have not really been defensive,"" he said, pointing to price drops more or less in line with European markets.
Globally, a 13% drop in the MSCI world telecommunications services index <.MIWO0TS00PUS> pales in comparison to healthcare <.MIWO0HC00GUS>, down 6%, technology (MIWO0IT00PUS), down 8%, or consumer staples (MIWD0CS00PUS), down 10%.
The poor showing illustrates the difficult dynamics facing carriers, even when their services are more essential than ever.
Around the world, millions of people are confined to their homes and businesses closed as governments restrict movement to halt the spread of the coronavirus which has led to over 113,000 deaths.
That has driven business and entertainment online, but left telcos spending to service surging demand, and, with fixed pricing structures, no quick way to monetise the investment.
At the same time, roaming revenue has dried up as people travel less, and telcos are bracing for a slump in new contracts accompanying a wave of unemployment as businesses shut.
""Because of flat-rate deals, we hardly get any extra revenue if people spend more time surfing or talking on the phone,"" Ralph Dommermuth, chief executive of German telco 1&1  Drillisch  AG (DE:DRIG), told Reuters.
""I can't yet say whether more time being spent in the home office will compensate for revenue losses that will arise because many companies or private individuals have to put off renewing their contracts or can't pay their bills.""

DIVIDEND PRESSURE
The outlook has driven stock drops as investors fret about dividends that have been under pressure for years.
Companies such as AT&T Inc (N:T), which is down 21% this year,  Telefonica  SA (MC:TEF), down 30%, and  MTN Group Ltd  (J:MTNJ) have either matched or outstripped benchmark declines.
 Vodafone  Group PLC (L:VOD), the world's second-biggest mobile operator, last month said data traffic had surged 50%, yet its stock is down 23% - the same as the benchmark index (FTSE).
""Not only do (telcos) have capex for 5G, but they also have debt payments,"" said Tariq Dennison, managing director at GFM Asset Management in Hong Kong. ""So whenever their cashflows fall, their first priority has to be to those bondholders.""
To be sure, the sector is not devoid of defensive characteristics, with the 13% fall in the MSCI world telecoms index comparing to a 16% fall in the broader market (MIWO00000PUS).
Falls have also unearthed bargains, with Dennison saying he took advantage of a dip in China Mobile Ltd's (HK:0941) stock to increase his exposure to a firm with steady income and few debts.
Yet at the same time, firms the telecom infrastructure carries such as Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) have outperformed - leaving network operators behind even as customers flock online.
""I think that trend will strengthen after the crisis,"" said independent telecoms analyst Paul Budde in Brisbane.
""These are engineers digging cables in the ground, not the ponytail guys coming up with all the ideas.""
(GRAPHIC: E-commerce and its carriers diverge - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklvyjqjpgd/Pasted%20image%201586751371173.png)
BRACED FOR DOWNGRADES
Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn), conglomerate  Bouygues  SA (PA:BOUY) and Telia Company AB (ST:TELIA) are among only a few large telcos to delay or reduce dividends or downgrade forecasts due to the virus.
But investors fear more to come.
Moody's Investors Service last week said Caribbean, Central American and Pacific network operator Digicel Group was at heightened risk of defaulting on bonds.
Chairman Denis O'Brien told Reuters debt restructuring would be completed by June, and that revenue was broadly stable.
""The big question is that if people are going to be unemployed, what happens?"" he said. ""Will they be able to have the 50 cents to a dollar a day in surplus cash to spend on telco services?""
Roaming revenue has also all but evaporated as airlines ground planes - erasing some $25 billion in usually reliable cash for telcos, showed data from Juniper Research.
Still, some, like O'Brien, hope the storm will pass and even deliver a future with greater demand for data.
In Australia, Telstra Ltd (AX:TLS) has suspended cost-cutting, handed out free data and halted charging overdue fees. Yet it believes it can meet the bottom of its earnings guidance and its stock has fallen only half as much as the broader market this year.
""They're being a good corporate citizen and that comes at a cost,"" said Bruce Smith, principal and portfolio manager at Alphinity Investment Management in Sydney.
""But demand for their core businesses – mobile and broadband – is very strong and they'll probably come out of this with enhanced reputation and an enhanced market share,"" he said.

""It's a company for the times.""

Readers are flocking to news outlets for information about the pandemic, but ad revenue has still plummeted for many publishers as companies slash marketing budgets and hesitate to have their brands advertised near coronavirus coverage.
News Corp said book publishing sales and revenue from video subscription services would also likely be dented as brick-and-mortar retail stores are shuttered and sporting events that it broadcasts are canceled or postponed.
A representative for Reuters news organization previously said the company has also experienced an impact on advertising revenue. Thomson Reuters Inc, the parent of Reuters News, competes with News Corp's Dow Jones Newswires for financial news customers.

News Corp is seeing an increase in digital paid subscribers for the Wall Street Journal, The Times and The Sunday Times, and in a regulatory filing https:// said it was working to offset some of the anticipated revenue losses by cutting costs, though it did not provide further details.

The brainchild of Vince McMahon, the XFL 2.0 was the second attempt by the World Wrestling Entertainment impresario to provide an NFL alternative to American football fans, the first folding in 2001 after one season.
""Unfortunately, as a new enterprise, we were not insulated from the harsh economic impacts and uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 crisis,"" the XFL said in a statement. ""Accordingly, we have filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.""
The eight-team league began play in February and cancelled the season after five weeks as the spread of the new coronavirus brought the global sporting calendar to a virtual halt.
According to a Delaware court filing made by XFL parent company Alpha Entertainment, the decision to scrap the rest of a season that was scheduled to conclude on April 26 cost the league ""tens of millions of dollars in revenue.""
The announcement that the XFL came three days after media reports said the league was suspending operations and laying off most employees after failing to finish its first season because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The original XFL lasted one season in 2001, but the rebooted league was created to rely less on professional wrestling-type elements and concentrate more on rules aimed at speeding up the game.

Backed by a television deal with FOX, ESPN and ABC, the XFL opened with solid ratings but they declined steadily each week until the coronavirus brought a premature end to the campaign.

Investing.com - The broader market ended the session lower today, although tech shares showed some resilience in late trading, helping the Nasdaq finish in the green.
And some big market players are saying that stocks have already seen the worst of the selling.
If the U.S. avoids a second surge in infections following the restart of the economy, it’s unlikely that the market will make new lows, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategist said in a note today.
The Federal Reserve and Congress have “precluded the prospect of a complete economic collapse,” Goldman said.
Tomorrow the focus will be on earnings reports and “the only thing people will want to hear about is balance sheet/credit line access,” Josh Brown of Ritholtz Wealth Management tweeted.


Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. J.P. Morgan, {{0|Wells Fargo}) Kick off Earnings Season
Earnings season gets underway tomorrow, starting with a pair of big banks before the bell as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) issue results.
Overall, earnings for S&P 500 firms are expected to tumble 10.2% in the first quarter, compared with a Jan. 1 forecast of a 6.3% rise, before plummeting 22.4% in the second quarter as sweeping lockdowns halt business activity and spark furloughs.
""This week will be somewhat of an inkblot test,"" said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade.
""There are multiple ways to read the state of play as earnings roll out, is the downturn fully priced in or is there cause for more downward pressure?""
With the banks, investors should look at provisions set aside for credit losses, which will give insight into the damage to the economy done by the coronavirus, according to Bloomberg.
Analysts are predicting that J.P. Morgan reports a profit of $2.28 per share on revenue of about $29.5 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Wells Fargo is seen earnings 61 cents per share with revenue of about $19.4 billion.
2. J&J, United Airlines Also Report
Banks aren’t the only companies that could give a clearer picture of the Covid-19 impact when reporting results.
Drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) will also issue numbers ahead of trading.
The consensus estimates are for earnings of $2.05 per share and sales of about $19.9 billion.
J&J said in mid-March its supply chain for pharmaceuticals was holding up and it was taking measures of ensure the availability of over-the-counter medications, Briefing.com reported.
After the bell, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) will weigh in. The entire airline industry is in freefall given the sharp reduction in travel.
But major carriers are concerned with the terms of the funds being provided by the federal government, with 30% expected to be repaid and the possibility of the government taking warrants in the companies, Bloomberg reported.
United is expected to report a loss of $2.29 per share for the quarter, with revenue coming in at about $8.4 billion.
3. API Inventories on Tap
Oil prices finally succumbed to selling late today as concerns about whether the OPEC+ agreement to cut about 10 million barrels per day in production would be enough.
The market pretty much ignored a tweet by President Donald Trump saying that the real amount cut would be closer to 20 million barrels.
After the bell tomorrow, the American Petroleum Institute will report its measure of U.S. oil inventories, giving traders a glimpse into the extent of the demand destruction.
Last month the API reported a rise in crude stockpiles of nearly 12 million barrels."
1045,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2020 04:05PM ET</span>",Your Money: Get aid or go bust? Small businesses face dilemma,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sara Pauly is not one of those small business owners scrambling to fill out paperwork for part of the more than $350 billion in government aid available through the Paycheck Protection Program or the Economic Injury Disaster Loan. 
Instead, the owner of the Rufus and Delilah pet care business in Los Angeles is scaling back her operation for now. 
""I have decided to float the business with a personal loan in order to stay afloat and not declare bankruptcy. Hopefully, I will not have to do this for too many months. If so, I may need to re-evaluate my decision,"" Pauly said. 
Many small business owners are in a similar situation, where even an influx of relief cash will not help them stay afloat. The dilemma they face is whether to seek aid or close up, often by going bankrupt. 
Since small businesses often are tied into the lives of their owners, personal finances are on the line, too. Many owners mix personal and business expenses on their credit cards and use a house or other personal assets as collateral. 
While there are plenty of ways for owners to forestall catastrophe, like negotiating rent or mortgage delays, some businesses just do not have the cash flow to keep things going.
""Business bankruptcies go hand-in-hand with personal bankruptcy,"" said Carl Peterson, vice president of small firms at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
The first step is to do the math, and that will mean an immediate call to your accountant, if you have one. Ask: ""What is my revenue drop? What will it be in the next three to six months? What will my fixed costs be? What deferments can I get?"" 
""Then you have to figure out if that gap is going to be too large to recover from,"" said Ian Weinberg, a certified financial planner in Woodbury, New York. 
Weinberg noted that for now programs like the Paycheck Protection Program cover just a few months of payroll. One of his clients is a dermatologist with his own practice - if the shutdown lasts too long, he may have to close down and go work for a hospital system. 
""He won't stop being a doctor, but he won't be employing people anymore,"" Weinberg said. 
PHASE OUT
Once you have assessed your cash flow, look at your solvency, says Scot Bishop, a certified public accountant and financial planner in Houston. For instance, a restaurateur with a loan coming due in May will have trouble refinancing.
""It's very important who owns the liability on your obligations,"" Bishop said, noting that if you have personally guaranteed the rent or a loan, your own finances will be dragged down, too. 
This is the stage to bring in a business attorney, to sort out either how to ramp down the business legally, or go into bankruptcy. 
If you are a one-person shop, you ""can go away with minimal effort,"" said Kashif Ahmed, a certified financial planner in Bedford, Massachusetts. One of Ahmed's clients put his business in hibernation for now. 
If you have employees or other obligations like a lease, insurance or inventory, then it gets more complicated. 
Anyone with a business structure like an LLC or an S Corporation needs a lawyer to do the proper filing to cease business operations, said Simon Hughes, a business attorney in Houston. Otherwise, you risk being sued by creditors, and you also risk your future business prospects. 
Litigation is what brings bankruptcy to a head. ""If there is potentially going to be a big judgment against the entity, then bankruptcy is the only way to put a stop to it,"" Hughes said. 
Otherwise, you may be able to negotiate a settlement with creditors, because they realize that it is better to recover something like 70% of what is owed than risk what they will get from a judge. 
If your business is so small that you do not have an accountant and a business lawyer on tap, there are resources available from the Small Business Association, said AICPA's Peterson. 
Services like Rocket Lawyer provide bankruptcy worksheets for free (https://www.rocketlawyer.com/document/bankruptcy-worksheet.rl#/), but this is not a very do-it-yourself pursuit. 

""While business owners are legally permitted to represent themselves from start to finish, that doesn’t mean being their own bankruptcy lawyer is a good idea,"" said Charley Moore, an attorney and founder and CEO of Rocket Lawyer.

Investing.com – Wall Street ended Monday off session lows, supported by strength in tech, but investor sentiment remained fragile amid worries companies are set to deliver a wave of gloomy earnings.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4%, or 328 points, but was down as many as 624 points at the lows of the day. The S&P 500 lost 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.48%.
With just a day to go until Wall Street banks kick off the first-quarter earnings season in earnest, investors appear to be bracing for earnings and guidance that will likely underscore the material impact to growth from the Covid-19 pandemic.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) get the first-quarter earnings season underway in earnings with results on Tuesday
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) report on Wednesday, with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) expected to report later this week.
The earnings arrive against a backdrop of growing optimism that some parts of the U.S. under lockdown may soon snap back into operation at a time when some Covid-19 hotspots like New York State are showing signs that the worst of the outbreak has passed.
""I think you can say the worst is over,"" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said, but he stressed lockdown measures, including social distancing, would need to continue to avoid jeopardizing the progress seen so far.
Intensive care unit admissions and the three-day hospitalization average continue to drop, Cuomo added, as total cases topped 195,000 and deaths passed the 10,000 mark.
The New York governor also joined several of his counterparts from New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Delaware to support the government's plans to reopen the economy.
President Donald Trump said in a tweet Monday that the decision to restart the economy would be made ""shortly"".
The losses in the broader market, meanwhile, were limited by a rise in tech stocks, led by a surge in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) as investors bet the surge in consumers will not disappear after coronavirus pandemic is over.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), meanwhile, surged 6% to close near all-time highs after Canaccord Genuity raised its price target on the stock to $2,600 from $2,500. The brokerage expects that higher margins in Amazon's cloud business will help offset rising fulfillment costs as the e-commerce giant has seen a surge in demand for household essentials and groceries in the wake of the ongoing pandemic.   
Energy stocks, meanwhile, were pressured by a fall from session highs in oil prices as investors shrugged off coordinated oil production cuts from major producers as the 10 million barrel per day cut agreement will not offset the coronavirus-led loss of demand of around 20 million bpd.
Industrials fell nearly 3%, paced by an 8.7% decline in  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) after Bank of America downgraded the stock to underperform from neutral. The bank expressed worries the hit to the energy and mining sectors from the coronavirus would hurt the heavy-equipment maker's results."

1048,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>",Athene pays $45 million fine in first settlement of New York pension transfer probe,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Athene Holding Ltd agreed on Monday to pay a $45 million civil fine to settle charges it conducted insurance business in New York without a license, the first settlement in a probe into an industry where life insurers take over corporate pension plans.
Linda Lacewell, superintendent of New York's Department of Financial Services, said Athene's unlicensed Athene Annuity & Life unit conducted 14 large pension risk transfer transactions covering tens of thousands of policy holders, and engaged in thousands of unauthorized communications with plan sponsors.
""Protection of New Yorkers' retirement plans is more important than ever in this vulnerable economy,"" Lacewell said in a statement. ""Unlicensed insurance activity puts retirement assets at risk and that's why we won't tolerate it.""
In a typical pension risk transfer, a life insurer takes on a pension plan's assets and liabilities, and writes a group annuity contract obligating it to pay participants.
The insurer is essentially betting it will make more on investments than it pays out. 
Athene issues, reinsures and acquires retirement savings products such as annuities.
As part of the settlement, it will move the handling of pension risk transfers to a licensed New York-based unit from Athene Annuity & Life.
The alleged wrongdoing occurred from 2017 to January 2019.
Athene cooperated with the probe. In a statement it said it was pleased to settle, and that participants it covers will continue receiving all contractual payments and benefits.
Pension risk transfers have existed since at least the 1920s, but rising interest rates and stock market gains in recent years had made them more common.

Lacewell said the pension risk transfer market has about 15 insurers, and most transactions involve partial buyouts of retirees' long-term benefits.

Penney Co. has tapped the consulting firm AlixPartners LLP for advice as the retail chain mulls options for managing its approximately $4 billion debt load amid shrinking revenue, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
J.C. Penney has been in conversations with its banks in recent weeks about their liquidity needs, and has been in on-and-off negotiations with lenders about a possible debt deal, said the people, who are not authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be named discussing private information.
The firm joins a roster of advisers helping J.C. Penney navigate its obstacles. The retailer is also working with restructuring advisers from the law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP and investment bank Lazard Ltd., Bloomberg previously reported. A representative for J.C. Penney declined to comment on the latest hire.
Retailers still do the bulk of their business at their physical locations. The lockdown now in effect to prevent the spread of the coronavirus puts retailers at risk of missing an entire season or more of business. That may leave them holding merchandise that has dropped in value.
Last month, J.C. Penney disclosed that it ended talks with one creditor after failing to reach an agreement but would continue discussions about its capital structure. The company also drew $1.25 billion of its $2.35 billion revolving credit line to shore up financing during coronavirus-related market upheavals.
A solution is critical for the beleaguered department-store chain, which said it was extending its temporary store and office closings and furloughing most store workers as it fights to conserve cash. The chain added that it is “evaluating other financial options.”

Investing.com – The impact from the coronavirus pandemic has many companies facing uncertain futures, but Amazon isn’t one of them. The e-commerce giant has enjoyed a jump in demand as customers rush to buy essentials amid government-imposed lockdown measures worldwide.
Canaccord Genuity raised its price target on Amazon to $2,600 from $2,500, sending Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) about 5% higher.
Amazon has seen an increase in demand as panic buying for household essentials and groceries continues to sweep through the globe in the wake of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
“We continue to see increased demand as our teams support their communities, and are going to continue to hire, creating an additional 75,000 jobs to help serve customers during this unprecedented time,” Amazon said. 
The increase in orders, however, is expected to ramp up Amazon's fulfillment costs in the first half of the year, Canaccord said. But ""increased pricing power"" from its cloud business will likely boost margins and offset the anticipated rise in costs, it added.
Amazon is up about 16% for the year."
1051,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2020 02:30PM ET</span>",McDonald's faces class action over 'pervasive sexual harassment',"By Brendan Pierson
(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) has been hit with a class action lawsuit accusing it of subjecting female employees in its corporate-owned fast-food restaurants in Florida to widespread sexual harassment.
The lawsuit, filed on Friday in federal court in Chicago, says the company fostered a climate of ""severe or pervasive sexual harassment and a hostile work environment, including groping, physical assaults, and sexually-charged verbal comments.""
McDonald's said in a statement that it was committed to ensuring workers were not subject to sexual harassment.
""The plaintiffs' allegations of harassment and retaliation were investigated as soon as they were brought to our attention, and we will likewise investigate the new allegations that they have raised in their complaint,"" it said.
The plaintiffs, McDonald's employee Jamelia Fairley and former employee Ashley Reddick, are seeking to represent a class of female employees of Florida's more than 100 corporate-owned, non-franchise McDonald's locations. They are asking for $500 million in compensatory damages and additional punitive damages.
Fairley and Reddick said in their complaint that McDonald's failed to provide training to prevent sexual harassment and shuffled serial harassers from one location to another without consequence.
""McDonald's strategy in Florida appears to be: deny, ignore, and punish anyone who complains too loudly, and at times, move harassers from one restaurant to another restaurant, where they have access to and can further harass more women,"" they said.
Reddick worked at a Sanford, Florida, McDonald's restaurant from 2015 until 2018, when she was fired for reporting unwanted sexual comments and touching by a male coworker, the complaint said. Fairley was harassed by two male coworkers while working at the same store, beginning in 2018, according to the complaint.
Management knew of the harassment of both women but failed to take appropriate action, the lawsuit said.
Sexual harassment allegations have plagued McDonald's since 2016, when it first faced a wave of complaints filed with the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission.
McDonald's also faces another class action in Michigan, as well as individual lawsuits.
About 95% of McDonald's U.S. restaurants are run by franchisees rather than by McDonald's itself. The company has argued that it cannot be held responsible for harassment in its franchise restaurants, and a federal appeals court in California agreed with that view last year.
Friday's lawsuit, however, concerns only corporate-owned stores.

Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook was fired last November for having an improper consensual relationship with an employee, though he was not accused of harassment.

1053,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 13, 2020 02:27PM ET</span>",What to Watch for When U.S. Banks Deliver Look at Virus Impact,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors in U.S. banks get their first look this week at how the coronavirus pandemic will impact the biggest firms’ loan-loss provisions, trading revenue and guidance for full-year earnings.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co., Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). will report earnings this week, as will investment banks  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). Smaller regional lenders follow next week. Shareholders will be paying close attention to how the companies are managing their balance sheets, given the pain Covid-19 is causing for households, businesses, markets and the overall economy.
At banks’ consumer units, the amount of provisions set aside for credit losses will give a sense of how severely the economic turmoil will impact individuals. For some firms, one bright spot could be an increase in trading revenue from high volumes due to market volatility. For others, that could be overshadowed by markdowns of debt they held as spreads widened.
Any insight into banks’ expectations for the remaining quarters of 2020 will also be watched closely, along with any signs that U.S. banks might follow their European counterparts in cutting dividend payments.
Here are five things investors and strategists will be looking at:
Loss Provisions
With people staying at home, spending less and, in some cases, losing their jobs, banks’ credit-card and consumer-lending businesses are expected to take a hit. First-quarter results from the nation’s four largest consumer banks will probably show an overall drop in loans and a jump in bad debt, leading to an increase in credit-loss provisions.
Until the beginning of this year, banks had come to rely on their consumer units as a steady source of profit, but high rates of unemployment will make it hard for many people to keep up with their bills. Top lenders may have to set aside as much as $164 billion in loss provisions this year, according to analysts’ estimates.
At the same time, banks are grappling with a new accounting rule that requires them to recognize loan losses more quickly. The rule, known as CECL, means that buybacks for the rest of 2020 will be nearly impossible, given the capital requirements needed to support potential loan losses.
The recently passed federal coronavirus relief legislation allows banks to delay CECL implementation until the end of 2020, but most banks are expected to proceed with it this quarter, according to a report Monday from Fitch Ratings Inc.
The adoption of CECL “will magnify the impact of the sharp economic contraction as a result of the coronavirus pandemic on U.S. lenders’ 1Q20 financial results and exacerbate an already complex outlook for lenders’ credit losses,” Fitch said in the report.
Trading Revenues
When it comes to trading, there will likely be winners and losers this quarter, with some banks benefiting from high equity volumes and others stuck with high-yield bonds and leveraged loans.
Another challenge is that many traders have been working from home, and a disjointed work environment can impact information flow and cause divergences in decision-making, according to UBS Group AG analyst Brennan Hawken.
Goldman Investing
Unlike its peers, Goldman Sachs has a large investment portfolio across its asset-management and merchant-banking business. While that’s helped drive some of the firm’s most profitable results, the company is also particularly exposed to market gyrations.
The firm’s annual 10-K filing estimates that a $4.2 billion reduction in net revenue would result from a 10% decline across the value of its equity and debt positions. Goldman has a $22 billion equity portfolio, with about 90% of it in private equity.
But it won’t be all doom and gloom in that unit. In February, the firm announced the largest-ever private real estate transaction in the U.K., the sale of a student-housing business to Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group Inc. Goldman is expected to record a handsome profit from that deal when it’s completed.
2020 Guidance
Any indication of expected results for the remaining three quarters of 2020 will be of interest to nervous investors eager to understand the longer-term impacts of the pandemic.
Changes to annual forecasts will provide insight into how banks expect the economy to perform for the rest of 2020 as well as the effect of record-low interest rates. Updates to loan-loss provision forecasts for the second quarter are also of interest because stay-at-home orders are still in effect in many states through April and into May and potentially longer.
Dividends
In Europe, banks including UBS Group AG,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG and  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) are taking capital-preserving measures including suspending or halting dividends, as well as making changes to management bonuses.
The biggest U.S. banks have already halted share buybacks to allow them to boost lending, and dividends make up a much smaller part of capital returns to investors than buybacks, according to Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer David Solomon.
U.S. bank CEOs have largely dismissed the idea of halting dividends, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last week he sees no reason why the country’s lenders need to suspend dividends at this time. That said, investors will still be looking for any indication of additional measures being considered by the banks.

1054,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2020 02:25PM ET</span>",Amazon stops accepting new online grocery customers amid surging demand,"By Krystal Hu
(Reuters) - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will begin to put new grocery delivery customers on a wait list and curtail shopping hours at some Whole Foods stores to prioritize orders from existing customers buying food online during the coronavirus outbreak, the company said on Sunday.
Many shoppers recently seeking to purchase groceries from the Seattle-based ​e-commerce company found they could not place orders due to a lack of available delivery slots. Amazon said it would have to relegate all new online grocery customers to a wait list starting Monday while working on adding capacity each week. 
In recent weeks, it increased the number of Whole Foods stores offering grocery pickup ​to more than 150 locations, up from 80 previously. 
Amazon ​also plans to shorten some Whole Foods stores' hours for the public so its employees can more quickly fulfill online grocery orders, the company said. 
The moves illustrates how the world's largest online retailer, which showed its ambition to enter the grocery industry by acquiring Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in August 2017, is now leveraging its presence both online and in physical stores to handle high demand from consumers who are stuck eating at home, with many restaurant dining rooms closed to the public. 
Amazon offers grocery delivery services Amazon Fresh and Amazon Prime Now from its own warehouses and Whole Foods stores. It typically touts ultra-fast delivery within hours, ​with shoppers able to choose a delivery window. Last month, Amazon temporarily suspended the Prime Pantry delivery service, which sells non-perishable groceries. 
Amazon said its online grocery order capacity has increased by more than 60% during the outbreak. Some netizens who said they used Amazon Prime, its $119-a-year subscription service for U.S. shoppers, have nevertheless complained on social media about the scarcity of delivery windows. 
The company said it is hiring more workers to expand capacity and that it plans to launch a new feature that will help customers secure a virtual ""place in line"" to distribute the delivery windows on a first come, first served basis. It also offered higher pay to encourage its warehouse workers to work for its grocery delivery service.
Currently, Amazon runs 487 Whole Foods stores in the United States. These stores have been limiting the number of customers allowed at once, and Amazon has said it conducts daily employee temperature checks and sends masks and gloves to protect workers.

The first store of Amazon's much-anticipated new grocery chain, which is scheduled to open this year in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, has been temporarily transitioned into a warehouse for online orders, the company said.
Still, some employees at Whole Foods and Amazon warehouses have protested the company is not doing enough to protect them, in demonstrations that gained attention from lawmakers and unions. Over 50 Amazon fulfillment centers and several Whole Foods stores had confirmed COVID-19 cases, according to multiple reports.
""We still expect the combination of restricted capacity due to social distancing and customer demand will continue to make finding available delivery windows challenging for customers,"" Stephenie Landry, vice president of Grocery at Amazon, wrote in a blogpost. ""If you are able to do so safely, we kindly encourage our customers who can to shop in-person.""

(Reuters) - Dish Network Corp (O:DISH) has cut staff and is re-evaluating its business to cope better with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. satellite TV provider told Reuters, without disclosing the number of employees laid off. 
Shares of the company moved lower after Reuters reported the move, and were last down 4.8% at $21.97 in late morning trading.
""The pandemic has forced us to take a closer look at every aspect of our business, at our work volumes, our areas of focus and investments, and the performance of our team members,"" Chief Executive Officer Erik Carlson told employees in an internal memo, which was seen by Reuters late Sunday.
""I want you to hear directly from me that we've made a series of difficult decisions to reevaluate parts of our business, particularly within In Home Services,"" he added.
The company had 16,000 employees as of December 31. 
Dish has struggled to retain pay-TV subscribers as it repositions itself as a wireless phone carrier, as customers are shifting to online streaming services including those from Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS).
The latest move from Dish, which had not disclosed any coronavirus impact till date, indicates the challenges ahead for the company as it vies for a share in the 5G race.
The company stands to benefit from the merger of T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS) and Sprint Corp, as the combined wireless company is expected to sell off certain assets to Dish making it the fourth-largest provider in the U.S. wireless space.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Monday it is producing face masks at a Michigan plant to protect its workers from the coronavirus pandemic and is seeking to have those masks certified for medical use.
The automaker said the masks are being made at its Van Dyke transmission plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan, and were developed in collaboration with the United Auto Workers union. 
Ford executive Adrian Price said Ford will need a ""surge"" of protective equipment for employees as it restarts operations, which the company has said it plans to do during the current quarter. Long-term, however, Ford does not intend to stay in the business of producing medical equipment or competing with incumbent suppliers such as 3M (NYSE:MMM), Ford Vice President Jim Baumbick said during a conference call on Monday.
Ford also said it is using its high-volume manufacturing and supply chain capability to help Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) to increase production of COVID-19 collection kits, using plastic bottles suitable for field testing.
The automaker said it is also working with supplier Joyson Safety Systems to manufacture reusable gowns from airbag materials. 
The No. 2 U.S. automaker had previously announced that it will make air-purifying respirators in consultation with 3M Co. Ford said production of those respirators will start on Tuesday at a plant near Flat Rock, Michigan. 

Demand for respirators and other medical equipment is ""greatly exceeding supply,"" 3M executive Mike Kesti said during a conference call on Monday.

Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said premiums paid for the months of March, April and potentially May, should be returned for six insurance lines - passenger and commercial auto, workers' compensation, commercial multi-peril, commercial liability and medical malpractice.
The order also includes other insurance lines facing the risk of loss as a result of the pandemic.
Major U.S. insurers are already offering credit to auto and motorcycle policyholders following a decline in driving, as most Americans stay at home under widespread orders to help contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.
""With Californians driving fewer miles and many businesses closed due to the COVID-19 emergency, consumers need relief from premiums that no longer reflect their present-day risk of accident or loss,"" Lara said http://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2020/release038-2020.cfm. 
""Today's mandatory action will put money back in people's pockets when they need it most."" 
As part of the order, insurance companies are required to provide a premium credit, cut, return of premium, or other ""appropriate premium adjustments"" as soon as possible, and no later than August.
Insurers collect $310 billion in premiums annually in California, according to the state's insurance department, the largest consumer protection agency in California.

Investing.com – The Dow remained firmly in the red on Monday as investors weighed the latest efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic against hopes the economy could reopen sooner rather than later.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.71%, or 405 points, but had been as low as 624 points at the lows of the day. The S&P 500 lost 1.50%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.3%.
Stoking hopes that some parts of U.S. under lockdown may soon snap back into operation, President Donald Trump said in a tweet Monday that the decision to restart the economy would be made ""shortly"".
The tweet came as U.S. deaths from the coronavirus pandemic topped 20,000, surpassing that of Italy, which had been the epicenter of the global outbreak.
But in New York state there were growing signs that lockdown measures, including social distance, are flattening the curve of infections.
Intensive care unit admissions and the three-day hospitalization average continue to drop, according to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.
The governor also said he wants to reopen nonessential businesses and public places ""as soon as possible,"" but stressed any reopening measures would require careful examination as any action taken in haste risked another wave of infections.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, were pressured by a fall from session highs in oil prices as investors shrugged off coordinated oil production cuts from major producers as the 10 million barrel per day cut agreement will not offset the coronavirus-led loss of demand of around 20 million bpd.

Underwriter Raymond James Financial Inc. estimates that as many as 200 new negotiated state and local debt offerings will price over the next few days, almost double the amount issued last week, fixed-income strategist Kevin Giddis said in a note to clients.
That would mark a turnaround for a segment of the capital markets that had virtually shut down after concerns about the coronavirus prompted a series of steep sell-offs last month when investors pulled out their funds. The market has since been steadied, with the Federal Reserve last month moving to increase liquidity for money-market funds and last week rolling out a plan to lend as much as $500 billion to states and local governments to help them avoid a cash crunch in the middle of the pandemic.
Since March 9, there have only been about $15 billion of new municipal bonds issued, a drop of 56% from the same period a year earlier. Many big sales have been placed on so-called day-to-day status, meaning underwriters will sell them when market conditions warrant.
“This improvement in issuance is largely due to the Fed and Treasury’s unprecedented support for these markets and it appears to be working,” Giddis wrote.

(Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said on Monday it expects to post a pre-tax loss of about $600 million for the first quarter as the coronavirus outbreak pummeled its sales and shuttered vehicle assembly plants, resulting in a 21% drop in vehicle sales to dealers versus the same quarter in 2019.
The news sent Ford's shares down more than 5% in morning trading.
Only Ford’s joint ventures in China, where the COVID-19 pandemic has been receding, are currently producing vehicles. The automaker said it is working on a scenario for a phased restart of its manufacturing plants beginning in the second quarter. 
""However, we believe we have sufficient cash today to get us through at least the end of the third quarter with no incremental vehicle production and wholesales or financing actions,"" Chief Financial Officer Tim Stone said in a statement.
Asked whether Ford would apply for loans from the U.S. government or the Federal Reserve to sustain its operations for longer if needed, a spokesman for the automaker said that unlike during the Great Recession - when financing dried up - there is still plenty of liquidity in the capital markets.
""We have a broad range of options"" for obtaining additional financing if needed, the spokesman said.
As of April 9, Ford said it had about $30 billion in cash on its balance sheet, including $15.4 billion it borrowed last month against two existing credit lines.
Ford said any decisions on restarting its plants will be made ""in cooperation with local unions, suppliers, dealers and other stakeholders.""
In March, the company shuttered plants in North America and Europe due to the spreading pandemic. 
Earlier this month, the No. 2 U.S. automaker said its first-quarter U.S. sales had fallen 12.5% during the quarter. The U.S. market, with its highly profitable pickup truck and SUV segments, generates the overwhelming majority of Ford's profits.
Ford's U.S. sales chief Mark LaNeve said on April 2 that Ford believes some level of government stimulus will be needed for American consumers once the COVID-19 pandemic recedes. 
Ford said it expects its first-quarter adjusted loss before interest and taxes to be about $600 million, compared with a profit of $2.4 billion a year ago.
The company said it expects to report revenue of about $34 billion for the quarter.

In morning trade, Ford shares were down 30 cents, or 5.6%, at $5.09.

The U.S. industrial conglomerate last week pulled its full-year forecast due to the uncertainties created by the coronavirus outbreak, but backed its first-quarter industrial free cash flow expectation of near-negative $2 billion.
GE has repaid $6 billion of its intercompany loan to finance arm GE Capital on April 1 using funds from the biopharma proceeds, it said on Monday.
The company's total borrowings stood at $90.9 billion as of Dec. 31.
GE Capital launched a tender targeting up to $9 billion of debt maturing in 2020, GE said, using the repayment amount. The unit also repaid $4.7 billion of debt that matured in the first quarter of 2020.
GE, which makes jet engines, power plants and other industrial equipment, last month sold its biopharma business to Danaher Corp (N:DHR) to focus on its core aviation and power businesses.
GE held cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of more than $47 billion as of March 31.

The company said that it was launching a strategic debt issuance to fund an immediate tender for GE bonds maturing through 2024, and has also refinanced a back-up credit facility that expires in 2021.

MADRID (Reuters) - Employees at global fashion giant  Inditex  (MC:ITX)'s 10 logistics centres in Spain - from where it sends garments to its stores worldwide - returned to work on Monday but only to less than half their normal levels of activity, workers said.
Meanwhile, just three of Inditex's 13 Spanish factories were back at work, making medical supplies like scrubs to help fight Spain's coronavirus crisis, with no garments being made for now for brands like Zara and Bershka, a union representative said.
Spain loosened on Monday the terms of a strict lockdown, brought into force to halt the spread of one of the deadliest outbreaks of the virus worldwide, allowing non-essential workers to return to their jobs after a two-week hiatus.
Staff at the Inditex logistics centres returned to work but at reduced schedules - either working half-days or just two or three shifts a week - to reduce contact between employees, a union representative and a worker said.
Rather than entering the facilities all at once, shift workers had staggered entries and exits and wore masks and gloves while maintaining two metre distances from colleagues, they said.
Just 15% of normal activity was maintained at one of Inditex's 13 Spanish sewing factories, one worker said, focused on maintenance of machines rather than production of clothes.
Inditex did not respond to a request for comment.
The Massimo Dutti owner does not disclose the proportion of its fashions made in Spain, but it sources 57% from factories near its Spanish headquarters - mostly in Spain, Portugal, Turkey and Morocco - so it can respond quickly to trends.
Inditex said in its annual results on March 18 that it had temporarily closed 3,785 stores worldwide. That would leave around half of its shops still open.
Its fashion brands are currently offering discounts on their websites with items like a Zara oversize printed dress reduced by 45% to 15.99 euros ($17.46) and a Massimo Dutti cashmere sweater reduced by 30% to 69.95 euros as the company seeks to shift unsold stock.
It is offering free delivery for online orders and has extended return times to 30 days after the reopening of stores.

Inditex said at the time of its annual results that it would book a provision of 287 million euros against the outbreak's impact on its spring/summer inventory position.

The company, which suspended its share repurchase program, said it drew $400 million from a $3 billion credit facility to strengthen its balance sheet.
Performance Food also said it had furloughed about 3,000 employees and deferred 25% of senior management's base pay and the board's fee through the year to protect its long-term financial position.
""There are other decisions that are difficult for any company to make, but necessary during challenging times,"" Chief Executive Officer George Holm said in a statement.
The pandemic, which has left over 22,000 dead in the United States, has created panic among consumers as they rush to supermarkets to stock up everyday essentials and canned foods amid lockdowns called by several states.

The company has about 100 distribution centers across the country and caters to independent and chain restaurants, retailers, theaters, convenience stores among others.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank expects its $100 billion Vision Fund to book a loss of 1.8 trillion yen due to the worsening performance of its tech bets, which will tip the group as a whole into its first loss for 15 years. 
A third consecutive quarter of losses by the Saudi Arabian-backed fund will push SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) to an annual operating loss of 1.35 trillion yen ($12.5 billion), it said in a statement on Monday.
The fund's dire performance, which SoftBank attributed to ""the deteriorating market environment"" as markets are hammered by the coronavirus crisis, is a major blow to CEO Masayoshi Son's attempts to revive his reputation among investors.
SoftBank's finances are being squeezed after a disastrous bet on co-working firm WeWork and souring portfolio bets on startups that have sacked workers as the outlook has darkened.
The coronavirus pandemic has undermined predictions by Son, who just two months ago said ""the tide is turning"" and pointed to recovery at WeWork, forcing him into a major sell down of core assets to raise cash. 
SoftBank did not disclose which Vision Fund tech bets were being marked down in the fourth quarter. 
Activist investor Elliott Management wants greater transparency at the fund, whose nebulous valuations have contributed to the group's persistent conglomerate discount. 
The tech conglomerate said it would book an 800 billion yen loss on investments outside the fund including in WeWork and satellite operator OneWeb, which last month filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after SoftBank declined to provide further funding, contributing to a net loss of 750 billion yen.
SoftBank sees sales falling 36% after the deconsolidation of wireless carrier Sprint, which merged with T-Mobile US (O:TMUS). 
The group's shares, which are down by 11.7% this year, closed down 3.4% ahead of the announcement.

Last month, SoftBank announced its largest ever buyback to prop up the value of its shares, which have been pledged by Son as collateral for loans.

1077,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2020 08:59AM ET</span>","'Elbow to elbow:' North America meat plant workers fall ill, walk off jobs","By Tom Polansek and Rod Nickel
CHICAGO/WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - At a Wayne Farms chicken processing plant in Alabama, workers recently had to pay the company 10 cents a day to buy masks to protect themselves from the new coronavirus, according to a meat inspector. 
In Colorado, nearly a third of the workers at a JBS USA beef plant stayed home amid safety concerns for the last two weeks as a 30-year employee of the facility died following complications from the virus. 
And since an Olymel pork plant in Quebec shut on March 29, the number of workers who tested positive for the coronavirus quintupled to more than 50, according to their union. The facility and at least 10 others in North America have temporarily closed or reduced production in about the last two weeks because of the pandemic, disrupting food supply chains that have struggled to keep pace with surging demand at grocery stores.
According to more than a dozen interviews with U.S and Canadian plant workers, union leaders and industry analysts, a lack of protective equipment and the nature of ""elbow to elbow"" work required to debone chickens, chop beef and slice hams are highlighting risks for employees and limiting output as some forego the low-paying work. Companies that added protections, such as enhanced cleaning or spacing out workers, say the moves are further slowing meat production.
Smithfield Foods, the world’s biggest pork processor, on Sunday said it is shutting a pork plant indefinitely and warned that plant shutdowns are pushing the United States “perilously close to the edge” in meat supplies for grocers.
Lockdowns that aim to stop the spread of the coronavirus have prevented farmers across the globe from delivering produce to consumers. Millions of laborers also cannot get to the fields for harvesting and planting, and there are too few truckers to keep goods moving.
The United States and Canada are among the world's biggest shippers of beef and pork. Food production has continued as governments try to ensure adequate supplies, even as they close broad swathes of the economy. 
The closures and increased absenteeism among workers have contributed to drops in the price of livestock, as farmers find fewer places for slaughter. Since March 25, nearby lean hog futures have plunged 35%, and live cattle prices shed 15%, straining the U.S. farm economy. 
North American meat demand has dropped some 30% in the past month as declining sales of restaurant meats like steaks and chicken wings outweighed a spike in retail demand for ground beef, said Christine McCracken, Rabobank's animal protein analyst. 
Frozen meats in U.S. cold storage facilities remain plentiful, but supply could be whittled down as exports to protein-hungry China increase after a trade agreement removed obstacles for American meat purchases. 
""There's a huge risk of additional plant closures,"" McCracken said. 
JBS had to reduce beef production at a massive plant in Greeley, Colorado, as about 800 to 1,000 workers a day stayed home since the end of March, said Kim Cordova, president of the local United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union that represents employees. 
""There's just not enough people,"" Cordova said. She added that the union knew of at least 50 cases and two deaths among employees as of Friday.
Plant worker Saul Sanchez, known affectionately as ""grandpa"" among some co-workers, tested positive for the virus and died on April 7 at 78 years old, according to his daughter, Beatriz Rangel. She said he only went from home to work before developing symptoms, including a low fever.
""I'm heartbroken because my dad was so loyal,"" Rangel said.
Brazilian owned JBS confirmed an employee with three decades of experience died from complications associated with COVID-19, without naming Sanchez. The company said he had not been at work since March 20, the same day JBS removed people older than 70 from its facilities as a precaution. He was never symptomatic while at work and never worked in the facility while sick, according to the company.
JBS said it was working with federal and state governments to obtain tests for all plant employees. 
Weld County, where the plant is located, had the fourth highest number of COVID-19 cases of any county in Colorado on Friday, according to the state. Health officials confirmed cases among JBS workers.
JBS said high absenteeism at the plant led slaughter rates to outpace the process of cutting carcasses into pieces of beef. The company disputed the union's numbers on worker absences but did not provide its own. It took steps including buying masks and putting up plexiglass shields in lunch rooms to protect employees, said Cameron Bruett, spokesman for JBS USA.
""MY LIFE IS IN JEOPARDY"" 
At Wayne Farms' chicken plant in Decatur, Alabama, some workers are upset the company recently made employees pay for masks, said Mona Darby, who inspects chicken breasts there and is a local leader of hundreds of poultry workers for the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.
""My life is in jeopardy because we're working elbow to elbow,"" she said.
Wayne Farms, with annual sales exceeding $2 billion, is trying to obtain masks to distribute to employees, though supplies are limited, spokesman Frank Singleton said. He said he did not know of any instances where employees were charged for masks.
Workers at a  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) chicken plant in Shelbyville, Tennessee, bought their own masks when the facility ran out, said Kim Hickerson, who loads chicken on trucks there and is a union leader. Some are talking about quitting because they are scared of getting sick, he said.
""I just put it in God's hands,"" he said.
Tyson, the top U.S. meat producer, is working to find more personal protective equipment for employees, spokesman Worth Sparkman said. The company increased cleaning at facilities and sought to space out employees, which can both slow production, according to a statement.
Workers have lost their trust in Olymel after an outbreak of the coronavirus closed a plant in Yamachiche, Quebec, according to union spokeswoman Anouk Collet. ""They do not feel that the company took all the measures they could have taken to keep them safe,"" she said. 
Company spokesman Richard Vigneault said the plant will reopen on Tuesday with new measures in place, such as separating panels, masks and visors.
Marc Perrone, international president of the UFCW union, said meat plant workers are increasingly weighing concerns about their own safety and their responsibility to produce food. 

""If we don't take care of the food supply, the American people are going to panic,"" he said.

The loaner cars, typically offered to customers to drive while their vehicles are in a shop for repairs, can be called upon for delivering food to a local food bank, transporting masks and gowns, and dropping off necessary items to those who are unable to leave their home, the automaker said.

1079,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 13, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",Fear of an Impending Car-Price Collapse Grips the Auto Industry,"(Bloomberg) -- The auto industry -- already fretting lengthy factory shutdowns and depressed new-vehicle demand -- is starting to sound the alarm about a potential used-car price collapse that could have far-reaching consequences for manufacturers, lenders and rental companies.
Used-vehicle auctions are for now virtually paralyzed, much like the rest of the economy. The grave concern market watchers have is that vehicles already are starting to pile up at places where buyers and sellers make and take bids on cars and trucks -- and that this imbalance will last for months.
If that fear is realized and prices plummet, it will be detrimental to automakers and their in-house lending units, which likely will have to write down the value of lease contracts that had assumed vehicles would retain greater value. Rental-car companies also will get less money from selling down their fleet of vehicles, which are sitting idle amid a global pandemic that’s been catastrophic for travel.
“Six months from now, there will be huge, if not unprecedented, levels of wholesale supply in the market,” Dale Pollak, an executive vice president of Cox Automotive, which owns North America’s largest auto-auction company, wrote in an open letter to auto dealers last week. “Cars are coming in, but they aren’t selling. Today’s huge supply of wholesale inventory suggests supplies will be even larger in the months ahead.”
Lease Extensions
Automakers are doing what they can to limit the damage. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.’s finance units already are offering customers one-month lease extensions. In addition to relieving pressure on consumers wary of going into showrooms, this will delay some of the influx of off-lease vehicles headed to auctions that are for now operating only virtually.
But these measures are unlikely to go nearly far enough to address the asymmetry between the supply of used vehicles and demand that is unlikely to rebound anytime soon given that almost 17 million Americans sought jobless benefits in just the last three weeks.
“There aren’t a lot of people in gloves and masks running out to buy cars,” said Maryann Keller, a former Wall Street analyst who’s now an auto-industry consultant in Stamford, Connecticut. “Auctions are mostly shut down and they’re filled with cars that have no buyers.”
Residual Risk
Used-car sales fell 64% in the last week of March, according to Manheim. The Cox Automotive-owned auction company estimates that prices have fallen about 10% in recent weeks, though that figure is based on unusually low volume at auctions.
If that level of decline lasts or worsens, it could have huge implications for GM, whose General Motors Financial unit had $30.4 billion worth of vehicles leased to customers at the end of last year. If GM Financial needs to boost its estimate of how much those vehicles are going to depreciate in value, each percentage point increase raises the firm’s expenses by $304 million, according to a regulatory filing.
GM assumed a 4% decline in residual values this year. If the 10% drop Manheim has seen recently persists, depreciation expense could counter the $1.9 billion that GM Financial earned in pretax profit last year, said Joel Levington, a credit analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. Ford Motor Credit faces similar risk, he said.

Rental-car companies that appealed to the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve as a group last month for loans, tax breaks and other forms of support await a similar fate. Hertz Global Holdings Inc., Avis Budget Group Inc. and Enterprise Holdings Inc. all are trying to find ways to unload some cars without taking too big of a hit, said Keller, a former Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc. board member.
If Avis and Hertz have to sell cars at lower values, it will add to the costs of maintaining their fleets. A big drop in residual values comes straight out of the bottom line and can create liquidity problems, said Hamzah Mazari, a Jefferies analyst.
For Hertz and Avis, every 1% increase in fleet costs saps about $20 million from earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Mazari said.
Motivated Sellers
Hertz hasn’t cleared out as many cars so far as Avis has, meaning it’s holding more vehicles with few customers to whom it can rent them.
But rental companies that sold aggressively in late March as Covid-19 was spreading did so at a cost, said Jonathan Smoke, Cox Automotive’s chief economist.
“Rental companies are motivated sellers,” Smoke said. “They moved cars quickly but saw the impact on price.”
Dealers also are looking to tap the used-car inventory sitting on their lots into whatever money they can muster. One of Manheim’s biggest tasks now, Cox Automotive’s Pollak wrote in his letter last week, is finding places to park the stream of vehicles headed for auctions.
“It’s critical for dealers to recognize what may be an unpleasant truth,” Pollak said. “It might take all the cash you can gather to sustain your business today and put it in a position to be viable when the market comes back.”

1080,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2020 07:30AM ET</span>",Trading gains for big U.S. banks may not last past first quarter,"By Imani Moise and David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Big U.S. banks made a pretty penny in trading during the first quarter as the coronavirus pandemic caused wild market swings, analysts said, but those gains will likely be overshadowed by declines in other businesses and a bleak outlook for the rest of the year.
Trading revenue could be up from 8% to 20% when the five big Wall Street banks – JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) – report results this week, according to five estimates gathered by Reuters.
A note of caution was sounded by a sixth, Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer & Co, who penciled in double-digit revenue declines for some banks because ""these kinds of markets almost always lead to some trading inventory losses.""
Nonetheless, Kotowski favors banks with heavy exposure to trading, betting they will fare better than those with large lending businesses.
That dark optimism reflects the state of banking today.
Bread-and-butter businesses that take in, lend out, process and manage money for individuals and companies are struggling as the novel coronavirus has infected hundreds of thousands of people in the United States alone, shut down businesses and set the stage for a global recession. (https://tmsnrt.rs/2RqR9sT)
Shifting updates about the novel coronavirus and government responses during the first quarter created volatility that allowed trading businesses to perform well, analysts said.
Stock markets plunged and soared day-to-day in a manner not seen in at least a decade, while bond markets reacted to the U.S. Federal Reserve's cutting interest rates and pouring trillions of dollars into financial markets to address liquidity issues.
Teams that handle stocks, Treasury bonds and foreign-exchange swaps likely did better than those in corporate credit, where there was severe stress at times, analysts said.
Average daily volumes on  Tradeweb Markets Inc  (O:TW), which operates electronic trading platforms for fixed income and equities, were up 39% in the quarter from a year earlier, the company reported.
But activity began dissipating by late March, and few expect it to return as the year goes on.
""Good temporary news for the big banks is trading was really good in 1Q,"" Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr said in a recent report.
The last time Wall Street banks experienced this kind of dynamic was the first quarter of 2009. Investors were worried that banks were in serious trouble, only to learn that government stimulus programs had created a trading boon, which held up through most of that year. But coronavirus volatility may turn out to be quite different, analysts said.

Banks have dramatically restructured their trading businesses since then, and bursts of trading activity have become much more fleeting, even when they are extreme. ""If we look back to, like, 2Q '18 when we had that sharp market correction, it took several quarters in a good economy for that trading activity to come back,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck said in an interview. ""With this economy it's going to take a little bit longer.""

A combination of unprecedented policy support and a flattening viral curve has “dramatically” cut risks to both markets and the American economy, strategists including David Kostin wrote in a note Monday. If the U.S. doesn’t have a second surge in infections after the economy reopens, equity markets are unlikely to make new lows, they said.
“The Fed and Congress have precluded the prospect of a complete economic collapse,” the strategists wrote. “These policy actions mean our previous near-term downside of 2,000 is no longer likely” for the S&P 500 Index.
The U.S. benchmark closed Thursday around the 2,790 level, having hit a three-year low of 2,237 on March 23.
Goldman cited policy measures including rate cuts, the Federal Reserve’s Commercial Paper Funding Facility and fiscal stimulus such as the $2 trillion CARES act among the “numerous and increasingly powerful” actions that have spurred equity investors to take a risk-on view.
Meanwhile, the strategists expect investors to look through first-quarter results from the upcoming earnings season, and focus instead on the outlook for 2021, according to the note.
“Despite the likely steady stream of weak earnings reports, 1Q earnings season will not represent a major negative catalyst for equity market performance,” they wrote. “Our year-end S&P 500 target remains 3,000.”

TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Global equities weakened on Monday as investors braced for more indications of economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic while oil prices rose in choppy trade following a landmark deal by OPEC and its allies to cut output.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were up 3.9% at $23.6 per barrel in a volatile session, having fallen more than 3% to $22.03 earlier in the day.
Those moves came after a group of oil producing countries known as OPEC+, which includes Russia, agreed to reduce production by 9.7 million barrels per day (bpd) for May-June, after four days of marathon talks.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) lost 0.3%. The Nikkei (N225) fell 1.9%, South Korean shares (KS11) dropped 1.3% while China's CSI300 index (CSI300) lost 0.5%.
""The combined OPEC+ and G-20 cuts should set in place a bottoming process for oil prices and significantly limit the tail risk of free-falling into the single digits in our view,"" Bank of Singapore, the private banking arm of OCBC, said in a report.
International benchmark Brent futures (LCOc1) rose 2.7% to $32.65 per barrel but were trading below the day's highs.
Oil prices have slumped more than 50% from their January peak as the novel coronavirus pandemic brought the global economy to a standstill and hit fuel demand.
Investors are now looking to see if the novel coronavirus pandemic, which has battered global economic growth, will soon peak in the United States and Europe, as had been initially expected.
""While panic selling we saw last month has faded, not many investors would want to chase stock prices higher given we are about to see more evidence of economic downturns,"" said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management.
U.S. S&P 500 mini futures  dropped 1.4%, erasing a brief gain to a one-month high hit earlier in the Asian session. Financial markets in Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong were closed for a public holiday on Monday as are European markets such as Britain, Germany and France.
Asia's main ex-Japan stocks gauge is up 18% from a four-year low struck around mid-March following unprecedented global stimulus. But the index is off about 18% so far this year as investors are unconvinced that the worst is over for the markets.
Earnings scorecards from U.S. companies are in focus this week, with banks among the first to report, while China releases its trade data on Tuesday and closely watched gross domestic product figures on Friday.
Companies are only now adjusting their behaviour to deal with an expected global recession, which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said will be ""way worse"" than the global financial crisis a decade ago.
Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270) told its labour union in South Korea that it wants to suspend operations at three of its domestic factories as the outbreak weighs on exports to Europe and the United States.

Here are some facilities that have shut or reduced production:
* JBS USA [JBS.UL] shut a beef plant in Souderton, Pennsylvania, until April 16, after previously cutting production.
* JBS reduced production a beef plant in Greeley, Colorado, due to high absences among workers, according to the local United Food and Commercial Workers union. The company said high absenteeism led slaughter rates to outpace the process of cutting carcasses into pieces.
* National Beef Packing Co [NBEEF.UL] suspended cattle slaughtering at a beef plant in Tama, Iowa, for a cleaning and planned to resume on April 13.
* Aurora Packing Company closed a beef plant in Aurora, Illinois, said Brad Lyle, chief financial officer for U.S. commodity firm Kerns and Associates. A security officer at the plant said it was closed due to the pandemic. The company did not respond to requests for comment.
* Harmony Beef in Alberta, Canada, shut its cattle slaughter operations on March 27 for two days, after a worker tested positive for the new coronavirus, prompting some federal inspectors to stay away from the site.
* Cargill Inc (CARG.UL) closed a plant in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, that produces meat for U.S. grocery stores.
*  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) shut a hog slaughterhouse in Columbus Junction, Iowa, the week of April 6 after more than 24 cases of COVID-19 involving employees at the facility. 
* Smithfield Foods, the world’s biggest pork processor, on Sunday said it is shutting a pork plant indefinitely and warned that plant shutdowns are pushing the United States “perilously close to the edge” in meat supplies for grocers.
* An Olymel pork plant in Yamachiche, Quebec, shut on March 29 for two weeks, after nine workers tested positive for the coronavirus.
* Maple Leaf Foods (TO:MFI) suspended operations on April 8 at its Brampton, Ontario poultry plant, following three COVID cases among workers at that facility. 
*  Sanderson Farms  Inc (O:SAFM) reduced chicken production to 1 million birds a week from 1.3 million at a plant in Moultrie, Georgia.

It has become more difficult to trade S&P 500 e-mini futures as volume has migrated to products based on the all-electronic SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, said Neel Shah, a senior trader at the options trading firm.
“If you’re a broker, you have access to tons of liquidity providers in the pit. Now, that doesn’t exist anymore,” Shah said in a phone interview. “All those brokers are upstairs, and to call up 10 people is going to take longer to source that liquidity.”
For example, open interest in put options on S&P 500 futures has not really recovered since March contracts expired, while the same measure in the SPY (NYSE:SPY) ETF has climbed, he said.
Stock exchanges around the world have been forced to shift to electronic trading in order to control the spread of the coronavirus. CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) closed its Chicago trading floor on March 13, while the New York Stock Exchange shut its equity and options trading floors on March 23 after an employee and a person who worked there both tested positive.
Still, there are signs the disruption to the market is coming to an end, according to Shah. While futures bid/ask spreads were significantly wider in the peak part of the rout due partially to the lower liquidity, they are “getting back to normal” now, he said.

The union has not yet decided whether to accept the plan - under which operations would be suspended from April 23-29 - because negotiations over pay are ongoing, the official said.
""Kia Motors is currently reviewing the suspension of some of its plants in Korea in response to declining global demand due to COVID-19. However, a decision has not been made at this time,"" Kia Motors said in a statement.
Kia Motors' share price fell 3.4% and that of affiliate  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) declined 2% in a wider market (KS11) that was 0.7% lower in morning trade.
Hyundai Motor halted a line producing its Tucson sport utility vehicle in the southeastern city of Ulsan from April 13-17.
Hyundai and Kia Motors have suspended operations at most of their factories outside South Korea and China as the coronavirus spreads fast beyond Asia.
Government restrictions on movement to slow the spread are impacting consumer spending worldwide.

South Korea's exports for the first 10 days of April plunged 18.6% from the same period a year earlier, far below the 20.8% jump over March 1-10. Shipments of vehicles and vehicle components during the period tumbled 7.1% and 31.8% respectively.

(Reuters) - An agreement by oil-producing nations on Sunday to cut output by a record amount may sustain a recent bounce in stocks, although stay-at-home restrictions and closures tied to the coronavirus pandemic still weigh on the global economy. 
OPEC and allies led by Russia agreed to cut oil output by a record amount - representing around 10% of global supply - to support oil prices amid the pandemic, although sources told Reuters that effective cuts could amount to as much as 20%.
S&P futures (ESC1) were down on Sunday evening, while U.S. crude futures (CLc1) and Brent (LCOc1) opened higher before paring gains. 
The deal could buoy oil prices over the longer term and boost stocks, since talks between producers had hit roadblocks late last week, some analysts said.
""The broader market will see this as another point of stabilization as the economy, primed by favorable fiscal and monetary policies, seems to be avoiding the worst-case market scenarios,"" said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Jersey.
Oil prices have been slammed recently by concerns about demand because of virus-related restrictions, with U.S. crude ending Friday's trade at $22.76, down 62.7% year-to-date. The S&P 500 energy sector (SPNY) has fallen about 43% this year.
Some analysts cautioned that some hopes of an accord had already been factored into stock prices. The S&P 500 rose 12% last week, notching its best weekly gain since 1974.
At the same time, many believe that the scope of any rally - whether in oil or stocks - will be limited by the coronavirus-related shutdowns that have slowed economic activity around the world.
Measures to slow the spread of the respiratory virus have destroyed demand for fuel and driven down oil prices, straining budgets of oil producers and hammering the U.S. shale industry, which is more vulnerable to low prices due to its higher costs.
If the global economy stays closed for another few months, ""this 9.7 million (bpd) reduction will be meaningless because people aren't driving,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. He added, however, that the prospect of deeper cuts would likely be welcomed. 
Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda in New York, wrote that the deal would help support oil prices.

""Despite the skepticism that this production deal will not see a high-level of compliance, it should end calls for oil prices to fall to single digits,"" Moya said.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Smithfield Foods, the world's biggest pork processor, said on Sunday it will shut a U.S. plant indefinitely due to a rash of coronavirus cases among employees and warned the country was moving ""perilously close to the edge"" in supplies for grocers.
Slaughterhouse shutdowns are disrupting the U.S. food supply chain, crimping availability of meat at retail stores and leaving farmers without outlets for their livestock.
Smithfield extended the closure of its Sioux Falls, South Dakota, plant after initially saying it would idle temporarily for cleaning. The facility is one of the nation's largest pork processing facilities, representing 4% to 5% of U.S. pork production, according to the company.
South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem said on Saturday that 238 Smithfield employees had active cases of the new coronavirus, accounting for 55% of the state's total. Noem and the mayor of Sioux Falls had recommended the company shut the plant, which has about 3,700 workers, for at least two weeks.
""It is impossible to keep our grocery stores stocked if our plants are not running,"" Smithfield Chief Executive Ken Sullivan said in a statement on Sunday. ""These facility closures will also have severe, perhaps disastrous, repercussions for many in the supply chain, first and foremost our nation's livestock farmers.""
Smithfield said it will resume operations in Sioux Falls after further direction from local, state and federal officials. The company will pay employees for the next two weeks, according to the statement. 
The company has been running its plants to supply U.S. consumers during the outbreak, Sullivan said.
""We have a stark choice as a nation: we are either going to produce food or not, even in the face of COVID-19,"" he said.

Other major U.S. meat and poultry processors, including  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN), Cargill Inc (CARG.UL) and JBS USA [JBS.UL] have already idled plants in other states.

Such cases have effectively more than doubled since the end of 2019, when AIB had forbearance arrangements in place for a total of 22,276 customers, its annual results published last month show.
Ireland's five retail banks agreed last month to implement loan repayment breaks of up to three months for those affected by the near shutdown of the economy. 
AIB CEO Colin Hunt told the Sunday Times in an interview that it was inevitable certain customers will require support beyond that timeframe.
The 25,000 breaks agreed by AIB, one the country's two dominant lenders, include 15,000 mortgages and 5,000 businesses seeking breaks or working capital, Hunt said.
AIB's main rival, Bank of Ireland (I:BIRG), was processing a similar number of applications for breaks from mortgage and business customers by the end of March, its chief executive said on April 3.
Hunt added that AIB was sticking to its medium targets announced just a week before the government started introducing a series of severe restrictions to slow the spread of the virus.
These targets include a return on equity of at least 8%, maintaining a core tier-one capital ratio of 14% or more and a reduction in staff numbers of around 1,500 to below 8,000 by the end of 2022. ""They are still valid,"" Hunt told the newspaper. 
An economist and former policy adviser in Ireland's finance department, Hunt said the focus of the country's banks is ""to minimize the economic damage"" being wrought by the pandemic on customers and to ""turbocharge the recovery with the right products"" when the health crisis shows signs of abating.

""It is looking more like a U-shaped recovery. I do believe the economy will recover, but it may be well into 2021 before we are back into the position we were at the end of February,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon said Saturday it is using its authority under the Defense Production Act to boost the supply of N95 masks, which are essential for protecting healthcare professionals from the coronavirus and are in short supply in many places. 
The American military will spend $133 million to increase U.S. domestic N95 mask production by over 39 million over the next 90 days, Lieutenant Colonel Mike Andrews said in a statement.
This is the first time the Pentagon is using the Korean War-era law to address coronavirus needs after it won approval late Friday from a White House task force.
The Defense Production Act, approved in 1950, grants the president the power to expand industrial production of key materials or products for national security and other reasons.
Andrews said the Pentagon in coming days will identify the companies involved when the contract is awarded.
Earlier this week, 3M (N:MMM) and the White House announced a plan https:// to import 166.5 million N95 masks over the next three months to support healthcare workers in the United States, supplementing the 35 million N95 respirators the company currently produces per month in the United States.
The announcement came after Trump last week said he was invoking the Defense Production Act in order to acquire additional N95 masks from the company. Trump had demanded a pause in the exports of domestically produced respirators to Canada and some Latin American countries, where 3M is the primary supplier.
""3M is doing a great job,"" Trump said Friday.
Canadian officials had criticized Trump's efforts to block 3M export of N95 respirator masks to Canada.
Last month, Trump invoked the act to require General Motors Co (N:GM) to build ventilators needed to treat severely sick coronavirus patients even though the U.S. automaker announced it would begin building ventilators by mid-April.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department awarded GM a contract for $489 million to produce 30,000 ventilators, while it also announced a $646.7 million contract given to Dutch health technology company Philips (AS:PHG) to produce 43,000 ventilators.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the airlines on Friday the government would require them to repay 30% of the grants in low-cost loans over 10 years -- with the first five years at 1% interest -- before the interest rate would rise. The government is also seeking warrants equal to 10% of the loan amount.
U.S. airlines have idled more than 2,200 airplanes, a third of the fleet, canceled hundreds of thousands of flights and sought to shore up their balance sheets as travel demand has fallen by about 95% because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Airlines, in calls with U.S. Treasury officials and the government's outside advisers, were making the case that Treasury should not require them to repay a big chunk of grants, in part because the $25 billion is not sufficient to cover the full amount of payroll costs submitted.
Airlines for America, a trade group representing  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), United Airlines (O:UAL), Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), JetBlue Airways Corp (N:JBLU), Alaska Airlines (N:ALK) and others, said Saturday it believes the $25 billion in payroll assistance was ""to be only in grants – which is considerably more effective for our employees – and not a combination of grants and loans.""
Under the terms laid out in the statute, companies receiving funds cannot lay off employees before Sept. 30 or change collective bargaining agreements. Mnuchin has authority to demand compensation for the grants but is not required to do so.
Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants union, wrote on Twitter Saturday that if Treasury insists on airlines repaying $7 billion in grants, ""job cuts will happen now AND longer term cuts will come in October. This is absolutely stealing from the money Congress allocated directly to workers.""
Congress set aside another $25 billion in loans to passenger airlines, but no action on those is expected until Treasury makes decisions on the grants.
Some airlines were seeking other changes in the terms including ensuring grant funds are paid as a lump sum rather than on a monthly basis.
The Treasury said Friday Mnuchin will not require passenger air carriers that will receive $100 million in assistance or less to provide compensation.
Reuters first reported the terms Mnuchin proposed to carriers.
Treasury said Friday it is working with 12 larger passenger air carriers ""to secure appropriate financial instruments to compensate taxpayers.""

Airlines were told they could apply for the amount they paid in salaries and benefits in the second and third quarters of 2019. American Airlines, with the largest number of employees, had said it was seeking around $6 billion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Macy's Inc (N:M) has hired investment bank  Lazard Ltd  (N:LAZ) to explore options for bolstering its finances after the department store operator lost most of its revenue as it shut down all its stores as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, people familiar with the matter said.
The move by Macy's, the largest U.S. department store operator by sales, is a sign of the severity of the crisis facing brick-and-mortar retailers, which were already struggling with the shift to online shopping. The pandemic has forced store closures and widespread furloughs of employees as state after state issued shelter-in-place orders in efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 respiratory illness. 
Macy's has called in Lazard bankers who specialize in finding ways to recapitalize financially troubled companies and rework debts, the sources said. Macy's has also enlisted debt restructuring lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis LLP, two of the sources said.
Macy's has asked its advisers to help manage its liabilities and explore options that could include new financing, the sources said, adding that no debt restructuring is imminent. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. 
A spokeswoman for Macy's said in a statement that the company is ""exploring numerous options to strengthen our capital structure,"" adding that it maintains relationships with a range of advisers. 
The company, which operates the Macy's and Bloomingdale's department stores, declined to comment further beyond pointing to previous steps it has taken in response to the pandemic, which include suspending its quarterly dividend, drawing down its credit line, deferring spending, reducing pay at most management levels and furloughing the majority of its roughly 123,000 employees. 
A Kirkland spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Lazard spokeswoman declined to comment.
The company, which also operates the bluemercury beauty products and spa chain, has $3.6 billion in long-term debt and roughly $7 billion in store lease obligations. It had $685 million in cash as of the end of its most recent fiscal year, and recently drew down another $1.5 billion from a credit line while its stores remained closed.
Macy's decision to explore new financing, among other options, makes it the latest U.S. retailer to do so. On Thursday, rival  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN) raised $600 million by placing real estate assets that included five stores, six distribution centers and its Seattle headquarters in a separate company and borrowing against it by issuing bonds. 
Macy's was already in the midst of slashing costs before the coronavirus outbreak, with plans to permanently close 125 stores over the next three years and cut more than 2,000 jobs. Those were in addition to the more than 100 store closures and thousands of job cuts it has rolled out since 2015.
The 161-year-old department store operator closed all of its 775 department stores last month in response to the pandemic. That made its e-commerce operations its only source of revenue; e-commerce accounted for about 25% of its roughly $25 billion in sales in the 12 months ending Feb. 1. 
It is unclear when Macy's and other department store chains will be able to re-open their stores. Credit ratings firm Fitch Ratings Inc said earlier this month that it expected Macy's revenue to plunge nearly 25% this year. The New York-based company's shares have tumbled more than 60% since the start of this year, giving the retailer a market capitalization of roughly $2 billion.
DEBT DUE
Like many companies hit hard by the pandemic, Macy's has said its chief executive, Jeff Gennette, will forego pay during the crisis. Last week, Macy's announced that its chief financial officer had decided to step down at the end of May and that it was seeking a replacement.
Macy's became a U.S. household name over the decades, known for its Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City and its flagship Herald Square (NYSE:SQ) store, which stretches over an entire block in the heart of Manhattan. 
Macy's has $530 million of debt due in January 2021 and another $450 million at the start of 2022, and likely has enough cash to make those payments, Fitch said.
The company's credit rating was downgraded to junk by two ratings firms in recent weeks, making it more expensive for the retailer to borrow. However, Macy's junk-rated bonds rallied last week after the Federal Reserve said it would expand its asset-buying program to bonds of companies that had been investment-grade but then were downgraded to junk status.

1100,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2020 06:15PM ET</span>",Exclusive: JPMorgan Chase to raise mortgage borrowing standards as economic outlook darkens,"By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), the country's largest lender by assets, is raising borrowing standards this week for most new home loans as the bank moves to mitigate lending risk stemming from the novel coronavirus disruption.
From Tuesday, customers applying for a new mortgage will need a credit score of at least 700, and will be required to make a down payment equal to 20% of the home's value. 
The change highlights how banks are quickly shifting gears to respond to the darkening U.S. economic outlook and stress in the housing market, after measures to contain the virus put 16 million people out of work and plunged the country into recession. 
""Due to the economic uncertainty, we are making temporary changes that will allow us to more closely focus on serving our existing customers,"" Amy Bonitatibus, chief marketing officer for JPMorgan Chase's home lending business, told Reuters.
The bank was the fourth largest U.S. mortgage lender in 2019, according to industry publication Inside Mortgage Finance. 
The changes should help JPMorgan reduce its exposure to borrowers who unexpectedly lose their job, suffer a decline in wages, or whose homes lose value. The bank said the change will also free up staff to handle a surge in mortgage refinance requests, which are taking longer to process due to staff working from home and non-essential businesses being closed. 
Refinancing requests jumped to their highest level in more than a decade last month as average rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, the most popular home loan, fell to near record lows, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). 
JPMorgan would not disclose the current minimum requirements for its various mortgage products, but the average down payment across the housing market is around 10%, according to the MBA.
The new credit standards do not apply to JPMorgan's roughly four million existing mortgage customers, or to low and moderate income borrowers who qualify for its ""DreaMaker"" product, which requires a minimum 3% down payment and 620 credit score. 
The U.S. housing market had been on a steady footing earlier this year, but with a deepening recession and would-be home buyers unable to view properties or close purchases due to social distancing measures, the health crisis now threatens to derail the sector.
The residential mortgage market is already under strain after borrower requests to delay mortgage payments rose 1,900% in the second half of March, Reuters reported.

The National Association of Realtors last month said home sales could fall by around 10% in the short-term, compared to historical sales for this time of year. A Federal Reserve March consumer survey said home prices were expected grow 1.32% over the year, the lowest reading since the survey began in 2013.

1101,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2020 03:10PM ET</span>","Warehouse workers risk COVID-19 to ship Gucci shades, face cream, sofas","By Chris Kirkham, Reade Levinson and Nandita Bose
(Reuters) - As U.S. authorities ordered shutdowns of non-essential businesses to fight coronavirus, retailer  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN) closed hundreds of stores and gave in-store workers three weeks’ pay, calling their safety its top priority. 
That benefit did not extend to Meagan Christensen, 34, an Iowa warehouse worker who packs online orders of Birkenstock sandals, swimsuits and $60 face cream. The facility recently closed for cleaning after a co-worker contracted COVID-19, but it reopened 36 hours later.
With Americans stuck at home, warehouse workers scramble to fill surging online orders. Some, such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc employees, often ship groceries and other essentials. Others risk their health for furniture or fashion retailers such as IKEA, Wayfair Inc or Macy’s Inc.
Government stay-home orders have carve-outs for warehouses or e-commerce operations, allowing a wide array of retailers to piggyback on exemptions intended primarily to ensure the flow of necessities. The loophole means a large segment of retail workers - who often have scant benefits or sick time - must choose between their health and their paycheck. Some retailers, including Wayfair, Kohl’s and Macy’s, have given workers letters from executives to show police if they are stopped while commuting. 
“A lot of people are scared” at Nordstrom, said Christensen, who says she earns less than $40,000 per year and is enrolled in the company’s health insurance plan. “We’re selling designer-line apparel and cosmetics. None of this is make-it-or-break-it for the current situation.”
Nordstrom said its online operations are keeping its business afloat - and ensuring workers’ livelihoods for the long term. 
“What’s the opposite scenario? Everything gets shut down completely, and we can’t afford to pay your benefits?” said Gigi Ganatra Duff, a Nordstrom corporate affairs vice president. “And we can’t afford to hire you back when it’s over?”
As in-store sales evaporate, retailers are chasing a captive audience - stuck inside, bored, tempted to shop online. Macy’s ads, echoing others, tout “our lowest prices of the season right now!”
Those orders are filled by warehouses employing hundreds of people. Stephanie Morris, 57, works for IKEA in New Jersey, shipping sofas and shelves. She says she checks her temperature before each shift. “People don’t understand that, when you order something, there’s got to be someone there to pull that merchandise,” she said.
Reuters interviewed three dozen warehouse and fulfillment workers and reviewed COVID-19 wage-and-benefit policies at nine retailers - Amazon, Walmart,  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), Nordstrom, Wayfair, O'Reilly (NASDAQ:ORLY) Automotive Inc, IKEA, Macy’s and Kohl’s. Five of them - Amazon, Walmart, Nordstrom, Kohl’s and Target - extended temporary $2-per-hour raises to workers, some of whom make less than $15 an hour. Wayfair offered $4 raises.
The firms said they prioritize safety by cleaning, encouraging social distancing and providing protective gear. Kohl’s, Walmart and IKEA said their workers’ temperatures are checked before shifts, although several IKEA workers said that’s not happening at their warehouses.
IKEA and Wayfair called their products essential to people who suddenly need home-office furniture or other household items. Consumers depend on “companies like Wayfair to keep them supplied with the items they need for their homes during these challenging times,” Wayfair said, adding that the government has recognized its crucial role.
A recent report from the Brookings Institution think tank estimated that between 49 million and 62 million U.S. workers – 34% to 43% of the total workforce - are employed in industries deemed to be essential under what the organization called a “sweeping” federal definition. Those industries, Brookings found, tend to employ lower-wage workers who often have less health insurance than most Americans.
Labor relations and public policy experts said the crisis poses dilemmas for employers and workers trying to balance safety with financial survival. For consumers, the ability to shop online makes “this extraordinary period more comfortable,” said Erica Groshen, a Cornell University labor relations professor.
Online sales amount to an understandable “survival strategy” for a sector that is important to consumers, investors and the economy, said Thomas Kochan, a management professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But staying open also creates an obligation to give workers more say in benefits and protections.
“The companies may view these workers as essential,” he said, “but they're not treating them as essential.”
Workers themselves are often torn about continuing to work. One of Christensen’s Nordstrom co-workers, Makenzie McMullen, 28, called the warehouse environment a “ticking time bomb,” and yet said she was “very conflicted” about whether to stay home.
“I do love my job,” she said. “I wouldn’t have been there the last three years if I didn’t.""
‘EVERY SALE COUNTS RIGHT NOW!’
Luxury retailer Neiman Marcus Group has asked, but not required, workers to report to shuttered stores to package online orders for sweaters, handbags and other items.
“Every sale counts right now!” wrote a Neiman manager at Pennsylvania’s King of Prussia Mall, in an email to employees. The pandemic has put Neiman in especially dire straits: It is straining to make payments on about $4 billion in debt as it prepares for a possible bankruptcy. Neiman did not comment on whether it has extended additional benefits, but said its precautions include cleaning and temperature checks.
Some retailers offer more generous pandemic-related benefits than others. Macy’s gave e-commerce employees two weeks of extra paid leave to use anytime. Nordstrom said it would pay infected workers’ medical bills and salaries until they recover.
Other companies, such as Amazon, Walmart, Target, O'Reilly, Wayfair and IKEA, offered warehouse workers one or two weeks of additional leave if they test positive or get quarantined by a medical professional. IKEA’s policy also applies to workers showing COVID-19 or flu symptoms, those with family members showing symptoms, and workers with underlying health conditions that heighten the threat of the virus, the company said.
Another worker at IKEA's New Jersey warehouse, Tiwaan Bradley, 46, has diabetes and lupus, putting him at high risk. When he learned that a co-worker’s wife had tested positive, he stayed home and depleted his sick pay. He said he didn't learn he might qualify for two weeks of extra sick time until this week, when a manager told him as he was taking up other workplace issues with the company in his role as a union shop steward. 
The extra two weeks of paid leave will help, he said, but likely won't last him through the pandemic. He said he's balancing the need for income with protecting his health.
""In order for me to take care of my family,"" Bradley said, ""I have to be alive.""
Nordstrom offered warehouse workers five additional paid days. Kohl’s isn’t offering additional sick leave, workers said; it did not respond to questions on its policy for employees who contract COVID-19.
Some Kohl’s and Nordstrom in-store workers have the option to return to stores to help with online orders. Other retail employees have been furloughed - allowing them to keep their health benefits and apply for government unemployment insurance, an option some warehouse workers say they wish they had.
Rae Jones, 29, works at an O’Reilly Auto Parts warehouse in Alabama. She has an autoimmune disease that has already consumed what little sick leave she had, so she continues to work. The company offered no additional virus-related sick leave unless she tests positive for COVID-19. It has not regularly provided sanitizer, she said, so she started giving workers her own homemade concoction of Everclear grain alcohol and aloe vera.
“I need the paycheck,” Jones said. “But I’m scared.”
Twice in the last few days, Jones said, dozens of O’Reilly employees walked out in protest over a lack of personal protective equipment. O’Reilly Auto Parts did not comment on the walk-outs or worker complaints, but said it has disinfected warehouses and provided cleaning supplies.
Cyndi Murray, a Walmart employee in Maryland, said workers must submit a positive coronavirus test and a doctor’s note to a third-party online system to apply for extra paid leave. Decisions take two to seven days, she said, leaving workers in limbo.
Walmart spokesman Kory Lundberg said the system takes at least two days but did not address concerns about delays. He said employees who test positive, run a high fever or are quarantined can qualify for two paid weeks off.
FIRING A PROTEST ORGANIZER
Amazon has taken heat from some workers over safety. Staffers at its Staten Island, New York, facility protested in late March, demanding the facility’s closure for deep cleaning after workers tested positive. Similar protests followed elsewhere. Amazon said it fired the employee who organized the Staten Island protest because he didn’t quarantine himself after contact with an infected worker.
A Minnesota Amazon warehouse does not provide enough masks, sanitizer or gloves, said worker Sahro Sharif. Managers instruct workers to wash their hands and clean work stations, Sharif said, but keeps them too busy to do so.
Stephanie Haynes, an Amazon employee in Joliet, Illinois, said the company did not shut down her warehouse after a worker tested positive. Instead, Amazon checked surveillance cameras to determine who had worked within six feet of the infected staffer and asked those employees to self-quarantine. Others were asked back to work, even if they were convinced they had been exposed, she said.
""It's very scary,” said Haynes, 42. “Amazon decides if you've had close contact with an infected person.""
Amazon spokeswoman Kristen Kish said the company distributes masks, sanitizer and wipes, but did not address complaints of shortages. Amazon is taking “extreme measures” to ensure safety, she said. She did not answer questions about company protocols for shutting warehouses after confirmed infections.
In late March, Wayfair workers at a New Jersey warehouse were told an employee had tested positive. The building closed for cleaning and reopened 24 hours later. A second employee tested positive on Sunday.
Wayfair said 13 workers have tested positive, and in each case it cleaned facilities and identified those in close contact with infected staffers. The company said it paid all employees during closures and paid workers in quarantine.
SELLING KNICK-KNACKS, GUCCI SUNGLASSES
Akeel Sudlow, 28, works at the warehouse as an IT support engineer. When he requested to work from home, citing ill health and school closures, his manager said he could go unpaid, according to communication seen by Reuters.
“Unless I’m sick and dying, there’s no support for me,” said Sudlow, who has stayed home without pay for a month.
The company said it has allowed workers to work from home if they can effectively do their jobs there.
Anthony Costa, who works for Macy’s in Connecticut, decided to use up his leave time to avoid the warehouse after seeing crowded conditions and limited sanitation supplies. 
“To have a thousand-dollar pair of shoes is something that in my opinion is not essential,” said Costa, who loads merchandise and drives it a short distance between two warehouses. “You could wait until this is over to order some Gucci sunglasses.”
Workers at IKEA have questioned why they risk their health to ship decorative plastic trees, knick-knacks and couches. Ahnisohn Harmon, 42, who works at a New Jersey warehouse, described a tense environment, with heightened awareness of every cough and workers constantly diagnosing one another. The company encourages social distancing, he said, but employees are often lifting items weighing 50 pounds or more - requiring a partner.

“We’re going to be in each other’s face,” he said, “breathing each other’s air.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp CEO Masayoshi Son said he has secured a monthly supply of 300 million face masks for Japan after reaching a deal with Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD Co Ltd, which has also started producing masks.
From next month, SoftBank will supply two different kinds of mask, initially for medical staff, in cooperation with the Japanese government's ""mask team"", set up to tackle shortages due to the coronavirus outbreak, Son said on Twitter. 
SoftBank, which last month said it was donating 1.4 million masks to New York state, will supply the masks without taking a profit.
Addressing the supply crunch is a priority for the Japanese government, which will begin delivering two washable masks to households next week -- a move that has been widely criticised on social media as inadequate.
The government is also targeting domestic production of 700 million disposable masks.
Son, who has a long history of partnering with and investing in Chinese firms, said BYD is setting up a new line to produce the masks. 
BYD's production capacity has reached 15 million masks a day, a company spokeswoman said, confirming the firm will supply masks to SoftBank.
SoftBank's supply will consist of 100 million N95 masks, which can filter very small particles, and 200 million regular surgical masks. 

The coronavirus pandemic has spurred Son's return to Twitter, where he has complained that Japan's response is being spearheaded by politicians rather than scientists and polled users on their view of the government's response -- adding to pressure to increase social distancing measures.

PARIS (Reuters) - Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) has requested several billion euros of emergency funds from the French state while it negotiates a loan package from banks, which would be guaranteed by France and the Netherlands, French business daily Les Echos reported.
The airline has asked for an immediate state cash injection to meet its needs for the next four to five months, the paper said, with air travel paralysed by the coronavirus shutdown.
Air France KLM and the French finance ministry declined to comment.
Negotiations with the banks over loans to tide it over for the next 12 to 18 months are taking longer than expected, Les Echos reported, adding that neither Air France KLM, nor the banks, were satisfied with the level of guarantee that France provides of 75%, which compares to a 90% backup by the Netherlands. 
Sources previously told Reuters that Air France KLM is in talks with banks to receive up to 6 billion euros ($6.5 billion) in state-backed bank loans.
The airline had said on Thursday that despite cost-cutting measures to stave off the impact of the coronavirus crisis, it expects it will be short of cash in the third quarter, but said it was confident of French and Dutch government support.
French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said earlier this week that the government was prepared to provide massive support to the airline in order to save a French industrial champion.

Air France KLM Chief Executive Benjamin Smith has asked the French government to increase its guarantee to 90%, les Echos said.

By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski
WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told major airlines on Friday he wants them to repay some of the $25 billion in cash grants the U.S. Congress approved last month to cover payroll costs as airlines weather an unprecedented crisis due to the coronavirus, three industry officials briefed on the matter told Reuters.
The Treasury said in a statement Mnuchin will not require passenger air carriers that will receive $100 million in payroll assistance or less to provide compensation and ""funds will be available promptly upon approval of their applications.""
Reuters first reported earlier on Friday that Treasury would not seek warrants from smaller regional carriers, which had urged the government not to demand compensation.
Mnuchin spoke with the chief executives of major airlines in separate calls on Friday and told them the department was offering 70% of the aid in grants that would not need to be repaid, and 30% in low-interest loans for which the airlines would be required to offer warrants, the sources said. The interest rates would rise over time if airlines had not repaid them, the sources said.
Three people briefed on the matter said the warrants, which would give the government the right to buy equity at a pre-set price and time, would be equal to 10% of the value of the loan.
That means that every $1 billion in government aid would include $700 million in grants, $300 million in low-interest loans and an option for the government to buy $30 million in shares. Two people said the warrants would be priced at current stock prices.
Any of the terms could still be subject to change as talks continue.
Warrants do not generate any balance sheet debt and thus should not hamper the ability of airlines, which can also apply for a separate $25 billion government loan package, to finance in the future, experts said.
Treasury said it is working with 12 passenger air carriers expected to get more than $100 million ""to secure appropriate financial instruments to compensate taxpayers.""
The majority of the smaller requests sought less than $10 million and Treasury is not seeking compensation in order to maintain ""needed air service,"" avoiding layoffs ""and limiting share buyback and executive compensation.""
On Sunday, Alaska'a largest regional carrier, RavnAir filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, laying off nearly its entire staff and grounding all of its 72 planes.
Treasury said it received more than 230 requests from passenger carriers.
Airlines were told they could apply for the amount they paid in salaries and benefits in the second and third quarters of 2019.  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), with the largest number of employees, had said it was seeking around $6 billion. 
A United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) spokesman said the company was reviewing the details of Treasury's proposal. American Airlines also confirmed it was reviewing the proposal.
Airline boards and officials plan to review the proposals all weekend and it is not clear if they will accept the terms or propose a counteroffer.
Under the terms laid out in the statute, companies receiving funds cannot lay off employees before Sept. 30 or change collective bargaining agreements, two conditions for which labor unions had lobbied aggressively.
The bill bars entities from receiving grants from stock buybacks, or paying dividends before September 2021 and sets limits on executive compensation.
Airline unions and Democrats in the U.S. Congress have pressed Treasury to grant the assistance quickly and without requiring unreasonable conditions on airlines that are struggling.
The choice of grants as a type of support is sensitive in the airline industry after a 2015 spat in which U.S. carriers accused Gulf carriers of receiving $50 billion of aid including grants to set up competing Middle East hubs, a charge they denied.
Under the $2.3 trillion CARES Act, passenger airlines are eligible for $25 billion in cash grants for payroll while cargo carriers can get $4 billion and airport contractors like caterers and airplane cleaners $3 billion, in addition to a separate loan package for which they can apply in the months ahead.
Treasury told the airlines that they plan to charge varying interest rates on the $25 billion in loans based on a risk assessment.
Reuters reported on Thursday that the six largest U.S. airlines -- American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), JetBlue Airways Corp (N:JBLU) and Alaska Airlines (N:ALK) -- are expected to get around 90% of the $25 billion package.

Airlines say they are suffering the worst crisis of their history as travel demand has dwindled to less than 5% of normal levels. Several major U.S. airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks or the 2009 financial crisis.

Money that Honeywell draws against the revolving credit agreement should be repaid no later than April 9, 2021, the company said. 
The agreement comes after the industrial conglomerate entered into a $6 billion loan agreement last month to bolster liquidity as the fast-spreading coronavirus pandemic wreaks havoc on the global economy.
The company, which makes everything from aircraft engine parts to warehouse automation equipment, had $10 billion in cash at the end of 2019, with its pension liability overfunded, it said last month.

Honeywell has reported a surge in demand for its protective face masks in North America, Europe, India and China, following the novel coronavirus outbreak.

1107,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2020 05:20PM ET</span>","Boeing hires Lazard, Evercore to assess government aid or private loans: source","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co has hired investment banks Lazard and Evercore Inc to assess potential U.S. government assistance or private sector loans, a person briefed on the matter confirmed on Friday.
The largest U.S. planemaker asked last month for at least $60 billion in U.S. government loan guarantees for itself and other American aerospace manufacturers to help the embattled industry withstand a coronavirus-related cash drain.
""We're going to be meeting with Boeing,"" President Donald Trump told reporters on Friday. ""Boeing has not asked for aid yet but I think they probably will... We can't let anything happen to Boeing.""
Boeing did not immediately comment.
Boeing has noted that typically 70% of its revenue flows to its 17,000 suppliers and has told lawmakers that without significant assistance the entire U.S. aviation manufacturing sector could collapse.
""This isn't a great time to sell airplanes,"" Trump said, adding that the United States will make sure ""Boeing is strong again.""
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Boeing had hired the two investment banks.
The U.S. Congress set aside $17 billion in direct loans for national security related companies that could be tapped by Boeing. Boeing could also take part in a Treasury-backed Federal Reserve lending program and one analyst said it could raise up to $11.25 billion under one facility.
This week, Boeing suspended production of its 787 airplane at its facilities in South Carolina and indefinitely extended a halt in its production operations at its Washington state facilities.
Last week, Reuters reported Boeing was looking at drastic cuts in wide-body production amid a slump in demand for the industry's largest jetliners, citing sources.
Boeing's airline customers have deferred taking new aircraft and making pre-delivery downpayments, compounding a crisis over the year-old grounding of Boeing's previously fast-selling 737 MAX jet after two fatal crashes. Boeing halted 737 production in January and this week said it was now dealing with two new software issues it must address before the plane can resume flights.

Takeda (T:4502), Japan’s biggest drugmaker, announced the sale of TachoSil, a surgical patch to control bleeding, to Johnson & Johnson's subsidiary Ethicon for $400 million last May.
""Ethicon and Takeda have mutually decided to terminate the TachoSil transaction, agreeing that it was the right decision given the regulators’ concerns,"" a representative for Johnson & Johnson said in a statement.
The chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, Joseph Simons, said earlier on Friday there were potential regulatory issues about the deal because Johnson & Johnson sells Evarrest, the only other U.S.-approved fibrin sealant patch designed to stop bleeding during surgery.
""Staff had significant concerns about the likely anticompetitive effects and had recommended that the Commission block the transaction. Now that the deal has been abandoned, patients and surgeons will continue to benefit from competition,"" Simons said in an email statement.

In late March, European Union antitrust regulators had expressed concern about the deal and opened a full investigation, saying that high development costs meant rivals would find it difficult to enter the market.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's biggest insurer Generali (MI:GASI) on Friday said it would pay its 2019 dividend in two tranches, confirming a total payout of 0.96 euros per share, citing its strong capital position.
The announcement flies in the face of calls by industry regulator EIOPA for insurers and reinsurers in the European Union to suspend dividends and share buybacks and consider postponing bonuses to ensure continuity in services during the coronavirus pandemic.
Generali said it would pay a first tranche of 0.50 euros per share in May and that it plans to pay the remaining portion by the end of the year, subject to a board assessment of capital and regulatory requirements.
The company said it had taken EIOPA's recommendations into account and that its decision was consistent ""with the fact that ... all of the conditions to proceed with the dividend distribution for 2019 continue to exist"". 
""Even if the final impact of the COVID-19 crisis is still uncertain, there is no reason to doubt the group's stability,"" it said, adding that its solvency ratio remains comfortably within the target operating range.
Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG), the region's biggest insurer, told Reuters last week that it was in ""good shape"" and wanted to maintain both its dividend and a share buyback.
Generali's solvency ratio, a key measure of its financial strength, stood at 200% on March 6, compared with 224% at the end of 2019 - partly because of an acquisition in Portugal, but also because of falling prices for Italian government bonds. 
The insurer held 63 billion euros ($68 billion) in Italian bonds at the end of 2019.
Italian bonds have been hit as the coronavirus crisis and a nationwide lockdown aimed at stemming contagion rock the economy, forcing the government to ramp up spending.
Generali also announced voluntary pay cuts at management level.
Chief Executive Philippe Donnet, the members of the group's management committee and other executives with strategic responsibilities have decided to reduce their fixed salary by 20% for the remainder of the year, the company said.
France's biggest insurer AXA (PA:AXAF) has postponed its annual meeting to allow time for discussions with European regulators, though draft resolutions to pay a dividend remain unchanged.
Generali's smaller domestic rival UnipolSai (MI:US) last week said that it would pay its planned dividend on 2019 results while parent company  Unipol  Gruppo (MI:UNPI) suspended its own dividend payment.

N95 respirators, which are designed to filter 95% of airborne particles, are among the personal protective equipment most needed now by medical professionals as they battle the coronavirus outbreak. New York City has become the epicenter of the global pandemic.
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, said Performance Supply ""offered to sell $45 million in N95 respirators to New York City officials at prices 500-600% over 3M's list price."" According to the lawsuit, Performance Supply offered about 7 million 3M masks to city procurers on March 30 at over $6, up to 600% of 3M's list price.
Performance Supply did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
3M said in a statement that it seeks injunctive relieve and damages and will donate any damages recovered to COVID-19-related nonprofit organizations.
3M said last week it expects to ramp up U.S. monthly production of N95 respirator masks to 50 million in June, and is also looking to produce 2 billion N95 respirators globally within the next year.

PARIS/TOULOUSE (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) has shelved plans to add a French assembly line for its A321neo just 10 weeks after the expansion was launched, as the coronavirus fallout spreads to its best-selling jetliner.
The move heralds the start of a politically sensitive drive to cut investment and overheads as the pandemic reverses the last 8 years of production growth for such single-aisle jets.
Airbus announced plans for an extra assembly line in January when its problem was meeting record demand for the A321neo from its site in Hamburg, Germany, which has suffered production bottlenecks.
That would redeploy jobs threatened by the imminent demise of the A380, the world's largest jetliner whose popularity with airlines has slumped in favour of smaller models.
Although the plan remains on the table, its urgency has evaporated after Airbus this week announced a one-third cut in output of jets like the A321, sources said.
""Our plans for an A321 line in Toulouse are paused, on hold,"" an Airbus spokesman confirmed. ""When we see rates going up again, we will reconnect to the plans.""
That leaves a question mark hanging over its massive Lagardere A380 production plant in Toulouse, where the last superjumbo is due to roll off the line in coming months.
French unions said they would fight for the plant.
""Unlike (Airbus CEO) Guillaume Faury who wants to halt non-essential investment, we think the arrival of a new A321 line in the Lagardere factory must be maintained,"" CGT union official Xavier Petrachi said.
BALANCE OF JOBS
The move could rekindle a debate over the balance of jobs between French and German plants at the company, founded as a European consortium 51 years ago.
Airlines are shifting more towards single-aisle jets like the Hamburg-assembled A321 at the expense of wide-body jets put together in Toulouse, leaving French workers on edge. 
When the recovery does come, small jets are expected to lead the way because they are easier to fill and trip costs are low.
Airbus is also taking a wider look at fixed costs that weigh more heavily on the profitability of each jet when output falls.
After investing several hundred million dollars in ramping up production, it has a cost structure to support output of 900 planes a year whereas it is expected to ship far fewer.
""We are reducing all nature of costs which are no longer absolutely necessary for the short term and preserving the ability to go through the crisis,"" Faury said this week.
Airbus has signalled it wants to cut some costs in line with the one-third output cut, unions said. That includes in engineering and support. Development studies will also be hit.
Staff have been told to take 10 days' paid leave by mid-May. Airbus has said it may look at government-backed partial unemployment schemes, but has not done so yet.
Industry sources said a worst-case scenario could include restructuring comparable to its 2007 Power8 shake-up this summer when it has more financial clarity. That is also when Airbus starts its rolling three-year planning process. 
Rival Boeing (N:BA) is pondering 10% staff cuts, sources said. Cutting fixed costs at Airbus has traditionally been hard because of a delicate industrial jigsaw designed to balance work among core nations France, Germany, Spain and Britain. 
""It is hard to do, especially in these circumstances as there is so little time,"" said aerospace consultant Jerrold Lundquist, managing director of the Lundquist Group.
Airbus is also expected to lean on suppliers, though it has lost some leverage after cutting production.

""The way you survive a downturn is to hold product at the suppliers. You want to keep the supplier alive but at the same time not take all their product,"" Lundquist said.

1112,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2020 12:05PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Coronavirus-hit airlines in push for divisive route subsidies,"By Laurence Frost
PARIS (Reuters) - Major airlines are seeking operating subsidies for key routes once coronavirus restrictions are lifted, a leaked lobbying document shows, stoking tensions with some low-cost carriers that are less likely to benefit from the additional funds.
Route subsidies feature on a list of financial support requests circulated among airline members of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and seen by Reuters.
""Airlines will need support to maintain their networks, which play a critical role in driving the world's economy,"" Geneva-based IATA states in the 12-page digest of ""key messages"" for airline public affairs executives to take to governments.
The support can be offered ""either through a rebate on landing charges per flight or via a direct subsidy per available seat kilometre until markets have been stabilised"", it adds.
IATA spokesman Chris Goater confirmed the authenticity of the document, which was first reported by Unearthed, an environmental news service funded by campaign group Greenpeace. ""It's a private document for our members,"" Goater said.
Operating subsidies would add to tax breaks, charge deferrals, loan guarantees and other forms of government support given to airlines crippled by an unprecedented near-total shutdown of air travel in the face of the global pandemic.
But they may also strain industry efforts to present a united front amid growing dissent over aid and its effects on competition. Ryanair's (I:RYA) Lauda unit publicly urged Vienna on Thursday to withhold financial support from Lufthansa-owned Austrian Airlines.
""Not all airlines (are) in support of this initiative,"" the IATA document states, noting a ""high risk of discrimination if only applied in certain markets"". It did not identify carriers seeking or opposing route support.
British Airways parent IAG (L:ICAG) and Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) declined to comment on the proposal. Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) did not respond to requests for comment.
CORE ROUTES
Subsidies have long existed on low-traffic routes offering economic lifelines to regions with few other transport links.
But IATA, which represents 290 airlines, wants support to help to restore services on some of the bigger international connections during what may be a slow and difficult recovery.
Even after restrictions end, airlines could face further losses, hit by weak demand, intense fare competition and limits to passenger numbers designed to keep the coronavirus at bay.
""It's only core routes that a government would probably consider supporting at this stage,"" IATA's Goater said. ""They're not going to be looking at marginal tourism routes.""
The emphasis on economically important connections favours so-called flag carriers over budget rivals such as Ryanair, which fly more leisure passengers to and from secondary airports.
""Under EU law, any grant of state aid must respect the principle of equal treatment."" a Ryanair spokeswoman said when asked about the call for route subsidies.
""We are in contact with the European Commission to ensure that it remains vigilant and blocks any aid measures that favour 'national' airlines.""
EasyJet, which operates no-frills flights from major airports, said that route subsidies ""may be needed to encourage faster restarts"" when its services resume.
""But we must ensure there is a level playing field, so any support should be equally applied and should not distort market competition,"" a company spokeswoman said.
The coronavirus fallout could make some flights financially unviable long after they are allowed to resume, IATA says.
""If a government wants a particular route to be running because it's strategically important, then temporary funds or support may be required,"" Goater said.

""It's part of our ask to governments, but it's not our number one ask.""

1113,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2020 11:55AM ET</span>",Italy's banks fail to get wider virus support measures for already struggling firms,"By Valentina Za and Giuseppe Fonte
MILAN (Reuters) - Italy has rebuffed calls to widely include businesses who were already struggling to repay their debt in its latest coronavirus economic aid package, two officials who worked on the measures said, leaving lenders to face rising loan losses. 
Rome this week approved an emergency decree that offers guarantees on more than 400 billion euros ($435 billion) of new bank loans to companies hit by the coronavirus outbreak.
Banking and business lobbies had called for the package to include loans extended to firms already in trouble before the virus hit and deemed still to have a chance to be restored to good health, the officials told Reuters.
Italian banks held 76 billion euros in such loans, known as 'unlikely to pay' (UTP), as of mid-2019, which are now more likely to default in the deep recession expected to follow the pandemic. 
Under the decree, a set of state guarantees reserved for smaller companies with no more than 499 staff can be tapped by firms that were regularly repaying their debt up until Jan. 31.
That pre-dates the coronavirus contagion which emerged in Italy on Feb. 20-21, in a limited concession to companies whose troubles cannot be traced back solely to the virus.
The two officials said there had been intense discussions on the cut-off date, which is relevant in terms of compliance with European state aid rules.
""By setting Jan. 31 as the cut-off date for the set of guarantees that can be tapped to refinance existing debt, the decree excludes the vast majority of problem loans,"" Tommaso Foco, a partner at law firm Portolano Cavallo, said.
A government official said the Treasury was not currently considering extending further state guarantees for UTP loans.
In efforts to curb the spread of the virus, the government has enforced a progressively wider shutdown and it must now prop up companies at risk of buckling under mounting payment deadlines through debt moratoriums and guarantees on new bank debt.
The debt holiday applies only to companies that were performing up until March 17.
Annalisa Dentoni-Litta, a partner at law firm Orrick, said the new decree, though it had limitations, was ""a step forward"" compared to the debt moratorium package in terms of support for borrowers already in trouble.
While praising the new liquidity package, the head of Italy's third-largest bank Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) this week said UTPs remained a problem.
""There are companies that, helped by banks, were getting back on track. If they are denied the guarantees available to performing companies it's clear there'll be problems there,"" CEO Giuseppe Castagna said in a television interview.
""I understand the government faces constraints due to European rules but it's an important issue - these companies are still in business.""
As of mid-2019, Italian banks' provisions against losses covered only around 40% of their UTP loans, against a 65% coverage for defaulted loans, pointing to a 19 billion euro gap in terms of additional writedowns. ($1 = 0.9205 euros)

1114,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2020 10:36AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Italy's government set to reappoint Eni and Enel CEOs - source,"By Giuseppe Fonte
ROME (Reuters) - The chief executives of Italy's top two energy groups Eni (MI:ENI) and  Enel  (MI:ENEI) are on course to secure third terms next week when Rome decides on roles at key state-controlled companies, a senior government official said.
Claudio Descalzi and Francesco Starace took over the helm of Eni and Enel, respectively, in 2014 and were both reappointed in 2017.
The boards of both companies come up for renewal in May, along with those of defence group Leonardo (MI:LDOF), power grid  Terna  (MI:TRN) and bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS).
But the government is expected to draw up its list of candidates for the boards - including the CEOs - by April 18, said the source, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. 
The nominations were originally expected in March but were delayed because of the coronavirus crisis, which looks set to push the euro zone's third largest economy into its worst recession in modern history.
""There have been intense political talks between the ruling parties, but in the end the reappointment of both Descalzi and Starace can be considered almost a done deal,"" said the source.
The economy ministry declined to comment on this story. Eni and Enel also both declined to comment.
Under Descalzi, Eni has transformed into one of Europe's most successful oil and gas explorers.
However, Italy's main ruling party, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, has been highly critical in the past of Descalzi because of his involvement in a trial in Italy for alleged corruption over a 2011 oil deal in Nigeria. 
The veteran oilman has denied any wrongdoing.
HORSE TRADING
Political sources previously told Reuters Rome was leaning towards reappointing Descalzi.
A 5-Star source, also asking not to be named, said his party was pressing its coalition partners not to reappoint Starace at Enel, but the government official said the appointment would go ahead thanks to Starace's powerful supporters who include Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri.
Some key members of 5-Star have accused Starace of dragging his feet over a plan, backed by the party, to merge  Telecom Italia 's (MI:TLIT) fib broadband assets with those of Open Fiber, controlled by Enel (MI:ENEI) and state lender CDP.
The party has put the creation of a single ultrafast broadband network at the centre of its agenda in an effort to close the digital gap with the rest of Europe.
""They're making a lot of noise but they are not really in a position to seriously challenge Starace's reappointment,"", said the government official.
However, the nomination process at Italy's state-controlled companies is traditionally subject to lengthy horse trading, and the outcomes can be unpredictable and change suddenly on political vagaries.
Since taking over the top spot at Enel in 2014, the 65-year old Starace has won plaudits from investors for his financial results and transforming the former power monopoly into one of the biggest and cleanest utilities in the world.
If reappointed, Descalzi and Starace would both be given three-year terms.
The 5-Star Movement is also campaigning to replace Terna CEO Luigi Ferraris with Stefano Antonio Donnarumma, the head of utility Acea (MI:ACE), the party source said.
A third source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters Ferraris might be appointed at the helm of railway group Ferrovie dello Stato.

Terna declined to comment.

TOKYO/BEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd's (T:7201) management has become convinced the struggling automaker needs to be much smaller and a restructuring plan due out next month would likely assume a cut of 1 million cars to its annual sales target, senior company sources said.
Even before the spread of the coronavirus, Nissan's sales and profits had been slumping and it was burning through cash, forcing it to row back on an aggressive expansion plan pursued by ousted leader Carlos Ghosn. The pandemic has only piled on urgency and pressure to renewed efforts to downsize.
No new sales target has been finalised and it remains unclear whether one will be formally disclosed.
But Nissan's plans for restructuring through to March 2023 should be based on the assumption that it would only be able to return to annual sales of 5 million cars by then, two sources said, adding this would entail a large reduction to manufacturing capacity.
That compares with a goal of 6 million cars for the same period outlined in July by then-CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who had already stepped back from around 8 million targeted under Ghosn. Nissan likely sold about 5 million cars in the past financial year but this year's outlook is bleaker due to the pandemic.
""For years, Nissan was looking for annual sales volumes around 7-8 million vehicles. The company has never managed to sell much more than 5 million or so,"" one of the sources told Reuters. ""The company can no longer consider this sort of wishful thinking. The resizing issue is really being taken into account, it has a lot of consequences on operations for 2020-2022."" A third senior company source said the figure could be even lower than 5 million given the impact of the virus, which has hammered car demand around the world.
The sources declined to be identified as details of the turnaround plan have yet to finalised.
In July, Nissan said it was aiming to cut annual global production capacity to around 6.5 million vehicles. Shrinking its sales target by 1 million vehicles would equate to closing three to four more assembly plants and shedding thousands more jobs on top of already announced plans to cut its workforce by 10%. The cutbacks would also ripple through to its suppliers and dealers.
Nissan declined to comment on its progress in devising a new mid-term plan. ""The details will be shared in May,"" a spokeswoman said.
For interactive charts on Nissan's global vehicle sales and operating margins, click on https://reut.rs/2USzcFy
The people said that a key metric of the recovery plan will be its operating profit margin and new CEO Makoto Uchida is likely to keep Saikawa's target for a margin of about 6%, one of the people said. In the third quarter, the margin was just 0.9%.
""At the very least, a downsizing is a given,"" the person said.
By comparison, operating margins at top-selling automakers Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) before the coronavirus pandemic hovered around 8%. 
Another top priority will be the preservation of cash.
As of December, Nissan's automotive operations had negative free cash flow of 670.9 billion yen, a more than 6-fold increase from a year ago. ""That's no longer at an acceptable level,"" said one of the people.
For an interactive chart on Nissan's overall cashflow and net cash levels, click on https://reut.rs/2VgkJSN
Nissan has requested a $4.6 billion commitment line from major lenders to cushion the impact of the pandemic while it seeks to engineer the desperately needed turnaround, people with knowledge of the matter have said.

1116,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: KKR's Envision Healthcare hires bank to explore debt restructuring - sources,"By Rebecca Spalding and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Envision Healthcare Corp, a U.S. provider of physicians and other medical staff owned by buyout firm KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR), has hired a financial adviser to explore ways to restructure its $7.5 billion debt pile, people familiar with the matter said.
Envision's move underscores the struggles facing the medical industry in the wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak. The Nashville, Tennessee-based company's doctors are needed more than ever as the number of COVID-19 cases soars. Yet its revenue has collapsed as patients who have not contracted the virus are avoiding elective procedures and are staying clear of emergency rooms for fear of being infected.
Envision has hired investment bank  Houlihan Lokey Inc  (N:HLI) to explore a range of debt restructuring options, according to the sources. Envision's recent offer to creditors to exchange some of its bonds with loan borrowings will not be enough to keep the company afloat, the sources said. The healthcare services provider will have to make more significant cuts to its debt, the sources added.
The sources cautioned that no decision on a course of action had yet been taken and asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Envision, KKR and Houlihan Lokey declined to comment.
The novel coronavirus, which first broke out in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, has infected more than 1.4 million people around the world, killing more than 87,700. In the United States, the number of those infected topped 459,000 on Thursday, with deaths soaring to more than 16,400.
Elective surgeries that Envision provides are among the most lucrative medical procedures, while intensive care, which COVID-19 patients require, is far more expensive. Envision's business of staffing emergency rooms has also suffered because it gets compensated per visit rather than for the time patients spent there. As a result, the typical two-week period that many COVID-19 patients spend in intensive care is a further drag on Envision's revenue. 
Moreover, it not just the non-COVID-19 patients who are avoiding hospital treatment when possible. Acute care hospitals are postponing non-essential elective surgical procedures to make room for COVID-19 patients. Ambulatory surgery centers are doing the same on the advice of health officials and to conserve surgical supplies, such as personal protective equipment.
Envision said this week that patient volumes are down by as much as 70% in its ambulatory surgery and anesthesia services since the onset of the pandemic, while emergency room visits are down by 30%.
The company also said that it would cut senior staffers' salaries by 50%, reduce doctors' pay in areas where patient visits are down, and furlough non-clinical workers.
A portion of Envision's roughly $5 billion term loan was trading at 60 cents on the dollar this week, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, indicating investor concerns about being paid back in full.
The $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package approved by Congress includes a $100 billion relief fund to reimburse medical providers. However, many large doctors' groups such as Envision, which has more than 25,000 physicians, anesthesiologists and other medical staff, are not eligible for aid. The only relief Envision has secured so far is a three-month advance on Medicare fee-for-service payments, which has made little difference to its finances, according to one of the sources.
""The ongoing spread of the coronavirus will make it increasingly challenging for Envision to manage its labor costs, sustain consistent revenue cycle management, and maintain subsidies that it receives from hospitals,"" credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service Inc said this week.
LEVERAGED BUYOUT DEBT
Much of Envision's debt is the legacy of KKR's $9.9 billion leveraged buyout of the company in 2018. Its rival, TeamHealth Inc, which is owned by private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX), has also been hit by a severe decline in revenue and cash flow, according to Moody's.
Envision provides medical staff to more than 1,800 clinical departments in healthcare facilities in 45 states and the District of Columbia. It also owns and operates 257 surgery centers and one surgical hospital in 35 states and the District of Columbia.
The company faced financial threats even before the emergence of the pandemic. U.S. lawmakers are considering proposals that would reduce reimbursement that Envision collects on out-of-network claims. Some patients have criticized it for so-called ""surprise billing,"" after unknowingly seeing a doctor who was not covered by their health insurance, even though the visit may have occurred in an in-network facility.
In February, Envision replaced its chief executive officer Chris Holden with healthcare services company OptumCare president James Rechtin. The company said this week said it would deploy a total of 200 doctors to the Mount Sinai Health System and nearby hospitals in New York to help with the coronavirus crisis.

The development comes at the tail end of a Sino-U.S. trade war characterised by tit-for-tat tariffs on goods and services as varied as metals and cars, which bumped up prices of U.S. made goods in China.
It also comes after Tesla suspended production at its San Francisco Bay Area plant due to the broader impact of the coronavirus, with plans to resume normal operation on May 4.
Tesla said it aims to start delivering Shanghai-made Long Range Model 3 cars from June this year, priced 339,050 yuan after subsidies.
The rear-wheel drive variant, with a driving range of over 600 kilometres before needing to be recharged, differs from the imported version which was all-wheel drive and priced 439,900 yuan.
The locally made Performance Model 3, for which deliveries are slated for the first quarter next year, will be priced 419,800 yuan, the California-based automaker said without specifying the price after subsidies. Imported Performance Model 3 vehicles were priced 509,900 yuan.
The move contrasts with a previous plan from Tesla's billionaire chief executive, Elon Musk, under which the automaker would only make more affordable versions of the Model 3 sedan at its $2 billion Shanghai factory.
Tesla sold 10,160 vehicles in China in March, versus 3,900 in February, marking its highest-ever monthly sales in the world's largest auto market, industry data showed.

Tesla also said it will cut the pay of global vice presidents in China by 30% and that of China-based director-level executives by 20%, to be consistent with operations in the United States. Salaries of other China-based staff are unchanged, it said.

The potential job cuts are expected to largely target Boeing's commercial arm, which has been under strain due to the crisis in the global airline industry, the report https://www.wsj.com/articles/boeing-considers-potential-10-cut-to-workforce-11586485509?mod=e2tw said.
The planemaker declined to a Reuters request for comment.
Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Boeing has been suspending production at various plants, including the manufacturing of its 787 airplane at its facilities in South Carolina. 
Last week, the U.S. planemaker's Chief Executive Officer Dave Calhoun outlined a plan of voluntary layoffs for employees, while warning that the pandemic would have a lasting impact on the aerospace industry.
The company had earlier freezed hiring and overtime pay except in certain critical areas to preserve cash.

(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday revived nationwide litigation accusing  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) of violating users' privacy rights by tracking their internet activity even after they logged out of the social media website.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said Facebook users could pursue several claims under federal and California privacy and wiretapping laws.
A spokeswoman for Facebook said the proposed class action was without merit, and the Menlo Park, California-based company will continue defending itself.
Facebook users had accused the company of quietly storing cookies on their browsers that tracked when they visited outside websites containing ""like"" buttons, and then selling personal profiles based on their browsing histories to advertisers.
U.S. District Judge Edward Davila in San Jose, California had dismissed the lawsuit in 2017, including claims under the federal Wiretap Act, and said the users lacked legal standing to pursue economic damages claims.
But in Thursday’s decision, Chief Judge Sidney Thomas wrote for a three-judge panel that users had a reasonable expectation of privacy, and had sufficiently alleged a ""clear invasion"" of their right to privacy.
The panel also said California law recognized a right to recoup unjustly earned profits, regardless of whether a defendant's conduct directly caused economic harm.
""Facebook's user profiles would allegedly reveal an individual's likes, dislikes, interests, and habits over a significant amount of time, without affording users meaningful opportunity to control or prevent the unauthorized exploration of their private lives,"" Thomas wrote.

Citing Facebook’s data use policy, he also said the plaintiffs ""plausibly alleged that Facebook set an expectation that logged-out user data would not be collected, but then collected it anyway.""

The development comes days after the world's biggest construction and mining equipment maker raised $2 billion through the bond market. 
Caterpillar said last month its financial position was strong. The company ended 2019 with $8.3 billion in cash and available credit facilities of $10.5 billion. 
The Deerfield, Illinois-headquartered company had also said it would withhold annual salary increases for senior executives, managers and salaried employees to contain costs due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business. 
Caterpillar also withdrew its 2020 earnings forecast in late March and suspended some operations, citing uncertainty caused by the pandemic, which has dented equipment sales and hit supply chains.

Blame it on the algos, or a White House tweet, or maybe both. Surely the hedge funds had something to do with it.
Weeks like this offer an alternative lesson: In this fiendishly complex system it’s never one thing, and it can’t always be explained.
Most will say it was the Federal Reserve, and that’s surely a big part of it. Others will talk of virus curves flattening. Some will mention short-covering. A few will cite real money re-balancing, or maybe oil producers coming to their senses or perhaps simply good old-fashioned dip buying.
Whatever the cause, U.S. stocks are leading a market-wide revival in the face of an unfolding global economic crisis. And it was all encapsulated in one of the longest short weeks investors have ever known. Here again, drawing on coverage from across Bloomberg News, is how it was in real time.
‘New Distortions’
Monday 6 April: Oil falls early, and falls hard. The world’s biggest producers had teased a meeting today to agree a potential deal to cut output, but over the weekend the virtual gathering was pushed back. Brent drops as much as 12%. It’s hard to believe, but even that double-digit slide seems tame compared with recent moves, and the spillover to equities is contained.
The latest data suggests death rates from the coronavirus pandemic could be stabilizing in Italy, Spain, France, Germany and New York. President Donald Trump sees signs the outbreak is leveling off. For investors hammered by bad news for more than a month, it is enough. Futures on the S&P 500 rise as they begin trading in Asia and stay up all day, and the underlying gauge follows suit when the cash market opens in New York.
As well as the stabilizing rate of coronavirus spread, the stabilizing markets themselves are a contributing factor. Most investors dislike volatility, so when calm returns it makes gains more likely. The VIX Index, a market-derived gauge of expected price swings on the benchmark U.S. equity gauge, today falls to the lowest level in a month.
Stimulus from central banks and governments has made all this possible. The Federal Reserve has set both the pace and the standard in this regard, and seems to deliver a new support measure daily. Today it’s a program to help speed funds to small businesses.
That kind of step doesn’t necessarily directly boost the major capital markets, but it certainly reinforces the message that policy makers are alert and proactive. The Fed actions, especially its bond buying, have depressed volatility in Treasuries which has in turn calmed credit and soothed stocks.
“Over the course of the past few weeks, we have seen markets return of some semblance of normalcy,” James McCormick (NYSE:MKC), global head of desk strategy at NatWest Markets, writes in a Monday note. “Although policies put in place to settle markets have created new distortions of their own.”
McCormick notes that all the stimulus has flipped a global dollar shortage to an over supply. Yet this will be another day of greenback strength as everyone continues to stock up on the one asset they can count on.
Meanwhile in Europe, Angela Merkel warns the pandemic is the biggest challenge since the European Union was formed, yet stocks pay no attention and close up 3.7%. The leveling off of virus deaths probably helped, but the $34 billion euros ($37 billion) of cash pumped into the financial system in a week by the region’s central bank probably hasn’t hurt.
The deluge of cash from policy makers worldwide is finally settling some nerves in the riskier reaches of the credit market. Corporate debt has been a big worry, because companies are bearing the brunt of the collapse in demand caused by the lockdown needed to contain the virus.
High-grade deals -- those which are considered lower risk -- have been flooding back in the past two weeks, and even riskier junk debt has been sold. Today brings news of the first new leveraged loan deal in a month.
Calm has also returned to the funding markets in anticipation of the the Fed buying commercial paper starting next week.
The markets are rediscovering some confidence, and maybe even a little hope. Japan’s plan to declare multiple states of emergency, the British Prime Minister being placed in intensive care, U.S. politicians back to bickering over stimulus -- nothing can derail it today.
U.S. stocks rally into the close to leave a surreal state of affairs: With 74,000 people dead globally, including 10,000 Americans, and 1.3 million confirmed cases of coronavirus, a gauge of world stocks posts the second-best day in more than a decade.
Reversal
Tuesday 7 April: The buying was frenzied on Monday, so much so that one of the best performing U.S. stocks was a cruise line, an area of business not thriving in the age of the coronavirus. The fervor carries over, and futures for the S&P 500 rise so much that the underlying gauge’s re-entry to a bull market looks a sure thing.
The bull and bear labels are an attempt to capture the general trend or mood of a market, and are typically applied to lengthy periods of gains or declines, respectively. Only this time the rebound has been exceptionally fast and the current bear market exceptionally short, stoking fear it’s just a temporary reprieve.
Read more: A Brief History of Bear-Market Rallies and What Follows
There are rational explanations, of course. The slowing death rates in several major economies, for one.
“A lot of investors had said their trigger for the bottom would be a sign of a slowdown in the rate of increase in new Covid-19 cases,” says Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance. “They seem to be implementing that playbook.”
Plus all that stimulus. The Fed has pumped enough dollars into the global system that the U.S. currency should be weakening, and today it’s finally having a miserable day. A weaker dollar tends to help equities, so the move is lending momentum to a market where no one wants to miss the bottom.
The upbeat mood isn’t limited to stocks, and conditions in credit are so strong that Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) Ltd., one of the companies hardest hit by the pandemic, is seeking hundreds of millions in an unsecured deal.
That hunger for cash is the same across vast swaths of the corporate space though, and it’s still causing trouble. As companies stockpile cash banks have to get more of it, and the market for lending between them is still far from normal.
These businesses are battening down the hatches, trying to ensure they can weather the economic storm now commerce and industry has ground to a halt. As that happened, sources of tax revenue for local administrations seized up just when the cash was needed to fight the virus. Enough anxiety is lingering in municipal bond markets that Democrats want the Fed to extend its buying to lower rated debt.
For all the talk of slowing death rates, the numbers are still horribly high and there is no end in sight to the crisis. Fatalities in New Jersey jump. New York state reports its deadliest day yet, just a few minutes before the U.K. -- where the Prime Minister remains in intensive care -- does the same.
People will claim to know the reason for what happened next, likely pointing at those virus figures. But they came hours earlier. The truth is there was no obvious trigger, except maybe a late slide in oil.
Regardless, heading into the second-half of the trading day risk appetite is riding high and the bull market for the S&P 500 looks assured. The dollar is down. Treasuries are down. The stars are aligned.
Then around lunchtime on Wall Street, the gauge turns. Having opened with a jump of 3.5%, the S&P 500 meets the closing bell in the red. The bull must wait another day.
Beckoning Bull
Wednesday 8 April: The start to the day is inauspicious. It’s the middle of the night on Wall Street when European Union finance ministers conclude an emergency teleconference that lasted more than 16 hours. They have failed to agree a plan to protect the region’s economy from the last effects of the pandemic. They’ll meet again on Thursday.
The divisions are multiple and historic and predictable, but the news knocks European equity futures and the euro lower and when bonds start trading, Italian yields spike. The country’s coronavirus outbreak is one of the worst, and its economy one of the most fragile.
This is more than just an Italian problem, though. The great risk of this outbreak, aside from the death toll, remains the economic halt triggering financial collapse which feeds back into the economy to become a self-sustaining crisis. The Fed, ECB and others have spent trillions of dollars in an attempt to avert such a scenario, and they have been successful. If the world’s largest trading bloc is too slow or its measures are too small, it could become the weak link in the chain.
European stocks, which were closed when their U.S. peers erased gains on Tuesday, slump at the open. Data showing the French economy shrank the most since World War II in the first quarter hardly helps the mood.
That gloomy economic tone contrasts with the one emanating from the U.S., where the White House is developing plans to get the economy back in action. Similar suggestions by Trump in recent weeks have been met with fear, but with evidence of a slowing virus count it gets a warmer reception from investors.
The S&P 500 opens up and stays that way. A record day for deaths for in both New York and the U.K. is quickly shrugged off. Data showing the U.S. is already in recession is a technicality. The virus spreads faster than thought -- tell them something they don’t know. The bull is back on.
The good mood extends to the credit markets, even though investment-grade issuance is finally slowing down after back-to-back record weeks.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). reckons spreads for in the high-grade space peaked in March, and the Fed actions mean the worst is behind. Sentiment in Europe is hit by the failed EU talks, but investors are keen to put cash to work, and order books for new deals are large.
Corporate demands for cash extend beyond the debt markets, however. Pressure on banks to lend is high, and it’s stoking the cost of funding. Not enough to cause panic, and central bank actions are helping, but this could be a key area to watch if the stress does not ease.
Later in the trading day, a couple of things help cement the risk-on mood. The release of minutes from the Fed’s emergency meeting in mid-March underscores how policy makers saw the need for a “forceful” response to the virus. Markets know that from the response itself, but confirmation is welcome.
“The massive fiscal and monetary stimulus has put a backstop on how far markets will fall,” says Brian O’Reilly, head of market strategy for Mediolanum International Funds. “Unlike previous recession where the authorities were slow to react this time support has been put in place much quicker so it is possible that we have seen the lows of this bear market already.”
Then oil surges late in the session after Algeria and Russia confirm a virtual gathering of major producers scheduled for Thursday will discuss output cuts of 10 million barrels a day.
Even shares in Europe, facing yet another existential crisis, end little changed. The S&P 500 finishes 23% above its March 23 low. According to one of the more popular definitions, it is back in a bull market.
Everything In Play
Thursday 9 April: The long weekend beckons. For the duration of the coronavirus crisis, the last trading day of of the week has almost always seen stocks decline. The markets stop but the pandemic does not, so many investors prefer to trim their exposures before a two-day break. Easter means three or even four days off for many participants.
Play it safe or keep riding the rally that has the S&P 500 up more than 10% this week? It would be a puzzle at the best of times, but Thursday has evolved into a day packed with potentially market moving events. EU finance chiefs are back on the phone together. The world’s major oil producers are finally meeting. Jerome Powell will give a big speech. Plus the small matter of the weekly jobless claims.
Asian stocks had a good session, thanks to the upbeat finish seen on Wall Street a few hours earlier. But S&P 500 futures are rudderless, swinging from gain to loss as the markets weigh it all up. European shares start on the front foot before paring amid a general confidence vacuum. Bonds in the region begin to tick up.
“The market has got ahead of itself essentially pricing in a V-shaped recovery,” reckons O’Reilly. “It will take some time to get back to normality, and the recovery will be more start stop than the market is factoring in.”
That end-of-week pattern is showing signs of returning. It feels technical in nature, rather than headline driven. Virus news is mixed. Spain’s death rate slows, though European nations are still contemplating longer lockdowns to stamp out the disease. The U.K. economy was shrinking even before country’s lockdown began, but Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak continues to move fast to cushion the blow.
In a twist worthy of the unprecedented market turmoil unfolding this year, the defining event of the day turns out to be none of those listed above.
At the same moment the unemployment data hits the wire -- another 6.6 million Americans claiming benefits in a week -- the Fed makes its move, announcing a series of sweeping steps to provide as much as $2.3 trillion in additional aid. These will include programs targeting small and mid-sized businesses as well as state and local governments.
For a few minutes, equity futures swing wildly as the market absorbs both this and the claims. Then the gains begin. The claims were expected, another Fed bazooka was not.
What a contrast to Europe, where the minutes of the latest ECB meeting show some members weren’t even sure about the need for new measures to protect the euro area. Still, the rising tide lifts all boats, and European stocks regain their footing.
The Fed’s benevolence goes far and wide. In a stunning move, it will now take positions in some debt recently downgraded to below investment grade as well as certain collateralized loan obligations and commercial mortgage-backed securities. The credit markets rejoice. The bonds of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co., recently cut to junk, lead the surge.
It all means that stocks will end the week in the green. Despite a record number of deaths in New York city, an underwhelming deal to cut oil production and billions in aid getting snarled up in Washington, appetite for risk holds. Investors heading into the long weekend can toast double digit gains in the S&P 500 for the second time in three weeks.
At some point, there may be questions about printing trillions of dollars -- undermining the currency and risking inflation -- to plow it into financial markets when tens of millions no longer have a job. There may be worries about what it means when one institution is effectively backstopping the global financial system with an increasingly stretched balance sheet.
But it seems that will have to wait. At the time of the closing bell in New York, with the S&P 500 about 21% from its all-time high, there are 1.5 million confirmed infections worldwide, and 93,000 dead.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, cut total compensation for Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink by 8.4% in 2019, a second straight year of decline, according to a filing on Thursday.
Fink was awarded $24.3 million in compensation last year, compared with $26.5 million in 2018, based on a calculation of his pay in line with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines.
Going by a set of calculations BlackRock prefers, Fink's total compensation for the year rose 5% to $25.25 million. The figures differ because BlackRock reports some incentive pay in a different year.
Fink is often quoted for his views on the markets and corporate governance and has been listed among the world's best CEOs by the newspaper Barron's.
BlackRock's stock rose 28% in price during 2019, its best performance since 2017, as global financial markets rebounded from a sharp selloff at the end of 2018. That compares with a 23.5% rise for a Thomson Reuters index that includes more than a dozen of BlackRock's industry rivals in the United States <.TRXFLDUSPINVM>.
The shares, which hit a near four-year low of $323.98 in late March 2020 amid a broad-market selloff, have recovered some ground to trade down about 7% for 2020.
Fink's pay is among the highest in investment management globally as well as among U.S. financial firms, according to Thomson Reuters data. In the past the company's pay to executive officers has drawn criticism from proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co LLC.

The company's president, Rob Kapito, was paid $19.3 million in 2019, a decrease of 7.6% from the prior year, according to the calculations based on regulatory guidelines. Kapito and Fink were among BlackRock's founders in 1988.

In an emergency teleconference on Thursday, they approved a plan to stave off what’s expected to be a recession of unprecedented size. The cornerstone of the proposal will be to employ the European Stability Mechanism, the euro area’s bailout fund, to offer credit lines worth as much as 240 billion euros.
While important, the agreement by the finance ministers is only one step toward the the adoption of such a package; the bloc’s leaders will have to debate, fine tune and eventually endorse the plan. That meeting could happen as soon as next week.
The pandemic has overwhelmed Europe, with the continent suffering more than 65% of the worldwide deaths attributable to the virus. German Chancellor Angela Merkel even called the threat the EU ‘s biggest challenge since its founding, and it’s one that has laid bare the bloc’s political fault lines and is testing each member state’s commitment to solidarity.

Investing.com –  The S&P ended Thursday higher, capping off a shortened trading week with its biggest weekly gain since 1974 as the Federal Reserve delivered another wave of stimulus to cushion the economic impact from the Covid-19 pandemic.
The S&P 500 gained 1.45%, taking its gains for the week to 12.1%, its biggest one-week rally since 1974. The Dow rose 1.22%, or 286 points, and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.77%.
Just weeks after its unprecedented measures to avert a financial crisis, the Federal Reserve intervened again, unveiling a $2.3 trillion stimulus package to not only create new loan programs but bolster current lending facilities too.
For the first time ever, the Fed offered loans – up to $500 billion - to states and municipalities and the central bank also expanded its bond-buying program to include both high-yield bonds and high-yield exchange traded funds (ETFs).
Following the Fed's move, Chairman Jerome Powell reassured investors the central bank is willing to continue to use its powder to pave as smooth a path for the economic recovery as needed.
""We will continue to use these powers forcefully, proactively and aggressively until we are confident that we are solidly on the road to recovery,"" Powell said.
Powell also said he saw no reason for banks to cut dividends as they are well-capitalized.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) rallied 9.6% JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) surged 9%, and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) was up 6%. 
OPEC and its allies also garnered some of the spotlight as oil prices reversed sharply amid fears the coordinated supply cut agreement would do little offset a widely expected supply overhang in the wake of a coronavirus-led hit to demand.
OPEC delegates agreed to reduce total output by 10 million barrels a day in May and June with Saudi Arabia cutting 3.3 million barrels and Russia cutting 2 million barrels, The Wall Street Journal reported.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street rose for the third time in four days on Thursday as the U.S. Federal Reserve unleashed its latest program designed to buttress local governments and businesses crushed by moves to slow the coronavirus outbreak.
In the $2.3 trillion package, the Fed said it would work with banks to offer four-year loans to companies of up to 10,000 employees and directly buy bonds of states and more populous counties and cities.
""It was unexpected and it has definitely given a shot in the arm not only to the overall equity market but also the high yield market,"" said Sal Bruno, chief investment officer at IndexIQ in New York. 
The financial index was up 4.11%, providing the biggest boost to the S&P 500, as banks rose sharply on the Fed's backstop. J.P. Morgan rose over 7.50%, leading gains on the Dow. Shares of iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond Fund climbed 5.92%.
That helped take the sting out of another tough report on the labor market, with weekly initial jobless claims topping the 6 million mark for a second straight week.
The defensive real estate and utilities sectors also rose more than 4%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 191.56 points, or 0.82%, to 23,625.13, the S&P 500 gained 25.36 points, or 0.92%, to 2,775.34 and the Nasdaq Composite added 11.85 points, or 0.15%, to 8,102.75.
The S&P 500 has gained more than 12% in the holiday-shortened week on early signs of the outbreak hitting a peak and aggressive global stimulus, on track for its best weekly performance since 1974. The Dow, up nearly 13%, was poised for its biggest weekly percentage gain since 1938. 
If gains hold through the day, the benchmark index would have logged its best week since October 1974.
While public health experts stressed the need to keep people apart to contain the contagion, the restrictions have strangled the economy and sparked widespread production cuts, layoffs and projections of a severe recession. 
In a sign that the disease's curve was flattening in New York, the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said new hospitalizations fell to a fresh low of 200, although deaths spiked to another new high. 
Major averages were well off their earlier highs, however, as oil prices reversed course and turned lower as OPEC and its allies held talks about production cuts, sending the energy sector down 3.63%. 
""The fact they are at the table, virtually talking, is a decent sign, probably not a great sign, but a decent sign,"" said Bruno.

Investing.com – Wall Street cut gains onThursday, as a sharp reversal in oil prices pressured energy stocks, offsetting fresh measures from the Federal Reserve's to support the economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.79%, or 185 points, the S&P 500 added 0.83%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.14%.
Energy, meanwhile, fell 4.05%, paced by a sharp reversal in oil prices as investors awaited further details from the virtual meeting between OPEC and its allies.
OPEC reportedly agreed in principle to cut output by 10 million barrels per day for May to June, and will look to other nations to cut output by 5 million bpd, Reuters reported, citing sources.
WTI futures crude settled at $22.76, down 9.29% after surging more than 12% intraday.
The move lower in oil soured earlier investor optimism, which had followed bullish comments from Fed Chairman Jay Powell.  
In a sign that the Fed's bazooka is at little risk of running out of ammo, Powell said the economy would have to on be on a solid footing before the Fed pulls back and expected a ""robust"" recovery to follow once the pandemic was under control.
""We will continue to use these powers forcefully, proactively and aggressively until we are confident that we are solidly on the road to recovery,"" Powell said.
""There is every reason to believe that the economic rebound, when it comes, can be robust,"" the Fed chairman added.
The optimistic tone arrived as the U.S. central bank pledged $2.3 trillion to create new loan programs and bolster its current measures, including $600 billion for its Main Street Lending Fund to support for small and medium sized businesses.  
The central bank also expanded its corporate credit lending facility by $850 billion and for the first time ever offered up to $500 billion in loans to states and municipalities. The Fed will also be able to buy junk corporate debt and high-yield ETFs for the first time, which also helped segments of the market.
The move overshadowed data showing initial U.S. jobless claims fell 6.6 million for the week ended April 4.
Financials, mostly banks, rose sharply on the Fed's move, with  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) up 8% JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) up 7%, and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) up 4.5%. Powell also said he saw no reason for banks to cut dividends as they are well-capitalized.
With the unprecedented action from the Federal Reserve expected to exacerbate the hunt for yield, utilities – often used as a bond proxy that does well in low interest rate environments – also led the broader move higher, up 6%."

1143,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 02:10PM ET</span>","U.S. small business rescue program gets capital and liquidity clarity, brings fintechs onboard","By Michelle Price and Anna Irrera
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government's $350 billion effort to help ailing small businesses took several steps forward on Thursday as regulators confirmed banks would not have to hold capital against loans made under the program, and non-bank lenders were admitted to it.
The capital treatment of loans was one of several issues banks had been seeking clarity on since the program was launched last Friday, while non-bank fintech lenders had also been pushing for days to be allowed to participate.
On Wednesday evening, the Small Business Administration and the U.S. Treasury Department, which are jointly administering the program, published the application form for non-banks, subject to certain requirements.
That means companies like Kabbage, PayPal (O:PYPL), BlueVine, OnDeck (N:ONDK) and Square (N:SQ) can directly join the program without having to partner with a traditional bank, increasing options for small and minority-owned businesses, many of which have struggled to find lenders to accept their applications. 
Less than half of small businesses had turned to a bank for a loan in the past five years, according to Fed data released on Tuesday. Smaller businesses and those with black or Hispanic owners were more likely to have used online lenders, the Fed said.
""This is a pivotal moment. Fintech lenders, like Square, PayPal, BlueVine - many of these have massive install bases of U.S. customers,"" said Jared Hecht, CEO of Fundera, a small business loan marketplace that is helping to funnel applications to the scheme's participating lenders. 
""Most importantly, these lenders are fast. They’re built for speed.""
Launched as part of a $2.3 trillion congressional economic relief package, the $350 billion program allows small businesses hurt by the coronavirus pandemic to apply for government-guaranteed loans with participating lenders. Those loans will be forgiven if they are largely used to cover payroll costs.
As of Wednesday evening, more than $100 billion in funds had been authorized, according to a senior administration official, although it remains unclear how much of that cash has so far made its way into the hands of small businesses.
Banks, already straining under hundreds of thousands of applications, were bracing for another influx on Friday, when the program opens up to individual proprietors and contractors. Banks are still awaiting government guidance on how to process those applications, as well as key SBA language allowing them to release funds for loans already approved, according to industry officials.

The U.S. Federal Reserve also on Thursday announced the terms of a liquidity facility for the program, saying it would dish out cash at a rate of 35 basis points, taking program loans as collateral. While that will help smaller lenders with limited balance sheets to front more loans, fintechs are not yet able to participate - although the Fed said it is looking to expand eligibility.

1144,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 02:05PM ET</span>",Airbus's landmark jet output cut faces crucial test,"By Tim Hepher and Johanna Decorse
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus's (PA:AIR) decision to cut output of its best-selling jet by a third amid coronavirus marks a huge shift for the European planemaker, which has enjoyed virtually unbroken growth since it began competing toe-to-toe with Boeing (N:BA) almost 20 years ago.
The company's first significant cut in A320-family output, to 40 jets a month, brings production to the lowest level since 2012 and will be implemented in May or June, unions said.
Airbus shares, which have fallen around 50% this year due to the crisis, wobbled on Thursday but ended up 2% as several analysts said the company had acted swiftly to reset output.
But with all but a handful of airlines shunning deliveries as they hoard cash to survive the crisis, several industry officials and economists suggested the rate may be optimistic. 
""We have too many planes,"" said Avitas senior vice-president Adam Pilarski, who has long warned of a jet market bubble - though nothing on the scale of the meltdown in air travel seen since quarantines rippled across the globe last month.
Airlines are warning of $252 billion in lost revenues and 38% lower traffic, many times higher than past corrections.
With Boeing's competing 737 MAX still grounded after more than a year of safety reviews following two accidents, Airbus signalled on Wednesday that it was ready to act again if needed.
""It is a first step,"" said Rob Morris, chief consultant at UK-based Ascend by Cirium, adding more reductions could be needed because of a large potential jet surplus.
That contrasts with 2001 when Boeing cut output sharply after 9/11 attacks, while Airbus - reluctant then as now to cut output due to rigid European labour laws - spotted an opening with upstart budget carriers and went on a selling spree.
One such carrier, easyJet (L:EZJ), is now one of Airbus's top customers and says it is deferring deliveries.
On Wednesday, Airbus was forced by the scale of the crisis to act as Boeing's 737 MAX remained grounded for safety reasons - having also played an unplanned role in curtailing supply that one source likened to a ""spent shock-absorber"".
Airbus ""will have to share the (market) pain with Boeing,"" Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa said in a recent note. 
AIRCRAFT RETIREMENTS
To defend its new output rate, experts said Airbus appeared to be banking on a sharp increase in retirements of older jets, echoing moves seen after 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis.
Airlines have an incentive in bad times to idle jets early to avoid costly scheduled repair visits. But low oil prices like those seen today tend to push airlines in the other direction.
According to Ascend by Cirium, the new Airbus target assumes every plane delivered this year will replace an older one being taken out of service. That suggests borrowing some demand from future years when some of those jets were due to be retired.
Other tools used in past crises include pressure on leasing companies to take delivery. They place large speculative orders for good prices and are expected to pull their weight in a downturn - but they too are reeling as airlines hand back jets.
Even so, market sources said, Airbus will need to make use of its relatively strong balance sheet to spur deliveries by providing finance to airlines or offering advances or discounts.
Unlike in past downturns, the industry is currently facing a fundamental drop in demand everywhere, meaning there is little room for error if Airbus's output calculations go awry.

""Right now it looks like a tug of war between Airbus and airlines to see who should store some of those planes,"" an aircraft finance veteran said, asking not to be named.

Italy, the epicentre of the virus emergency in Europe, imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 9. Two weeks later non-essential businesses including car, clothing and furniture manufacturing were ordered to close. 
That forced Fiat Chrysler (FCA) to close its Italian plants even though it had already introduced extraordinary security measures to protect workers. 
""The main points of the accord deal both with a preparatory phase and a restarting one, which will be gradual and will not involve all of the FCA production sites straight away,"" a statement by the FIM union said.
The agreed measures include sanitising premises, taking workers' temperatures, providing safety devices such as face masks and hand gel, rearranging assembly layouts, marking floors to ensure one-metre between workers and staggering shifts.
The head of the UILM union Gianluca Ficco said that production at light commercial vehicle maker Sevel, assembly lines for Jeep's Compass in Melfi in southern Italy and the new electric 500 in Turin's Mirafiori, along with some processes in mechanics plants, would be among the first to re-start once Rome gives the green light.
With plants closed and demand for cars almost non-existent, carmakers are burning cash and pushing to relaunch operations as soon as possible, starting with the most profitable and appealing models. 
""The health and security of workers are the main priorities for FCA... The functioning of our industrial system is fundamental for our group, but we do not admit any derogation to people's security,"" FCA said in a statement. 
The unions also agreed to adopt a rotating furlough system to reduce the financial impact on workers' pay, FIM said. 
A third union, FIOM, said that the agreement would be valid until the end of July and that each factory would need to find ""the best solution to protect workers"".

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte suggested on Thursday that some restrictions could be gradually lifted, provided the spread of the disease continued to slow, but an extension of a national lockdown due to expire on April 13 cannot be ruled out.

1152,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 12:09PM ET</span>",Surging Ford Bonds Lead Credit Market Rally After Fed Rescue,"(Bloomberg) -- Credit risk is easing dramatically now that the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented effort to save corporate debt just got even bigger, adding a backstop to what could be hundreds of billions of dollars worth of bonds that are expected to fall to junk.
The central bank will expand its bond-buying program to include debt that was investment-grade rated as of March 22 but was later downgraded to no lower than BB-, or three levels into high yield, according to a statement Thursday. It’ll also buy exchange-traded funds that track speculative-grade debt, which surged the most in a decade following the announcement. All together, the programs will support as much as $850 billion in credit.
These latest steps provide a huge lifeline to companies like Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. that will now have the support from one of the biggest sources of demand in the world. Its bonds are posting the biggest gains in the high-yield index, with its 7.45% debt due 2031 up 15 cents on the dollar, according to Trace. The cost to protect the automaker’s debt against default for five years dropped more than 17 basis points to 953 basis points, according to ICE (NYSE:ICE) Data Services.
Ford is so far the largest fallen angel of this cycle with more than $37 billion entering the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) high-yield index this month. Strategists say that’s just the tip of the iceberg, with most expecting the total to exceed $200 billion this year.
Derivative indexes that track credit default risk are notably easing, especially in high yield, which wasn’t originally part of the Fed’s program that was unveiled on March 23. The junk CDX is up more than 3 points, while investment-grade is nearly 15 basis points tighter.
The new purchases will likely add to what’s already been a substantial rally in credit since the Fed first stepped into the market. Investment-grade spreads have compressed 120 basis points since then, and high-yield spreads are about 230 basis points tighter.
“I’m sure there will be all sorts of reasons to ‘fade’ this rally in credit and equities, but I completely disagree,” said Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities. “I’m already in risk on mode, but wouldn’t be afraid to add more.”
Many investors thought the Fed’s initial program was right to just focus on investment-grade debt, as those companies tend to be the biggest employers and more systemically important to financial markets. But the expansion opens up a whole new set of securities that are on the cusp of junk, where the Fed will step in as a buyer in a sea of forced selling.
U.S.
Credit risk gauges are easing following the Fed’s additional injection to buy some junk bonds. There are no new deals ahead of the holiday weekend, and markets close at 2 p.m. in New York.
Europe
When LVMH issued new euro bonds on April 1, the spread it paid had quadrupled from when it was last in the market in early February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Earlier today, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) sold 10-year yen bonds at a yield premium of 105 basis points, more than double the 50 basis points it paid to sell similar-maturity notes a little over half a year ago.
Asia
In Asia, corporations have been slower to return to the market but a $10 billion sale from Qatar this week amassed about $45 billion of investor orders. It too paid a premium over its existing notes to get the deal done.

1153,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 11:55AM ET</span>",U.S. Treasury chief to brief Trump on aviation aid review,"By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski
WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he plans to brief President Donald Trump on the status of government's review of requests for $32 billion in grants from passenger airlines, cargo carriers and airport contractors.
""We hope to get to a lot of the airlines starting tomorrow and over the weekend with preliminary information. And it is our objective to make sure, as I've said, this is not a bailout, but that airlines have the liquidity to keep their workers in place. So that's the next big thing we'll be rolling out,"" Mnuchin said in an interview with CNBC.
Passenger airlines are eligible for $25 billion in cash grants for payroll, while cargo carriers can get $4 billion in cash grant and airport contractors like caterers and airplane cleaners are eligible for $3 billion in grants.
Mnuchin has repeatedly said the government will receive compensation for the grants, but airline unions and some Democrats have urged him not to demand equity or warrants.
The talks have been ongoing and Treasury asked airlines seeking government payroll support to provide additional detailed information on capital structure, liquidity and loyalty programs, people briefed on the matter told Reuters Wednesday.
As Treasury reviews applications for government aid, it has asked for details such as airlines' daily cash burn rates, when they expect to run out of cash and their best estimates for projected wages and benefits between April 1 and Sept. 30, they said.
Treasury has also requested information on the value and historical cash flow of airlines' loyalty programs, as well as an overview of all unencumbered assets such as aircraft, engines and spare parts.
Airlines continue to slash flights as travel demand dwindles to less than 5% of normal levels. On Wednesday, the number of people screened at U.S. airports fell to a new low of 94,931, down from a normal 2.23 million.
JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) on Wednesday asked the U.S. Transportation Department for emergency approval to temporarily suspend service to 11 U.S. airports, including Dallas, Houston and Minneapolis. It also announced was consolidating flights in five U.S. metropolitan areas and suspending flights at Baltimore, Providence, New York LaGuardia and San Jose airports.

 Spirit Airlines  (N:SAVE) also asked approval to halt flights to two dozen airports, saying requiring flights ""will rapidly exhaust Spirit’s financial resources and manpower, while adding virtually nothing to those cities access to air transportation.""

Investors are also keeping a close eye on OPEC+, which had started its virtual meeting. Oil prices swung sharply, with WTI futures jumping more than 10% on a report that Saudi Arabia and Russia had agreed to cuts of up to 20 million bpd, and then falling back down to be up just 3% after there was no cofirmation of such a deal.
The Fed's measures, which had been outlined before but not detailed, earmark another $2.3 trillion in support for the U.S. economy as the Covid-19 pandemic pushes more and more Americans into unemployment. The Labor Department said that another 6.61 million people filed initial claims for jobless benefits last week, more than the 5.25 million expected by economists beforehand, and only fractionally less than an upwardly revised record of 6.88 million the week before.
For the first time, the Fed also said it will buy high-yield corporate debt through exchange-traded funds, although it will still devote the bulk of the relevant program to buying investment-grade credit.  It will also buy the bonds of so-called 'fallen angels' - those recently downgraded to junk from investment grade, if they were downgraded after March 22.
As such, it will be able to depress the borrowing costs of companies like Ford Motor (NYSE:F), which lost its last investment grade credit rating on March 25. Ford stock rose 10%.

1162,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 11:18AM ET</span>","Powell Says Banks Well-Capitalized, No Need to Halt Dividends","(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he sees no reason “at this time” why U.S. banks need to suspend dividends to preserve capital amid the deepening coronavirus economic crisis.
Powell, speaking Thursday on a Brookings Institution webcast, said lenders currently have strong capital buffers to absorb financial shocks. Powell added that the biggest U.S. banks have already halted share buybacks to preserve cash, a decision he called a “good thing.”
The Fed chairman’s remarks echo those of U.S. bank leaders.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). Chief Executive Officer David Solomon vowed last week to keep paying the firm’s dividend, saying that such distributions make up a much smaller part of capital returns to investors than buybacks.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) CEO James Gorman and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). CEO Michael Corbat have also pledged to maintain dividends.
Questions about halting dividends have gotten a lot more attention after many European banks shelved them in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

The $14.8 billion iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, or HYG, surged about 7.5% -- the most since January 2009 -- after the Fed said Thursday that it will expand its corporate bond buying program to include debt from companies that recently lost their investment-grade rating. The announcement also gave a boost of the same magnitude to the $8.5 billion SPDR Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) High Yield Bond ETF, or JNK.
Concerns about the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak had reignited fears about “fallen angels,” as companies that are downgraded to speculative grade are known. Fidelity estimated that roughly $215 billion of U.S. debt could lose its investment-grade status this year, with the energy sector most at risk.
“Fears about how the high-yield market would absorb the likely wave of oncoming ‘fallen angels’ has been weighing heavily on the market,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. “The announcement is a significant relief, as reflected in the HY market’s response.”
Thursday’s move expands the size and scope of the Fed’s previously announced Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facilities, which enabled the central bank to purchase of up to 10% of an issuer’s outstanding bonds and up to 20% of the assets of eligible ETFs. While the majority of the Fed’s purchases will be aimed at ETFs whose primary objective is U.S. high-grade bond exposure, “the remainder will be in ETFs whose primary investment objective is exposure to U.S. high-yield corporate bonds,” according to a primer.

1173,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 08:35AM ET</span>",Exclusive: JPMorgan looking to offload Saudi and UAE sovereign fund loans - sources,"By Davide Barbuscia
DUBAI (Reuters) - JPMorgan (N:JPM) is seeking to sell at a discount loans raised by the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, according to two sources and a document, as banks brace for a borrowing spree in the Gulf due to low oil prices.
Banks tend to hold loans they grant to Gulf governments in their portfolios, only selling down their exposure quietly through bilateral transactions as they don't want to be seen as dumping the paper in the market, two banking sources said.
This helps them maintain good relationships with the borrowers in light of future funding requests, but with loans raised by oil-rich Gulf states generally trading at par value, there are also few incentives for other banks to buy them in the secondary market.
However, as Gulf government and state entities seek to raise funds after the recent plunge in oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic strained budgets, banks have been trying to make room for new borrowing requests by selling down some of their exposure, the two sources said.
JPMorgan this week tried to sell down loans it has made to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Abu Dhabi's Mubadala, among a few other regional names, according to a loan document known as axe sheet, seen by Reuters.
The bank was considering selling at least $50 million of PIF loan paper due in 2023 at an indicative price of 98.75 cents on the dollar, and at least 70 million euros of Mubadala loans at 99 cents on the dollar, the document showed.
JPMorgan and Mubadala declined to comment, while PIF did not respond to a request for comment.
OFFLOADING
Other banks with large exposures to Gulf governments have also tried to offload loans over the past few weeks, a Gulf-based source said.
""Everyone wants money these days and we can't give everyone money,"" said the source, speaking anonymously due to commercial sensitivities.
""Even if you put aside the current market environment, this is a region which has seen an increase in borrowing requests over the past few years so we need to make room.""
The source stressed that the sale of the loans was not a sign of a change in the creditors' financial condition, with repayments due as per the agreements. 
The PIF debt JPMorgan has been trying to sell is part of an $11 billion debut syndicated loan the sovereign wealth fund raised in 2018 from 15 banks, including the U.S. lender.
Gulf states have borrowed tens of billions of dollars since oil prices collapsed in 2014/2015, taking advantage of low global rates to refill their oil-dependent state coffers, with Saudi Arabia alone borrowing more than $100 billion through loans and bonds over the past few years.
""Generally the expectation this year is there will be a lot of asks for the region ... so you make room ahead of that,"" the source said.
PIF - the investment fund at the centre of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to diversify the Saudi economy - raised an additional $10 billion loan last year.

Some banks were hesitant to participate in that deal given the low interest rate on offer and in light of their already big exposure to Saudi entities, sources have told Reuters. [nL8N24Q55B]

PARIS (Reuters) - Credit rating agency Standard & Poor's (S&P) delivered downgrades on Thursday to France's top car companies  Renault  (PA:RENA) and PSA (PA:PEUP), cutting Renault's bonds to 'junk' status due to the impact of the new coronavirus.
S&P downgraded Renault to 'BB+/B' from 'BBB-/A-3', meaning it had ascribed a ""junk bond"" status to those Renault corporate bonds.
""French automaker Renault has an ample liquidity cushion and can, in our view, count on guarantees from the French state,"" S&P wrote in a research note.
""We nevertheless expect Renault's earnings, free cash flow generation (FOCF), and financial position to weaken materially in 2020, following an already challenging 2019,"" added S&P.
S&P kept a BBB- rating on Peugeot-company PSA, but it cut its outlook on PSA to ""negative"" from ""stable"".
Shares in Renault and PSA were both down by around 1% in late session trading.

Data earlier this month showed that French car registrations had dropped by more than 72% in March due to the coronavirus outbreak and lockdown ordered by authorities to fight the epidemic spread.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to edge lower Thursday, with investors happy to bank some of the recent gains ahead of key unemployment data that could illustrate the depth of the economic slowdown.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), futures for the S&P 500  traded 10 points, or 0.4%, lower, futures for the Nasdaq down 21 points, or 0.3%. The Dow futures contract fell 10 points, or 0.1%. 
These cash indices are at one month highs, with the Dow and theS&P 500 now in bull territories, over 25% higher than the March 23 lows.
U.S. weekly  jobless claims have become the go-to economic indicator to capture the latest impact of the coronavirus outbreak, and this week’s report is due at 8:30 AM ET.
Economists expect that claims eased off only a little from the previous week's record 6.65 million to 5.25 million, while continuing claims are seen coming in at a staggering 8 million. This eclipses the 6 million odd seen in 2009 during the financial crisis.
Investors will also be able to hear from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT) as he takes part in a webinar on the state of the economy, taking questions from the audience and viewers via e-mail and Twitter.
At the same time the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporters including Russia will hold an emergency meeting to discuss cutting output to stabilize world markets. A reduction of approaching 10 million barrels a day is expected as pressure mounts to bring supply back into line with collapsing demand.
On Friday, oil ministers from G-20 countries will discuss whether to make their own contributions.
At 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 6.8% higher at $26.82 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 4.2% to $34.23, having earlier touched a one-month high.
Meanwhile, the number of Covid-19 cases in the U.S. has climbed over 432,000, with the national death toll surpassing 14,000. At least 1,939 people died of the virus Wednesday, marking the deadliest day in the U.S. since the crisis started.
In corporate news, Walt  Disney  Company (NYSE:DIS) will be in focus, with its shares jumping over 6% in after hours trading, after it announced that its new video streaming service has reached more than 50 million subscribers since its launch five months ago. That’s almost double the number when it last detailed these figures in February.
On the flip side, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) could struggle Thursday after announcing that fiscal second-quarter earnings will be chopped roughly in half from a year ago due to the spread of the coronavirus through China and the U.S. Starbucks shares dropped 2.2% in after hours trading.
Additionally, gold futures rose 1.3% to $1,705.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded at $1.0859, up 0.1%."
1176,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 06:55AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Wall Street firm dangled up to 175% returns to investors using U.S. aid programs,"By Lawrence Delevingne
BOSTON (Reuters) - A New York investment firm pitched wealthy investors in recent days on a way to make returns of 22% to 175% using U.S. government programs designed to help Americans keep their jobs and boost the coronavirus-stricken economy, according to a marketing document seen by Reuters.
Following questions posed by Reuters, Arcadia Investment Partners LLC, which has about $1 billion under management, said it had put its plans on hold.
The idea was in “formative stages” and the firm was not “presently moving forward with this strategy given reasons that include uncertainty surrounding the regulations,” Dahlia Loeb, managing director at Arcadia, told Reuters in an email on Wednesday. She did not elaborate further.
The firm had sent the pitch as recently as this weekend to ""a limited number of sophisticated investors,"" according to the marketing materials, which are dated April 4 and marked confidential. In an email sent Sunday, and seen by Reuters, Loeb wrote it was a “highly time sensitive opportunity” and had offered to discuss it with investors that day or early in the week. 
Arcadia’s pitch offers a glimpse into how some private investors are looking to quickly take advantage of the unprecedented government intervention after the novel coronavirus brought economic activity to a screeching halt.
Under Arcadia’s plan, which has not been previously reported, the firm would have raised money to finance loans to small businesses guaranteed as part of a $2.2 trillion government aid package, the marketing materials show. It called the new vehicle the “Paycheck Protection Program Fund,"" named after the government initiative for small businesses launched on April 3.
Arcadia proposed to juice profits by borrowing 90% to 95% of the money from funding markets that were backstopped in recent weeks by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
'DESIGN FLAW'
The small business lending program has had a chaotic start, with banks and companies saying more crucial details need to be worked out. Under Arcadia’s plan, the actual loans would have been made by online lending platforms. Some such lenders said they are yet to be approved by the government to make the loans.
Had Arcadia proceeded with its plan, its investors would have profited handsomely from a virtually risk-free investment. Arcadia typically generates returns to investors of between 8% and 12%, depending on the type of investment, according to a March regulatory filing. The potential returns would also be far above other options available to investors. The U.S. 10-year Treasury note, for example, currently yields around 0.77%.
Lucian Bebchuk, a corporate governance expert at Harvard Law School who reviewed key assumptions of Arcadia’s pitch for Reuters, said that the potential returns, assuming they are estimated correctly, ""suggests a design flaw on the part of the government’s program.""
A spokeswoman for the Fed declined to comment, while a representative for the U.S. Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment.
In the past, large-scale government intervention has engendered fierce debates about whether they create perverse incentives and lead to unintended consequences.
ARCADIA’S PLAN
Founded by former Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette banker Kammy Moalemzadeh in 2001, Arcadia makes investments in areas such as private equity, real estate and distressed credit funds, according to its March regulatory filing. It said its investors include investment funds and wealthy people, including hedge fund managers and chief executives.
In the marketing document, the firm said it would work with an unidentified asset manager on the plan. That asset manager, which Arcadia said has $17 billion under management and was founded in 2012, has experience financing small business and consumer credit through online lending platforms, with more than $6 billion dedicated to that strategy.
If the small business borrowers use the money for employee payroll and other approved expenses, the U.S. Small Business Administration would forgive the 24-month loans in as little as three months, Arcadia wrote in the document. The loans carry a fixed interest rate of 1%.  The remaining loans will be repurchased within 24 months, according to the Arcadia materials.
In its document, Arcadia did not give the size of the anticipated fund. But it noted that investors would contribute 5% to 10% of the equity of the new fund. The rest would initially be borrowed from the repurchase agreement, or ""repo"" market, which the Fed has backstopped in recent weeks.
After three months, the fund would borrow from the Fed’s Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, another funding initiative launched last month to help the economy.

Investors in the Arcadia fund would pay no management fee but would be charged 20% of profits, the document shows.

1177,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 06:54AM ET</span>",Flows to India Stock Funds Climb Despite Brutal March Selloff,"(Bloomberg) -- Inflows into Indian equity funds climbed to a one-year high in March even as the broader market witnessed a record selloff on concerns over the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Equity plans received 117.2 billion rupees ($1.53 billion), according to data released by the Association of Mutual Funds in India. That’s the highest since March 2019 and the fourth straight month of increased inflows.
The stickiness of the flows will be tested next month when the full impact of the nationwide lockdown, which began late March and may be extended, will be felt. India’s key equity indexes last month logged their worst declines since 2008, as the nation’s assets got swept up in the virus-fueled rout that erased trillions of dollars from global stock values.
“April will likely see tepid flows both on account of fear as well as operational issues in investing for offline investors,” said Vidya Bala, head of research and co-founder at Chennai-based Primeinvestor.in. “In the early stage of a correction, investors feel emboldened to average. This trend may not continue with how the pandemic has turned out since late March.”
India’s policy makers are trying to cushion an economy that was slowing even before the coronavirus outbreak. Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered a 21-day nationwide lockdown until April 14 after the country witnessed a steady rise in cases. More than 5,900 people have been infected in India with the death toll at 178, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University.
Liquid Funds
The uncertainty hit liquid funds, which saw withdrawals of 1.1 trillion rupees, versus an outflow of 438.3 billion rupees in February, according to AMFI data. This the biggest withdrawal from the category since September. The product is used mostly by companies to park short-term cash and typically see a spike in redemption at the end of a quarter.
The withdrawals from liquid funds accounted for the bulk of the net outflow of 2.13 trillion rupees across all mutual fund segments, the data showed. That is the biggest decline since September 2018 when defaults by the IL&FS Group sparked an exodus from debt plans.
Even so, AMFI is banking on the robust liquidity from institutional investors that has helped cushion the market against large outflows sparked by global shocks in recent years. Mutual funds and insurance firms together invested a net 555.95 billion rupees ($7.3 billion) into shares in March even as global funds yanked out a record $8.4 billion.
“We expect pace of inflows into equity funds to remain robust as every dip is being used by investors to buy and the industry has been able to move most transactions online,” said N. S Venkatesh, chief executive officer at the AMFI.

1178,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 06:00AM ET</span>",Saudi Wealth Fund Builds Stakes in European Energy Giants,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund has built up stakes in four major European energy firms, including about $200 million in Equinor ASA (OL:EQNR), as the oil-rich kingdom navigates the coronavirus pandemic and plummeting crude prices.
The Public Investment Fund amassed shares in Norway’s largest producer mostly through the open market last week, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified, adding that it’s unclear exactly when the fund bought the holding or if it’s still buying. It also bought stakes in Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc,  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) and  ENI  (MI:ENI) SpA, according to another person with knowledge of the matter.
Saudi Arabia’s $320 billion sovereign wealth fund, run by Yasir Al-Rumayyan and controlled by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is taking advantage of a slump in stock market valuations as it steps up deal-making to become the world’s biggest manager of sovereign capital, the people said. The fund last month built an 8.2% stake in cruise operator Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp. after its shares slumped due to the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.
The PIF is a key part of the crown prince’s efforts to diversify the Saudi economy away from its dependence on oil and has made a series of high-profile investments in recent years. Its amassed holdings in Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., as well as committing giant sums to Softbank Group Corp.’s Vision Fund.
Oil Policy
Still, building stakes in some of the largest international oil companies is unusual, especially as Al-Rumayyan also heads up state-owned crude producer  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222). He’s also a close adviser to the crown prince, who sets the kingdom’s oil production policy and influences prices globally.
Representatives for the PIF and all of the oil companies declined to comment.
On top of the slump of oil prices and a meltdown in global markets, Gulf sovereign wealth funds are channeling some of their billions back home to counter slowing economic growth triggered by the coronavirus. The decline in assets from funds in countries such as Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia could exceed $300 billion this year, according to the Institute of International Finance, the industry’s global association.
In contrast to 2015, the last time crude prices collapsed, Saudi Arabia will likely focus on borrowing rather than drawing down PIF funds, according to the IIF. Last month, Finance Minister Mohammed Al Jadaan said the kingdom would fund an expected larger deficit through borrowing more rather than drawing down reserves.
Equinor shares slumped just over 30% this year before rising 18% last week, amid a broad recovery for European energy majors, giving the company a current market value of about $44 billion.
The Wall Street Journal was first to report that the PIF has acquired stakes in Shell, Total and Eni, worth about $1 billion along with the Equinor holding, citing people familiar.
Norwegian daily Finansavisen this week reported that JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.’s unit in Saudi Arabia had bought 14.5 million shares in Equinor on behalf of an unnamed client, followed by another 6.4 million shares."

1180,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 05:41AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Markets Test Key Retracement Level as Crisis Nears End of Phase 1,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets rose on Thursday ahead of the long Easter weekend, buoyed by increasing signs that the continent is reaching the end of the first phase of the Covid-19 outbreak.
Over the last two months, markets have had to adjust to the biggest synchronized shock in living memory. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 fell 62% from its peak in February to its trough of 268.57 on March 16, as investors were forced to trash all their existing models on future cashflows.
A clear policy response from central bank and – to a lesser degree – governments since then has allowed a respectable rebound. At 327.68 as of 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), the Stoxx 600 has almost perfectly completed a standard 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the Q1 disaster. A brief push above the 331.7 level on Thursday failed to last, however.
Germany’s DAX has posted one of the strongest rebounds in recent days, on the perception that its heavy weighting of manufacturers will, ultimately, translate into a quicker and more thorough recovery than indices dominated by service sectors. It also helps that Germany’s response to the medical emergency has been – at least at first glance – more successful than that of its neighbors, with one of the highest testing rates and lowest mortality rates in the region.
But even so, the DAX at 10,412 is still some 70 points short of a 38.2% retracement. At this Easter time, cautious investors are likely to remain doubting Thomases until they see such levels convincingly broken.
A positive breakout, in turn, is likely to depend on how the second phase of the Covid-19 saga plays out. The recovery is unlikely to be smooth. Restrictions will be lifted much as they were imposed – in piecemeal, stop-start fashion, without any consistent messaging across the continent.  The effects of high unemployment or underemployment on consumption remain impossible to predict accurately. Markets will stay particularly sensitive to any evidence of secondary infection waves in China.
Germany at least has profited from having more fiscal space to mobilize a comprehensive package of stabilization measures, including a now-unlimited government loan guarantee scheme for its small and medium-sized enterprises, the famed Mittelstand. Arguably, it stands to extend its relative gains vis-a-vis other European markets as a cancelled summer tourist season diverts more consumption to the domestic market.
The support measures will still be direly needed though – the Federal Labor Agency reported on Thursday that the number of businesses filing for government wage subsidies under the so-called ‘Kurzarbeit’ scheme rose by 40% to 650,000 last week. Chairman Detlef Scheele said the Agency won’t have reliable data on the actual level of subsidies needed for a few weeks yet, but the number of people using it is sure to exceed the 1.4 million peak of the last crisis. Peak uncertainty may have passed, but it remains painfully high."
1181,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 05:40AM ET</span>",European companies ditch dividends to save cash,"(Reuters) - European companies are scrapping dividends to maintain cash and comply with regulations in response to the financial havoc caused by the spread of the new coronavirus.
Companies have been racing to cut dividends as lockdowns of major cities crush businesses, drying up their cashflows, with banking authorities and national governments also rushing to regulate financial institutions and state-owned companies.
More than 80 of the top 600 listed companies in Europe cut or scrapped dividends between Feb. 24 and April 8, a Reuters analysis found. Among the latest to suspend dividends were French aerospace and defence supplier  Thales  (PA:TCFP) and Swedish metal-cutting tools and mining gear maker  Sandvik  (ST:SAND) on Tuesday. UK-listed companies could cancel about $60 billion in dividends this year, according to a report by analytics company Link Group.

1182,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 05:20AM ET</span>","Virgin Australia grounds almost all domestic flights, seeks government aid","By Jamie Freed
SYDNEY (Reuters) -  Virgin Australia  Holdings Ltd (AX:VAH) said on Thursday it would ground all domestic flights, except a single daily Sydney-Melbourne service through June 15, as it continues to seek government aid to weather the coronavirus crisis.
Rival Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN), which is in a stronger financial position, said on Thursday it had also made more cuts to its domestic network but for the time being it was still flying to every capital city and over 25 regional destinations. 
Virgin has asked the government for a A$1.4 billion ($862.68 million) loan that could be converted to equity in certain circumstances.
Government ministers have indicated that any help is likely to be on an industry-wide basis rather than specific to Virgin. 
""We continue to talk to airline executives on a regular basis as we navigate this unprecedented situation,"" Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack said on Thursday. 
""All levels of government, airports, airlines and the whole sector will need to work together to ensure Australia's aviation industry emerges from this crisis in the best position possible.""
Virgin said its latest capacity cuts were due to government restrictions that had lowered travel demand. 
Qantas said it expected to carry 95% fewer passengers over the Easter holiday weekend than last year. It is flying five flights per week from Sydney to Melbourne, down from almost 50 a day before the virus struck.
Virgin had already cut all international flights except government rescue charters, put most of its workforce on leave and permanently cut all pilots at low-cost arm Tigerair Australia and all crew based in New Zealand. 
It will continue local and international cargo flights, the airline said.
Virgin's shares are tightly controlled by a group of foreign airlines including Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL), Etihad Airways and Chinese conglomerate HNA Group that have also seen a sharp deterioration in revenues due to the coronavirus crisis.
The Australian government has already announced some aid to the broader airline industry, including refunding and waiving charges such as domestic air traffic control fees worth A$715 million and A$198 million in support for regional aviation.
The coronavirus has infected about 1.5 million people globally, while over 87,000 have died, disrupting lives and businesses as governments impose lockdowns to curb the outbreak.

1183,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 05:18AM ET</span>",How a Cascade of Job Losses Left America’s Safety Net in Shreds,"(Bloomberg) -- In Michigan and New York you can only call on certain days of the week, depending on your last name. In New Jersey, it’s hourly slots based on your social security number. Ask for help in Texas and you might end up engaging with a guy called Larry, who’s really just a bot.Across the U.S., state governments are scrambling –- and sometimes failing -- to cope with the historic surge in unemployment claims triggered by the coronavirus recession.Data due Thursday will likely pile new records on top of the already staggering toll: some 10 million claims in two weeks. Yet numbers can’t capture all the strains that brought social infrastructure in the world’s biggest economy close to breaking point, and tested the patience of millions plunged into a sudden economic crisis.
Call-centers that process applications can barely hire people fast enough. Answering services are overwhelmed. Decades-old computer systems aren’t up to the task, forcing people in Florida this week to wait hours for the paper forms that turned out to be the only way to avoid an overcrowded online system and register for benefits.
“It’s not just high volumes. It’s completely off the scales of what was thought was possible in an economic downturn,” said Josh Richardson, chief of staff at the Indiana Department of Workforce Development. “We were unprepared for what occurred. I’m not too reluctant to say that.”
‘It’s Complete Gridlock’
Two weeks ago, more than 120,000 people in Indiana applied for unemployment benefits. That’s more than quadruple the previous weekly record, set in January 2009 at the height of the Great Recession.At one point, it translated to 65 new calls per second on the unemployment hotline, overwhelming not just the humans picking up the phones, but the automated answering service too.State officials have a daunting double task. They’re bracing for another wave of claims, and also figuring out how to clear their backlog.
In Connecticut, that could take six weeks and some new computer code, according to Nancy Steffens. She’s a spokeswoman for the state labor department, which would receive about 3,000 claims in a normal week and has gotten more than 100 times that amount since mid-March.On the other end of the process are millions of Americans suddenly deprived of their livelihoods. And even those who manage to file their claims aren’t out of the woods.
Mark Francis, a freelance photographer in Houston, applied April 1. More than a week on, he’s still trying to work his way through the Texas bureaucracy, which wants more information.
“You can’t get through on the phone lines no matter what time you call,” he said. “It’s complete gridlock.”
Francis said he’s tried engaging “Larry,” the online chat-bot deployed by Texas authorities to help speed up processing, but didn’t get much help.
‘All Hands on Deck’
Francisco Gamez, a spokesman for the Texas Workforce Commission, said the state had moved 450 people from other departments and hired another 100 to work call centers, as it tries to ramp up capacity to address jobless claims. “It’s all hands on deck,” he said. “We’re looking at every avenue.”But like peers elsewhere, Texas officials are dealing with numbers that are literally off the charts. The state helped about 700,000 Texans file unemployment claims in the whole of 2019. It’s surpassed that number in the past four weeks –- including one frenzied 24-hour period when a toll-free hotline got more than 3 million calls.
Oil states are getting battered by the crude-price collapse, as well as Covid-19. In Oklahoma, for example, a booming energy industry had shielded labor markets from the worst of the pain during the last big financial crisis of 2008-2009.
“We didn’t see the hit that many other states did,” said Robin Roberson, executive director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. A former tech entrepreneur, she was brought in 9 weeks ago to modernize the department just as the virus started to hit.
Her job has turned into an emergency response. Claims soared from an average of 2,000 a week or less, to 150,000 in the past month. Habits formed during a period of fairly full employment have gotten a jolt.
“We haven’t been fast nor have we really kept up with a ton of the training, because we didn’t need to,” Roberson said. “We’ve made some pretty drastic changes over the past couple of weeks.”
‘Dropping the Ball’
In many states, the $2 trillion rescue package signed by President Donald Trump last month could add another category of applicants. It extends federal unemployment benefits to self-employed workers and contractors, who normally wouldn’t qualify, and leaves states struggling to cobble together new programs.
Tony Baker, a 35-year-old software developer in Sterling Heights, Michigan, lost his last client -- a website that helped book stays at now-deserted campgrounds -- at the end of February.More than a month on, he hasn’t been able to even file for unemployment because authorities in Michigan say they’re not yet accepting claims from workers like him, despite the federal rescue package.To make matters worse, he’s worried that his $1,200 government check –- another much-touted element of the stimulus bill -- may be delayed because the IRS doesn’t have his direct-deposit details.“I feel let down not only by my federal government, but my state government as well,” Baker said. “They dropped the ball on this pandemic crisis. And they’re dropping the ball on this emergency help.”Jason Moon, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, said the state would soon begin accepting claims like Baker’s.“We’re assuring every eligible worker in Michigan that files for unemployment that they will receive the benefits that they are entitled to,” Moon said. The department is ramping up staffing for its unemployment hotline, which by the end of this week will approach four times the pre-virus level.
‘Just Really Rough’
Amid all the unprecedented numbers, it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that behind every call or claim is a human situation -- sometimes complex, and requiring adjudication by a system already stretched to its limits amid a cascade of business failures and layoffs.
Claims can get disputed or rejected, for reasons that often feel unfair to the claimant. Appeals take time that people in such predicaments can rarely afford.Raven Gilbert moved to North Carolina from California in December last year. She managed the bar at Hunter House & Gardens, a restored Colonial farmhouse that became a venue for weddings and other events, until she was laid off March 15.
Gilbert says she even got up at 3 a.m. in an attempt to file for unemployment online, and still couldn’t get through. She eventually managed to lodge her claim, but then watched as her status mysteriously changed from “pending” to “ineligible.” She finally received an official denial on Wednesday, for reasons that she’s pretty sure boil down to a technicality but will take time to address.Meantime, she’s not getting the help that she and her elderly mother, who now lives with her, are badly in need of.
“It’s already a difficult situation, to stay inside,” she said. “Yet you know your family suffers because you’re not being able to support them. And that’s rough. It’s just really rough.”"

The Trump administration has asked lawmakers for an additional $250 billion in aid for small U.S. businesses. However, congressional efforts were stalling as Democrats held out for similar amounts of aid for hospitals and local governments.

Eurozone finance ministers are set to resume their virtual gathering to debate the best way of financing the response to the Covid-19 crisis, which is set to result in a sharp expansion of budget deficits. Outside the currency union, the U.K. government has signalled it will increase direct borrowings from the Bank of England. 
The Eurogroup meeting had originally started Tuesday, but disagreements persisted over the conditions for loans to hard-hit countries like Spain and Italy under the eurozone bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, as well as whether to issue joint debt known as ‘coronabonds’ as part of a wider recovery plan.
In corporate news, UBS  (NYSE:UBS) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Switzerland’s two biggest banks, said Thursday that they had decided to partially postpone the payment of their dividend for 2019 until later this year. UBS shares rose 1.9%, while Credit Suisse shares rose 4%.
Staying in the banking sector, top executives at HSBC (LON:HSBA) and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) announced they would forgo their bonuses for 2020 and donate part of their salaries to the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. HSBC shares climbed 1.2% and Standard Chartered shares rose 3.5%.
The two banks said at the start of this month that they would cancel their dividends and suspend buybacks.

1186,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 03:30AM ET</span>",UBS and Credit Suisse bow to regulator pressure on dividends,"By Silke Koltrowitz and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss banks UBS (S:UBSG) and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) will postpone paying out part of their 2019 dividends until later this year after mounting pressure from authorities over lenders' payouts during the coronavirus epidemic.
The move follows bank dividend cancellations or postponements across much of Europe as regulators have heaped pressure on lenders to conserve profits and capital in order to assist the economy.
The two banks were the remaining major European lenders to resist requests to change their dividend policy. But they stopped short of steps taken by British and euro zone banks who have either suspended or canceled all their 2019 payouts.
Switzerland's two biggest banks said their strong capital and liquidity positions would have allowed them to support the Swiss economy and their clients in the crisis while also paying out their dividends, but were bowing to requests from Swiss financial markets watchdog FINMA.
""Our financial strength well above regulatory requirements and prudent risk management allow us to deliver on our current capital returns policy,"" UBS Chairman Axel Weber said in a statement. ""Nevertheless, at FINMA's request, we have adjusted the 2019 dividend payout proposal given the high and unprecedented uncertainty."" 
The regulator had warned banks not to pay out dividends in order to conserve capital to lend to companies during an economic downturn caused by coronavirus restrictions. It toughened its stance last week by blocking upcoming dividend payments from capital relief measures.
PRUDENT AND RESPONSIBLE
""We believe that this response to FINMA's request, in alignment with the similar decisions made by our peers, is a prudent and responsible step,"" Credit Suisse said.
Both Credit Suisse and UBS are participating in a Swiss government emergency loan scheme to support businesses hit by the pandemic. UBS said it had already provided 2.1 billion Swiss francs ($2.2 billion) in liquidity to more than 16,000 mostly small- and medium-sized companies.
UBS also offered a sweetener to investors, saying it expected on April 28 to report a rise in first-quarter net profit to around $1.5 billion from $1.1 billion a year ago. Credit Suisse confirmed upbeat trading updates given last month.
UBS said it intended to pay out its dividend of $0.73 in two installments, half of it as a regular dividend and the rest as a special dividend - to be separately approved by shareholders on Nov. 19 - after the publication of its third-quarter results.
Credit Suisse will propose a cash distribution of 0.1388 francs per share at its upcoming annual shareholders' meeting, half its original proposal, and a second distribution of the same amount to be approved by an extraordinary shareholder meeting in the third quarter of 2020.

FINMA said it welcomed the banks' decisions.

""In the current situation, ESMA expects national competent authorities to adopt a risk-based approach and not prioritise supervisory actions against these market participants in respect of the upcoming reporting deadlines,"" the regulator said in a statement.

1191,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 01:50AM ET</span>",China plans to make it easier for foreign life insurers to buy domestic firms: sources,"By Sumeet Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China plans to make it easier for foreign life insurers to make controlling acquisitions and large equity investments in domestic peers, five people with knowledge of the matter said, as the country pushes ahead in opening up its financial sector.
The plan being drafted by the sector regulator is also part of Beijing's efforts to bolster the capital levels of small and mid-sized local players, sources said, amid concerns about the impact of the new coronavirus pandemic on their financial foundations.
The new rules for the world's third-largest insurance market after the United States and Japan - worth about $318 billion in premiums according to a Swiss Re Institute report - are likely to be finalised in the second half of the year, sources said.
They will pave the way for foreign insurers to acquire a controlling or significant minority stake in a local peer, and run that business separately from existing joint ventures or wholly owned operations, they added. 
""The move is aimed at giving the provincial insurance firms access to capital and an opportunity to leverage the best practices of a foreign insurance company,"" said a Beijing-based lawyer, who works with the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Authority (CBIRC).
Existing regulations allow overseas life insurers, with operations in China, to own up to 15% stake in a local rival. Under the new rules being considered, the CBIRC will allow a foreign life insurer to own more than one main business license, the people with knowledge of the matter said. 
""There is great M&A potential in the Chinese insurance sector,"" the Beijing-based lawyer said. Sources interviewed by Reuters for this story declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
The CBIRC did not respond to request for comment.
Opaque guidelines for acquisitions and a lack of majority control, with foreign ownership capped at 50% until recently, have long frustrated global insurers looking to expand market share in China, where individual wealth is on the rise and comparatively few people have life insurance cover.
Britain's  Prudential  (L:PRU) and Canada's  Sun Life Financial  (TO:SLF) and  Aviva  (L:AV) have been in China for decades, but their collective market share remains below 10% as a result of ownership curbs and limited geographical presence. 
But China has been gradually easing access to its financial sector for foreigners in the last couple of years. As part of that push it already allowed overseas firms to take full control of their local joint ventures from Jan. 1 this year.
The regulator also plans to dismantle the ""international division"" within its set-up over the next year, which deals with the licensing issues of foreign insurers, with an aim to create ""a level-playing field"" with local peers, two people said.

Pacific Collective LLC invoked force majeure in its bid to delay an Exxon property acquisition, according to a suit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The legal clause refers to unexpected events that prevent one party to a contract from meeting its obligations. 
Sometimes referred to as the act of God clause, force majeure is being invoked elsewhere in energy contracts.  BP  (LON:BP) this month cited force majeure for a one-year delay on a natural gas project, and three Indian refiners have cited it in rejecting crude oil imports.
An Exxon spokesman declined immediate comment, citing pending litigation. 
Pacific Collective did not reply to a request for comment and an attorney for the firm declined to comment. 
The retail property developer's lawsuit seeks $7.9 million in damages for alleged breach of contract and an injunction prohibiting Exxon from selling the property to someone else. 
Pacific Collective invoked force majeure on March 30, a day before the acquisition was to close. Three days later Exxon notified the developer it would cancel the sale and keep the company's deposit, according to the lawsuit. 
Exxon's insistence on the scheduled closing required ""acts that would qualify as crimes under the current California and County of LA Stay-at-Home Orders,"" Pacific Collective's complaint said. 
Coronavirus could constitute a legal force majeure as long as a company can show it is effectively impossible to perform contractual duties as a result of the outbreak, said legal experts.
The case is Pacific Collective LLC V Exxon Mobil, Los Angeles County Superior Court, No. 20-STCV-13294.

Certain safety measures differ from manufacturer to manufacturer. Italian sports car maker  Ferrari  NV (MI:RACE) said on Wednesday it would offer voluntary blood tests to employees who wanted to know if they had been exposed to the virus.
General Motors Co's (N:GM) head of workplace safety, Jim Glynn, told Reuters on Wednesday GM is not persuaded blood tests are useful. But Glynn said GM has studied and adapted measures taken by Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) to protect warehouse workers, such as temperature screening to catch employees with fevers before they enter the workplace.
Auto manufacturers and suppliers are converging on a consensus that temperature screening, daily health questionnaires, assembly lines redesigned to keep workers 3 to 6 feet (0.9 m to 1.8 m) apart, and lots and lots of masks and gloves can enable large-scale factories to operate safely.
""We know the protocols to keep people safe,"" Gerald Johnson, GM's executive vice president for global manufacturing, told Reuters in an interview. GM has relaunched vehicle plants in China and kept factories running in South Korea, he said.
GM has not said when it will reopen assembly plants in the United States. Other automakers are putting dates out in public, even though health officials and federal and state policymakers are wary of lifting lockdowns too soon. 
""You see vehicle manufacturers ... putting a stake in the ground,"" said Brian Collie, head of Boston Consulting Group's automotive practice. By setting a public date to restart production, they signal suppliers to get ready to ramp up, he said.
The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown the global auto industry into the worst tailspin since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Consumer demand for vehicles has collapsed as governments have enforced lockdowns in China, and then in Europe and the United States. For the Detroit automakers and their suppliers, the shutdown of profitable truck and sport utility vehicle plants in North America has choked off cash flow.
In Europe, major automakers have said they hope to begin building vehicles again in mid-to-late April. In the United States, several big automakers, including  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU), Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), are aiming to restart production during the first week of May.
Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and unions are discussing plans for beefed-up health measures at Italian plants to pave the way for production to restart as soon as the government eases a national lockdown due to expire on April 13, unions said on Wednesday.
Among the proposals from Fiat Chrysler's Italian unions: move meals to the end of shifts, allowing employees to chose to avoid canteens, eat their food elsewhere and leave half an hour earlier without losing pay.
FCA did not comment on specific measures. 
In the United States, some non-union automakers have also said they hope to restart vehicle plants as soon as next week.
Tire maker Bridgestone said on Wednesday it plans to restart U.S. production on April 13.
But the Trump administration has said people should continue to practice social distancing until April 30.
VENTILATOR ASSEMBLY
For the Detroit automakers, the United Auto Workers union will play a key role in deciding when and how plants will restart. 
UAW President Rory Gamble said in a statement on Wednesday the union is in ""deep discussions with all three companies to plan ahead over the implementation of CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] safety standards and using all available technologies to protect all UAW members, their families and the public."" 
Among the union's concerns is that members who report being ill can take time away from work without penalty, Gamble added.
The UAW has supported GM and  Ford Motor Co 's (N:F) efforts to launch production of ventilators in U.S. plants - operations that have allowed the companies and the union to road-test safety measures at small scale.
At GM's ventilator assembly plant in Kokomo, Indiana, workers and managers have been fine-tuning details such as when employees are handed masks, and when they step in front of a temperature screening device.
At first, ventilator assemblers in training at Kokomo walked down a hall before getting a mask, said Debby Hollis, one of the UAW-represented workers. Last week, she said, ""They met us at the door and had us get in the masks there."" 
The time workers spend putting on extra protective gear, the time spent doing extra cleaning, and spreading workers out on assembly lines designed to have one vehicle roll off the end every 60 seconds could undercut productivity.
""If we can protect employees we can get work done,"" said Johnson, the GM manufacturing chief. ""The magnitude of the incremental cost is irrelevant. Costs will be managed.""

1196,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 10:00PM ET</span>","Exxon used economic uncertainty to push for Paulsboro, N.J., contract: sources","HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) used economic uncertainty tied to the coronavirus pandemic to urge workers at its lubricants and packaging plant in Paulsboro, New Jersey, to vote for a proposed contract, according to two sources familiar with the matter. 
Workers at the plant on Wednesday rejected the contract in a 62-11 vote, however, said the two sources. 
The workers are represented by the Independent Oil Workers union (IOW) in Paulsboro. Officials at the IOW office did not reply to a phone message. 
The sources said the proposal would have put Exxon, not the union, in charge of choosing safety officers and overturned gains won by the union in past arbitration with the company. 
“They used our fears to try to decimate this contract,” one of the sources said. 
Exxon Mobil spokesman Todd Spitler said the claims were not justified. 
“We reject these unwarranted claims,” Spitler said. “One only has to look at current market conditions to realize that this is simply not true.” 
Spitler said Exxon’s goal is to continue to negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement with the IOW. 
“Exxon Mobil’s primary focus remains the safety and health of our workforce and to do our part to manage the impact of the novel coronavirus in the community,” he said. 
An official with the United Steelworkers union (USW) at Exxon’s Baytown, Texas, refinery said last Friday that the company was using economic uncertainty brought about by the coronavirus pandemic to push workers to accept a new contract. 
Like most employees in petrochemical manufacturing, workers at the Paulsboro plant cannot do their jobs from home and must work in shared production areas. 

The Paulsboro plant produces and packages lubricants.

1197,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 09:30PM ET</span>",U.S. senators question Amazon CEO about firing of warehouse protest leader,"By Jeffrey Dastin
(Reuters) - Five Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday wrote Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) to raise concern about its firing of a worker who protested warehouse operations during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters.
The letter, addressed to Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, adds to public scrutiny Amazon is facing over the dismissal, at a time when the company is racing to update safety protocols, keep warehouses open and ship essential goods to shoppers who are shut indoors. 
Amazon employee Christian Smalls came to the company's Staten Island, New York, warehouse on March 30 for a small protest he helped organize, which in part called for the site's closure. Workers feared infection after a colleague had fallen ill to the novel coronavirus, cases of which have now been reported among staff at more than 50 Amazon warehouses, according to the New York Times.
The virus has infected more than 1.4 million people globally.
Amazon said it fired Smalls, who had contact with the virus patient, after he violated a paid quarantine to join the protest. The dismissal prompted New York City's mayor to announce a probe and the state's attorney general to demand a U.S. labor board investigation.
In Wednesday's letter, senators led by Cory Booker of New Jersey questioned the order of events. They cited a media report suggesting that Smalls' two-week quarantine may have come after Smalls ""had begun organizing their colleagues to demand more workplace transparency and stronger workplace protections."" The quarantine should have ended five days before the protest based on a possible March 11 exposure, the letter said, citing the media report.
""The right to organize is a bedrock of our economy, responsible for many of the greatest advances achieved by workers over generations,"" the letter said.
Amazon said Smalls' contact with the diagnosed worker was well after the 11th and that on March 28 he was told to go into quarantine.
The company said it fired Smalls because he put others' health at risk, not because he organized a protest.
Amazon said it is taking ""extreme"" measures to keep staff safe while shipping goods to U.S. households, the vast majority of which are under a stay-at-home order. On top of site cleaning, it is requiring temperature checks and social distancing, and is making masks available at all U.S. and European warehouses, the company said.
Leaked notes from an Amazon executive meeting have added to blowback over the firing. In the notes, Amazon's general counsel described Smalls as ""not smart, or articulate.""
He later issued a statement saying frustration over the health risks created by Smalls had clouded his judgment.

The other signatories to the senators' letter, which referenced the leaked notes, were Robert Menendez, Sherrod Brown, Richard Blumenthal and Kirsten Gillibrand.

1198,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 09:00PM ET</span>",Bank of Korea Stands Pat on Rates After Emergency Action,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Korea left its key interest rate unchanged, taking a wait-and-see approach after last month’s unprecedented steps to cushion the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
South Korea’s central bank held the seven-day repurchase rate at 0.75% on Thursday in a move forecast by nine of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The rest expected a quarter percentage point reduction. The BOK announced further measures to channel liquidity to the economy, expanding the range of bonds eligible for its open market operations.
The BOK is taking stock after a flurry of measures last month, including an emergency rate cut to a record low and a pledge to inject unlimited liquidity into the market via repurchase agreements. South Korea’s government is also rolling out stimulus like never before, with a second extra budget lined up.
“Considering the diminishing ammunition after previous cuts, it’s not surprising the BOK is holding,” said Chang Min, a researcher at the Korea Institute of Finance. “This doesn’t mean that the situation is improving, though. The BOK is likely to keep coming out with non-rate measures to stabilize markets.”
Yet, with the pandemic continuing to wreak havoc on South Korean economy, the BOK’s pause may be short-lived. About half of the surveyed analysts expected the BOK to ease on Thursday. Among those who forecast the hold decision, several including analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expect a cut in May.
While virus cases are slowing in South Korea and in China, its largest trade partner, a recovery in global demand is elusive as large parts of the world are at a virtual standstill. South Korea’s government also extended its social-distancing rules as a precaution against a second wave of infections.
Many economists expect South Korea to grow this year at the weakest pace since the Asian financial crisis two decades ago, or even contract. Recent reports show South Korea’s retail sales, confidence, and investment all sliding, and a mild contraction in exports is set to deepen as the pandemic puts global supply chains in disarray and hurts overall demand.
Investors will be watching Governor Lee Ju-yeol’s post-decision briefing for insight into the reasoning behind holding fire -- whether it’s because of cautious optimism that the worst is behind, or due to lack of policy room.
“I think the BOK may explore the option to lower the interest rate to zero if necessary, although BOK is also mindful of the potential adverse impact to the housing market,” Arthur Lau, head of Asia ex-Japan fixed income at PineBridge Investments said before Thursday’s decision.
The BOK’s next scheduled meeting is May 28, when the bank will revise its 2.1% growth and 1% inflation projections for this year. The board will have new faces by then, as four of the seven-member board have terms that end April 20.

1199,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 08:09PM ET</span>",World Economy Faces $5 Trillion Hit That Is Like Losing Japan,"(Bloomberg) -- The coronavirus pandemic is set to rob the global economy of more than $5 trillion of growth over the next two years, greater than the annual output of Japan.
That’s the warning from Wall Street banks as the world plunges into its deepest peacetime recession since the 1930s, after the virus forced governments to demand that businesses close and people stay home.
Although the downturn is predicted to be short-lived, it’ll take time for economies to make up the lost ground. Even with unprecedented levels of monetary and fiscal stimulus, gross domestic product is unlikely to return to its pre-crisis trend until at least 2022.
That’s a similar timescale to the aftermath of the global financial crisis just over a decade ago, though the recovery could yet prove even more sluggish than economists are predicting.
It underscores the massive task for policy makers, who must deliver enough stimulus to drive the rebound but avoid reopening their economies too soon and allowing the virus to return.
“Trajectory matters a whole lot,” said Catherine Mann, chief economist of  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., which expects a global hit of around $5 trillion. “If your trajectory is positive, that is supportive of business confidence and supportive of individuals feeling they can go get a job. That’s a critical ingredient going into the second half of the year and 2021.”
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. economists put the lost output at $5.5 trillion or almost 8% of GDP through the end of next year. The cost to developed economies alone will be similar to those witnessed in the recessions of 2008-2009 and 1974-1975.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) says that despite an aggressive policy response, it’ll be the third quarter of 2021 before GDP in developed markets returns to pre-virus levels.  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) says the “lingering cost and scarring effect” will leave the U.S. and European Union economies alone $1 trillion below pre-virus expectations by the end of 2021.
The World Trade Organization said Wednesday that the pandemic could cause a deeper collapse of international trade flows than at any point in the postwar era. The International Monetary Fund is due to announce its latest forecasts as part of its spring meeting -- to be held virtually -- next week.
What our Economists Say
“The global economy is already contracting, and is losing steam faster than in the early days of the financial crisis.”
-Dan Hanson, click here for the full GDP Tracker
The numbers risk masking the human toll of the crisis. As well as the mounting death count, businesses will lose income and many will be forced to close. Millions of employees will be cast out of work.
The International Labor Organization said this week that more than 1 billion workers are at high risk of a pay cut or losing their job.
“It’s going to be temporary, but it’s putting stress on everything,” Steve Schwarzman, chief executive officer of Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group Inc., told Bloomberg Television this week.
Governments will need to coordinate. The Bank for International Settlements has warned that disjointed national efforts could lead to a second wave of cases, a worst-case scenario that would leave U.S. GDP close to 12% below its pre-virus level by the end of 2020.
Without a concerted global effort, emerging markets face an especially long road to recovery, according to Amlan Roy, head of global macro policy research at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors.
“The recession we are likely to see, if emerging markets don’t come out of it by June, is something that could last many years, just like the Asian and Latin American crises,” he said. “It’s likely to be a five or 10-year effect if the world doesn’t get together.”
The ramifications of the pandemic are in any case likely to be felt for a very long time if history is a guide. Research from the University of California, Davis, shows that previous outbreaks tend to curb wages and weigh on investment for decades.
The current scenarios also assume that that policy makers get their response largely right. That’s not guaranteed -- as the failure of EU finance ministers on Tuesday to agree a joint strategy showed.
Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, notes that governments might need to keep heavy restrictions on travel in late 2020 or 2021 to prevent the pandemic from recurring. At the same time, they must keep spending well beyond their initial measures to support the upturn, or risk another dip in a so-called W-shaped recovery.
“A major policy error could do serious damage,” he said. “It would be easier to come up with darker forecasts. You just have to assume that the policy response won’t be quite adequate.”

1200,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 07:15PM ET</span>",Virus lockdown threatens $60 billion in UK dividends: report,"LONDON (Reuters) - UK-listed companies could cancel about $60 billion in dividend payments this year following Britain's lockdown and calls from regulators to preserve cash during the coronavirus crisis, according to a report by analytics company Link Group.
As Britain battles to curb the spread of virus, the report published on Thursday showed that a record 41% of dividend payouts by the country's listed companies were under threat if the situation worsens.
Link Group, which provides shareholder management services as well as analytics, said it based its UK Dividend Monitor findings on publicly available data from companies listed on Britain's main stock market, and consensus analyst forecasts. 
Companies had already announced a staggering 23.8 billion pounds ($29.5 billion) of dividend cuts and delays by April 5, it said, warning that a ""UK recession is already underway, but duration and severity are unknowable at this stage"".
British banks led the way as top lenders scrapped or postponed 13.6 billion pounds in planned payouts after the Bank of England asked them to halt dividends, while also encouraging them not to pay executive bonuses. 
 Barclays  (L:BARC), HSBC (L:HSBA), Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY), Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS),  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) and the British arm of Spain's Santander (MC:SAN) all put their payouts on ice in a co-ordinated industry response earlier this month.
The next largest batch of potentially frozen dividends came from the mining sector, led by heavyweight  Glencore  (L:GLEN), which deferred to August a decision on its proposed $2.6 billion payout for this year while it weighed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business and on the economy.
The total amount of investor payouts being scrapped this year could nearly double, as an additional 23.9 billion pound worth of dividends could be at risk, Link said adding that half of the amount could come from an oil sector hit by a price war between the world's top oil producers Saudi Arabia and Russia.
But much of that could depend on a meeting on Thursday, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies led by Russia, the group known as OPEC+, will discuss a potential big output cut to shore up crude prices that have also been hammered by the coronavirus pandemic.

1201,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 06:45PM ET</span>",Oil Climbs After Russia Signals Willingness to Cut Production,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil posted its first gain of the week just before the world’s top producers meet to discuss potential output cuts against of backdrop of demand destruction from the coronavirus.
Futures in New York rose 6.2% on Wednesday after a volatile session that saw prices rise as much as 12%. Oil is drawing support from investors who are focused on plans being ironed out by Saudi Arabia and Russia for a global supply-curb agreement at the OPEC+ emergency virtual meeting on Thursday. Russia earlier said it is ready to cut oil production by 1.6 million barrels a day, or 14% of its output.
“Fundamentals are the driving force in this market, whether it be the demand or supply-side,” said Peter McGinn, market strategist at RJ O’Brien & Associates LLC in Chicago. While the OPEC+ production cuts are welcome, the real question is when will demand return, he added.
Oil gained even after the Energy Information Administration reported a 15.2 million barrel weekly increase in crude stocks, biggest gain in data going back to 1982.
Any sort of supply reduction may not be large enough to offset the massive near-term demand destruction, said Bart Melek, director and head of global commodity strategy at TD Securities. “We doubt that OPEC+ can cut sufficient amount, without other key producers committing to reductions as well.”
Despite gains in the futures market, physical prices continue to fall as refineries cut processing rates and purchases. North American landlocked crudes are fetching ever lower prices, with grades in the U.S. Bakken region back beneath $10 and oil in Canada at a record low. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney warned on Tuesday that there’s a “very real possibility” of negative prices.
Part of the volatile session today was due to the ongoing rollover activity by investor funds, McGinn said. “The United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO) roll volume had peaked just before close, tripping a circuit breaker,” before easing back lower, he said. The fund had begun its rollover on Tuesday, selling the front month to buy the next three months.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Wednesday approved Alphabet Inc unit Google's (O:GOOGL) request to use part of an U.S.-Asia undersea telecommunications cable after the company warned it would face significantly higher prices to carry traffic by other means.
Google agreed to operate a portion of the 8,000-mile Pacific Light Cable Network System between the United States and Taiwan, but not Hong Kong. Google and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) helped pay for construction of the now completed telecommunications link but U.S. regulators have blocked its use.
The Justice Department earlier told the FCC in a petition it supported Google's revised request. The agency said U.S. agencies believe ""there is a significant risk that the grant of a direct cable connection between the United States and Hong Kong would seriously jeopardize the national security and law enforcement interests of the United States.""
Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China, whose relations with the United States have soured over the deadly coronavirus pandemic, which originated in Wuhan, trade disputes and security concerns.
In a statement, Google thanked the FCC for approving its request and added ""dedicated global network deployment and operations team is continually increasing capacity to meet the needs of our users, and that includes our subsea cable system."" 
The FCC is allowing Google to operate the segment for the next six months, pending a final disposition of the license application.
Google told regulators earlier this year it has ""an immediate need to meet internal demand for capacity between the U.S. and Taiwan, in particular to connect Google’s Taiwan data center to Google data centers in the United States and to serve users throughout the Asia-Pacific region.""
It added that without that ""capacity, the value of large, recent capital investments Google has made in the United States is significantly reduced.""
The Justice Department said without temporary authority ""Google would likely have to seek alternative capacity at significantly higher prices.""
Google has also agreed to ""pursue diversification of interconnection points in Asia,"" as well as to establish network facilities that deliver traffic ""as close as practicable"" to its ultimate destination, the department added.
The United States has expressed concerns about China's role in handling network traffic and potential for espionage. Around 300 subsea cables form the backbone of the internet by carrying 99% of the world’s data traffic.
A Facebook affiliate sought FCC approval to use a portion of the cable connecting the Philippines to the United States to handle traffic. 

Facebook said on Wednesday it is ""navigating through all the appropriate channels on licensing and permitting.""

1204,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for April 9,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Wall Street shook off its trepidation from yesterday to close sharply higher in today’s session.
The market was buoyed by more signs that efforts to contain the Covid-19 pandemic are working as hoped.
And there was enthusiasm in the energy sector, which should continue tomorrow as Saudi Arabia, Russia and the rest of OPEC+ meet.
But there will also be more sobering economic numbers. And Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will be taking questions from around the internet.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Jobless Claims Set to Spike Again
Weekly jobless claims, which have become the go-to economic indicator to capture the latest impact of the virus, come out before the bell tomorrow.
The Labor Department will report on claims for first-time unemployment benefits at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists are expecting that claims eased off a little from the huge number the week before, but will still post a rise of 5.25 million, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Continuing claims are seen coming in at a staggering 8 million, eclipsing the level of more than 6 million seen in 2009 during the financial crisis.
At 10:00 AM ET, the University of Michigan will release its preliminary measure of consumer confidence for April.
The consumer sentiment index is expected to sink to 75 from 89.1 in March.
But economists also think consumers are, like President Donald Trump said, starting to see light at the end of the tunnel. The preliminary April consumer expectations component is seen rising to 88.2 from 79.7 the month before.
The Labor Department will also release the latest numbers on wholesale inflation at 8:30 AM ET.
The producer price index (PPI) is expected to have dropped 0.4% in March. The core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is forecast to have risen 0.1%.
Still, whether all these indicators are as valuable as they were before these unprecedented times is debatable.
“The economy has never changed this fast before,” University of Michigan economics professor Justin Wolfers tweeted. “The unemployment rate is moving as much every two days as it typically moves in a year. So we need economic indicators that can tell us what's happening across the whole economy, day by day.”


2. OPEC+ to Meet, With Cuts Expected
Oil ministers will be brushing up on their video conference skills tonight.
OPEC+ will hold its virtual meeting Thursday that many (bulls) are hoping will result in production cuts to stabilize the market.
WTI futures spiked 11% in late trading as Algeria revved up expectations, saying “massive” output cuts were on the cards, which could be around 10 million barrels per day.
That added to enthusiasm about Russia planning to offer cuts of 1.6 million barrels, Reuters reported, citing a Kremlin source.
U.S. participation could be the key to whether a deal goes through. But the world’s largest crude producer signaled it will contribute about 1.2 million bpd at most in cuts that would be market driven, not an official reduction.
3. Powell Hosts Webinar
The Federal Reserve minutes from its March meetings out today revealed that in its worst-case scenario the central bank believed that the U.S. economy would not recover from the coronavirus damage until next year.
How much has the Fed’s thinking changed? Investors can hear from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell tomorrow when he participates in a webinar at the Brookings Institution think tank at 10:00 ET (14:00 GMT).
“In an online-only discussion, Powell will talk about the current state of the economy, the Fed’s response to the crisis, and what lies ahead,” Brookings said.
Powell will take questions from the audience and viewers via e-mail and Twitter (#COVID19Economy).

Philips said it would deliver the U.S. government 43,000 hospital ventilators, an essential tool for the treatment of patients struggling with the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, throughout the rest of the year for a total sum of $647 million.
As part of the deal, President Donald Trump has ordered suppliers to prioritise their shipments to the two U.S. factories where Philips produces its ventilators, Chief Executive Frans van Houten told Reuters. 
Philips will be allowed to continue its shipments of ventilators to the rest of the world, where the appliances are also in high demand.
""This helps"", Van Houten said in a reference to Trump's use of the Defense Production Act (DPA), a law dating back to the Korean War of the 1950s that grants the U.S. president sweeping authority to expedite and expand the supply of resources from U.S. factories.
""We came to a good solution and now we can focus on further increasing production"", Van Houten said.
Philips earlier warned that protectionist measures such as the DPA could jeopardise its promise to rapidly increase production of critical medical supplies for the diagnosis and care of coronavirus patients.
The company said last month it would ramp up production of hospital ventilators to 4,000 a week by the third quarter, after having doubled it to 1,000 units per week in March.

1207,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 04:55PM ET</span>","Activist Blackwells up 20% in first quarter, firm plans taking in client capital","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - For many hedge funds specializing in prodding management to perform better, the first three months of 2020 marked the worst start to the year they have experienced, ever.
For Jason Aintabi, who runs Blackwells Capital, early 2020 was his best start ever.
While the average activist hedge fund lost 33% in the first quarter, fueled by a 25% drop in March, according to data from Hedge Fund Research, Blackwells gained 20% in the quarter and returned 10% in March, according to data seen by Reuters.
Blackwells, which made headlines last month by reaching a settlement that handed the activist a fourth board seat at real estate investment firm Colony Capital (N:CLNY), has mounted five activist campaigns during its four-year lifetime.
This year's returns put Aintabi, who founded Blackwells as part of his family office in 2016, far ahead of some older, bigger and better known activists. Daniel Loeb's Third Point Offshore fund lost 11% in March and Nelson Peltz' Trian Partners fell 16% last month, investors said.
To be sure, some prominent activists were winners in March, with William Ackman's Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management up 11.1%.
Soon, Aintabi plans to convert Blackwells into a hedge fund and take in capital from outside investors for the first time, people familiar with his plans said.
Launching a hedge fund, never an easy proposition, may be all the more difficult now as investors compare this economic crisis - which has sent the S&P 500 index tumbling 20% in the first quarter - with the 2008 financial crisis when activist funds lost 40%. 
But Blackwells' early numbers will go a long way to establishing a track record that investors say will prompt a closer look, at least.
Early returns were boosted by bets consumer discretionary stocks, including travel, leisure, retail industries, would decline. Financial, consumer staples and communications services stocks helped and a big winner was internet service provider  Cogent Communications  (O:CCOI), which gained 24% in the first quarter as millions stayed home.
The fight at Colony, successful in board room, weighed on returns as the stock fell 61% in the quarter.
Blackwells previously pushed for changes at global trade management software provider Amber Road which sold itself to E2open in 2019, earning Blackwells a 50% gain. 
In 2018, Blackwells battled with food distributor Supervalu and earned a 128% return. At Bed Bath & Beyond (O:BBBY), Blackwells was ready to try and unseat the entire board before others waged a fight last year, a source said.

1209,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 04:36PM ET</span>",Korea Inc. Returns to Debt Market Even as Virus Fears Stay High,"(Bloomberg) -- South Korea’s corporate bond sales are starting to revive as the government joins authorities abroad in taking steps to support credit markets roiled by the coronavirus pandemic.
Lotte Food Co. priced won-denominated bonds Tuesday, the first Korean company to do so in nearly three weeks. Other firms with strong local credit ratings including Kia Motors Corp. and Hotel Shilla Co. are planning to tap the market this month, people familiar with the matter say. The moves follow the start of debt purchases this month by a 20 trillion won ($16 billion) fund set up by the government to help stabilize the bond market.
South Korea’s credit markets are playing catch-up with counterparts in the U.S. and Europe, where massive corporate debt purchases by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank have helped spark a boom in issuance. But even as Korean issuers return, investor concerns about the damage to the corporate sector from the virus outbreak remain pronounced: yield premiums on won corporate notes rose to the highest since 2012 this week amid a gloomy outlook for the nation’s exporters as consumer spending plunges all over the world.
“The bond stabilization fund will have short-term effects as some solid companies can benefit from it,” said Joo Tae-young, senior managing director at KB Securities Co., the top arranger of won corporate notes. “But it remains to be seen how much it will help in the long term.”
The bond rescue fund is designed to provide liquidity to the market and invests only in companies with solid ratings. It appears to have helped meet the market’s cash needs so far: the yield on three-month won commercial paper, a metric of short-term funding demand, has decreased since Friday after jumping to the highest in five years.
While Kia Motors and Hotel Shilla have high credit ratings in Korea, the automobile and accommodation sectors are among the hardest hit by the virus.

Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings have placed Kia’s ratings on review for downgrade, citing the auto industry’s sensitivity to consumer demand and sentiment amid the pandemic.
The government fund isn’t likely to buy company debt at very favorable rates for issuers, so spreads may continue to widen a bit, said Kim Eun-gie, credit analyst at Samsung (KS:005930) Securities Co. Issuance of three-year bonds may increase as the fund only buys notes due in three years or less, he said.

(Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) is hopeful initial public offerings will pick up in the second half of 2020, but much depends on how well companies and investors emerge from the coronavirus pandemic, the head of the exchange operator said on Wednesday.
Nasdaq had a strong pipeline of companies wanting to go public this year, but most IPO activity dried up after the first six weeks as markets were up-ended by the coronavirus crisis, Nasdaq Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman told the Economic Club of Washington, DC.
""Most companies are either just waiting for a better moment, when investors are more ready to put some risk capital to work, or they are being disrupted in their business models and they're going to have to be able to demonstrate how they can bounce back or how resilient they are through that before investors are going to take that risk with them,"" she said. 
Nasdaq has had 30 U.S. market debuts so far this year, but just two in the past several weeks, including Keros Therapeutics, which held its IPO on Wednesday, popping more than 40% intraday on its first day of trading. There currently no other IPOs on the calendar. 
The benchmark S&P 500 is down nearly 20% from its record high in mid-February, despite big gains early this week, as measures to contain the virus brought the U.S. economy to a virtual halt.
No matter the direction of the market or the size of the moves, keeping the markets open is of paramount importance as it has a direct affect on investor confidence, said Friedman, who is also a board member of the New York Federal Reserve.
""Investors have put hard-earned savings into the market,"" she said. ""Now at a time when they are facing a lot of disruption themselves, if you close the market and choke off access to their savings, at a moment when they might need it the most, that is obviously a big break in trust and so when you reopen the market, you can imagine that they would race to the door.""

The spike in trading volumes during the crisis has benefited Nasdaq, which makes around 25% of its revenues from exchange transactions, and the company is not planning any layoffs for its around 4,000 employees, across 30 countries, most of whom are working from home, Friedman said.

""I am optimistic that the talks in Bern, Berlin, Brussels and Vienna will lead to good and positive results,"" CEO Carsten Spohr said in a video message to staff that was posted online.
People close to the matter told Reuters last week that Germany was in talks to provide Lufthansa, which has grounded 95% of its fleet due to the pandemic, with billions of euros in state aid and could take a stake in the airline.
Spohr added that Lufthansa was lucky to have a liquidity buffer of more than 4 billion euros ($4.35 billion), but some of that was owed to customers that have paid for now-cancelled flights and the carrier was currently losing cash at a rate of 1 million euros per hour, possibly for months to come.
""This crisis will take much longer than we could have imagined just a few weeks ago,"" Spohr said.
Lufthansa, which also owns Swiss International, Austrian Airlines and Brussels Airlines, has previously said it was considering requests for state support.

1222,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 02:55PM ET</span>",U.S. SEC issues compliance focus areas for brokers before new rules take effect,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the examination office at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday published details about the expected scope and content for compliance with a new rule requiring broker-dealers and investment advisers to disclose potential conflicts of interest.
Although the financial industry had lobbied to delay or suspend parts of the measure beyond its June 30 deadline, citing issues stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, SEC Chair Jay Clayton said the deadline remained ""appropriate,"" but indicated there could be flexibility and more insight provided on the agency's examination approach.
Tuesday's notice seeks to underscore that the SEC will assess whether brokers have made a ""good faith effort"" to comply with the Best Interest rule, including the operational effectiveness of its procedures, the agency said.
The agency added that, among other issues, it wants to spot potential issues like whether brokers recommend account types, or whether firms fail to describe how advisers are paid in the rule's Client Relationship Summary form. 
""It is important to share our plans for initial examinations to help firms assess their preparedness as the June 30, 2020 compliance date nears,"" said Pete Driscoll, director of SEC's Office Compliance Inspections and Examinations, adding that the agency's focus would ""take into account firm-specific effects from disruptions caused by COVID-19.""
However, investor advocates have said the agency's rule doesn't go far enough, and they would likely view the agency's examination efforts as a move to curb to lobby pressure and mislead investors, even without extending the deadline.
The new rule has been widely seen as a win for Wall Street, which successfully fought off a more onerous investment advice proposal by the Department of Labor. Most notably, the SEC's rule still allows brokers to recommend financial products that benefit them, provided they disclose the conflict.

Clayton has pushed back on this characterization, saying ""in sum, Reg BI cannot be satisfied by disclosure alone.""

1224,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 02:40PM ET</span>",U.S. companies criticized for cutting jobs rather than investor payouts,"By Alwyn Scott, Ross Kerber, Jessica DiNapoli and Rebecca Spalding
NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - U.S. companies laying off workers in response to the coronavirus pandemic but still paying dividends and buying back shares are drawing criticism from labor unions, pension fund advisers, lawmakers and corporate governance experts.
While most U.S. companies are scaling back payouts after a decade in which the amount of money paid to investors through buybacks and dividends more than tripled, some are maintaining their policies despite the economic pain.
 Royal Caribbean  Cruises Ltd (N:RCL),  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL), General Motors Co (N:GM) and McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) have all laid off staff, cut their hours, or slashed salaries while maintaining payouts, according to a Reuters review of regulatory filings, company announcements and company officials.
""This is the time for large companies to try to help, for systemic reasons, to keep things flowing,"" said Ken Bertsch, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors. The council's members include public pension funds and endowments that manage assets worth about $4 trillion.
Royal Caribbean, which has halted its cruises in response to the pandemic and borrowed to boost its liquidity to more than $3.6 billion, said it began laying off contract workers in mid-March, though the moves did not affect its full-time employees.
The company has not suspended its remaining $600 million share buyback program, which expires in May, or its dividend, which totaled $602 million last year and is set quarterly.
""We continue to take decisive actions to protect (our) financial and liquidity positions,"" Royal Caribbean spokesman Jonathon Fishman said. He declined to comment specifically on the layoffs or shareholder payouts.
While Royal Caribbean's rival Carnival Corp (N:CCL) has also laid off contract workers, it has suspended dividends and buybacks as it raised more than $6 billion in capital markets to weather the coronavirus storm.
UNEMPLOYMENT SURGE
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts forecast this week that S&P 500 companies would cut dividends in 2020 by an average of 50% because of the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
For a graphic on S&P 500 shareholder payouts from 2009 to 2018, please click on: https://reut.rs/349G2JV
While there has been criticism of companies maintaining investor payouts, only those receiving financial support from the U.S. government under a $2.3 trillion stimulus package are obliged to suspend share buybacks.
Layoffs contributed to U.S. unemployment skyrocketing last month. Jobless claims topped 6.6 million in the week ended March 28 - double the record set the prior week and far above the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982.
Companies say job cuts are necessary to offset a plunge in revenue but their critics say they should consider turning off the spigots to shareholders before letting employees go.
""If companies are paying dividends and doing buybacks, they do not have to lay off workers,"" said William Lazonick, a corporate governance expert at the University of Massachusetts.
Workers at franchised McDonald's restaurants say they are getting fewer shifts since dining areas were closed in March, leaving only carry-out and drive-through services open.
Alma Ceballos, 31, who has worked at a franchised McDonald's near San Francisco for 14 years, said she could not pay her rent after her schedule was cut to 16 hours from 40 and her husband, a janitor at Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) Cupertino, California, campus was laid off.
McDonald's, which has suspended buybacks but maintained its annual dividend, worth $3.6 billion in 2019, told Reuters its staffing and opening hours were not related to ""making a choice between employees and dividends"".
About 95% of its U.S. restaurants are run by franchisees who decide staffing. McDonald's said it was offering rent deferrals and other help to keep franchises open and employing workers.
""McDonald's could commit to 30 days of income for all workers,"" Mary Kay Henry, president of the labor union SEIU which has 2 million members, said in an interview with Reuters. ""Corporations need to pay their fair share here.""
'IT'S JUST WRONG'
General Motors has halted normal production in North America and temporarily reduced cash pay for salaried workers by 20%. It paid its first-quarter dividend on March 20 and has a month before declaring its next dividend, a spokeswoman said, adding that GM would assess economic conditions before deciding.
""Our focus in the near term is to protect the health of our employees and customers, ensure we have ample liquidity for a very wide range of scenarios, and implement austerity measures to preserve cash,"" spokeswoman Lauren Langille said.
Oilfield services firm Halliburton furloughed about 3,500 workers in its Houston office starting on March 23, according to a letter sent to the Texas Workforce Commission obtained by Reuters. It has also cut 350 positions in Oklahoma.
Halliburton cited disruption from the coronavirus as well as plunging oil prices as the reason for the furlough. In March, it paid its first-quarter dividend to shareholders as planned.
A Halliburton spokeswoman declined to comment on the furlough and the company's dividend policy. 
Some of the companies laying off workers while still paying out shareholders, such as General Motors, signed an initiative last year from the Business Roundtable, a group of chief executives, pledging to make business decisions in the interest of employees and other stakeholders, not just shareholders.
Large asset managers such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Vanguard have cited managing ""human capital"" as a priority for companies in which they invest. Yet they have been reluctant to publicly press companies to avoid layoffs during the crisis.
Vanguard told Reuters it ""recognizes the need for companies to exercise judgment and flexibility as they balance short- and long-term business considerations"". 
BlackRock did not respond with a statement when contacted for comment.
""Profits should be shared with the workers who actually create them,"" U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin, a long-standing critic of share buybacks, told Reuters in an email.

""It's just wrong for big corporations to reward the wealthy or top executives with more stock buybacks, while closing facilities and laying off workers.""

1228,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 02:36PM ET</span>",Volatility Anomaly Is Turning Perceptions of Safety Upside Down,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors are redefining what constitutes safety in the stock market as the unprecedented lockdown of the U.S. economy takes hold.
Options pricing is showing traders have more faith in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). holding up than they do in the broader market. The anomaly, never before seen in data going back to 2010, puts the three-month implied volatility of the e-commerce giant below that of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. It has been an average of 15.6 points higher during the past decade.
In normal times, a large group of stocks will tend to have a lower implied volatility than any individual company because of the likelihood of offsetting gains and losses among many moving parts.
But things are different now because Amazon -- the biggest weight in the consumer discretionary index -- has become perhaps the most important consumer staple as Americans shelter in place. The stock is less than 7% off its all-time high despite labor strife driven by employee safety concerns amid the coronavirus. That compares to a drawdown of almost 20% for the exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500 Index.It’s one thing for traditionally defensive companies like the health care conglomerate Johnson & Johnson or diversified behemoths like  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  . (NYSE:BRKa) to occasionally post implied volatility below the broad market. That happens, albeit rarely, during periods of stress. It’s quite another thing for this to happen to a high-growth company trading at 46 times forward earnings.To some, this volatility anomaly suggests a bottom may not be in yet for stocks, as some of the bull market’s darlings haven’t been sufficiently punished during this bear market. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc., for instance, is another member of the so-called FANG quartet with lower three-month implied volatility than the SPY (NYSE:SPY) ETF.“The mega caps in the Nasdaq 100 have been bastions of stability relative to the market as a whole,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “Those remain relatively impervious to the broader fears, and that means they haven’t capitulated yet.”While implied volatility aims to look into the future, the recent past shows a similar phonemon fo Amazon. The stock’s 60-session historial volatility is lower than the benchmark equity index’s for the first time on record.
It’s the culmination of a major change in the character of the stock: Over the five years ending April 2018, Amazon’s beta to the broad market was 1.21, indicating the shares tended to post daily moves 21% larger than the S&P 500 Index. Over the past two years, that measure has shrunk to 0.89.
The Covid-19 outbreak has created a market in which all stocks are affected by a common factor, and tend to move in harmony. The discount in Amazon’s volatility relative to SPY also speaks to an expectation that this dynamic will continue, even as the White House develops plans to re-open some parts of the U.S. economy.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) chief equity derivatives strategist Mandy Xu said this week that longer-dated correlation is “one metric that remains extremely stressed.”

1234,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 01:54PM ET</span>",Trump Health Team Crafts Plan to Open Economy If Virus Crests,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump’s top health advisers are developing medical criteria for safely reopening the U.S. economy in coming weeks should trends showing a crest in the coronavirus outbreak hold steady.
Deborah Birx, the immunologist who coordinates the White House virus task force, met into the night Tuesday with health experts, including Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn.
Notably absent from the late-night discussion were economic and political advisers to the president, along with the leader of the coronavirus task force, Vice President Mike Pence, and his chief of staff, Marc Short.
Excluding the political and economic advisers was a deliberate signal that the White House would continue for now to prioritize health considerations over economic ones, according to three people familiar with the meeting who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
“We are going to let the data drive our decision making,” Katie Miller, press secretary to the vice president, said in an email.
Trump’s Enthusiasm
Still, Trump remains enthusiastic about trying to restart the economy as quickly as possible, and is pressing staff to expedite planning. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow and presidential son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner have been encouraged by the president to get Americans back to work as quickly as possible with an eye toward the possible fallout from a coronavirus recession on the president’s re-election prospects.
There is “a lot of activity going on” within the White House as aides try to figure out how to return Americans to work, Fauci said Wednesday.
“It makes sense to at least plan what a reentry into normality would look like,” Fauci said in an interview with Fox News. “That doesn’t mean we are going to do it right now, but it means we need to be prepared to ease into that.”
States, businesses and ordinary Americans began adopting the social distancing practices that have hamstrung the economy before Trump recommended them on March 16, and it isn’t clear the country will abandon the behaviors simply because the president says it should.
Still, Trump tweeted Wednesday that a re-opening would come “sooner rather than later.”
Trump has expressed an interest in empaneling a second coronavirus task force focused exclusively on the economy, though he sidestepped questions from reporters about whether he intends to do so. He indicated to reporters at the White House on Tuesday that a second panel might slow efforts to reopen the economy.
“We’re thinking about that, but we want to open up, and we want to get it open soon,” Trump said.
Vice President Mike Pence -- who leads the existing task force -- said Trump had initiated a “dual track” effort to monitor both the nation’s health and economic safety.
“Some of the best minds here at the White House are beginning to think about what recommendations will look like that we give to businesses, that we give to states,” Pence said.
The administration expects to release as soon as Wednesday new guidance advising individuals who were in proximity to those who contracted coronavirus -- but who themselves do not show any symptoms -- on when they may be able to return to work. The guidance is expected to include careful temperature monitoring and the use of facial protection.
The White House is also soliciting ideas from business groups in Washington on advising companies about restarting operations, and what guidance would be most beneficial to managers looking to balance workers’ safety with a desire to resume operations.
Officials are considering drawing so-called “red zones” and “green zones” within the country to designate where the federal government believes it’s safe to reopen, according to Politico. The plan appears to be a variation of a proposal that Trump was weighing two weeks ago to designate each county as a high, medium, or low risk. The administration would provide matching guidelines for state and local policymakers about maintaining, increasing, or relaxing social distancing.“We’re looking at the concept where we open sections of the country and we’re also looking at the concept where you open up everything,” Trump told Fox News.
The planning would likely depend on testing far more Americans for the virus than has been possible to date. The administration sees rapid and widespread testing as a crucial step, one person familiar with the matter said. Doing so would allow health authorities to better identify infected people, including those who don’t show symptoms, and isolate them from healthy people.
That’s led White House officials to increase pressure on local laboratory directors. Birx said high-volume platforms -- like an  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) test that can provide results within minutes, and an automated test developed by Roche Laboratories Inc. -- should be adopted to provide the scale of testing needed for an effort to reopen the economy.
“We’re really calling on them to really increase that capacity so that we can do not only increase diagnostic testing -- which I think we’re doing quite well right now -- but also increasing the ability to do more health-care workers, first responders, community testing, and surveillance,” Birx said.

1235,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 01:50PM ET</span>",Fed modifying asset cap so Wells Fargo can make more small business loans,"By Imani Moise
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it would ""temporarily and narrowly"" modify the growth restriction on  Wells Fargo  & Co's (N:WFC) balance sheet, allowing the bank to make more loans under government assistance programs for small businesses hurt by the coronavirus disruption.
The change will allow the bank to make additional loans under the $350 billion small business payroll protection program approved by Congress last month and the Fed's forthcoming Main Street Lending Program, and will be in place as long as those facilities are active, the central bank said.
The announcement prompted Wells Fargo to announce it was expanding its participation in the small business rescue program after initially restricting its lending capacity at $10 billion due to regulatory requirements despite seeing high demand. 
Wells Fargo, one of the largest U.S. small business lenders, received over 170,000 indications of interest for the program within the first two days.
Small businesses have been hit hard by the COVID1-19 pandemic, which has shuttered, at least temporarily, non-essential businesses in many states and curbed consumer spending. 
The bank has been urging the Fed to lift the asset cap so it can unleash its full lending capacity to support struggling businesses and consumers, but regulators were initially cold to the idea, Reuters has reported.
The liquidity crunch facing Main Street has helped the scandal-plagued bank pick up unlikely advocates, including Wall Street watchdog group Better Markets and former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) chair Sheila Bair, who have said the Fed should grant the bank more leeway to make sure small businesses can access much-needed funds. 
Loans made under the new government programs will not count toward the $1.95 trillion asset cap the Fed imposed on the bank in February 2018. The Fed has said it would only remove the cap when Wells Fargo had improved its governance and risk controls following a wave of sales practice scandals.
""To date the firm has to date not satisfied all of the requirements for removal of the asset growth restriction,"" Fed officials said in the amended consent order on Wednesday.

Under the new conditions, Wells Fargo will have to turn over any fees generated from its participation in the program to the U.S. Treasury or to nonprofits approved by the Fed.

1237,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 01:25PM ET</span>",Centerview turns to Matthieu Pigasse to lead new Paris hub,"By Gwénaëlle Barzic and Pamela Barbaglia
PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Centerview has hired Lazard's former France boss, Matthieu Pigasse, to lead its newly-launched Paris office and win business from European companies grappling with the economic damage caused by the coronavirus outbreak.
Centerview, which currently operates in Europe from its London outpost, has also poached former Lazard bankers Nicolas Constant and Pierre Pasqual.
Pigasse, who left Lazard in October after 17 years at the firm, will head a 14-strong team of bankers focusing on merger and acquisition (M&A) deals as well as corporate restructurings and financing needs for French and European clients. 
The 51-year old media mogul, who helped rescue the Le Monde group, will also pioneer sovereign advisory on behalf of Centerview - a business that the U.S. boutique bank has not tackled before.
Pigasse has built a reputation for himself after advising world governments including Iraq, Greece and Argentina in their debt restructuring efforts.
A former advisor to the French Treasury, Pigasse also boasts long-standing relationships in France's tight-knit world of finance and has worked with companies including L'Oreal (PA:OREP) and  Danone  (PA:DANO).
Centerview has been trying to lure Pigasse for the past nine months in a bid to advise France's key companies and ramp up its continental European business in the wake of Britain's departure from the EU.
""Despite current challenges, we are confident that businesses in France and across Europe are resilient and will be essential contributors to the global economic recovery,"" said Centerview's co-founder Blair Effron.
The boutique firm, which was launched by Effron and co-founder Robert Pruzan in 2006, has ambitious plans for its Paris office located on the upmarket Avenue Matignon.
It wants to hire another five to ten junior bankers in Paris in the coming months to boost its ability to provide long-term support to crisis-hit clients on a broad range of topics.
Constant, who quit Lazard just weeks before Pigasse, will serve as his right-hand man having been named partner of the firm alongside Pigasse, while Pierre Pasqual will serve as a managing director.
With the French economy officially entering a recession, Centerview's Paris hub will gradually try to position itself to advise on deals in other battered economies including Italy and Spain.
Pigasse said Centerview's decision to press ahead with the office launch was ""an act of confidence in the future"" and pledged to support ""French and European companies in dealing with the crisis and preparing for recovery in the best possible conditions.""
The U.S. firm ranked poorly in first quarter global M&A league tables, slipping to 21st place, according to Refinitiv data, while its fierce rival Evercore ranked fourth after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
Centerview has typically advised U.S. clients when working on European deals and recently represented jeweller Tiffany (N:TIF) in sales discussions with LVMH (PA:LVMH), and Synthorx when the U.S. biotech was sold to Sanofi (PA:SASY) last year.

1238,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 01:10PM ET</span>","Toyota extends North American plant shutdown; will stop paying 5,000 temporary workers","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said Wednesday it plans to reopen its North American auto plants on May 4, extending its current shutdown by two additional weeks.
The Japanese automaker cited the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and decline in vehicle demand to extend the halt of production at all of its automobile and components plants in Canada, Mexico and the United States.
Toyota will not furlough its direct employees, but has asked its hourly plant employees to take two days out of the 10 day extension as paid time off or they can go without pay if they don’t have accrued leave.
For Toyota's 5,000 workers provided by outside agencies, Toyota is releasing those workers back to their agencies. Toyota will continue to pay the benefits of those workers for the time being, and they may be eligible for unemployment.
On Tuesday, Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co on Tuesday said they had furloughed thousands of workers at their U.S. operations as the coronavirus pandemic slashes demand for cars in the country.
A spokesman for Honda, which employs about 18,400 workers at plants in Alabama, Indiana and Ohio, said the Japanese automaker would guarantee salaries through Sunday, having suspended operations on March 23. The plants will be closed through May 1.
Nissan said it was temporarily laying off about 10,000 U.S. hourly workers effective April 6. It has suspended operations at its U.S. manufacturing facilities through late April due to the impact of the outbreak.

Automakers are facing a dramatic drop in sales in the United States, the world’s second-largest car market, after some states barred dealers from selling new cars while “stay-at-home” orders are in place. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV on Monday extended its shutdown of U.S. and Canadian plants until May 4.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) plans to convert up to $4.3 billion of its debt into equity and to issue new shares as it seeks to stay in business following the COVID-19 outbreak that has grounded almost all of its fleet, the budget carrier said on Wednesday.
The move would allow the airline to tap government guarantees of up to 3 billion Norwegian crowns ($292 million), which are dependent on the company reducing its ratio of debt to equity.
Growing rapidly in the last decade to become Europe's third-largest low-cost airline and the biggest foreign carrier serving New York and other major U.S. cities, Norwegian had accumulated debts and liabilities of close to $8 billion by the end of 2019.
On March 16, the company announced temporary layoffs of 7,300 employees, about 90% of its workforce, and the following day called on Norway's government for help, saying it needed cash ""within weeks, not months"".
""The proposed measures are necessary in securing the next tranches of the Norwegian government state guarantee program,"" Chief Executive Jacob Schram said in a statement on Wednesday, announcing the measures on the eve of Norway's Easter break.
""They are also necessary for the future of the company by strengthening the company's balance sheet,"" added Schram, who joined the airline only last year, adding work had begun on building the future ""New Norwegian"".
VOTE NEXT MONTH
The company must convince its creditors to agree to the plan before it is put to a shareholders' vote on May 4.
If approved, Norwegian would convert part or all of its bonds worth 5.68 billion crowns into shares as well as leasing debt of up to 38.82 billion crowns, the company said.
It would also aim to raise at least 300 million crowns of fresh cash by selling new shares, with the aim of reaching a total of 400 million to meet government terms for its aid.
Those deals are far in excess of the company's market capitalisation of 1.4 billion crowns and will significantly dilute existing equity.
Asset manager Sissener AS, which holds bonds in Norwegian with a nominal value of $5 million, but also shorted some stock, said creditors may have few options but to accept the proposal.
Seizing the underlying assets would make little sense in the current situation, the fund's founding partner Jan Petter Sissener told Reuters.
""One of the bonds has a hangar as security, who needs a hangar today? And the others, with security in slots at Gatwick, they don't have much value today either,"" Sissener said.
On the other hand, foreign creditors may not see it the same way, he added.
""It's the American bond holders that are calling the shots and they may have a different agenda, I don't know how they will react.""
The stock has plunged almost 80% over the past two months as the crisis has engulfed the airline industry and deepened Norwegian's existing financial difficulties. 
While Norwegian quickly qualified for access to 10% of government guarantees introduced to help businesses weather the coronavirus crisis, it must convince financial creditors to temporarily forego payments if it is to access the second tranche, worth 1.2 billion crowns.
To access the final tranche, of 1.5 billion crowns, the company must also raise equity, the government has said.

The Austrian arm of Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), which has announced that it would close its Germanwings low-cost carrier and reduce capacity across the group, also signalled job cuts. 
How many of its 7,000 employees will lose their jobs will depend on the state aid and how soon the industry will be able to ramp up services, an AUA spokesman said. 
He did not comment speculation by several media outlets including public broadcaster ORF about a 500 to 800 million euro aid package.
The finance ministry referred to the Austrian government's coronavirus aid package of 38 billion euros, when asked about the state aid. It said that AUA could make use of the available instruments. 
Both sides had an interest in keeping Vienna as a transfer hub, and therefore it would make sense for the state to provide money in exchange for a location guarantee with a certain amount of jobs, a source close to the talks said.

Lufthansa has idled more than 90% of its fleet since the virus outbreak and has already held talks with the German government on providing liquidity, including through special loans from state development bank KfW.

(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) posted a steeper-than-expected decline in first-quarter comparable store sales and the burger chain pulled its full-year forecast as coronavirus-led lockdowns forced it to shutter stores and stick to delivery or take-out.
The company - one of the first major quick-service chains to provide a glimpse into the impact of the health crisis - said on Wednesday it had raised $6.5 billion in the quarter and suspended share buybacks to bolster its cash reserves.
McDonald's March comparable sales tumbled 22.2% globally and 13.4% in the United States, as authorities imposed lockdowns and strict travel curbs to contain the spread of the virus, which has infected more than 1.3 million and killed over 81,000 globally.
About 75% of McDonald's 38,000 restaurants around the world were operational during the quarter, the majority of which adapted to focus on drive-thru, delivery or take-away, Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski said.
""This unprecedented situation is changing the world we live in, and we will need to adapt to a new reality in its aftermath,"" Kempczinski said in a statement.
The steep drop in March led to a 3.4% fall in comparable sales for the three months ended March 31, compared with the 0.91% drop analysts on average had expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
""There will be more challenges and difficult business decisions to be made,"" Kempczinski said. 
Still, Wall Street analysts said strong sales at the start of the quarter, when global same-store sales rose 7.2%, could help the company get back on its feet soon.
""The business update implies McDonald's is well-positioned for an eventual recovery following Jan/Feb momentum,"" said BMO Capital Markets analyst Andrew Strelzik. 
McDonald's said it would defer rent and royalties for its franchisees, who are already facing difficulties due to the outbreak and are burdened with other expenses like restaurant renovations as a part of the company's push to modernize stores. 
The company said it expects to reduce capital expenditures by about $1 billion for 2020 due to fewer store renovations in the United States and fewer restaurant openings around the world.
McDonald's said the cancellation of its Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention due to the health crisis could cost about $40 million due to refunds. 

The Chicago-based company's shares were up about 2% amid a bounce in the broader market.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets climbed in morning trading Wednesday on fresh hopes that the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic will soon be past.
At 11:40 AM ET (1540 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 588 points, or 2.6% from Tuesday’s close, putting it on course for its highest close in over three weeks. The S&P 500 was up 2.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 2%.
Sentiment was lifted by a new projection of a much lower death toll from the Covid-19 virus than previously thought. While the Trump administration had warned of over 100,000 possible deaths in the U.S. last week, researchers at the University of Washington estimated that the actual number may be limited to about 60,000. It had earlier predicted over 80,000.
The growth rate of new infections nationwide fell to only 8.1% on Tuesday, the latest in a string of daily declines, even though both caseload and mortality statistics continue to hit new highs in absolute terms. 
For some at least, that means that the market bottom is near enough to warrant increasing exposure to stocks. Oaktree Capital founder Howard Marks told investors that he was no longer inclined to “play defense” but rather to buy stocks that offered value at their current levels. Goldman Sachs is also upbeat.
“Our own advice to clients is that right now is a good time to get back into markets and take advantage of the decline in equity markets to position for the rebound,” Bloomberg quoted Silvia Ardagna, managing director in the investment strategy group within Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Private Wealth Management, as saying.
Short-term economic numbers still look miserable, however. The Mortgage Bankers Association’s purchase index slumped 12.2% in the period ended April 3. That rounded off its sharpest monthly drop since mid-2010.
Also, France’s central bank said it expects first-quarter GDP to have shrunk by 6% while Germany’s leading research institutes predicted a 9.8% contraction in their country in Q2.
McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock fell 1.8% despite saying comparable sales fell 22% in March, and 3.4% for the first quarter. Analysts had expected quarterly sales to fall 0.9%.
Short-seller Carson Block announced a short position in online health marketplace  eHealth  (NASDAQ:EHTH) stock, puhsing it down 12.2%. Block's Muddy Waters Research said the company uses aggressive accounting techniques to hide a lack of underlying profitability.

1249,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 11:36AM ET</span>",Five Ideas That Do Nothing for the Pandemic Economy,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There’s no shortage of good ideas for dealing with the economic fallout from the coronavirus shutdowns. Some of the best include helping companies to keep workers in their jobs, paying for coronavirus testing and treatment, bailing out state governments and having the Federal Reserve lend cheaply to businesses. But sometimes, leaders can become fixated on mediocre policies instead. These don’t necessarily cause the economy additional harm, but they can distract from doing the things that really need to be done and become symbolic flashpoints for partisan debate. Here are a five ideas that are being thrown around that should be quickly and quietly shelved.
No. 1. Capital gains tax cuts
Some administration officials have floated the idea of capital-gains tax cuts as part of the next stimulus bill. But cutting capital-gains taxes is a dubious idea in the best of times. In some economic theories, reducing the tax rate that investors pay when their assets appreciate induces them to invest more money in markets, allowing companies to fund themselves more cheaply. But these theories probably bear little relation to reality in a world awash in cheap capital. Dividend tax cuts, which are similar, have shown no ability to boost investment. In the current pandemic situation there’s even less of a chance this would happen. Companies can already borrow and invest cheaply, thanks to the Federal Reserve; a tax cut on top of that would be nothing but a gratuitous giveaway to shareholders. Fortunately, even economic adviser Larry Kudlow seems to realize how useless this idea is.
No. 2. SALT deduction
President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax reform limited the amount of state and local taxes that could be deducted from federal tax bills. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has floated the idea of uncapping that deduction as part of a new stimulus bill aimed at giving money to states. In theory, this might reduce political pressure on states to cut their top income taxes, allowing them to gather more revenue from high earners. But that effect, if it ever came, would take a long time to show up. In the meantime, uncapping SALT deductions would simply hand cash to high earners -- the people harmed least by the current crisis. Giving money directly to state governments is a much better idea.
No. 3. Export bans
Throughout the crisis, U.S. medical personnel have faced a shortage of personal-protection equipment such as masks, face shields and gowns. This has put front-line workers in danger and held back U.S. testing efforts. In response, Trump ordered a ban on exports of these and other items. Although looking out for the U.S.’s own interests in a crisis is perfectly legitimate, this export ban was misguided because it will invite retaliation from trading partners that the U.S. still relies on for crucial medical supplies. That could easily end up making shortages worse. Fortunately the Trump administration seems to be partially reversing the move. Let's hope the European Union, which has enacted similar export restrictions, will follow suit.
No. 4. More unemployment insurance
Pelosi has suggested including more extended unemployment-insurance benefits in the next round of stimulus. But throwing even more people into the overloaded unemployment system is far from optimal. The approach made sense for the first round of rescue money only because something had to be done immediately, and the unemployment insurance system was an existing program that could start mailing checks relatively quickly. But there’s a big downside; letting companies throw employees out of work and then requiring people to search for new jobs after shutdowns causes long-term economic disruption. A much better approach is to do what countries such as Denmark have done -- pay companies to keep workers on staff until the shutdown ends. The more economic relationships and income streams that can be preserved intact through the crisis, the better.
No. 5. Liability waivers
There are reports that the Trump administration is considering issuing blanket waivers of liability to companies whose workers contract Covid-19 on the job, meaning they can't sue their employers if they become infected on the job. The idea might be that fear of lawsuits is keeping employers from hiring during the shutdowns. But this makes little sense -- it’s the shutdowns themselves that are reducing employment. Waiving legal liability would simply discourage companies in essential industries, such as grocery stores or delivery services, from providing their workers with adequate protection equipment. That in turn would raise the amount of compensation that workers demand in exchange for staying on the job, making it harder for essential businesses to stay open. Instead, the next stimulus bill should simply pay companies to provide adequate protection to their workers, as well as subsidizing premium pay for hazardous work.

The company is considering the idea as one way to make the public feel safe about returning to Disney's parks once they are allowed to open again for business, Iger told Barron's. 
""One of the things that we’re discussing already is that in order to return to some semblance of normal, people will have to feel comfortable that they’re safe,"" Iger said. ""Some of that could come in the form ultimately of a vaccine, but in the absence of that it could come from basically, more scrutiny, more restrictions.""
""Just as we now do bag checks for everybody that goes into our parks, it could be that at some point we add a component of that that takes people’s temperatures, as a for-instance,"" Iger added.
Disney operates Walt Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California as well as theme parks in China, Hong Kong, Japan and France. All are currently closed to help fight the spread of the novel coronavirus. The company has not said when they will re-open.
Walt Disney World, the most-visited theme park in the world, attracted 58.4 million visitors in 2018, according to the Themed Entertainment Association.
Iger said Disney is studying China's efforts to let people return to everyday activities.

In China, ""you can’t get on a bus or a subway or a train or enter a high-rise building there, and I’m sure this will be the case when their schools reopen, without having your temperature taken,"" Iger said.

Airport passenger numbers have continued to plunge due to the new coronavirus, which has decimated air travel across the globe. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration screened just 97,130 travelers on Tuesday versus over 2 million on the same day a year ago, according to daily data provided on its website.
""We face new challenges every day and can’t hesitate to take the steps necessary to reduce our costs amidst dramatically falling demand so we can emerge from this unprecedented time as a strong company for our customers and crewmembers,” JetBlue head of revenue and planning Scott Laurence said in a statement.
The airline, which is among U.S. carriers seeking government support to pay employees, has already reduced flying across its network by 80% per day in April and is now taking additional steps to streamline its operations.
Under the new plan, JetBlue will bundle flights in and out of Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco and Washington D.C. at one or two airports in those areas between April 15 and June 10.

The move is aimed at reducing excess flying while maintaining a critical level of service for those who absolutely must fly, it said.

The Department of Health and Human Services contract is the first for ventilator production under the Defense Production Act, invoked by President Donald Trump to get companies to produce essential gear needed to fight the pandemic.
GM will work with ventilator firm Ventec Life Systems to deliver 30,000 ventilators under the contract to the U.S. government by the end of August, with deliveries of the first 6,132 ventilators taking place by June 1.

1266,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 09:54AM ET</span>",Goldman Tells Rich Clients U.S. Stocks Still Offer Best Returns,"(Bloomberg) --  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). is advising its wealthy clients to return to equities and particularly favors U.S. stocks on optimism for a strong economic recovery after the end of the virus lockdowns.
“Our own advice to clients is that right now is a good time to get back into markets and take advantage of the decline in equity markets to position for the rebound,” Silvia Ardagna, managing director in the investment strategy group within Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management, said in a phone interview.
While Goldman strategists expect a sharp near-term decline in global economic activity, they also forecast a V-shaped rebound in the second half of the year. Ardagna said her team has been “positively impressed” by the response of policymakers and while these measures won’t prevent a recession in the first half, they’ll likely fuel a powerful recovery.
Goldman’s investment strategy group recommended in mid-March that clients use the selloff to slowly add to risk assets and said it was using options instead of direct purchases of U.S. stocks. Ardagna said that in its tactical fund, Goldman has since gone outright long the S&P 500 Index to position for the bounce. U.S. equities reached their low on March 23 after slumping 34% over the course of a month and have since rallied 19%.
“We see light at the end of the tunnel because we believe that sooner or later the medical community will make breakthroughs, and because the fiscal and monetary response around the world, especially in the U.S., where we’re overweight stocks, has been pretty aggressive and forceful,” she said, while adding that the market may remain volatile because of the pandemic.
Strong Rebound
comments echo those of Peter Oppenheimer, Goldman’s chief global equity strategist, who said on Bloomberg TV that global growth is expected to rise 6% next year, fueling a strong rebound in equities. He added that the stock market isn’t yet reflecting a pick-up in earnings in 2021 that is expected to be at least 50% in Europe and the U.S.
Fiscal support measures in the U.S. are giving businesses incentive to retain workers, which should allow them to restart their operations more quickly once lockdowns are lifted, Ardagna said. Sentiment among U.S. small businesses collapsed in March by the most on record and payrolls slumped by more than 700,000, seven times as much as economists had forecast.
Goldman’s consumer and wealth-management unit had $561 billion of assets under supervision at the end of 2019, up 23% from a year earlier.
Ardagna said the team isn’t recommending positions in high-yield credit or European government bonds because U.S. stocks offer a much better risk-reward.
“When valuations are so low, when there’s been pretty sharp drawdowns in equity markets, on a 12- to 18-month horizon, the probability of getting a positive return is pretty high,” she said."

The Mortgage Bankers Association’s purchase index slumped 12.2% in the period ended April 3 after tumbling 25.7%, data from the Washington-based group showed Wednesday. Over the past four weeks, the gauge has declined nearly 95 points, the sharpest monthly drop since mid-2010.
Government stay-at-home orders designed to limit the spread of Covid-19 are also inflicting economic damage across industries, including residential real estate. While the MBA’s data showed 30-year fixed mortgage rates are down nearly a percentage point from a year ago, interested homebuyers are unable to take advantage of lower borrowing costs.
The group’s measure of refinancing applications declined 19.4% last week -- though remained elevated -- while the broader index of all mortgage applications fell 17.9%.

1270,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 09:10AM ET</span>",Germany's short-time work fix offers Europe a crisis model,"By Edward Taylor and Jan Schwartz
FRANKFURT/HAMBURG (Reuters) - A tried-and-tested German model of sending workers home in exchange for job guarantees during downturns could help the European Union limit the damage from the coronavirus pandemic.
EU ministers voiced support in principle on Tuesday for a plan to raise 100 billion euros ($109 billion), against 25 billion euros of government guarantees, to subsidise wages so that firms can cut working hours rather than sack people.
Critics warn that adopting the German practice of short-time work or Kurzarbeit, which helped Europe's largest economy emerge faster than others from the 2009 recession, may hamper and delay much-needed EU restructuring.
Nevertheless, it is being emulated by other countries to combat the downturn as the coronavirus crisis hits Europe.
Germany's IG Metall union has already lowered wage demands for 3.8 million metalworkers and company labour representatives began pushing for Kurzarbeit to help slash wage costs.
""The corona pandemic caused us to abandon normal collective wage bargaining and we struck a deal with employers aimed at securing work and income,"" said Rudolf Luz, head of operations policy at IG Metall, which has now agreed to forego a pay rise.
All the large carmakers in Germany, including VW, Audi, BMW, Mercedes, have applied for short-working in recent weeks.
""Thanks to Kurzarbeit we can cut back production without destroying structures. Employees cannot be dismissed, they stay in the organisation and companies immediately have qualified staff once the crisis is over,"" IG Metall's Luz said.
Instead of drawing a full salary, employees will tap a 26 billion euro insurance fund overseen by Germany's Federal Employment Office, which guarantees workers at least 60% of their basic pay or more if companies add their own stipend.
""The more generous the terms, the more likely aggregate demand and consumption can be maintained during the crisis and the faster the recovery once the confinement measures are lifted,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Economist Marc de-Muizon said in a note.
EUROPEAN VARIATIONS 
Although France has extended its own partial unemployment scheme, a lack of clarity on eligibility criteria may weaken its efficiency, Deutsche Bank analysts said. 
Spanish measures look less generous, which may leave demand more exposed to downside risks, and there is uncertainty over the implementation of Britain's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and Self-employed Income Support Scheme, Deutsche Bank added. 
Germany's neighbour, Poland, has a short-work scheme, but critics say it has not been administered efficiently. 
A survey by the Lewiatan Confederation business association in Poland showed that job cuts might be necessary in 69% of the country's businesses because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Sonia Buchholtz, an economist at Lewiatan estimates that less than a quarter of Poland's coronavirus economic plan, which represents over 9% of gross domestic product (GDP), is fiscal stimulus that can be channelled to companies promptly. 
""We have many good practices from Europe like the Kurzarbeit from Germany, tools that we could introduce and learn from,"" Buchholtz said.
KEY TO RECOVERY 
In the longer run, Kurzarbeit subsidies could discourage restructuring of underperforming companies, said Jacob Kirkegaard, Senior Fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
""You don't want Kurzarbeit to delay the inevitable and allow a zombie company to survive. It is a fine balance,"" he said.
Deutsche Bank estimates the number of short-time workers in Germany is likely to peak at 3.5-5.0 million, surpassing the 2009 record of just under 1.5 million.
Kurzarbeit helped Germany emerge faster from recession than the United States and other European economies, Alexander Hijzen, a labour market economist at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, told Reuters.
Although others operated similar schemes, the take-up and hence the potential impact tended to be much smaller, he said.
""We estimated that Kurzarbeit had a significant impact on preserving jobs during the global financial crisis, with employment in the second half of 2009 estimated to have been 580, 000 higher than what it would have been in its absence.""
Kirkegaard said countries that introduce a wage-subsidy model are in a better position for a relatively rapid recovery after a short-term deep shock than those where people are sent into unemployment. 
For Florian Hirsch, a 37-year-old assembly worker at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s plant in Wolfsburg, Germany, the unemployment insurance combined with a company stipend get him to 90% of his basic salary, he no longer gets overtime pay.
This makes him cautious about spending.

""The big question is, how will the overall economy recover from this?"" he said. ""What if we have no customers because they themselves have been put on short-term work, or lost their job? Then we lose the basis for earning our bread.""

Spirit's announcement comes days after Boeing suspended production of its 787 Dreamliner airplane, citing the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Boeing has already suspended production of its smaller 737 MAX airplanes, which await government approval to fly again following two deadly crashes.
Spirit previously announced plans to suspend production for Boeing for two weeks ending April 8.
The company said its factories in the United States will continue producing parts for Boeing rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR), its second biggest customer, which accounted for 16% of its sales last year, while also carrying on work for Spirit's defense contracts.
In January, Spirit said it would lay off 2,800 workers at its marquee facility in Wichita, as the 737 MAX grounding prolonged.
Spirit said on Wednesday it will reduce pay for all U.S.-based executives by 20% until further notice, and that Boeing production-related furloughs in Kansas and Oklahoma were for 21 calendar days.
The company had 18,200 employees as of 2019 and 15,900 of them in the United States.

Spirit's shares were up about 6% at $19.50 in premarket trading. The company's stock has fallen about 75% this year.

The France-based owner of luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton offered to buy Tiffany for $16.2 billion last November, and the deal is expected to close mid-2020.
Tiffany said it still aimed to close the deal by that time, subject to the review by the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB).
The FIRB is experiencing delays in processing transactions and requested extending the statutory review deadline of April 8 to until Oct. 6, which LVMH has accepted, according to a regulatory filing https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/98246/000156459020015787/tif-8k_20200407.htm.
The deal was cleared by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 26, while a draft filing has been submitted in Europe and pre-filing discussions are going on with the European Commission, Tiffany said.
Tiffany's shareholders approved the deal in February. 
Both LVMH and Tiffany have temporarily closed several outlets across the globe, including Tiffany's iconic flagship Fifth Avenue store in New York, to curb the spread of the virus.

Structured notes worth hundreds of millions of dollars are effectively trading in distressed territory, often with just weeks or months left until they mature, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Take a $7.3 million offering from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. The product tied to the VanEck Vectors Oil Services exchange-traded fund had a face value of $10 at issuance in 2015. It last traded at just 85 cents, meaning it’s on course to saddle holders with a 92% loss at its due date on May 14.
A spokesperson for JPMorgan declined to comment.
These types of unsecured debt instruments were issued by banks in droves in the bull market as investors starved for yield flocked to their double-digit coupons.
“Oil-linked structured notes were hit the hardest out of all the structured products” in recent market turmoil, said Tiago Fernandes, global head of sales at WallStreetDocs, a data and technology provider. He reckons these instruments have lost 50% of their value on average -- worse than the losses incurred by most structured products tied to the stock market.
In the first two months of this year, banks sold over $200 million of notes tied to ETFs like the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production product and the U.S. Oil Fund, as well as directly to crude oil futures.
The JPMorgan note tracked a VanEck fund that was trading at roughly $38 when it was issued. The latter closed Tuesday at just $4.50.
Vows to pump more crude are colliding with a historic slump in demand, as large chunks of the global economy grind to a halt due to the spreading coronavirus. A gauge of implied swings for oil soared to a record last month, as prices were whipsawed by President Donald Trump’s remarks that he could get involved in the standoff between Saudi Arabia and Russia.
Ticking Clock
Structured instruments often carry complex jargon like “trigger autocallable optimization securities” and “contingent coupon callable yield notes.”
A typical one is sold to retail investors via an independent financial adviser or large wealth management firm. If the price of the linked asset trades at or above its starting level, the notes are called and investors receive a hefty coupon. But if the underlying drops, the product can continue until maturity without paying another coupon.
If the price declines enough, it can breach a barrier where the investor starts participating one-for-one in losses all the way to zero.
Speculators in oil ETFs can relate to this type of pain.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) announced last week that buyers of a triple-leveraged oil note would receive $0 if they tried to redeem the securities after the energy crash. A slew of other crude products have shuttered, leaving investors nursing eye-watering losses.
As for the structured securities, there’s still time for prices to recover before some of these notes come due. OPEC+ ministers are gathering Thursday in a virtual meeting to hammer out a deal to end their price war and cut output.
But the clock is ticking. Fernandes at WallStreetDocs reckons Brent oil futures would have to rise to between $40 and $42 a barrel compared with just $32 currently in order for these instruments to recover.
“The concern here is that these products mostly have short-term maturities,” he said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open mostly higher Wednesday, with markets still searching for direction after Tuesday’s volatile session as investors struggle to gauge the spread of coronavirus across the country.
At 7:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 21 points, or 0.8%, higher, futures for the Nasdaq up 82 points, or 1.0%. The Dow futures contract rose 191 points, or 0.8%.
A wave of late selling hit stocks Tuesday as an early rally ran out of steam. The Dow fell 0.1%, or 26 points, but had been up about 937 points at the highs of the day. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite ended 0.3% lower.
The number of Covid-19 cases in the U.S. has reached 400,000, doubling over the last week, with over 12,000 deaths.
There are signs the measures, including social distancing, in hot spots like New York and New Jersey are helping to curb the outbreak, but fears exist that other states, like Florida and Louisiana, could see a wave of infections.
Helping the tone are comments from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, that the Trump administration is in talks with Congress to secure an additional $250 billion to fund loans for small businesses hit by the coronavirus pandemic.


In corporate news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) said it was cutting wages and putting staff on temporary leave until it decides to reopen its main faciity in Fremont.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) announced late Tuesday it would have to make two new software updates to its 737 MAX’s flight control computer as it works to win regulatory approval to resume flights.
Also of interest will be the release of the minutes of the two emergency meetings held by the Federal Open Market Committee last month, when the central bank slashed rates to 0% to 0.25%, announced a huge amount of quantitative easing, as well as expanding repo operations and credit for commercial banks.
The minutes are due for release at 2 PM ET (1800 GMT).

MILAN (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler (FCA) (MI:FCHA) and unions are discussing plans for beefed-up health measures at Italian plants to pave the way for most profitable production to restart as soon as the government eases a national lockdown, unions said on Wednesday.
An extension of a national lockdown due to expire on April 13 cannot be ruled out, but recent coronavirus data allowed growing confidence that the virus was on the retreat in Italy.
Measures proposed by FCA's unions include rearranging assembly layouts, staggering shifts, and marking floors to ensure a one-meter distance is kept between workers, FIM representative Raffaele Apetino said, adding this would inevitably result in reduced production rates.
Other requests include testing workers' temperatures, providing safety devices such as face masks, and sanitising premises during work hours, Apetino added.
Unions also proposed moving meals to the end of shifts, allowing employees to chose to avoid canteens, take away their food and leave half an hour earlier without losing pay.
""FCA has showed great willingness to accept our proposals,"" Apetino said, adding unions would hold a call with company representatives on Thursday to prepare an agreement.
""Our aim is to sign it by the end of this week,"" he said. ""We want be ready to restart most profitable production just after Easter, if the government allows it.""
UILM union representative Gianluca Ficco said similar requests were also made to  Ferrari  (MI:RACE),  CNH Industrial  (MI:CNHI) and car parts maker Marelli. ""The lockdown can't go on forever, Italy must give itself a target to match jobs and security,"" he said. 
FCA last month introduced a first package of extraordinary measures in its Italian plants, but eventually had to close them after Rome in mid-March decided to freeze all manufacturing activities deemed non essential. 
The automaker has told unions it aimed to restart operations at three Italian sites as soon as the government lifts its toughest coronavirus restrictions.
These would be the assembly lines for Jeep's Compass and new hybrid models at Melfi in southern Italy; Atessa's plant making light commercial vehicles in central Italy; and preparatory work for the new electric 500 in Turin's Mirafiori factory. 
That would initially involve less than 10,000 workers out of 55,000 in Italy.

FCA did not comment on measures being prepared but a spokesman said: ""As always workers' health and security were the top priority for the company"".

The Covid-19 outbreak seems to be slowing, and that’s “the only thing that matters for now,” head strategist Emmanuel Cau wrote in a note on Wednesday. Additionally, the unprecedented response from governments and central banks is reducing downside risks and could hasten the recovery, he said.
The Stoxx Europe 600 has bounced about 16% since March 18, but remains 25% below its Feb. 19 all-time high. With the epicenter of the pandemic now switching to the U.S., European stocks could well outperform their U.S. peers over the next year, according to Barclays. Cau sees the European benchmark advancing to 365 points by year-end, suggesting 13% upside.
“We continue to believe equities offer an attractive risk-reward on a six to 12 month horizon and will end the year higher,” Cau said. He retained a balanced allocation between cyclicals and defensives, with a quality bias, because further economic pain is still on the cards.
While expecting that the recession will be deeper than in 2008-2009, but also shorter, the strategist warned that the pandemic will have long-lasting effects on society, the economy and financial markets.

1280,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>",Coronavirus rout spurs China investors to dividend plays,"By Noah Sin
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Wild swings in global equities markets are prompting brokers and fund managers to urge patience with a strategy still alien to many of China's momentum-driven stock investors: switch into companies offering high and stable dividends.
As companies around the world conserve cash by cutting dividends to survive the coronavirus pandemic, Chinese firms with stronger finances and state-backing hold out the prospect of being better able to sustain shareholder payouts.
Brokers believe Chinese corporate dividends will be worth seeking out as bonds become less rewarding, China's economy begins to recover quickly from the virus hit and officials continue with corporate reform to increase company payouts.
""Because the epidemic is better controlled in our country, we are more confident in the fundamentals of companies here,"" said Wang Wulei, an analyst at China Merchants Securities, who last month recommended seeking companies with payouts.
Some 641 A-share companies have announced 774.5 billion yuan ($109.6 billion) of dividends, more than 20% of 2019 net profits, Wang's analysis shows. The annualised return on the CSI dividend index, which tracks 100 stocks, was 3.3%. 
By contrast, yields on 10-year Chinese government bonds (CN10YT=RR) fell to a fresh 17-year low of 2.503% on Tuesday, from 4.12% in January 2017.
Many of China's state-linked companies are leading the way on payouts. China Mobile (HK:0941) last month lifted its 2019 dividend by 24% and pledged a steady payout in 2020.
Despite pressures on margins, banks including Agricultural Bank of China (HK:1288) (SS:601288), Bank of China (HK:3988) (SS:601988), and oil producers Sinopec (HK:0386) (SS:600028) and PetroChina (HK:0857) (SS:601857) also pressed ahead with payout plans.
""Companies are announcing more attractive dividend policies,"" said Catherine Yeung, investment director at Fidelity International. ""But given the volatility, it might not be a key focus (for most investors) right now.""
Sheldon Zhang, Shanghai-based fund manager at Schroder Investment Management, said some long-term investors started switching from bonds in March, although the numbers were still relatively small.
Chinese blue-chip shares (CSI300) fell 11.5% in their biggest quarterly drop since the end of 2018, but fared better than many. The S&P 500 (SPX) dived 20%, for example, in its worst three months since the fourth quarter of 2008.
Nomura's analysis shows 48 of 100 top Chinese companies, excluding financial institutions, have net cash - where cash piles exceed their total debts - compared with just 18 of top firms in the United States.
While some Chinese companies may cut dividends in the short term due to the global slowdown, sector leaders could expand market share and payouts, said Lirong Xu, chief investment officer at Franklin Templeton Sealand Fund Management in Shanghai.
""These companies have good business strategies, cashflows, and even though their dividend yields are currently low, they have plans to raise them,"" he added.

IRON ROOSTERS RUFFLED
About 75% of companies pay dividends in China, and payout ratios climbed 6 percentage points between 2017 and 2019, according to reports by China Securities Index Company, a major index provider.
Regulators have for several years targeted so-called ""iron roosters"" - a term used for companies who do not pay dividends - as part of efforts to improve corporate governance by slowly weaning investors off their focus on quick capital appreciation instead of stable income.
Yield-seeking investors have also typically bought wealth management products or money market funds but these opportunities are narrowing as interest rates fall.
With interest rates likely to stay lower for longer, investors will seek better returns from other assets, such as high-yielding equities, said Lilian Leung, who manages JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management's China income fund. 
In that respect, Chinese investors may begin to behave more like their peers in developed markets.
""What happens globally, institutional investors using high dividend yield stocks as alternatives to long-term bonds, will also happen in China,"" said Matthews Asia's Sherwood Zhang, who runs the firm's China and Asia income strategies.

LONDON (Reuters) - EasyJet (L:EZJ) founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou continued his battle to force the British airline to cancel an order for 107 Airbus (PA:AIR) planes, making a new demand on Wednesday for a shareholder vote and threatening to sue its directors. 
Haji-Ioannou, still easyJet's biggest shareholder, says the new Airbus planes are useless given the impact of the coronavirus on air travel and says their 4.5 billion pound ($5.5 billion) bill threatens easyJet's survival.
He said he had renewed his call for two directors including the chief financial officer (CFO) to be removed via a shareholder vote, and voiced his opposition to a 600 million pound loan easyJet has taken out under a UK government scheme.
In a statement he also threatened legal action against directors if easyJet ends up paying Airbus but was not able to meet its other financial commitments. 
""If a penny of easyJet’s monies goes to Airbus whilst easyJet defaults on other future financial obligations (repayment of the UK government loan in March 2021), I will personally make sure that any scoundrels responsible will go to jail for breach of their fiduciary duties,"" Haji-Ioannou said. 
EasyJet said in response it believes holding a general shareholders' meeting would be an unhelpful distraction from its focus on managing its finances at a time when it has no revenue and all its planes are grounded. 
""We remain absolutely focused on removing expenditure from the business, engaging with all of our business partners and suppliers including Airbus, and on safeguarding jobs and short-term liquidity,"" an easyJet spokeswoman said by email. 
The airline said accessing the government's COVID Corporate Finance Facility was in the best interests of the company and CFO Andrew Findlay had the board's full support. 

Haji-Ioannou, whose family owns a third of easyJet's shares and who even before the coronavirus crisis was a critic of easyJet's strategy to buy more planes, has talked of a 4.5 billion pound payment to Airbus, but a source familiar with the matter said the amount due was significantly less.

Investing.com -- Anyone who’s been to a supermarket in the last few weeks has probably come away with the idea that the sector is doing better than most in the current Covid-19 crisis.
To which the U.K.’s biggest grocer,  Tesco  (LON:TSCO), replied: “Up to a point.”
Yes, there has been an uplift from panic-buying of staples – a 30% uplift in U.K. stores, the company said in a trading update on Wednesday.
But panic-buying only dislocates the time horizon of consumption, rather than increasing it. The average family will not use more toilet paper over the course of this year than it does in any other year (unless, of course, it is blessed with a seven-year old girl who sees the stockpile as an inexhaustible supply of crafting material).
More importantly, even the temporary boost to sales is more than offset by other factors, such as lower outlays on discretionary items and, particularly, extra costs arising from staffing disruptions. Tesco estimated additional costs of between 625 and 925 million pounds this year, having hired 45,000 extra staff so far to deal with the surge in business.
To make things worse, Tesco warned that its banking arm will probably lose money this year due to a rise in bad loans, as the income of millions of newly-unemployed customers dries up.
Tesco shares fell 3.7% by mid-morning in London on the news, dragging the rest of the U.K. supermarket sector down with them. J Sainsbury (OTC:JSAIY) shares and Morrison Supermarkets shares were both down 3.3%.
The moves helped to make the U.K. FTSE 100 underperform the broader Stoxx 600 index with a 1.6% decline, compared with a 1.2% drop for the regional benchmark. Other European markets also suffered as Eurozone finance ministers failed yet again to agree on how to fund the region’s crisis response, with Germany and others continuing to reject calls from France, Spain and Italy for common debt issuance.
Elsewhere in its update, Tesco also scrapped its guidance for the new fiscal year (as did Dutch brewer  Heineken  (AS:HEIN)).
However, it wasn’t all bad news. Being in the staples business gives the supermarkets an unusually reliable cash flow, and thus confidence about their liquidity. As such, Tesco not only stuck by plans to pay a full-year dividend, it actually paid out more than previously guided at 9.15 (yield of over 4.4% at current prices).
By contrast, U.K. insurers  Aviva  (LON:AV),  Hiscox  (LON:HSX) and RSA (LON:RSA) all caved in to regulatory pressure on Wednesday and said they would suspend dividend payments until the crisis passes."

WUHAN, China (Reuters) - Temperature checkpoints and posters telling workers to keep more than a metre apart at Japanese automaker Honda Motor Co's reopened plant in the Chinese city of Wuhan show how the coronavirus has created a new normal on the factory floor.
The plant, a Honda joint venture with Dongfeng Motor Group was shut in late January when authorities ordered a lockdown in Wuhan in a bid to snuff out the coronavirus, which emerged there late last year.
It reopened on March 11 to resume operations in stages and is now back to pre-virus production levels, Li Shiquan, assistant director of the joint venture's No. 2 final assembly plant, told reporters on Wednesday.
Returning workers were asked to report where they had been since the epidemic started and temperature checkpoints were set up, Li said.
About 98% of its 12,000 workers were now back and were putting in over-time to make up for lost production, he said. 
The joint venture produced 800,000 cars last year. 
""We have many customers who are waiting for cars so this week we have arranged for each worker to work 1.5 hours more,"" he said, adding that a typical shift was eight hours.
A sign hanging from the ceiling in the factory said the goal was 1,237 cars that day, 17% higher than the 1,060 it usually produced.
Plants at Honda's Guangzhou-based joint venture with GAC are also running extra shifts, GAC's chairman Zeng Qinghong told analysts on its earnings call last week. 
The central industrial hub of Wuhan started allowing people to leave the city on Wednesday in what is seen as a turning point for China's fight against the coronavirus.
RUBBER GLOVES, QR CODES
China's factories begun to reopen weeks ago as infection rates in their localities began to drop off.
Now other countries such as Italy and United States are trying to curb the spread of the virus by asking workplaces to shut and the public to stay home.
Honda has suspended operations in the United States and Canada, its biggest manufacturing hub, until May 1. It has also stopped output at plants in countries ranging from Britain to Thailand, and has announced intermittent stoppages at some of its Japanese plants.
The Wuhan plant reopened after the government approved its plan to curb infection risks, Li said. The plant's smoking and rest areas have been shut to stop people from gathering while meetings have to be held on video links.
Workers needing a rest from the assembly line are encouraged to sit on red stools spaced out on the factory floor, Li said.
Reuters reporters on a visit to the factory saw workers dressed in white overalls, rubber gloves and masks. Posters told them to keep a metre apart at all times, though that was not always adhered to.
Pasted on pillars were QR codes, which workers use their mobile phones to scan in order to fill in - once a day - forms asking about any coughing or contacts with unwell people.
Li said no coronavirus cases had been found since the plant resumed operations.

The plant's more than 500 suppliers in Wuhan had also been allowed to resume operations on March 11, Li said, adding that Dongfeng Honda had provided them with some help but he did not go into details.

An ECB spokesman declined to comment.
In a videoconference meeting, the EU Commission estimated that the bloc's economy could shrink by 10% this year, officials said. But ministers remained divided on how to boost the economy and failed to agree on a common text.
In the conference, which ended on Wednesday without a deal after 16 hours of talks, Germany, the Netherlands and other northern European countries were ready to support EU measures worth 500 billion euros, officials who participated in the meeting said.
The EU support would back up national measures, but the overall fiscal effort may not be enough to meet total financing needs, the officials said.
In the meeting France, Italy and Spain said the European effort to tackle the crisis should be well above 1 trillion euros this year, officials said, in line with the ECB estimate of financing needs of 1 to 1.5 trillion.
While the participants narrowed the gap in views during their lengthy talks, a deal could not be reached mostly due to resistance from the Netherlands and Italy, officials said.

Italy wanted a more ambitious agreement with clearer references to future common debt issuance, while the Netherlands pushed for conditions to any EU credit line to countries in need.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Wednesday, as the region’s finance ministers failed to agree on how best to finance the response to the coronavirus crisis, reviving old doubts about the long-term viability of the euro.
Markets had already opened weakly in the wake of the late drop in U.S. stocks on Tuesday, driven by unrelenting bad news regarding infection and death rates across the U.S.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index traded 0.9% lower, France's CAC 40 was down 1.2%, while the DAX fell 0.4%. The broader based Stoxx 600 Europe index dropped 0.6%.
Eurozone finance ministers have again failed to agree on an economic package to support the region’s economy after all night talks brought no breakthrough.
The chairman of the group, Mario Centeno, said on Wednesday he was suspending the discussions until Thursday, to bridge divisions over its elements.


Officials said the deadlock was caused by a feud between Italy and the Netherlands over conditions attached to credit for governments to fight the coronavirus epidemic.
The same impasse resulted in a similar meeting failing two weeks ago, but this time the economic damage is becoming clearer. The French central bank estimated Wednesday that the country’s economy contracted 6% in the first quarter. That would be the biggest contraction on a quarterly basis since World War II.
Italy remains the epicenter of the crisis in Europe, with the highest death toll - more than 17,000; next comes Spain, with over 14,000 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
In corporate news, shares in  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) fell 2.3% after Britain’s biggest retailer said it expected to take a hit of up to 925 million pounds ($1.1 billion) from coronavirus-related costs.
Shares in Givaudan (SIX:GIVN) fell just 0.4%, outperforming the wider market, after the Swiss perfume company said Wednesday that sales rose in the first quarter, recording solid growth across all its regions.
There's little in terms of European data due Wednesday, but of interest will be minutes of the meetings at which the Federal Reserve took decisive action to combat the coronavirus threat. The minutes are due for release at 14:00 ET (1800 GMT).
Oil prices have been volatile of late, and pushed higher during European hours after dropping sharply overnight as traders were kept in limbo on the possibility of production cuts.
Ahead of the meeting, the EIA will issue its weekly U.S. oil inventory numbers at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT), with analysts looking for a rise of about 9.3 million barrels for the week ended April 3.
At 2:55 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 4.6% higher at $24.62 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.4% to $32.33.

The benchmark index has gained about 20% since hitting an eight-year low on March 16, powered by aggressive global stimulus measures, but remains 25% below its all-time high with sentiment being driven by progress to contain the pandemic.

1289,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 02:27AM ET</span>","EU Fails to Rally Behind Recovery Plan, Clouding Way Forward","(Bloomberg) -- European Union finance ministers failed to agree on a strategy to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic, prolonging a paralysis that casts doubt over the bloc’s chances to weather the storm unscathed.
In an emergency teleconference that lasted more than 16 hours, finance chiefs couldn’t reconcile their contrasting visions for the steps needed to help European economies recover, as countries led by France and Europe’s hardest-hit south were pitted against Germany and other hawkish northern states over the need to issue joint debt.
A new call is now scheduled for Thursday.
Two officials familiar with the discussion said the main reason for the breakdown on Tuesday was a dispute between the Netherlands and Italy over the conditions attached to the potential use of credit lines from the euro area’s bailout fund to finance the spending spree needed to cushion the pandemic’s blow. Ministers also sparred over the wording of a joint statement hinting at the possible issuance of joint debt to finance the response.
The ministers had been tasked by EU leaders to come up with a toolkit of measures to address the economic impact of the pandemic by the end of this week. But even as the virus continued to engulf their economies and medical systems they were unable to move past traditional dividing lines, putting in question the next steps in the continent’s efforts to manage a looming recession.
With the euro area facing an economic slump of unprecedented scale, nations have instituted fiscal measures worth 3% of the EU gross domestic product as well as liquidity guarantees worth 18% of the bloc’s output. The European Central Bank has also launched massive bond purchases in what could end up becoming the biggest economic rescue package the continent has seen in peacetime. But few believe that’s sufficient.
And the stakes couldn’t be higher. Last week, IHS Markit said its monthly measure of services and manufacturing in the euro area points to an annualized economic contraction of about 10%. And that’s on top of job losses that are mounting across Europe, with Spain showing a record jobless-claims surge.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to largely open lower Wednesday, consolidating after posting gains this week, amid disagreements over how to finance the region's response to the coronavirus crisis.
At 2:15 AM ET (0615 GMT),  {{167|France's CAC 40 futures and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. both fell 2.0%, while the DAX futures contract in Germany outperformed, rising 0.1% higher.
""There is reason to be cautious as this looked to be a relief rally ahead of next week's start of Q1 earning season and before data reveals the depth of the virus impact,"" said analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), in a research note.
""Data shows the recent move higher has been accompanied by short covering and de-risking rather than active risk taking on the long side.""
A teleconference between Eurozone finance ministers, starting Tuesday, was set to continue through to Wednesday morning amid differences over how to tackle the economic fallout of the crisis. A press conference was tentatively scheduled for 4 AM ET (0800 GMT).
Some of the EU countries hardest hit by the virus - Italy, Spain and France, for example - want to share out the debt incurred in combating the coronavirus in the form of ""coronabonds"" - mutualized debt that all EU nations help pay off. But this has run into opposition from some of the wealthier countries, who feel they will be stuck paying off other countries’ debt.
Italy remains the epicenter of the crisis in Europe, with the highest death toll - more than 17,000; next comes Spain, with over 14,000 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
In corporate news, Givaudan (SIX:GIVN) will be of interest after the Swiss perfume company said Wednesday that sales rose in the first quarter, recording solid growth across all its regions.
Thales became the latest major European company to slash its dividend, suspend profit guidance and top up liquidity in response to the coronavirus crisis. The French aerospace and defence supplier said it had withdrawn the proposed final instalment of its 2019 dividend, saving 430 million euros ($465 million).  U.k. insurer  Aviva  (LON:AV) did likewise.
There's little in terms of European data due Wednesday, but of interest will be minutes of the meetings at which the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates back to zero, broadened access to dollars for foreign central banks, and restarted the massive asset purchases. The minutes are due for release at 14:00 ET (1800 GMT).
Oil prices have been volatile of late, and pushed higher during European hours after dropping sharply overnight as traders were kept in limbo on the possibility of production cuts.
Ahead of the meeting, the EIA will issue its weekly U.S. oil inventory numbers at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT), with analysts looking for a rise of about 9.3 million barrels for the week ended April 3.
In its measure of weekly crude stockpiles, the American Petroleum Institute Tuesday reported a rise of 11.9 million barrels.
At 2:15 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 4.6% higher at $24.70 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.6% to $32.39.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,683.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0846, down 0.4% on the day.

1291,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 01:35AM ET</span>",Pulp friction: Border jams delay supply of toilet paper's only ingredient,"By Richa Naidu and Siddharth Cavale
LONDON/BENGALURU (Reuters) - As several European borders limit travel to stop the spread of COVID-19, two of the world's biggest pulp makers say transportation logjams are delaying shipments of the raw material - the only ingredient in the toilet paper that people are hoarding to weather quarantines.
In March, countries including Norway, Germany and Spain shut their borders to non-essential travel. Freight can still pass through, but enforcing the new rules holds up deliveries to cargo trains and vessels bound for warehouses and factories in North America and China.
As a result, Finland's Metsä Fibre and Sweden's Södra Cell International told Reuters that truckloads of pulp going through Europe are getting caught in traffic jams for hours, or even a couple of days. 
Pulp-based products - like Kimberly-Clark's (N:KMB) Cottonelle toilet paper and P&G's (N:PG) Pampers diapers - are among the most sought-after goods worldwide as people stay home to slow the spread of COVID-19. While consumer companies currently have enough stock of most products to meet the unprecedented demand, they are urgently ramping up production so they have inventory on hand if quarantines extend. 
Even brief delays of pulp will stop machines from running - a waste of time and money that will drive up costs.
""Normally you don't need to worry about transportation; is it on time? Has it left? Is it in cargo? We have to have more communication to minimize the risk,"" said Ari Harmaala, head of sales at Metsä Fibre, the world's second largest softwood pulp producer and a vendor to Kimberly-Clark.

To meet deadlines, pulp suppliers are hunting for new drivers, putting more trucks on the road and redirecting shipments, industry data firm Pulp & Paper Industry Intelligence (PPI) said. That is prompting some pulp suppliers to shift to rail for deliveries, according to Steven Sachoff, editor for PPI Europe. Many truck drivers are also quitting because they don't want to risk getting sick far from their homes. Metsä and Södra said they have not missed deadlines so far.    
""Consumer products are so unique to each company that often, the specific ingredients needed can only be provided by a few suppliers,"" said Michael Reynen, a former P&G product developer in Europe. If a company can only use one type of raw material, it cannot be delayed, Reynen said.    
Made from wood chips or recycled paper, softwood pulp costs about $455 a tonne and is a key part of tampons, sanitary pads and diapers. To make toilet paper, softwood pulp is combined with hardwood pulp - made from trees like eucalyptus - which costs about $565 a tonne. As many as 1,000 rolls of toilet paper use the pulp of one eucalyptus tree.

'THE HOARDING EFFECT'    
Data firm PPI said this month that several suppliers across the industry had reported increased demand from tissue and toilet paper makers. PPI said the rise in calls is also a result of supplier inventories tightening, after many producers cut excess inventories before the pandemic to get over a year-long pulp supply glut.
""All of them are concerned about this and want to know what kind of war plan we have if there is a shortage or if there will be delays,"" Södra sales director Marcus Hellberg told Reuters. Södra, a supplier to P&G, Kimberly-Clark and (ST:ESSITYa), harvests pulp from more than two-and-a-half million hectares of pine and spruce trees to make just under 2 million tonnes of softwood pulp a year.    
""It's the hoarding effect that creates this tension in supply.""    
Klabin S.A., a top Brazilian pulp producer, told Reuters it has seen a jump in demand for softwood pulp from consumer companies worried about possible delays in deliveries of imported pulp from Argentina and the United States.    
P&G, which makes Charmin toilet paper, said it is trying to get U.S. tissue products to retailers ""as fast as humanly possible"" making and shipping them ""at record high levels."" The company - which uses European pulp in many personal hygiene products and North American and Latin American pulp to make tissue - recently restarted an idled toilet paper production line at a plant in Albany, Georgia.  
Rival Kimberly-Clark said it is also speeding up production and reallocating inventory to meet the high demand. P&G and Kimberly-Clark declined to comment about whether their pulp supply chains had been disrupted.    
Sweden's Essity, the world's second-largest consumer tissue maker and owner of the Tork brand, told Reuters it is seeing transportation delays, but that it currently has enough pulp to weather them.    
Just over 64 million tonnes of pulp were produced last year, 38% of which was used in products like toilet paper, kitchen towels and face tissues, according to the Pulp and Paper Products Council. Tampons, diapers and pads need about 5 million to 6 million tonnes. China is the biggest consumer of pulp, followed by North America and Western Europe. Globally, more than 1.34 million people have been infected and at least 76,000 have died due to the novel Coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China.

""Now is the moment to make toilet paper - we'll have to make sure that we can produce and deliver as much pulp as possible,"" Metsä Fibre's Harmaala said.

1292,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 01:25AM ET</span>",Trump administration seeks $250 billion more in aid for small U.S. businesses: Mnuchin,"By Richard Cowan and David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Tuesday asked Congress for an additional $250 billion in emergency economic aid for small U.S. businesses reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pushed for passage as soon as Thursday. 
In a posting on Twitter, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he had consulted with congressional leaders on the need for the second round of funding.
If approved by Congress, the aid would add to the $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses enacted on March 27 as part of a $2.3 trillion economic stimulus in response to the virus outbreak.
Shortly before Mnuchin's announcement, McConnell, a Republican, said in a statement: ""It is quickly becoming clear that Congress will need to provide more funding or this crucial program may run dry.""
He added that he would work with Mnuchin and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer on the initiative with the goal of winning Senate approval on Thursday.
It was not immediately clear whether the top two Democrats in Congress, Schumer and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, would embrace this timetable as they have been pushing for a broader set of measures that would comprise a fourth coronavirus-response bill since early March.
Quick Senate action would highlight the alarm over the crisis for small enterprises that have been shuttered because of the coronavirus outbreak.
McConnell's backing also marked a change in attitude. He warned in an April 1 interview with the Washington Post that Pelosi should not undertake a ""premature"" fourth stimulus bill related to the pandemic.
But just days into the launch of the small business loans, with coronavirus cases raging in many parts of the United States, pressure built for more aid.
""There is a critical need to supplement the (loan) fund to ensure America’s more than 30 million small businesses will be able to access this critical lifeline,"" Senate Small Business Committee Chairman Marco Rubio said in a statement.
Restaurants and hotels are among businesses hardest hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with many of them shuttered. 
The loan program aims to encourage small enterprises to keep their employees on staff and to help them pay rent, mortgages, utilities and other overhead costs.
Meanwhile, congressional Democrats were crafting a series of additional measures they plan to push in coming weeks.
Democratic senators on Tuesday called for up to $25,000 in temporary, federally paid bonuses to medical workers and others in essential services, such as pharmacists, grocery store workers and truckers whose jobs put them at greater risk of coronavirus infection. 
Their plan also contained $15,000 incentives to help recruit first responders and health and home-care workers. 
Pelosi on Monday consulted with rank-and-file members of her Democratic majority about House committees working on a bill that could top $1 trillion to augment the $2.3 trillion measure enacted last month.
A House Democratic aide on Tuesday said potential provisions include additional funding and greater flexibility for a ""stabilization"" fund helping state and local governments cope with the epidemic.
The aide said legislation also would increase funding for federal agencies, such as the Labor Department and Small Business Administration which now must deal with an explosive growth in unemployment and loan programs, respectively. 
In an interview on CNN, Pelosi said she wanted to ensure that a range of financial institutions, including community and minority-owned banks, could participate in the loan program and that the lending did not just go to businesses that had existing relationships with lenders. 
Some small restaurant operators have voiced concerns the loan program was structured so that large companies and large franchisees could gain advantage.

1294,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 11:50PM ET</span>","Australia's Treasury Wine, to cope with virus, weighs Penfolds demerger, U.S. cutback","By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's  Treasury Wine Estates Ltd  (AX:TWE) said it may spin off the prestigious Penfolds label and shrink its low-end ""commercial"" division in the United States as it seeks ways to grow profit amid upheaval brought by the coronavirus crisis.
The world's biggest stand-alone winemaker said it was weighing up the measures as restrictions on movement around the world to slow the spread of the illness upend its sales, although it said people were buying more cheap wine to drink at home.
A Penfolds spin-off would give investors a chance to own shares of one of the world's best-selling high-end drops without exposure to changes in the profitability of mid-range and lower-end products. Treasury also has the Wolf Blass, Lindeman's and 19 Crimes labels.
""A potential demerger would enhance (Treasury's) and Penfolds' ability to pursue their own strategic priorities and deliver a stronger long-term growth profile under separate teams and ownership structures,"" said Chief Executive Michael Clarke in a statement.
Penfolds generated about 10% of Treasury's sales volume but more than half its earnings, added the company which posted a net profit of A$211.4 million in the six months to Dec. 31. Whether and when to carve out the top-shelf label would depend on market conditions once the coronavirus outbreak was contained, it said.
Shares of Treasury defied a weaker market (AXJO) to be up as much as 6% in morning trading, as investors began to price in the earnings potential of an unencumbered Penfolds. Under the proposed demerger, Treasury shareholders get Penfolds shares, the company said.
""They have a lot of brands but most of them are pretty useless for valuation,"" said Mathan Somasundaram, market portfolio strategist at Blue Ocean Equities.
""They probably need a catalyst to keep the market interested and it's one they can keep talking about for the next year and a half.""
Even before the coronavirus pandemic effectively froze the social life of half the world's population, weighing on wine sales in restaurants and bars, Treasury reported that competitive pressure was dragging on its growth in the United States. 
Like many other Australian companies, Treasury has since withdrawn its earnings guidance, citing the unknown impact of shutdowns associated with the new coronavirus which has so far infected about 6,000 Australians and led to in 50 deaths.
Treasury's biggest market is China, where it said on Wednesday that ""while consumers are getting back to work, socialising and consumption levels remain at subdued levels"", affecting its sales.
Globally, it said shopping patterns reflected ""propensity for in-home consumption during government-imposed shutdown periods"", but that sales were skewed towards lower-margin products.

Regardless of whether the Penfolds spin-off went ahead, Treasury said it would cut the ""size and scale of its commercial wine business, particularly in the United States"", including dropping or selling brands to focus on more expensive, wider-margin labels.

After U.S. stock markets closed, President Donald Trump said the United States may be getting to the top of the coronavirus curve.
The Trump administration asked Congress for an additional $250 billion in emergency economic aid for small U.S. businesses reeling from the pandemic.
""While the virus' 'curve is flattening', the economic effects of the corona crisis will linger for years in our view,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia economist Joseph Capurso said in a note. 
""Economies will take time to re‑open, some businesses will not re‑open, and unemployment will take years to return to levels reported at the end of 2019.""

Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB), and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ) fell by 4.1% to as much as 6.2%, with Westpac falling the most.
The Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) asked banks and insurers to limit discretionary capital distribution so that they have sufficient capacity to continue essential functions such as lending and underwriting insurance.
The regulator said dividends will need to be at a ""materially reduced level"" even when a board is confident it can approve a dividend before conducting stress tests that will need to be discussed with APRA.
In response to the regulator's statement, Westpac said it is yet to make a decision regarding its interim dividend, while National Australia Bank said it will take APRA guidance into account when considering its dividend for the first half year.
Australian brokerage Morgans expects the top lenders will suspend the next dividend, saying commentary may describe the move as a deferral until the outlook is clearer. Analysts earlier forecast that the Big Four may cut dividend in coming weeks due to the pandemic.

Separately on Wednesday, the regulator suspended issuing new banking, insurance and superannuation licences for a least six months because of uncertainty created by the virus outbreak.

1299,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 08:18PM ET</span>",Australia Set to Pass Record $80 Billion Jobs-Rescue Plan,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s parliament is expected to pass a record A$130 billion ($80 billion) jobs-rescue plan on Wednesday, as the government continues efforts to buttress the economy from the coronavirus outbreak.
“It’s unprecedented in its scale and its scope, and around 6 million workers should be able to use this program to stay in a job,” Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in a television interview. The package “will help build that bridge to the recovery on the other side.”
The support will see the government pay wage subsidies of A$1,500 every two weeks per employee to help struggling businesses keep people in work. It’s the latest step in Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s plan to ensure the economy can survive in “hibernation” during the health crisis and then quickly be revived when businesses such as restaurants, clubs, casinos and cinemas are allowed to reopen.
Since the coronavirus threat emerged, the conservative government has abandoned plans to return and keep the budget in surplus, pumping an unprecedented amount of stimulus into the economy in a bid to avert it from falling into a crippling long-term recession.
Total fiscal and monetary stimulus has now exceeded A$320 billion, or 16.4% of gross domestic product.
The jobs-rescue plan is set to be passed on Wednesday in a special sitting of parliament with a reduced number of lawmakers. While opposition Labor party leader Anthony Albanese says he won’t stand the way of the government’s legislation, he called for more than 1 million casual workers who won’t receive the benefits to be included.
In other economic measures, Morrison last week announced it will make childcare free to help workers stay in their jobs. On Tuesday, he said a new industry code of practice for commercial tenancies would be legislated to provide rent relief for businesses hit by the outbreak. Any decline in revenue for small- or medium-sized enterprise will be reflected in a proportionate drop in rent they have to pay, he said.
Still, Morrison’s government can only do so much. Some economists are forecasting that Australia’s unemployment rate could soar to 12%, from 5.1% in February, as potentially hundreds of thousands of workers lose their jobs amid the shutdown. The nation’s central bank has cutting its rates to 0.25% and shifted to bond-buying operations.
Morrison has grown more confident that social-distancing restrictions and the nation’s relatively high rates of testing appear to be working to control the outbreak and “flatten the curve” of growth. As of 3 p.m. on Tuesday, Australia had 5,908 confirmed cases, up 2% from the day before.
Authorities are warning that they don’t want Australians to relax during the Easter break, which starts on Friday. In New South Wales, the most populous state that’s been hardest hit by the outbreak, police warned on Wednesday they will use the holiday period to patrol country roads, back streets, main highways and caravan parks to ensure people are complying with the restrictions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said late on Tuesday it will make two new software updates to the 737 MAX's flight control computer as it works to win regulatory approval to resume flights after the jet was grounded following two fatal crashes in five months.
The planemaker confirmed to Reuters that one issue involves hypothetical faults in the flight control computer microprocessor, which could potentially lead to a loss of control known as a runaway stabilizer, while the other issue could potentially lead to disengagement of the autopilot feature during final approach. Boeing said the software updates will address both issues.
The Federal Aviation Administration said on Tuesday it is in contact with Boeing as it ""continues its work on the automated flight control system on the 737 MAX. The manufacturer must demonstrate compliance with all certification standards.""
The largest U.S. planemaker has been dealing with a number of software issues involving the plane that has been grounded since March 2019. Boeing halted production in January. 
Boeing said it does not expect the issues to impact its current forecast of a mid-year return to service for the plane. Boeing said the new software issues are not tied to a key anti-software system known as MCAS faulted in both fatal crashes.
Boeing is adding new safeguards to MCAS in a software update.
Boeing said neither new software issue has been observed in flight. Boeing said in the autopilot issue ""flight deck alerts and warnings are already in place to alert the crew if it did.""
Boeing did not say when it expects the updates to be completed. 
Reuters reported in February a key certification test flight was not expected until April at the earliest and officials say it might not happen until late May or later.
Last month, Boeing decided to separate 737 MAX wiring bundles that the FAA had flagged by regulators as potentially dangerous before the jet returns to service, Reuters reported. 
Boeing said in February it would need a new software update to address an indicator light issue. 

In January, Boeing discovered another software issue relating to a power-up monitoring function that verifies some system monitors are operating correctly.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. casino operator  Wynn Resorts Ltd  (O:WYNN) and automated teller machines maker NCR Corp (N:NCR) jointly raised $1 billion on Tuesday, in the first unsecured junk-rated bond offerings since the market was roiled by the coronavirus outbreak at the start of March. 
The offerings indicate investor appetite for risk is gradually returning in the market for new corporate debt rated below investment grade. 
The so-called high-yield market has been supported by the Federal Reserve's pledge to backstop the investment-grade market, according to Bill Zox, chief investment officer of fixed income at Diamond Hill Capital Management.
""It opens up the new issue market on the investment-grade side, which then gives high-yield investors some confidence that the market can absorb new issuance,"" said Zox.
Wynn, which issued a warning on Feb. 28 about the potential impact of the coronavirus on earnings, sold $600 million in new debt maturing in 2025, upsized from the $350 million the company originally planned to raise. 
The company is paying interest of 7.75%, compared with 5.125% in a $750 million deal for bonds maturing in 2029, which was done in September. 
NCR sold $400 million in new debt maturing in 2025 at a yield of 8.125%, a higher borrowing cost than the 6.125% yield on the $500 million in 2029 bonds it agreed to in August. 
Yum Brands Inc (N:YUM) and Carnival Corp (N:CCL) last week reopened the market for riskier debt after its longest lull since the 2008 financial crisis, but those deals were both secured against the companies' assets. In an unsecured deal, the borrowing is done against a company's perceived creditworthiness.
Nevertheless, the high-yield market is still seen as off limits for smaller companies or borrowers with lower credit ratings. 
""You're going to see larger well-known issuers accessing the market. I still don’t expect very low-quality or much smaller issuers to access the new issue market,"" Zox said.
Shares in Wynn and NCR closed up 7.3% and down 4.3% respectively.

The company also reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the first quarter ended Feb. 23, even as sales in Asia declined due to store closures, sending Levi's shares up about 3%.
Like many U.S. retailers, Levi's has been hit by the coronavirus crisis as lockdowns in China and the United States to curb the spread of the infection forced store closures. Levi's has stood through the world wars and the 1918 flu pandemic in its 167-year history.
Nearly all stores in mainland China, including the store in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, were now open, Levi Strauss said. 
Traffic and sales in the region remained down, but weekly sales performance was sequentially improving, the company said, adding that sales from its websites and other online platforms grew in March powered by demand for women's wear. 
The retailer has been investing more in its e-commerce business, adding features designed to attract young shoppers, to cope with decline in foot traffic to malls and department stores due to a shift in shopping preferences.
""We're trying to find ways to connect more strongly with consumers during the period of time that they're cooped up... We're going to continue to leverage digital,"" Chief Executive Officer Chip Bergh said on a post-earnings call.
The company said the impact of the outbreak would be ""materially significant"" for the second quarter, as stores remain closed in the United States, where over 10,000 deaths have been reported.
Levi said it would furlough all its retail store staff in the country, a step taken by many retailers as they extend store closures. The company had about 7,300 U.S. employees as of Nov. 24, according to its annual filing.
It also said it had borrowed $300 million on a credit facility to boost its balance sheet. 
For the first quarter ended Feb. 23, Levi said sales rose 5% to $1.51 billion, powered by its direct-to-consumer business. Analysts were expecting $1.47 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 40 cents, beating Wall Street estimates by 5 cents.

1303,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 07:50PM ET</span>",WeWork sues SoftBank for dropping $3 billion tender offer,"By Anirban Sen, Jessica DiNapoli and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - A WeWork board committee that negotiated a $3 billion tender offer with SoftBank Group sued the Japanese conglomerate on Tuesday for abandoning the deal, accusing it of succumbing to ""buyer's remorse"" amid the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The tender offer was part of a $9.6 billion rescue financing package that SoftBank agreed with WeWork in October that gave it control of the company. Since then, the office space-sharing start-up's occupancy rates have plummeted, as customers in big cities stay at home to prevent the spread of the virus.
SoftBank said last week it would not press ahead with the tender offer because several pre-conditions had not been met, frustrating WeWork's minority shareholders, who were expecting a payout. They included co-founder and former Chief Executive Adam Neumann, venture capital firm Benchmark Capital and employees with equity in the company. 
While SoftBank cited the business impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as one of the reasons it would not complete the tender offer, it also pointed to U.S. criminal and civil investigations into WeWork and the failure to restructure a joint venture in China as grounds for abandoning it.
An independent two-member special committee of WeWork filed the lawsuit, calling SoftBank's decision to terminate the tender offer wrongful. The committee comprises Bruce Dunlevie, who is a general partner at WeWork shareholder Benchmark Capital, and Lew Frankfort, who is the former CEO of luxury handbag maker Coach.
""SoftBank's failure to consummate the tender offer is a clear breach of its contractual obligations ... as well as a breach of SoftBank's fiduciary obligations to WeWork's minority stockholders, including hundreds of current and former employees,"" the special committee said.
WeWork argued the investigations were not material to the company's business, and that SoftBank had pursued an alternative deal for the China business with minority investor Trustbridge Partners, voiding its right to walk away from the deal.
Trustbridge did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""Nothing in the special committee's filing today credibly refutes SoftBank's decision to terminate the tender offer. SoftBank will vigorously defend this suit. The special Committee will not prevail in this mistaken attempt to force SoftBank to purchase their shares when it is not legally obligated to do so,"" SoftBank said in a statement. 
WeWork is asking a Delaware judge for so-called ""specific performance,"" or performance of a contractual duty, so that SoftBank is forced to complete the tender offer, or for damages in an amount to be determined at trial.
Gabriel Rauterberg, a University of Michigan law professor, said that courts in Delaware, where WeWork is suing SoftBank, are generally receptive to arguments about specific performance. 
CASH CRUNCH
Even without the tender offer, SoftBank and its $100 billion Vision Fund currently own 52.3% of WeWork. While most of the financing agreed in October has been provided to WeWork, some $1.1 billion of senior secured debt was contingent on the tender offer being completed.
WeWork was facing a cash crunch before its deal with SoftBank in October, and was forced to scrap plans for an initial public offering, as investors soured on its loss-making rapid expansion.
WeWork told bond investors last month that it had $4.4 billion in cash and cash commitments as of the end of December, and would be able to weather the economic downturn. SoftBank has installed Sandeep Mathrani, former chief executive of Brookfield Properties' retail group, as WeWork's new CEO.
Neumann, who attracted criticism for his management of the company before being ousted in September, had negotiated the right to sell $970 million of his shares as part of the tender program. Some $450 million of the tender offer was allotted to current and former employees.
SoftBank has so far invested more than $13.5 billion in WeWork. In two previous tender offers in 2017 and 2019, WeWork shareholders and employees had received a total of $2.3 billion from SoftBank. 

But the conglomerate has been under growing financial strain, with souring tech bets bringing it under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management and pushing it into a radical pledge to raise $41 billion by selling down core assets to raise cash for share buybacks and to reduce debt.

1304,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 06:15PM ET</span>","Cell towers, warehouses look like safe plays in U.S. real estate","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some top-performing U.S. fund managers see opportunities in one of the sectors hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic, cautiously increasing stakes in niches of the real estate market like cell phone towers and warehouses, which they see benefiting from an eventual economic recovery. 
While real estate is typically considered a defensive sector, real estate investment trust (REIT) values have been slammed by the lockdown of the U.S. economy to slow the spread of COVID-19. Many retailers and restaurants are unable to serve customers in person, leaving them unable to pay rent. 
Overall, the Dow Jones Select REIT Index is down nearly approximately 28% for the year to date, almost double the 17% decline in the broad S&P 500 index. 
""You're seeing that the market is pricing in something approaching the Great Recession,"" said Burl East, whose Altegris/AACA Opportunistic Real Estate fund is the top-performing real estate fund this year and over the last three and five years, according to Morningstar data. 
While retail, restaurant and hotel REITS are unlikely anytime soon to regain their values prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the slowing rate of infections in New York and other hot spots, along with the benefits of the stimulus package passed by Congress, should limit further broad declines for the industry, he said. 
As a result, he is increasing his exposure to select cell phone towers, industrial warehouses and cold storage REITs that have outperformed during the recent market declines. But he said he continues to avoid hotels and malls that will likely continue to face economic pain. 
""We're leaning into this and buying here but we don't want to go out and buy the junky stocks that have fallen the furthest,"" he said. 
A broad rally in the U.S. stock market early on Tuesday helped push mall-owner Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) up more than 12% on Tuesday, while residential mortgage REITs such as Invesco Mortgage Capital and MFA Financial gained more than 37% and 11% respectively. Even so, all three companies are down more than 80% for the year to date. 
Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations, is bullish on single-family homes and apartment buildings because the slowdown will likely reduce the typical churn of tenants. At the same time, he is moving more of his portfolio away from regions like Houston, which is likely to see a severe economic hit from both the measures to slow the pandemic and the steep decline in oil and gas prices, he said. 
""There are some dangerous REITS and there are some resilient REITS and we're not taking a chance on the dangerous ones,"" Underhill said. 
Overall, 80 to 95 percent of apartment landlords are receiving their full April rent, according to Scott Crowe, chief investment officer at CenterSquare, an asset manager that invests in both public and private real estate. Between 20 and 50 percent of retailers, meanwhile, are paying their full April rent, with mall-based retailers the least likely to be able to pay in full, he said. 
Crowe is skeptical that REIT values will recover any time soon and remains focused on segments such as cell phone towers and industrial warehouses. 
""You're seeing some stocks get a nice technical bounce right now, but we aren't playing the stock market,"" he said. 
Consumers are likely to remain skeptical of spending time in enclosed spaces even after the economy reopens, which will put a cloud over hotels, restaurants and movie theaters and keep a lid on job growth for the next several years, Crowe said. Overall, CenterSquare estimates about 25% of all square footage devoted to retail or hospitality will not reopen following the coronavirus-mandated closures. 
""People are guessing about a recovery but I think we will have a very tough recession and it's not like we're going back right away to how the world looked in February,"" when the S&P 500 hit record highs, he said.

1305,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 06:12PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for April 8,"By Kim Khan
Investing.com - Wall Street’s enthusiasm ran out of steam late today. It looked like another day of strong gains early on, but a sharp late reversal, prompted in part by plunging oil prices, left the major indices in the red.
Investors are also weighing enthusiasm about signs measures to contain the Covid-19 pandemic are working with the fact that the economic damage that will be done is still unknown.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) predicted today that the U.S. had passed its peak in new cases three or four days ago and that it expects a limited reopening of the economy in one to two weeks, CNBC reported.
But JPMorgan analysts also said in a note yesterday that we’re experiencing “the first consumer and labor market downcycle in 11 years” and that investors “should keep fading the relief bounces, looking for new lows, and keep a defensive sector allocation.”
More data on coronavirus infections will come tomorrow, as will a different kind of Fed Minutes.
And oil inventories arrive as usual as traders await more hints on production cuts from OPEC+.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Fed Minutes on Emergency Meetings Arrive
The Federal Reserve minutes arrive tomorrow at 2:00 PM ET (18:00 GMT) and they’re not your usual minutes.
The minutes will cover two emergency meetings held by the Federal Open Market Committee last month (on March 3 and March 15) when it slashed rates to 0% to 0.25% as the impact the pandemic became clearer.
The Fed also announced a huge amount of quantitative easing, expanded repo operations and credit for commercial banks.
Usually the minutes give hints to the market on whether the FOMC is leaning hawkish of dovish, but it’ safe to say tomorrow’s release will illustrate an all-hands-on-deck approach and likely a willingness to do more if possible.
“Central banks have rolled out their global financial crisis playbooks in a matter of days – with the U.S. Federal Reserve buying assets of ($1.5 trillion) since announcing a return to quantitative easing,” UBS said in a note Tuesday.
“(P)olicymakers continue to act with unprecedented speed and scale, and we think that ultimately their efforts will help prevent a Global Financial Crisis-style credit crunch,” UBS said.
2. Oil Inventories on Tap as Cuts Still Uncertain
Oil prices took a tumble for the second-straight session as traders were kept in limbo on the possibility of production cuts
Even if OPEC+ can agree to cut production when it meets on Thursday, the drop in demand for oil across the globe means those cuts may not be enough to stabilize the market.
Ahead of the meeting, the weekly U.S. oil inventory numbers arrive tomorrow, with another big build expected.
The EIA will issue its report at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT). Analysts are looking for a rise of about 9.3 million barrels for the week ended April 3.
In its measure of weekly crude stockpiles today, the American Petroleum Institute reported a rise of 11.9 million barrels.
3. Is the New York Curve Flattening?
Even though stocks ended lower, there was some more encouraging news about the spread of infections in the U.S.
New York state, the epicenter of the pandemic, said that the number of new cases admitted to intensive care units dropped significantly, a welcome sign for a state that is quickly running out of hospital beds.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo will be giving another update tomorrow. His updates usually start around 11:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT).
His schedule will be updated here.

1306,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 06:10PM ET</span>",House panel asks Trump's acting spy chief to explain spate of firings,"By Jonathan Landay
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House Intelligence Committee chairman on Tuesday called on U.S. President Donald Trump's acting spy chief to explain the removals and resignations of top intelligence officials and whether he ever tried to block probes by the intelligence community's recently fired internal watchdog.
Democrat Adam Schiff also wrote in a letter that the panel will examine whether any of acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell’s staff interfered “with the production and dissemination"" of intelligence for a March 10 congressional briefing on election interference.
The letter to Grenell, a fierce Trump loyalist who also serves as U.S. ambassador to Germany, set the stage for a fresh confrontation with a president still fuming over his December impeachment by the Democratic-led House of Representatives on charges of abuse of office and obstruction of Congress. Schiff was the lead manager in that effort. 
The Republican-majority Senate in January acquitted Trump of the charges stemming from his attempt to pressure Ukraine to probe former Vice President Joe Biden, the leading Democratic challenger to Trump’s re-election in November, and his son, Hunter.
Grenell said on Twitter that Schiff's letter went to the media before he received it, adding ""These press leaks politicizing the intelligence community must stop.""
Trump in January named Grenell, who has no intelligence experience, acting director of national intelligence, the overseer of all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies.
Grenell ordered a hiring freeze and a review that officials said is aimed at improving resource and personnel uses. But some lawmakers and former intelligence officials expressed concerns that Grenell was targeting officers whose analyses differed with the views of Trump, who has clashed with U.S. intelligence agencies.
The intelligence committee, Schiff wrote, is concerned that Grenell is pursuing changes without seeking congressional authorization.
""This effort appears to be proceeding despite the Coronavirus pandemic and amid indications... of political interference in the production and dissemination of intelligence,"" he wrote.
The committee also is concerned, he said, by the removals or departures of all Senate-confirmed ODNI officials.
Schiff asked Grenell to explain those actions in writing by April 16.
He set the same deadline for Grenell to disclose whether he blocked any investigations by Michael Atkinson, whose firing by Trump last week as the inspector general for the intelligence community the committee is reviewing.

Trump said Atkinson did “a terrible job” by sending to Congress the whistleblower complaint that led to his impeachment, calling it ""fake.”

1307,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 05:55PM ET</span>",Wall Street volatility raises fears of another selloff,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - The evaporation of a rally on Wall Street in the closing minutes of Tuesday's session shows that many investors fear the U.S. stock market is in danger of a renewed tumble due to uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic.
Fueled by early signs of the outbreak plateauing in some U.S. hot spots, including New York State, the S&P 500 traded up as much as 3.5% during the session, only to lose ground sharply late in the day to finish down 0.16%. The index, however, remains up 19% from its March 23 low.
Much of Wall Street's recent recovery has been thanks to a $2 trillion package aimed at stimulating the economy as much of the country hibernates to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Still, many investors remained skeptical that Wall Street's recent rise represents the start of a sustained recovery. 
The S&P 500 is still down more than 20% from its Feb. 19 record high. However, most of the index's constituents are worse off. The median change in the S&P 500 since Feb. 19 is a decline of 26%. The index's largest components have mostly outperformed, including Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Amazon (O:AMZN).
Graphic: Largest companies outperform S&P 500 https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkplbnzpbx/most%20valuable%20cos%20losses.jpg 
Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis, is among many investors skeptical about the sturdiness of the recent rally. 
""You're still vulnerable. Let's say the virus news turns worse. The market's not going to like it. Or the government can't get fiscal stimulus into the hands of businesses quick enough, that's going to be a problem,"" Wren warned.
With Saudi Arabia and Russia disagreeing about output cuts in the face of a swelling oil glut, the energy sector remains down 40% from Feb. 19.

Consumer staples has been the S&P 500's best-performing sector, down about 10% since Feb. 19, steadied by a 10% gain in bleach maker Clorox (N:CLX).
Wall Street's 10 most valuable companies have lost a combined %1 trillion in market capitalization since Feb. 19, although one of them, Walmart (N:WMT), has actually increased its value by $12 billion as consumers staying home from work and school stock up on food and household goods.

Shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (O:REGN) and Gilead Sciences (O:GILD), both working on coronavirus treatment drugs, have been among the S&P 500's top performers since Feb. 19, up 25% and 11%, respectively. Citrix Systems (O:CTXS), which sells software helping organizations work online, has surged 19% in that time.

LPL Financial said in a research note that Wall Street remained vulnerable as investors await solid indications that the outbreak is not becoming worse. 

""We continue to watch for signs of a peak in new cases in the United States, which would allow investors to start thinking about a resumption of economic activity and a potentially powerful economic rebound in the second half of this year. In the meantime, stocks may revisit the March lows,"" LPL Financial wrote.

1308,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 05:45PM ET</span>",The Stock Market Has Become One Big Value Trap,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Watching equities rally strongly for a second consecutive day, pushing the S&P 500 Index at one point to its highest level since March 11, it was hard not to be reminded of one of the most famous lines in movie history, or at least among fans of the Star Wars franchise. In 1983’s “Return of the Jedi,” the rebel alliance mobilizes its forces to destroy the Death Star during the Battle of Endor. But the rebels get ambushed, prompting Admiral Gial Ackbar to shout “It’s a trap!” And, just like that, equities gave up all their gains on Tuesday to post a slight decline.
At its highest point on Tuesday, the S&P 500 was up 23% to 2,757 compared with last month’s closing low of 2,237 on March 23. The two main reasons given to explain the rebound are optimism that officials may be getting ahead of the curve in the battle to contain the coronavirus pandemic and what looks to be deeply discounted valuations on stocks following the fastest drop into a bear market in history. It remains to be seen whether Covid-19 is coming under control. When it comes to valuations, though, the optimists may well have fallen into a trap. A value trap is a well-known phenomenon in markets. It happens when a security or asset appears inexpensive relative to any number of metrics. The trap springs when the price of the security or asset continues to languish or drop even further. Indeed, stocks did look cheap, with the S&P 500 going from trading at close to 20 times this year’s estimated earnings down to 14 on March 13, which was the lowest since early 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But that was before analysts starting cutting their 2020 profit estimates, dropping them to $152 a share from $175 at the end of January. As a result, stocks no longer look so cheap, with the S&P 500’s price-to-forecasted earnings multiple jumping up to a not-very-inexpensive 18 times. The problem is that many analysts have held off slashing their profit estimates, deciding to wait until they hear from company executives when the first-quarter earnings reporting season begins in a few weeks. In other words, get ready for earnings estimates to fall even further, which should weigh on sentiment and valuations.
Bloomberg News reports that Keith Parker, UBS AG’s head of equity strategy, calculates that many firms hadn’t updated their forecasts on individual company earnings for weeks. That means the existing data covering the next 12 months are probably underestimating the scope of the decline in S&P 500 profits by a factor of 2. The 2008 bear market had a number of false starts, with the S&P 500 rallying about 18% between late October and early November, and 24% between late November and early January, before tumbling again by about 25% before finally bottoming at a 13-year low in March 2009.
DEBT RULES THE WORLDGovernments globally are stepping up their debt issuance to raise cash to support their economies during the coronavirus pandemic. There’s no shortage of market participants who expect all this money flowing into the system will set the stage for a sharp rebound in global growth once the crisis passes. Perhaps they should review a famous paper written a decade ago by economists Carmen Reinhart, Vincent Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff that argued economies with high debt potentially face “massive” losses of output lasting more than a decade, even if interest rates remain low. What’s concerning is that debt issuance showed no sign of slowing before the pandemic. The Institute of International Finance issued a report Tuesday saying that the mountain of global debt across all sectors rose by more than $10 trillion in 2019 to exceed $255 trillion. That tops 322% of global gross domestic product, rising from 282% at the onset of the 2008 financial crisis. The IFF estimates that if global economic activity contracts 3%, debt would exceed 342% of GDP this year based on net government borrowing for 2019. The question is whether all this government borrowing will begin to crowd out private borrowers, sending interest rates soaring for all but the safest debt. That would be another reason to not expect a sharp economic rebound.
AN EMERGING-MARKET TRAGEDYEmerging markets have accounted for a greater percentage of the global economy over the last decade, and that’s before considering the tremendous growth in China. What’s concerning for investors is that their health-care systems continue to lag behind those in developed markets, raising questions about their ability to handle the coronavirus pandemic. Among the top 25 health systems in the world as measured by the Johns Hopkins Global Health Security Index, only four are in emerging-market economies: Thailand at six, Malaysia at 18, Brazil at 22 and Argentina at 24. “As bad as the coronavirus crisis is likely to be in the world’s wealthiest nations, the public health and economic blow to less affluent ones, often referred to as ‘developing countries,’ could be drastically worse,” the analysts at Eurasia Group wrote in a note to clients. “They have less testing capability, fewer hospital beds, and lower stocks of ventilators and other specialized equipment. There are also far fewer doctors per capita.” Eurasia adds that while governments and central banks in the rich world can unleash stimulus packages that run into the trillions of dollars, developing countries have much less financial firepower, and their borrowing costs are also higher. Investors have already pulled $90 billion out of emerging markets since mid-January, helping to push the MSCI Emerging Markets FX Index down 5.67% for the year, raising problems such as faster inflation that can accompany a weakening currency.
THE WRONG KIND OF INFLATIONThe market for raw materials hasn’t been spared from the coronavirus pandemic, with the Bloomberg Commodity Index falling about 22% in 2020, dropping to its lowest level since the 1970s. But the commodities market is wide, and not all sectors move in lockstep. Prices are rising for rice and wheat, which account for about a third of the world’s calories, according to Bloomberg News. The increased costs are a double whammy for a global population that faces a worldwide recession, with many either already out of work or soon to be. In Nigeria, for example, the cost of rice in retail markets soared more than 30% in the last four days of March alone. According to Bloomberg News, it’s unclear whether the price increases are the result of a trickle-down effect from grain futures or local logistical choke points or panic buying, or some combination of those factors. Elsewhere, export prices for rice from Thailand, the world’s second-biggest shipper, are at a six-year high. Wheat futures in Chicago, the global benchmark, shot up more than 8% in March, while Canadian durum, the type of grain used in pasta and couscous, is at the highest since August 2017. Bloomberg News points out that staple-crop prices have a long history of fueling political instability. During the spikes of 2011 and 2008, there were food riots in more than 30 nations across Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
TEA LEAVESWhat were they thinking? Market participants will find out Wednesday when the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s emergency meeting on March 15 will be released. To refresh, that’s when the central bank slashed its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point to near zero and promised to boost its bond holdings by at least $700 billion, the first of several moves announced by the Fed in the weeks that followed to support the financial system during the coronavirus pandemic. Although the minutes will be dated, Bloomberg Economics notes that they will “provide some context of policy makers’ thinking at the onset of the crisis.” More specifically, the minutes may shed some light on whether Fed officials anticipated the depth and breadth of the shock from shutting the economy down or whether they were taken by surprise like the government.

Investing.com – A wave of late selling hit stocks Tuesday as the energy-infused rally ran out of steam. Oil prices fell sharply as fears about a glut in crude supply continue to mount.
The Dow fell 0.12%, or 26 points, but had been up about 937 points at the highs of the day. The S&P 500 fell 0.16% and the Nasdaq Composite ended 0.33% lower.
Energy stocks, which had led the early-day really, came under pressure as oil prices dropped 9% amid rising worries a coordinated production cut from global oil producers will do little to stop an expected glut in supply.
Some on Wall Street ahve estimated the coronavirus pandemic has cut demand by as many as 20 million barrels per day.
Gains in the market were also stifled by a 4.8% decline in Boeing (NYSE:BA) amid reports that regulators have delayed the 737 Max test flight until May.
The 737 Max has been grounded since March last year following two fatal crashes.
The wild ride on Wall Street comes as many weigh signs that measures, including social distancing, in hot spots like New York and New Jersey are helping to curb the outbreak against fears that other states could see a wave of infections.
Underscoring a fall in the rate of hospitalizations, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state was still indicating that the spread of the virus was plateauing, even as the state reported its biggest increase in deaths of 731 overnight.
Cuomo said, however, that death was a lagging indicator in the fight against the virus. He also pointed to a significant drop in patients admitted to intensive care units.
Infection in the U.S. increased 24,470 to 391,474 since Monday, with as many as 12,500 deaths recorded.
Sentiment on Wall Street was supported earlier by hopes Congress is readying another large stimulus package to curb the economic fallout from Covid-19 crisis.
Financials, mostly banks, ended the day higher, underpinned by a jump in Treasury yields.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) closed about 2% higher, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) gained 5% and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) rose 4%."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street rose on Tuesday on tentative early signs that coronavirus outbreaks in some of the biggest U.S. hot spots may be plateauing, with New York's governor saying social distancing measures to curb the spread of the virus were working.
The S&P 500 was poised for its biggest two-day gain in nearly two weeks, adding to a 7% jump on Monday, after health officials said the pandemic may kill fewer Americans than indicated in recent projections. Governor Andrew Cuomo said New York, the epicenter of the virus in the United States, was nearing a plateau in the number of patients hospitalized.
Energy, materials and financials were the best performing sectors, with an aggressive round of U.S. fiscal and monetary stimulus in the past month helping to boost risk appetite.
Still, major averages had come off earlier highs as investors braced for worsening economic data and corporate earnings while a decline in oil prices steepened. 
""Everybody is trying to figure out the same question - is the market ahead of the data and the science,"" said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at GLOBALT in Atlanta.

The S&P 500 is up about 23% from its March 23 intraday low, but remains about 20% below its mid-February record high as methods designed to contain the virus quashed demand across a swath of industries such as airlines, automakers and hotels.

1318,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 02:30PM ET</span>","Goldman Sachs must face class action over conflicts of interest, risky mortgages","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) must face a shareholder class action accusing the bank of hiding conflicts of interest, including behind-the-scenes dealings with a prominent hedge fund manager, when creating risky subprime securities before the 2008 financial crisis.
In a 2-1 decision on Tuesday, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said Goldman failed to overcome a legal presumption that shareholders relied on its pledges to guard against conflicts, when deciding to buy the bank's stock.
These included alleged misstatements that client interests ""always come first"" and ""integrity and honesty are at the heart of our business.""
The court also rejected Goldman's argument that allowing class actions based on ""general"" misstatements would turn securities fraud claims into ""a form of investor insurance,"" exposing companies to a flood of baseless litigation.
""We are not blind to the widespread understanding that class certification can pressure defendants into settling large claims, meritorious or not, because of the financial risk of going to trial,"" Circuit Judge Richard Wesley wrote. ""But our law already beats back this parade of horribles.""
Goldman spokeswoman Maeve DuVally said the bank intends to ask the entire appeals court to review the decision.
The lawsuit led by three pension plans said Goldman fraudulently overstated its ability to manage conflicts, causing more than $13 billion of losses for shareholders from February 2007 to June 2010.
Thomas Dubbs, a lawyer for the shareholders, said they were pleased with the decision and look forward to proceeding to trial.
The case arose from several collateralized debt obligations including Abacus 2007 AC-1, the centerpiece of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe that led to a $550 million Goldman civil settlement in 2010.
Goldman admitted it was a ""mistake"" not to reveal it had allowed hedge fund manager John Paulson to choose some mortgages to include in Abacus, and that he bet against the CDO through short sales.
Paulson made a roughly $1 billion profit at the expense of CDO investors.
Wesley rejected Goldman's claim that only in ""special circumstances"" could a court find that if revelations of bad news caused a company's stock to fall, it could infer that the price had previously been inflated by the same amount.
Circuit Judge Richard Sullivan dissented. He said the class should be decertified because Goldman had offered ""persuasive and uncontradicted"" evidence that earlier disclosures of its alleged conflicts did not affect its stock price.
The case was returned to U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty in Manhattan, who certified the class action in August 2018.

The case is Arkansas Teacher Retirement System et al v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 18-3667.

1319,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 02:27PM ET</span>",Corporate Insiders Are Frantically Buying Up Their Own Stock,"(Bloomberg) -- With buybacks on the outs, people have occasionally been baffled over who’s been doing the buying as the stock market surged. One answer is corporate insiders.
Corporate executives and officers have been adding shares of their own firms over the past few weeks at breakneck speed. So much so that they’re more bullish than they’ve been at most other points in the past decade, according to Sundial Capital Research.
Over that stretch -- admittedly, one that occurred during a massive bull market -- peak episodes of insider buying have been a good sign for stocks, with the S&P 500 up a median of 20% over the next year. Widening the lens back to 1997, the benchmark gained 12.6% in the 12 months that followed forceful insider buys.
“There’s enough here to consider insider positions a positive,” Jason Goepfert, the president of Blaine, Minnesota-based research firm Sundial, wrote in a note Friday. “We just can’t assume it’s a pound-the-table buy signal like most of the other points over the past decade when trends were clearly more favorable.”
The buying is a notable display of confidence for executives and officers of S&P 500 companies after the average stock swung in a 45% range over the last month. After equities fell into a bear market as the fastest rate ever, with the index down 34% at a March low, it took just 15 days to shoot up more than 20%.
Insiders wield much less buying power than companies do repurchasing their shares, a practice that has been all but shut off as companies conserve cash. Its import is mainly symbolic, showing the people with the clearest insights into corporate health are seeing bargains.
“It’s an expression of their confidence in their companies and their confidence in the U.S. economy to adapt and to push forward in difficult times,” Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, said by phone. “A capitalistic society adapts to changing environments, and you’re seeing some of that adaptation even in today’s environment.”
Obviously, there are no guarantees. In the first half of March, insider buys outstripped sales by the most since 2011, data from The Washington Service showed. The next week, the S&P 500 fell 15%, its worst since 2008.
During the financial crisis, insider buying picked up in October 2008 and then receded while market losses kept piling up. Demand spiked again in February 2009, and the next month stocks embarked on an 11-year bull run. After the dot-com bubble burst, insiders similarly stepped in early, in August 2001, before backing off as the sell-off continued. It wasn’t until June 2002 that heavy insider buying returned, three months into a bull market.
For Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade, it could be a positive signal nonetheless.
“You’ve got investment managers who follow these markets saying equities in general are over-sold, and now you have a lot of insiders at companies coming out across the board as well and purchasing their stock,” Cruz said by phone. It “can give credence or reinforce that narrative that things are broadly over-sold for the time being.”

TJX, which had about 286,000 employees as of Feb. 1 according to its latest annual filing, will pay its staff until the week ending April 11. 
U.S. retailers, including Macy's (N:M) and Nordstrom (N:JWN), have closed stores as several states called for lockdowns to curb the spread of the virus outbreak that has killed over 10,000 in the country.
TJX said several executives, including Chief Executive Officer Ernie Herrman, would take a pay cut, a pattern seen across U.S. companies looking to strengthen their balance sheets amid the economic downturn triggered by the health crisis.

The company said store reopening dates would defer based on the state and locality of the outlet.

Investing.com – The Dow eased from highs Tuesday, but remained solidly in the green as investors continued to assess efforts by governments worldwide to contain the Covid-19 outbreak, with JPMorgan optimistically claiming the U.S. had passed its peak in new cases already. 
The Dow rose 2.45%, 555 points, below its session highs of 937 points. TheS&P 500 gained 2.23% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.52%.
For the second day in a row, investors are cheering signs that restrictive measures, including social distancing, have been effective in slowing the pace of coronavirus infections.
Underscoring a fall in the rate of hospitalizations, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state was still indicating that the spread of the virus was plateauing, even as the state reported its biggest increase in deaths of 731 overnight.
Cuomo said, however, that death was a lagging indicator in the fight against the virus. He also pointed to a significant drop in patients admitted to intensive care units.
JPMorgan added to recent optimism, saying the U.S. had passed its peak in new cases three or four days ago and that it expects a limited reopening of the economy in one to two weeks, CNBC reported.
Sentiment on stocks was also helped by reports that Congress is looking to beef up its $349 billion small business loan package by a further $200 billion.  
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he hopes to approve further funding for the small business loan program this Thursday, CNBC reported.
The broader market rally was led by a surge in energy, with  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) cutting its capital spending plans by 30%, but pledging to maintain its dividend, sending its stock more than 5% higher.
A fall in oil prices, however, kept a lid on gains in energy as investors fear a coordinate production cut from global oil producers will do little to stop an expected glut in supply, with some on Wall Street estimating the coronavirus pandemic has cut demand by as many as 20 million barrels per day.
Financials, mostly banks, were also among the biggest gainers on the day as Treasury yields climbed higher.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) rallied 5%. while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) were both 6% higher.
Tech was also in high demand, with FANG names seeing strong gains. "
1323,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 01:36PM ET</span>",U.S. Slashes 2020 Oil-Output Forecast Ahead of OPEC+ Meeting,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. cut its 2020 oil production forecast by more than 1 million barrels a day, as collapsing crude prices and plummeting demand threaten to shutter production in the country’s biggest fields.
Production is expected to average 11.76 million barrels a day through December, down from a previous forecast of 12.99 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday. The agency also trimmed its 2021 output expectations by 1.6 million barrels a day to just over 11 million daily barrels.
The report comes just days before OPEC, Russia and other producers meet to negotiate a round of coordinated output curbs meant to stem crude’s historic plunge. President Donald Trump, who has been trying to broker a deal to end the price war between the Saudis and Russians, faces pressure from his counterparts to join in a global supply-cut agreement after prices plunged to their lowest levels in almost two decades.
The latest forecasts reinforce comments that Trump made just a day ago about low oil prices already forcing U.S. oil producers to cut back.
“The cuts are automatic if you’re a believer in markets,” he told reporters late Monday. “They’re already cutting. If you look, they’re cutting back. It’s the market. It’s demand. It’s supply and demand. They’re already cutting back and they’re cutting back very seriously.”
Massive Surplus
The EIA also slashed its 2020 global petroleum supply forecast by 2.7 million barrels a day, and reported a looming supply surplus of 11.4 million daily barrels in the second quarter. That would eclipse the 10 million barrel-a-day production cut Trump has suggested OPEC+ shoulder in a bid to resuscitate the market.
The agency’s 2021 forecast bottoms out at 10.91 million barrels a day in March 2021. That would amount to a production cut of almost 2 million barrels a day from the all-time high of 12.87 million barrels in November 2019.
The Energy Department attributed its gloomy production outlook to “unprecedented worldwide demand impacts of Covid-19 coupled with the disruptive actions of the ongoing dispute between OPEC + nations,” agency spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said in a statement. “The Secretary is confident that both of these forces are temporary, and the market will recover,” she said, referring to Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette.
The market rout -- spurred by coronavirus-related lockdowns and a price war for market share between the Saudis and Russians -- has already forced shale explorers to pare back their budgets. With storage rapidly filling up and nowhere for excess barrels to go, some companies are already starting to shut in wells.
Net Importer
“The U.S. oil industry is being wrestled to the ground by the Russians and Saudis,” Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research in Winchester, Massachusetts, said before the report was released. “Involuntary participation is the best way to put it.”
EIA forecasts that the U.S. will return to being a net importer of crude oil and petroleum products in the third quarter of 2020 and remain a net importer in most months through the end of the forecast period. The agency expects Brent, the global benchmark crude, to average $33.04 a barrel this year, down from earlier expectations of $43.30.
The U.S. will join in a discussion of energy ministers from the Group of 20 industrialized nations on Friday that will follow the OPEC + meeting, the Energy Department said.

With factories, schools and shops shuttered around the world, the Geneva-based body says lockdowns are affecting almost 2.7 billion workers. Within that, 1.25 billion are extremely vulnerable, mainly in hotels, food services, manufacturing and retail. That’s about 38% of the global workforce.
“These workers are facing a drastic and devastating reduction in working hours, wage cuts and layoffs,” the ILO said Tuesday.
That prediction is the latest in an-ever louder chorus of warnings of the socio-economic damage of measures designed to stop the spread of the virus. Governments are already spending billions to try to cushion the impact on companies and their employees.
“Businesses across a range of economic sectors are facing catastrophic losses, which threaten their operations and solvency,” the ILO said. “Policy responses need to focus on providing immediate relief to workers and enterprises in order to protect livelihoods and economically viable businesses.”
The organization also estimates that shutdowns mean that working hours will decline by 6.7% this quarter, equivalent to 195 million full-time workers.
The report comes after sharp job losses in countries from the U.K. and Spain to the U.S., where the unemployment rate rose by the most since 1975. It’s expected to rise further, because many shop and restaurant closures haven’t yet appeared in the statistics.
Such businesses feature on the ILO’s list of worst affected sectors.
“Many of those most affected are those who are already low-wage workers and have less access to social protection coverage,” the ILO said. “As such, this can have a further negative impact on already existing inequality.”

1325,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 01:25PM ET</span>",Lufthansa to discontinue Germanwings in sweeping restructuring,"By Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) will close its Germanwings low-cost airline as part of a broader overhaul including capacity cuts across the group, it said on Tuesday as it warned it could take years for the industry to recover from the coronavirus crisis.
The group, which also owns the Austrian Airlines, Swiss and Eurowings brands, said the coronavirus had forced it to accelerate radical restructuring steps.
Its shares were up 1.1% in late trading. 
""It will take months until the global travel restrictions are completely lifted and years until worldwide demand for air travel returns to pre-crisis levels,"" it said.
""Based on this evaluation, today the Executive Board has decided on extensive measures to reduce the capacity of flight operations and administration long term.""
Global airlines said on Tuesday that 25 million jobs across the world could be at risk from the coronavirus travel downturn and the industry's representative body IATA said airline finances were so fragile they could not afford to refund customers for cancelled flights.
""Germanwings flight operations will be discontinued. All options resulting from this are to be discussed with the respective unions,"" Lufthansa said, confirming what two sources had previously told Reuters.
The fate of Germanwings has hung in the balance as the low-cost sector came under pressure, and after a suicidal pilot deliberately flew a jet into a mountainside in 2015, killing all 150 people on board.
To slash costs Lufthansa will also cut capacity at its hubs in Frankfurt and Munich, including reducing the number of aircraft in service for Lufthansa and Eurowings, it said. 
Lufthansa's overhaul includes decommissioning a number of long-haul aircraft, including six Lufthansa Airbus (PA:AIR) A380s and seven A340-600s as well as five Boeing (N:BA) 747-400s. 
A further 11 Airbus A320s will be withdrawn from short-haul operations and Lufthansa Cityline will withdraw three Airbus A340-300 aircraft from service. 
In addition to grounding the Germanwings brand, Eurowings will cut back its long-haul business, Lufthansa said. ""All options resulting from this are to be discussed with the respective unions,"" it said. 
Graphic - European airlines' shares have plunged: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklvyqwbvgd/airlines%20europe.PNG
DELAYING DELIVERIES
Restructuring programmes already initiated at Austrian Airlines and Brussels Airlines will be intensified and both companies are working on reducing their fleets. 
Swiss International Air Lines will also adjust its fleet size by delaying deliveries of new short-haul aircraft and consider early phase-outs of older aircraft.
Lufthansa's overhaul is the latest shakeout in an industry ripe for consolidation. 
Whereas four airlines control 80% of the U.S. market, Europe has remained fragmented, with the budget segment already in trouble before the coronavirus struck and Lufthansa's rivals Germania and Air Berlin put out of business.
Cutting back low-margin Germanwings may help its parent survive at a time when even large rivals like Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) are in talks to receive billions of euros in government guaranteed loans.
Lufthansa has idled more than 90% of its fleet since the virus outbreak and has already held talks with the German government on providing liquidity, including through special loans from state development bank KfW.
Lufthansa is working on a package to raise money from the debt and equity markets, two sources familiar with the matter said. Lufthansa declined comment on its financial steps.
The plan, which has yet to be finalised, could include a combination of convertible bonds, the sale of new shares and a rights issue of new stock, the sources said, adding it could happen within the next two weeks.

1326,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. grants GE license to sell engines for China's new airplane,"By Stella Qiu and Karen Freifeld
(Reuters) - The Trump administration on Tuesday granted a license to  General Electric  Co (N:GE) to supply engines for China's new COMAC C919 passenger jet, a spokeswoman for the company said.
Early this year, the United States was weighing whether to deny GE's latest license request to provide the CFM LEAP-1C engine for the narrow-body COMAC jet, which is expected to go into service next year.
The U.S. Department of Commerce, which issues such licenses, declined to comment, saying it cannot discuss individual license applications. The White House also declined to comment.
But in February, President Donald Trump intervened, blasting U.S. proposals that would prevent companies from supplying jet engines and other components to China's budding aviation industry. 
""I want China to buy our jet engines, the best in the World,” Trump tweeted on Feb. 18. “I want to make it EASY to do business with the United States, not difficult. Everyone in my Administration is being so instructed, with no excuses...”
Trump's downplayed any national security concerns. ""We're not going to be sacrificing our companies...by using a fake term of national security. It's got to be real national security. And I think people were getting carried away with it,"" he told reporters. 
GE had received licenses for the LEAP engines since 2014 and was last granted one in March 2019, as the C919 plane was developed and began to engage in test flights.
Such licenses are typically valid for four years with a defined quantity and value, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The engine is a joint venture between GE and France's  Safran  Aircraft Engines (PA:SAF). 
""We received notification that GE Aviation has license approval for engines for the C919,"" a GE spokeswoman told Reuters on Tuesday.
Safran confirmed GE received the license approval. 
COMAC was not immediately available for comment.
The license approval comes as U.S. officials have agreed to press forward with new measures to control high-tech exports to China, and to require foreign companies that use U.S. chipmaking equipment to obtain a license before supplying certain chips to China's Huawei Technologies. 
COMAC is an acronym for Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd.
Trade tensions between China and the United States have flared up since late 2018, with the world's two biggest economies engaging in a prolonged trade war that saw billions of tariffs imposed on bilateral trade. 
Even with a Phase One trade agreement in effect since earlier this year, broad tensions between the two countries are expected to continue.
Trump and some top aides have repeatedly excoriated China over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

On Thursday, GE it would furlough about half its workers in the U.S. engine assembly and component manufacturing operations for up to four weeks, a move that would affect thousands of employees.

1334,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 11:28AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Solidly Higher on Optimism of Covid-19 Containment,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets extended Monday’s blistering rally in morning trading Tuesday, on hopes that the Covid-19 pandemic will peak soon, allowing at least a partial lifting of lockdown restrictions on the economy before long.
At 11:25 AM ET (1525 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 460, up 2% from Monday’s close. The S&P 500 was up 1.8%, while the NASDAQ Composite lagged with a gain of only 1%.
Although off their early highs, the indices received a late-morning boost on news that admissions to intensive care units were down significantly in New York state.
All three indices had gained more than 7% on Monday as reports emerged of a new package of economic support measures being prepared in Washington. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the measures could be worth over $1 trillion.
The extravagant rebound over the last 24 hours means that the market is already nearly back at its likely year-end value, by some analysts' estimates.
DWS, the asset management arm of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), assumes an end-2020 level of 2,750 for the S&P 500, only 9 points above its current level. That’s on the assumption that major U.S. and European cities won’t be locked down for more than 60 days, “followed by many month of residual demand and supply-side damage from late 2019 activity levels,” according to David Bianco, DWS’s U.S. head of active equities.
“A shorter or longer lockdown would lead to some upside or downside to this base-case scenario,” he added in e-mailed comments.
Among individual stocks, Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rose 5% after the company said it will cut capital spending by some 30% from the originally budgeted $33 billion, concentrating most of the cuts in its short-cycle shale properties in the Permian Basin in Texas. Independent shale producer  Continental Resources Inc  (NYSE:CLR) stock rose 13% after also announcing it will cut production by 30% this year and suspend its dividend to conserve cash.
Such guidance, which all-but locks in a lower production trajectory for the U.S. this year, will make it easier for rival producers led by Saudi Arabia and Russia to cobble together an agreement to cut more of their own output and stabilize global prices. U.S. crude futures were 0.9% higher at $26.32 a barrel as of 11:25 AM ET.
Elsewhere, 3M  (NYSE:MMM) stock rose 4.5% - also hitting a four-week high - after President Donald Trump announced an end to their public spat over producing face masks for U.S. health care workers. The two have agreed that 3M will supply 166 million masks over the next three months.
Elsewhere, Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) stock fell 8% and biotech giant Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) stock fell 5%, as two of the stocks that have benefited from inflows from the rest of the market in recent weeks reversed. Zoom Video has ridden a boom in working from home in Europe and the U.S., while Gilead's experimental anti-retroviral drug remdesivir has been touted as one of the most likely sources of a breakthrough in treating the Covid-19 disease."

1336,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 11:18AM ET</span>",Investors Are Chasing the Rally Into the Jaws of Economic Crisis,"(Bloomberg) -- There hasn’t been much of a consensus on Wall Street lately but all of a sudden it looks like investors agree on two things: This rally has legs, and the economic crisis might be the worst in living memory.
That those two views can coexist speaks to the strength of this stock rebound and the mindset of traders conditioned by more than a decade of gains. Everyone knows tough times are ahead; no one wants to miss the buying opportunity of a lifetime.
All that means the S&P 500 could re-enter a bull market in one of the quickest times on record -- even as dismal news for the world’s largest economy piles up. Just hours ahead of the U.S. open, sentiment among small businesses collapsed by the most on record.
“Investors are torn between greed and fear,” said Daniel Murray, deputy chief investment officer at EFG Asset Management. “The risks are huge simply because we’ve never experienced anything like this before. But at the same time because markets have sold off so far and so quickly that means some high-quality assets have been dragged down.”
The market rebound lies in the coronavirus data over the past few days, which show rates of new deaths and infections apparently easing in several major economies.
After weeks of gloomy headlines it’s a welcome reprieve, but a prolonged economic shutdown is still needed to contain the outbreak -- and that has many market watchers fretting over how sustainable the rebound is.
“It makes sense that near-term catalysts like slowing hospital admissions or bending infection curves in Europe resulted in higher stock prices,” the equity team at Bespoke Investment Group LLC wrote in a note. “But that optimism has to be balanced against what could easily be additional outbreaks, re-outbreaks, and the lack of complete normalcy that will likely persist until a vaccine can be developed.”
The disconnects aren’t just between assets and economics. They’re cropping up within the market itself.
Dividend futures for the S&P 500 -- contracts tied to future shareholder payouts for the biggest U.S. companies -- have all plunged more than 27% so far this year across a range of tenors as the pandemic sweeps the country, forcing people into quarantine and shuttering businesses.
Yet thanks to its rally of the past few weeks, the S&P 500 itself is down only about 15% this year. Put simply, pessimism over growth currently looks a lot worse than the cash market for stocks is pricing.

Strikingly, during a surge for the S&P 500 on Monday, the leading stocks were those whose earnings estimates for 2021 had fallen the most, according to Bespoke. The analysts reckon this is in large part because those businesses were hit particularly hard and have seen their valuations crater along the way. Yesterday’s rally could therefore be dubbed a dash for the cheap stuff rather than something powered by economic conviction.
And those awful economic readings are piling up. The collapse in small business confidence follows data showing unemployment surging at an unprecedented rate and orders contracting at U.S. factories at the fastest since 2009.
For some, the divergence between equities and the economy is purely a function of the extraordinary response from policy and law makers to the crisis. The flood of dollars unleashed by the Federal Reserve floats all asset boats, while its Treasury buying suppresses rates volatility which has a knock-on effect into credit and then stocks.
“DM economic indicators continue to fall short of expectations, and government economic policies are causing quite a bit of noise,” Masanari Takada, a quantitative strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc., wrote in a note. “We therefore think a basic approach to short-term DM equity trading should view this as a mere spontaneous technical rebound.”
All the doubts mean much of the big money remains on the sidelines, potentially limiting this updraft. Takada argues it will be “some time” before macro hedge funds and long-term investors are persuaded to start buying again.

That chimes with the response of smart-money investors surveyed by Evercore ISI. They found a distinctly bearish picture, with hedge funds net short across benchmarks as they prep for the S&P 500 to fall to as low as 2,000 by June amid the ongoing turmoil caused by the virus.
“Investors are starting to form a central case for the near/medium term economic outlook,” strategists led by Dennis Debusschere wrote in a note. “But the bearish case -- which most investors seem to agree with -- is the threat of virus rebound that continues to weigh on the outlook for growth and equities.”

1341,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 09:00AM ET</span>",Japan's SoftBank to invest $48 million in Brazil pet products site Petlove,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) reached an agreement to invest 250 million reais ($48 million) in pet products online retailer Petlove, the companies said in a statement on Tuesday.
The investment will come from SoftBank's Latin America fund, adding to previous venture capital investments from KasZek Ventures, Monashees and private equity firm Tarpon. 
Petlove founder Marcio Waldman said in a statement the investment would help accelerate Petlove's growth amid higher demand for online services during the social isolation period mandated by Brazilian authorities to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Brazil's pet market had 24 billion reais in revenue last year, among the three largest in the world, according to Euromonitor data. Online sales represent only 3.8% of

1342,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 09:00AM ET</span>",European Benchmarks Set to Exit Shortest Bear Market on Record,"(Bloomberg) --
For euro-area stocks, this could be the shortest bear market on record.
Major equity benchmarks from Italy to Germany advanced on Tuesday, taking their gains from last month’s low to 20% or more. The Euro Stoxx 50 Index too has advanced similarly. A close at these levels would technically mark the beginning of a bull market, even if it’s one that sees euro-area shares 25% off this year’s highs.
Traders are turning more optimistic this week as the number of coronavirus infections have slowed in several European countries, while others such as Denmark and Austria are relaxing lockdown measures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average entered a bull market just two weeks after leaving it, though the U.S. blue-chip index has barely made further headway since. The brisk rebound in stocks worldwide adds pressure on investors to take a call on whether to jump back in, take profits or risk losing out on a sharp recovery.
“Well look, volatility works in both directions,” Andre Koppers, a portfolio manager at Oberbanscheidt & Cie, said by phone. “We came from a really low level and have now quickly compensated for this negative exaggeration.” Koppers said the rebound will probably lose steam from here, but there are still good buying opportunities for long-term investors.
While dividend cuts and profit warnings keep coming, a number of companies made positive comments on Tuesday, with Danish medical-equipment firm Ambu A/S raising its sales forecast, Sweden’s Getinge AB saying it’s increasing production of ventilators to meet demand, and  Accor  (PA:ACCP) SA Chief Executive Officer Sebastien Bazin saying a rebound for the hotel industry will happen at some point.
Still, some caution lingered. Spain reported an increase in cases even as the outbreak showed signs of slowing elsewhere. And the U.K. is facing a leadership crisis as Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted to intensive care after struggling to shake off the infection.
“Markets are likely still underestimating how long containment measures will last, and particularly how long it will take to get back to ‘normal’ afterwards,” warned Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions. “We are unlikely to see a general ‘all clear’ and a resumption in activity.”
The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index was up 2.9% at 1:12 p.m. CET, taking its advance from a March trough to 18%. All 19 industry groups rose, with travel and leisure shares -- the worst hit in the rout -- leading gains with a 9% advance. Cyclical shares also outperformed, with carmakers and banks up more than 5%, while defensives lagged. Every major western-European benchmark was also in the green, including Britain’s FTSE 100 Index, up 3.1%.
A number of sector indexes, including energy, travel & leisure and autos have gained more than 25% since the market low on March 18.
“If we’ve seen the bottom, and cases do peak, and China doesn’t get a second wave, then everyone goes back to work and productivity starts again and we start spending again,” David Vickers, a senior portfolio manager at Russell Investments, said by phone.
“Then you’ll get pent-up demand coming onto the market. At the same time, interest rates are low and fiscal stimulus has been thrown at you. So there’s a very strong chance of a very strong bounce coming out of this if the virus does indeed peter out or some kind of vaccine comes to pass.”

1343,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 08:36AM ET</span>",UBS Says Stale Estimates Mask a Much Bigger S&P 500 Profit Slump,"(Bloomberg) -- A model aimed at eliminating the influence of stale estimates suggests earnings in the S&P 500 will fall a lot more than currently envisioned by the consensus of Wall Street analysts.
Keith Parker, UBS’s head of equity strategy, dusted off the methodology after noticing many firms hadn’t updated their data on individual stocks for weeks. His verdict: existing data on earnings in the next 12 months are probably underestimating the scope of the decline in S&P 500 income by a factor of 2.
Here’s how it works. Say a stock has 10 analysts covering it, five of which have lowered their prediction by 10% in the last week, while five left it unchanged. One of the models Parker is using assumes that the laggards will eventually get around to making cuts resembling the first group, and considers the “implied” EPS revision to be 10%.
In the past four weeks, reflecting both updated and unchanged estimates, the consensus target for S&P’s earnings in the next 12 months has fallen by 8.4%. According to Parker’s methodology, the implied EPS decrease is almost twice that.
“In times of such economic uncertainty, you often have earnings that come in and change slowly as analyst look for data points to change their earnings estimates,” Parker said by phone. “If we want to get a more timely forecast, we should adjust for those incorporating market information at their own pace.”
Such gaps often open up during periods of high uncertainty. According to Parker, the delay itself is useful in determining market direction. When the divergence between real and implied estimates narrowed to 1 or 2 percentage points in February 2009 and early 2016, a bottom was imminent.
“It’s going to remain pretty wide for the next few weeks, but it should narrow as we get through the first-quarter reporting season, as we see a reset and aligning of expectations, which is an important precondition for finding the bottom,” Parker said by phone. “What I think is going to be important is the magnitude of earnings revisions in the next few weeks.”
Wall Street has almost never disagreed this much about what companies will earn, with many forecasts going stale as researchers refused to hazard guesses. The available data through Friday suggest the consensus calls for operating income to fall 8.3% in the first quarter. That as some Wall Street strategists see a double-digit earnings decline in the same time. For the full year, analysts see a 5.9% drop in earnings followed by a 16% rebound in 2021.
The difference in EPS revisions has been uneven on a sector basis. Industrials have had a 13 percentage-point gap between implied and actual EPS revisions, the biggest among 11 industry groups, meaning upcoming “actual” downgrades could be large. For utilities and health-care stocks, revision trends in both categories have been more or less the same.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stock markets enjoyed a second day of sharp gains on Tuesday as signs of progress against the coronavirus in both Europe and the United States and some more liberal helpings of stimulus kept investors charging back in.
There was an added boost from commodity markets as oil climbed nearly 2.5% on supply cut hopes, while currency markets also came alive as a tumbling dollar sent the euro racing out of a six-session rut of falls. 
Equities were where the main action was however. Japan's Nikkei followed up Wall Street's 7% surge on Monday [nL1N2BU2BE ]with a 2% jump as its government promised a near $1 trillion stimulus package - equal to a fifth of its GDP.
Europe was in the swing of things too. The pan-European STOXX 600 index climbed roughly 3% as the respective markets in London, Frankfurt, Paris, Milan, and U.S. futures, all bounded higher. 
""A day does not a trend make, a week does not a trend make... but we think the market is bottoming out,"" said Jeff Mortimer, Director of Investment Strategy at BNY Mellon Wealth Management.
""We are trying to get clients to understand that (in market performance terms) better times ahead can come more quickly then you expected."" 
Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 1.3 million people and killed over 74,000, and though the numbers are still rising in many highly-populated countries, some tentative improvements have given hope.
In hardest-hit Italy and Spain, authorities have started looking ahead to easing lockdowns after steady falls in fatality rates. In the United States too, the daily number of deaths in the country's worst-affected area, New York, has also shown signs of steadying.
With market optimism on the rise, the U.S. dollar, which has been soaking up safe-haven flows for weeks, slipped against most major currencies. 
The euro shot up 0.8% to $1.0880 to snap a six-day run of falls, the pound climbed despite Britain's Prime Minister remaining in intensive care due to the virus, and the Australian dollar jumped over 1.5% to its highest in a week. 
New Zealand's dollar rose 1.3% too, while the Japanese yen shook off an early dip to clamber up to 108.92 per U.S. dollar. 
""We've got a nice decline in volatility across forex and equity markets. We know central banks have done a very good job in alleviating the strain in dollar markets and that's feeding through,"" said Kenneth Broux, FX strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
""We need some time for this to settle ... I think what we are seeing is a bit of mean reversion - a correction from exaggerated selling. We are in that process.""

OIL UP 
It wasn't only oil driving commodities markets higher either, copper punched up to a 3-week high with a 3% gain for industrial metals, while safe-haven gold wilted to $1,655 an troy ounce in the other direction. 
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds continued to lose out too. U.S. yields - which move inverse to price - rose to 0.73% having fallen almost 9 basis points on Monday, and Bund yields were up 6-9 basis points across the curve. [US/]
Rating agency Fitch had warned on Monday that it was likely to make some multi-notch cuts to some countries' credit scores due to the financial pressures heaped on by either tackling the virus, the collapse in oil prices, or both.
The Eurogroup of finance ministers within the single euro zone currency bloc are scheduled to meet later on Tuesday, and analysts expect more joint action to help prop up the economies of member states.
Cyprus, one of the lower-rated countries in the bloc, is marketing a seven-year and 30-year bond issuance. In Asia, Indonesia issued a 50-year bond, the longest ever timeframe in the region.
""Investors have recently been detecting growing public support for the concept of coronabonds in European Commission and ECB circles,"" said DZ Bank analyst Daniel Lenz, adding that German ECB Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel was among those who appeared to voice support.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to push higher at the open Tuesday, continuing Monday’s strong gains, on tentative signs the spread of coronavirus is slowing as well as talk of more funds to support the battered economy.
At 7:00 AM ET (1100 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 89 points, or 3.4%, higher, futures for the Nasdaq up 251 points, or 3.1%. The Dow futures contract rose 817 points, or 3.6%. 
Wall Street closed firmly higher Monday, with all three major cash indices up over 7%, the best session out of the last nine.
The number of Covid-19 cases in the U.S. have continued to rise, with Johns Hopkins University Tuesday registering over 368,000 cases, and nearly 11,000 deaths. However, there has been some positive news out of New York, the epicentre of the U.S. outbreak, as Governor Andrew Cuomo said late Monday the virus-related fatality rate was effectively flat for two days.
This is supported by further evidence that the virus has peaked in many countries in Europe, with some starting to present their 'exit strategy' from the strict lockdown measures. Also, for the first time since January, China reported no daily deaths.
Adding to the bullish tone are reports which emerged late Monday that another stimulus package could come from Capitol Hill. Another round could be agreed by May and be around $1.5 trillion, Fox Business reported, citing sources briefed by the White House and Congressional leaders.
Earlier Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced a much larger-than-expected stimulus package of 108 trillion yen ($988 billion) to support his country’s struggling households and businesses. 
In corporate news, Boeing (NYSE:BA) will be in focus after the troubled aircraft manufacturer announced Monday it will suspend all 787 operations at its South Carolina factory, following orders by the state governor, effectively putting the company’s entire commercial airplane production on hiatus.

On the flip side,  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) announced plans to progressively restart its manufacturing facilities in the United States and Canada on Monday, May 4.
Oil prices gained Tuesday as investors focused on the possibility of a global cut in crude production. Russia has confirmed it will join members of OPEC for a virtual meeting on Thursday, that many expect to end with an agreement.

Additionally, gold futures rose 0.7% to $1,705.10/oz, after earlier climbing to a new seven-year high of $1,742.20, while EUR/USD traded at $1.0875, up 0.8%."

U.K. discount airline EasyJet stock rose over 30% after announcing a series of measures that appear to secure its near-term future, despite having grounded all its fleet due to public health measures and the collapse in regional travel demand. By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), it was up 29.4%.
The airline said it had raised 600 million pounds in commercial paper – short-term debt securities -  and fully drawn down its 500 million revolving credit facility, secured against its aircraft. A couple of weeks ago, the company had said they were worth over 4 billion pounds, so it would appear to have the potential to raise more money against them later, if needed.
In addition, it said it has reached agreement with its most expensive staff – its pilots – over furlough terms, having struck a similar agreement with cabin crew last week.
In all, EasyJet now says it has access to 2.3 billion in cash reserves, including a 600 million-pound loan from the government, guaranteed by the Bank of England.
“Our current priority is to safeguard short term liquidity, so we have borrowed…in order to increase our liquidity in the event of a prolonged grounding of the fleet,” said CEO Johan Lundgren.
More interesting, however, was what the company didn’t say. The company made no reference to another blistering criticism from its largest shareholder Stelios Haji-Ioannou on Monday, who said the airline would run out of cash regardless by August. The founder who still controls over 34% of EasyJet through a family investment vehicle, is desperate to cancel EasyJet’s order for another 100 Airbus planes which he says are “useless”, given that pre-crisis forecasts for market growth no longer hold.
The CEO and founder are a microcosm of the broader debate about what shape the European economy will be in when it emerges from the crisis: will there be a quick return to business as usual, helped by effective state safety nets, or will it become a debt-laden zombie, vulnerable to recurrent outbreaks of the virus that weigh for years on business and consumer confidence?
 “I think that easyJet (LON:EZJ) at the end of national lockdowns will feel more like a start-up trying to find a few profitable routes for a few aircraft at a time,” Haji-Ioannou said on Monday. “How many Brits will want to fly to northern Italy or Spain on holiday this June? ...Not many, I think.”
The Guardian reported on Monday that management is indeed talking to Airbus about restructuring the contract, to reduce its overall size and stretch out the payment and delivery schedule. By taking the loans, management may have reduced its immediate bankruptcy risk, but it has also reduced its scope to plead poverty with its exclusive supplier."

BEIJING / HONG KONG (Reuters) - Luckin Coffee's app has rocketed to become the second most popular in China as consumers rushed to claim a free drink that it has long offered for downloading, worried the chain might collapse after it said much of its sales last year were fabricated.
""I heard that if you download the app, you will get free coffee,"" said Beijing-based Gan Lin, 35, who downloaded the app on Friday.
""I'm not that into coffee but it would be a pity to lose the chance for a free drink. After all, you don't know how much longer Luckin can hold on.""
The coffee chain's app usually ranks between the 70th and 100th most popular free app downloads for users of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iOS operating system in China, according to app performance tracker App Annie. Apple's App Store is one of the biggest in China.
Luckin's shock announcement last Thursday that its chief operating officer and other employees had fabricated sales sent its shares plunging more than 80% and wiped more than $5 billion off the company's market capitalisation.
The  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) rival only went public last year, positioning itself as a tech version of a retail business, where users ordered coffee via its app for delivery to their offices and homes. 
It has relied heavily on discounted sales to drive its fast growth and capture market share. The loss-making company began operations in January 2018 and by December 2019, had over 4,500 stores - overtaking Starbucks, with 4,100, in the process.
Luckin on Sunday said its business would continue to operate as normal and apologised to its customers.
The company did not respond on Tuesday to a request for comment on the surge in demand for its app. 
The newfound Luckin coffee frenzy has been strong enough to freeze the app in many Chinese cities, leaving customers unable to place orders for several hours.
On Luckin’s Weibo social media account, thousands of users have expressed hope the coffee chain will continue to operate because they haven’t used up their vouchers. 
Some were more genuine fans. One said on Weibo that if Luckin survived the scandal, he would drink Luckin ""even if there is no discount"". His comment gained 66,000 likes on Weibo.

(Reuters) - European shares rallied for a second straight day on Tuesday with investors focusing on early signs that the coronavirus pandemic may be easing, even as major companies took steps to shore up cash.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 3.1% to its highest level in nearly a month, with Spanish (IBEX) and Italian (FTMIB) stock surging 3.4% and 4.5%, respectively, on a slowdown in new infections in Italy, Spain and hard-hit parts of the United States.
""We see this rally as a necessary part of price discovery and finding a new bottom,"" said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at TS Lombard in London.
""The initial stage was the shock and we've gone through that when the market was selling off every day. We are now transitioning to phase two, which is the consequences of the lockdowns.""
The benchmark STOXX 600 index has gained more than 22% since hitting an eight-year low in March - technically marking a bull market - but remains 24% below its February record high, when the global spread of the coronavirus led to a virtual halt in business activity.
France's  Thales  (PA:TCFP) on Tuesday became the latest big company to slash dividend and suspend profit forecasts, but its shares rose 3.8% after it added a new 2 billion euro ($2.17 billion) credit facility to shore up liquidity.
(GRAPHIC: Global stock indexes' three-month performance - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jznpnlqeplm/Global%20stock%20indexes%20three-month%20performance.png) 
German shares (GDAXI) surged 4.5% to their highest since March 11, as data showed industry output in Europe's manufacturing powerhouse rose by a better-than-expected 0.3% in February, before the pandemic prompted sweeping lockdowns.
However, analysts said output will likely tumble in the next three months with the Ifo institute's index for production expectations logging its biggest drop since the survey was first conducted in 1991.
With a slate of companies withdrawing their financial forecasts and supply chains far from being revived, economists polled by Reuters said a global recession was under way, although most clung to hopes of a swift rebound.
""No one yet knows the exact damage this virus has already done to the global economy and corporate earnings, and what kind of exit strategies countries will follow in the weeks ahead,"" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.
""The road ahead won't be a smooth one, especially as investors still need to digest a mountain of negative economic data and possibly many bankruptcies.""
A Reuters report said Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) will discuss permanently grounding its Germanwings low-cost airline unit, as the health crisis dents travel demand.
Lufthansa's shares jumped 8.1% as another report said the company was working on a package to raise money from the debt and equity markets.

Cineworld (L:CINE), which has lost about three quarters of its value this year, surged 35.8% after saying it was in talks lenders for its liquidity needs as the strict stay-at-home orders forced it to shut all its 787 cinemas across 10 countries.

Investing.com - European stock markets have pushed firmly higher Tuesday, as investors anticipate more financial aid to help bolster the region’s battered economies.
At 3:30 AM ET (0730 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index traded 3.4% higher, France's CAC 40 was up 2.8%, while the DAX rose 3.4%. The broader-based Stoxx 600 Europe index climbed 2.4%. 
The EU’s finance ministers will be in focus Tuesday as they meet to try and agree a list of measures to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus on the region’s economies. If enough headway is made, the bloc’s leaders could debate and then rubber stamp a deal later in the week.
The subject of joint 'coronabonds' is sure to be raised again, but more likely options include credit lines from the euro zone's bailout fund, more lending from the European Investment Bank and the use of the joint long-term budget directly for guarantees for leveraged borrowing.
This follows on from reports late Monday that another stimulus package could come from Capitol Hill. Another round could come by May and be around $1.5 trillion, Fox Business reported, citing sources briefed by the White House and Congressional leaders.
In corporate news, shares in  Thales  (PA:TCFP) rose 3% despite it becoming the latest major European company to slash its dividend, suspend profit guidance and top up liquidity in response to the coronavirus crisis. The French aerospace and defense supplier said it had withdrawn the proposed final instalment of its 2019 dividend, saving 430 million euros ($465 million). 
Elsewhere, luxury groups LVMH  (PA:LVMH) and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) joined Hermes (PA:HRMS) and Chanel in saying they wouldn't tap a state scheme for wage subsidies to help them through the crisis.
Shares in WH Smith  (LON:SMWH) soared over 7% after the U.K. retailer said it has raised 165.9 million pounds ($203.5 million) via the share placing, which will strengthen its balance sheet and liquidity position.
Oil prices pushed higher Tuesday as investors focused on the possibility of a global cut in crude production. OPEC+, which includes Russia, is set for a virtual meeting on Thursday that many expect to end with an agreement.
The group is likely to agree to cut production Thursday as long as the United States joins in cutting output, Reuters reported late Monday, citing three OPEC+ sources.
The American Petroleum Institute will issue its measure of weekly U.S. oil stockpiles after the bell Tuesday. Last week it reported a huge build of more than 10 million barrels.
At 3:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 3.5% higher at $27.00 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 2.7% to $33.94.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose to a new seven-year high of $1,742.20 before retreating a little to $1,700.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0870, up 0.7% on the day.

1355,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 03:25AM ET</span>",Samsung first-quarter beats estimates; chips likely to prop up virus-hit second-quarter,"By Heekyong Yang and Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) -  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) said on Tuesday its first-quarter operating profit likely managed to rise slightly from a slump a year earlier, as solid chip sales helped cushion the blow from the coronavirus pandemic on smartphones and TVs.
The global leader in semiconductors is benefiting from higher demand for chips from laptop makers and data centres amid the coronavirus-driven shift to working from home, even as its mobile and consumer electronics businesses suffer.
Samsung said operating profit was expected to be 6.4 trillion won ($5.2 billion) in the quarter ended March, compared with 6.2 trillion won a year ago and the 6.2 trillion won estimate from analysts according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate. 
Revenue likely rose 5% to 55 trillion won from a year ago, in line with the 55.6 trillion won estimate. 
Samsung Electronics shares were 2.3% higher while the broader market (KS11) was up 1.9%. 
The maker of smartphones, TVs, appliances, memory chips and displays is the first global tech company to report its January-to-March quarter earnings estimates. 
Samsung Electronics said last month the coronavirus would hurt sales of smartphones - which accounted for about 47% of its revenue last year - and consumer electronics in 2020, while demand from data centres would fuel a recovery in memory chip markets. 
""Even though Samsung’s mobile business was hit by the coronavirus outbreak this quarter, it will likely face bigger challenges in the second quarter - now that the United States and Europe have become the hardest-hit countries,"" Kim Sun-woo, an analyst at Meritz Securities, said.
When the coronavirus outbreak started in China last year, Samsung’s strategy of spreading its production base to countries including Vietnam and India seemed to pay off as supply disruptions in China hit rivals such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
But as the virus spread across the globe, Samsung too has had to close factories and retail stores in Europe, India and the United States. 
NH Investment & Securities said on Tuesday it expected sales of Samsung's premium Galaxy 20 smartphone to reach 20 million units this year, far short of the 32 million it had forecast earlier.
LG Electronics (KS:066570), Samsung's crosstown rival in TVs, phones and appliances, meanwhile said its first-quarter operating profit likely rose 21% to 1 trillion won. Analysts expect the coronavirus to affect LG this quarter. 
CHIP BUFFER 
Samsung Electronics did not provide a breakdown of earnings for each division in its guidance released on Tuesday.
Analysts say the company's memory chip business, which generated more than 50% of its operating profit in 2019, would likely report better-than-expected results in the first half of this year. 
Memory chip prices are rising as work-from-home requirements boost demand from the data centres that support internet services such as streaming and cloud computing, analysts have said. 
Prices for DRAM memory chips are up more than 3.5% since January, according to industry tracker DRAMeXchange. 
""If the coronavirus outbreak doesn’t die down in the third quarter, demand for memory chips might face a bump,"" said Song Myeong-sup, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities.

1356,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 02:45AM ET</span>",Stock plunge gives Korean business owners chance to save on succession costs,"By Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - Ageing owners of South Korean companies are taking advantage of a coronavirus-induced plunge in stock prices to transfer stakes to kin on the cheap, in what will eventually soften the blow of one of the world's highest rates of inheritance tax.
From massive family-run ""chaebols"" to smaller enterprises, succession is expensive business in corporate Korea, one of just five of the 36 members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to fully tax direct parent-to-child inheritance. Korea also taxes stock inherited from major shareholders without exception, unlike the United States.
With market participants fretting over the impact of the novel coronavirus - which this year has prompted governments to curb economic activity - Korean shares have hovered at decade-low prices, giving business owners an avenue to shore up control without opposition by transferring stakes at minimal cost.
Transfers classed as gifts are subject to tax, but bills are relative to prices. And with bigger stakes in the hands of the next generation, inheritance tax bills will be lower. 
The chairman of CJ Group - Korea's 14th-largest chaebol with 31 trillion won ($25.34 billion) in assets and which produced Academy Award Best Picture winner ""Parasite"" - cancelled his Dec. 9 transfer of 1.84 million preferred shares in holding company  CJ Corp  (KS:001040) to his two children, and repeated it on April 1 at a price 24% lower, regulatory filings showed. 
As a result, the children saved as much as 20 billion won in gift tax, showed Reuters calculations based on local tax law and assuming an unchanged share price for the following two months.
The transfer was the first CJ Group Chairman Lee Jay-hyun, 60, had made to his children, showed CJ Corp filings since 2001.
Last month, a member of the family-owner of Dong Suh Companies Inc (KS:026960) gifted 1.3 billion won worth of shares in the food maker to his two children, in their early 30s and late 20s respectively. The chief executive of  Semisysco Co Ltd  (KQ:136510) also gifted his two children 40,000 shares in the display manufacturing equipment supplier.
Older members of family-owners of at least 10 other firms gifted stakes to younger generations in March, filings showed.
CJ Group and Dong Suh declined to comment. Semisysco did not have an immediate comment. 
PREMIUM
The wave of stock gifts comes as South Korea's main stock price index, the KOSPI (KS11), was 35% lower in mid-March than when the coronavirus spread beyond China's borders in February, hitting its lowest since the 2009 global economic downturn.
""This is one of the best times to prepare for succession,"" said Shin Dong-du, a tax accountant specialising in corporate succession. ""South Korea has gradually strengthened enforcement of tax codes on succession only in the past decade, and with many sitting company owners coincidentally aging beyond 60 right now, succession planning has only recently begun to be a field.""
Beneficiaries of over 3 billion won in inheritance must pay 1.04 billion won in tax plus 50% of the amount above 3 billion won, plus a premium of 20% of the value of stock inherited from the major shareholder, adding up to one of the highest rates of inheritance tax among OECD members, analysts said.
Samsung Group heir Jay Y. Lee would have to pay around 8.3 trillion won to inherit the his ailing father's 4.18% stake in  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) - the biggest stake held by an individual - as of the stock's average price over December 2019 through March 2020, showed Reuters calculations.
At LG Group and Hanjin Group, whose patriarchs died in the past two years, beneficiaries are paying inheritance tax of 921.5 billion won and about 270 billion won respectively in instalments over five years.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungarian low-cost airline Wizz Air (L:WIZZ) is repatriating citizens and transporting medical equipment for east European governments, in a move coupling one-off charter traffic with savvy government relations amid the coronavirus crisis.
Wizz Air is one of several airlines involved in the largest peacetime repatriation effort in Europe as travel firms turn their attention from tourists to serving governments. 
""We try to do the right thing,"" Wizz Air Chief Executive Jozsef Varadi told Reuters. ""Yes, governments and other institutions pay for the flights, but this is not the time to make a profit ... The most important issue here is to help.""
Wizz has operated two repatriation flights from the United States to Hungary, with the Budapest government picking up the tab and securing onboard meals. 
The airline charged the government for a charter flight, a lump sum which it declined to disclose. The government then advertised one-way tickets to Budapest for $880 on the Los Angeles consulate Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
A Wizz Air spokeswoman said that U.S. regulations precluded passengers from picking up the bill, as the flights counted as non-commercial, humanitarian missions.
""U.S. authorities gave us the green light to operate on the basis that we do not charge passengers,"" she said. ""Otherwise we would not get permits. And this is what we strictly kept to.""
A government spokesman said passengers did eventually pay for the flight.
""The Hungarian citizens paid below-market prices through the foreign missions, with the Hungarian state paying for the rest. The repatriating flights were a Hungarian government mission, therefore the passengers had no payment obligation to Wizz Air,"" the Foreign Ministery said.
Wizz has also operated flights for other governments in the region, including those of Slovenia and Macedonia, and is in talks with others. 
The carrier is deploying 10% of its fleet and 200 staff in the effort, which included its first ever transatlantic flights as Airbus jets acquired to serve Europe's tourist boom zig-zagged across the United States and stopped in Iceland for fuel.
Hungary's nationalist government has given Wizz Air ample publicity for the repatriation, featuring the airline in videos and media appearances and infusing it with patriotic appeals. 
""Home is here,"" Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto posted on Facebook alongside a video of the repatriation of hundreds of people from the United States, showing Wizz planes against the setting sun with a soundtrack of romantic music.

As a six-plane Wizz fleet flew back from China, Szijjarto met with Varadi and told the businessman: ""You play a key role here ... in more ways than one.""

1358,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 02:25AM ET</span>",Asian companies pose lower dividend risk due to stronger finances,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy 
(Reuters) - Asian firms appear better equipped to pay stable dividends compared with their western counterparts that are constrained by highly levered balance-sheets and a need to preserve cash during the coronavirus outbreak.
As major global central banks push interest rates to near-zero, yield-seeking investors are on the hunt for assets that provide a stable income.
Analysts say that while Asian companies are also pressured by factory shutdowns and falling demand this year, their higher cash flows could help to sustain dividend payments.
""We note that companies in Asia appear to have much more insulation in terms of sustainability of cash outflow items such as capital expenditure and dividends relative to their Western counterparts,"" Jim McCafferty, head of Asia-ex-Japan equity research at Nomura in Hong Kong, said in a note.
""We believe this conservatism has roots in the fact that Asia has experienced more crises than the West in recent years."" 
Nearly 70 of the top 600 listed companies in Europe cut or suspended dividends between Feb. 24 and March 31, a Reuters analysis found, while 18 of the top 100 London-listed companies have cut or delayed theirs. 
Last week, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said it expects S&P 500 dividends to fall by 25% in 2020 as certain large dividend-paying industries are particularly vulnerable to the economic shock of the coronavirus outbreak.
However, analysts' downgrades over the past month of Asian companies' dividend payments are modest compared to those of other regions, Refinitiv data showed. 
(GRAPHIC: Mean change in dividend estimates - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwpkznxvmn/mean%20estimate%20change.JPG) 
Sean Darby, global equity strategist at Jefferies, said China's Hong Kong-listed H-shares, or government-linked companies, which aren't in commodities businesses provide an interesting hedge for investors since they are likely to receive favourable bank credit while having large domestic franchises.
Companies such as China Mobile (HK:0941), China's toll road firms and insurance companies offer secured dividends on decent valuations, he said.
""We think they are unlikely to be cut since the Chinese government is running a record large budget deficit and needs sources of revenue to fill the gap,"" he said.
China Mobile, in fact, pledged last month to keep its dividend stable for 2020.
According to a Nomura analysis, only 18% of the top 100 non-financial U.S. companies were net cash, with cash levels exceeding debt, while the ratio for the UK was 21%. 
(GRAPHIC: Comparison of net cash levels - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklvynowpgd/nomura%20graphic.JPG) 
On the other hand, 48% of Chinese/HK firms and 50% of Japanese firms were net cash firms, the data showed.
Dividend yields of firms in Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore are among the highest in the world, Refinitiv data showed.

Asia-Pacific has the highest free cash-flow yield, a ratio that measures the cash a company generates to meet debt, dividend and other obligations, the data showed, suggesting these companies will keep enough buffers to cater to yield-seeking investors.

1360,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 02:10AM ET</span>",Employees worried about Valero response to virus cases at Texas refinery: sources,"By Erwin Seba
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Employees at  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO)'s Port Arthur, Texas, refinery expressed worries about the company's slow response to keep the coronavirus from spreading there after two workers tested positive, four people familiar with the matter said.
Valero, the nation's second-largest refiner, started to cut non-essential work and related contractors only this week after starting temperature checks last week - much later than other major U.S. refiners, according to the people.
Valero spokeswoman Lillian Riojas said the company maintains the privacy of employee health information and as such would ""not publicize individual cases of COVID-19."" 
Riojas, however, outlined Valero's response in case of a positive test, saying it included compliance and cooperation with the Centers for Disease Control and local health authorities, sterilization of affected areas and communicating with employees in 'close contact' with those affected. 
That is ""followed by implementation of appropriate quarantines, communication with our employees at the site, and, most importantly support of all affected employees.""
Globally, the coronavirus has infected over 1.3 million people and killed more than 74,000. The United States has the most number of cases, at more than 360,000.
The pandemic presents significant challenges to energy facilities like power generation plants, offshore drilling platforms and refineries, where remote operation is often not possible and some staffing is needed to run key units. 
Refiners are still meeting customer needs for gasoline and jet fuel that have slowed to a trickle in the United States and globally as the pandemic keeps people at home.
The largest U.S. refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC), and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), the third largest, cut contract workers, who perform maintenance, two weeks ago. 
Temperature checks for people entering refineries began about the same time at major U.S. refineries. 
VALERO COVID-19 CASES
But Valero has lagged, the people said.
Unable to work from home, many Port Arthur refinery employees are indoors in shared control rooms and eat in common dining areas, placing them at greater risk of contracting COVID-19, the sources added on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to media.
The Port Arthur refinery processes 335,000 barrels of crude oil per day, though it has lately been running at reduced rates due to weakened demand for products.
The refinery employs more than 900 salaried and hourly workers. Its about 450 hourly workers are represented by the United Steelworkers union (USW). About 750 contract workers are employed by third-party companies Valero hires to perform maintenance in the refinery.
The first case reported at the refinery was a contract worker who had no contact with employees, but had contact with another contract worker who had access to a building used by employees, the sources said. 
Employees were notified on March 28.
Temperature checks were implemented after employees were notified about the first case.
""In my opinion it was a very meager cover-your-ass by a company that has already had a contractor working inside the fence who tested positive for COVID-19,"" one of the sources said of the temperature checks. 
The second case was an employee, the sources said. 
The company notified its employees on April 5, adding the affected person has not been in the refinery since March 27.
The two people and those who worked closely with that person were sent home for 14 days and the places where they were working underwent ""enhanced cleaning,"" according to the sources.
Officials with USW 13-423 in Port Arthur, which represents workers at the Valero refinery, declined comment.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's  Thales  (PA:TCFP) on Tuesday became the latest major company to slash its dividend, suspend profit guidance and top up liquidity in response to the coronavirus crisis.
The aerospace and defence supplier said it had withdrawn the proposed final instalment of its 2019 dividend, saving 430 million euros ($465 million). The company has already paid an interim dividend of 0.6 euros, meaning the remaining 2.05 euros will not be paid.
Thales also suspended its 2020 financial guidance, which had assumed only a limited impact from the crisis, which is now grounding airline fleets and seizing up economies worldwide.
""We want to limit cash outflows that are not strictly necessary...to contain the economic and industrial impact on the group as much as possible,"" Thales Chief Executive Patrice Caine told reporters.
Thales said it had also signed a new 2-billion-euro credit facility that can be used over the next 12 months, with the option to extend it by another 6 months.
At the end of last year, Thales had 2.9 billion euros in cash or cash equivalents and an undrawn revolving credit facility worth 1.5 billion euros, expiring in December 2021.
Chief Financial Officer Pascal Bouchiat said the resulting available liquidity of 6.4 billion euros ""allows us to build a liquidity reserve that is totally sufficient"".
The new credit line, arranged and underwritten by  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), is not backed by guarantees offered by the French state to help companies through the crisis, he added.
Airlines worldwide have grounded the bulk of their fleets to cope with a slump in demand and travel restrictions designed to contain the coronavirus outbreak.
Thales says 21% of its annual revenues come from commercial aerospace activities such as air traffic management, with the rest coming from defence, government agencies and private infrastructure.
Caine declined to comment in detail on reported disruption in the French aerospace supply chain, but said that Thales' operations in Singapore and Australia were running almost normally.
Industry executives have said up to half of small French aerospace suppliers have halted production at some point since the government imposed a lockdown to slow the spread of coronavirus in mid-March, but that work is gradually resuming.
""Today I have the impression that the supply chain, like Thales, is in a recovery phase,"" said Caine.

Ucar, in which Lu is chairman and CEO, said in a statement late on Monday that the company applied to halt trading in its shares to avoid abnormal price fluctuations and protect investor interest amid media reports on the company.
Chinese media reports have linked the firm with Luckin, which said last week an internal investigation revealed sales fabrication of about 2.2 billion yuan ($310.80 million).
Ucar said its shares will halt trading on China's New Third Board equity market for as long as a month and will resume trading no later than May 6.
On Friday, the National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), operator of the New Third Board, sent a letter to Ucar, asking it to spell out the impact of the Luckin probe on the company.
NEEQ asked the company to explain whether the alleged fraud at Luckin could result in Lu being sued or have his stakes frozen. Ucar was also asked to spell out measures it plans to take to mitigate the risks from the Luckin probe. Lu controls roughly 10% of Ucar. 
In addition, the regulator queried Ucar over details of its acquisition of a 67% stake in Beijing Borgward Automobile Co.
Shares of CAR Inc (HK:0699), in which Ucar owns a substantial stake and of which too Lu is chairman, rallied on Tuesday morning after the Hong Kong-listed company said it does not hold a stake in nor has any business dealings with Luckin Coffee.

1364,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 12:45AM ET</span>",China’s big developers shrug off short-term virus impact to splurge on land,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's top developers are prising open their war chests to snap up land this year as local governments sell more prime real estate to boost revenues and smaller, distressed property firms look to offload assets as the coronavirus takes a toll.
Many of the country's major property companies said at recent earnings conferences that they planned to ramp up spending thanks to a faster-than-expected sales recovery in the first quarter and more abundant liquidity.
Others said they would maintain purchasing levels on a par with last year as they were confident demand for housing will remain intact in the long run.
China's property market ground to a halt earlier this year as the virus outbreak escalated and authorities imposed tough curbs on travel and movement, shutting down crowded places such as property showrooms.
But restrictions have been eased in many parts of the country in recent weeks, and the latest data from researcher CRIC shows sales of the top 100 developers in March surged 136% from February, narrowing the first-quarter decline to 21% compared with a year earlier.
Developers said they expected sales to normalize in April, following an 80-90% recovery in March.
A spate of government economic support measures and increased liquidity will provide some boost to property sales,
Hui Ka Yan, chairman of China  Evergrande  (HK:3333), the third- largest developer by sales, said last week.
The optimism underscores the increasing polarization in China's real estate market, where analyst forecasts of a single digit drop in national home sales this year is expected to see many smaller developers collapse.
In a note of caution, analysts said that given the land market lags the home market, developers would need to slow their investment if home sales decline at a faster pace.
""The industry downtrend is unchanged,"" said Larry Hu, head of China Economics at Macquarie.
""Despite the strong rebound in March sales, Q1 was still a big drop so I think the full-year sales will be weak, and that may lead to a drop in home prices. I'm more prudent on the property industry.""
UPBEAT OUTLOOK
Bigger property companies usually focus their developments in major cities where housing demand is stronger.
Many developers still posted double-digit sales and profit growth last year despite a sputtering economy.
Evergrande's Hui forecasts stable transaction volumes for this year, a more optimistic view than analysts.
Despite concerns over the shock from the coronavirus to consumers, some of the larger developers said it would only have a short-term effect and would not derail long-term housing demand.
Undeterred, they have set more or less the same sales targets as last year, in some cases even higher.
Evergrande aims to sell 30% more homes totalling 800 billion yuan ($112.82 billion), while Shimao Property targets 15% more at 300 billion yuan.  
Country Garden, the country's largest developer by sales, purchased more land in the first quarter than a year ago.
""We saw more good-quality land opportunities and M&A opportunities,"" company executive vice president Cheng Guangyu said at an earnings conference.
Both Country Garden and Shimao said they would spend at least the same amount on land as last year, as they have adequate cash.
Loosening of policies, including cutting interest and tax rates, have allowed developers to pay less of a deposit over a longer instalment period and helped to boost the land market. More stimulus is expected in the second quarter, according to analysts.
The outlook for more ample liquidity has already driven up land prices in major cities.
CRIC said while 20% of the top 100 developers bought no land in the first three months, reflecting cautious sentiment, land transaction volumes had gradually recovered, with some sales in first and second-tier cities recording premiums of more than 40%.
Another major real estate researcher, CREIS, said the average land floor price sold during the period was up 33% in tier-one cities, while flat and 7% in tier-two and three cities, respectively.
Because of the high land prices, some developers said they would be more prudent in public auctions and opt instead to build their land bank through acquiring smaller companies.
""We think 2020 will see a big wave of M&As,"" said Evergrande CEO Xia Haijun, who forecast the market share of the top three developers will increase from 12.6% in 2019 to over 20% in the next three to five years.

1365,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 12:25AM ET</span>","Toshiba should sell stake in ex-chip unit at IPO, says HK activist fund in letter","By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - A Hong Kong-based activist investor in Toshiba Corp (T:6502) has asked the Japanese conglomerate to sell its entire stake in Kioxia Holdings when the flash memory chip firm is listed in an IPO that could raise up to $32 billion, according to a letter reviewed by Reuters.
Argyle Street Management Ltd, a hedge fund with over $1.5 billion under management, sent the letter to CEO Nobuaki Kurumatani in late March urging the company to sell its 40% stake and distribute proceeds back to shareholders.
The initial public offering of Kioxia, the world's second-largest flash memory chip maker, could be Japan's biggest listing this year, sources have said.
Market valuation could reach $32 billion, domestic media reports have estimated. However, the coronavirus outbreak has created uncertainty over the timing of the IPO and valuation of the shares, given that the market for flash memory chips, used in smartphones and data storage servers, is highly volatile.
When contacted by Reuters, Toshiba said nothing has been decided. A Kioxia spokesman said the company was not in a position to comment on what Toshiba planned to do.
Toshiba sold its flash memory chips unit to a consortium led by U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital for $18 billion in 2018 to plug a huge financial hole left by the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear business.
The deal saw Toshiba reinvest in the unit and together with optical products maker Hoya Corp (T:7741), Japanese firms took more than 50% - a keen wish of the Japanese government, sources had said at the time.
Toshiba has explained to Argyle that one of the reasons for the reinvestment was the requirement by Japanese regulators for a significant portion of Kioxia shares to be held by domestic parties, according to the letter.
But this aspect should not be a factor in Toshiba's decision whether to divest or not, the letter argued. ""Doing otherwise would unnecessarily penalise shareholders.""
A source familier with the matter said Toshiba has tacit understanding with the government that it should not sell down the stake until an IPO, but has no such restrictions after the listing.
The fund also said Toshiba has ""substantial headroom"" for 400 billion yen ($3.7 billion) in share buybacks, on top of the 700 billion yen repurchase completed late last year, citing gains from the Kioxia stake sale and others as potential sources.
Toshiba has been facing pressure from activist funds agitating for changes since the company sold 600 billion yen of stock to dozens of foreign hedge funds in late 2017. Nearly 70% of its shareholders are non-Japanese.
Bowing to the pressure, the 144-year-old comapny last year overhauled its board to include non-Japanese directors for the first time in 80 years.

OSLO (Reuters) - The sharp rise in trading volumes during closing auctions at global stock markets requires more innovation by brokers to capture value for buy-side investors, one of the world's largest asset managers said on Tuesday.
Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), which runs Norway's $950 billion sovereign wealth fund, said the growing popularity of end-of-trade auctions reflects deep structural changes, including that more money is managed by bigger firms.
Gradually introduced by major stock markets since the late 1990s, auctions held in the final minutes of trade were initially seen as an efficient, hard-to-manipulate way to establish end-of-day prices.
The percentage of daily trade taking place in those final minutes roughly doubled between 2014 and 2019 in both Europe and the United States however, NBIM's calculations show, turning them into major trading opportunities with ample liquidity.
""The shift in volume from intraday, continuous trading to the closing auction in recent years is structural in nature and goes beyond the often-cited growth in 'passive' investing,"" the influential investor wrote in a rare comment on the industry.
London's FTSE100 is leading the way and now nearing 30% of daily share volumes traded in the closing auction, followed by France's CAC40 and Germany's DAX in the low-to-mid 20s, while the U.S. S&P500 last year hit 9%, up from 5% in 2014, NBIM said.
But the changing investor habits require, in turn, different approaches by brokerage firms, who must tailor algorithms not only to a different way of trading but also to the individual auction processes of each market, the fund added.
""As a client, we are focusing on several potential differentiators in broker offerings,"" NBIM said, while emphasising that this also offers a business opportunity to smaller sell-side industry players.
""We believe that further development work by brokers is required, both in the forecasting of auction volume and in order submission and signalling strategies – designing opportunistic trading strategies that evaluate the evolution of available liquidity at the close,"" NBIM said.
While the recent plunge in global stocks also caused a sharp rise in volatility, it did not change the conclusions.
""(The) recent crisis has not affected our view – in fact we have seen resilience of financial markets so far across various trading mechanisms, and in the closing auction,"" the fund manager said.
""Closing auctions have remained a major part of the trading day in percent terms even during the highest-volume days,"" it added.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) worker employed in Kentucky died over the weekend from a COVID-19 infection, Gov. Andy Beshear said at a public health briefing on Monday. 
UPS separately said that a ""valued member of our management team"" at its Worldport global shipping hub in Louisville, Kentucky, had died. UPS declined to give the man's cause of death, citing medical privacy laws. 
UPS employs roughly 20,000 workers in the Louisville area - mainly at Worldport, which is central to the U.S. government's effort to rush in medical supplies for healthcare workers. 
Worldport employees told Reuters and Louisville television station WDRB, which was first to confirm the Worldport death, that they believed the supervisor who died on Saturday had contracted COVID-19. 
Employees, who declined to be named for fear of retribution, told Reuters that UPS is not disclosing how many of their co-workers have fallen ill after being exposed to the novel coronavirus that has killed more than 10,000 people in the United States. 
Other large employers - including GE Appliance, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co - have briefed workers on COVID-19 cases in their facilities without revealing the names of affected individuals.
Atlanta-based UPS last week said it is working with President Donald Trump's Coronavirus Taskforce, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and state agencies to distribute test kits, protective equipment like N95 masks, and medical devices such as respirators.
FEMA is using UPS's 5.2 million-square-foot Worldport facility for temporary staging of shipments from overseas as part of a public-private partnership that the Trump Administration has named Project Airbridge.
Worldport is UPS' largest air hub - with more than 300 inbound and outbound flights daily. The hub processes roughly 2 million packages per day.

LONDON/MILAN/PARIS (Reuters) - With their sales hammered by the coronavirus outbreak, car makers Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot's owner PSA have postponed their shareholder meetings and are looking at ways to boost cash reserves ahead of their planned merger.
The two car makers have turned to their banks to secure much needed cash, and Fiat Chrysler (FCA) is looking at debt guarantees that the Italian government approved on Monday to support local companies, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
FCA, whose legal headquarters is in the Netherlands, runs several plants in Italy and may qualify for the government scheme which offers more than 400 billion euros worth of liquidity and bank loans to companies hit by the pandemic, the source said, cautioning no decision had been made.
A spokesman for FCA declined to comment.
The crisis triggered by the virus has virtually erased demand for new vehicles, pushing automakers to temporarily halt most production.
In late March FCA secured a 3.5 billion euro credit line, with an initial 12-month term that can be extended six months. This added to existing credit facilities worth 7.7 billion euros.
The Italo-American firm, chaired by John Elkann, scion of the Italian Agnelli family, would need to cut its ordinary dividend if it decides to pursue state aid from Italy.
The emergency decree says companies looking to apply for Italy-backed loans must refrain from approving dividend payments for a year.
FCA's decision to postpone the shareholders' meeting to late June has analysts speculating that its ordinary dividend worth 1.1 billion euros could be axed or postponed.
""While the merger process is proceeding, the postponement of the AGM will raise markets' concerns of a potential cancellation of the ordinary dividend,"" said  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) analyst Monica Bosio.
Equita analyst Martino De Ambroggi echoed that the most likely scenario was ""the cancellation or at least the postponement of the ordinary dividend for both FCA and PSA.""
PSA, which proposed a similar 1.1 billion euro dividend, also decided to postpone its annual shareholders' meeting to June 25. But the company is not expected to tap state funding, another source close to the company said.
The French firm, led by Carlos Tavares, said on Monday it had agreed new credit lines worth about 3 billion euros.
It is sitting on undrawn credit facilities worth about 3 billion euros.
SPECIAL DIVIDEND?
FCA shares are down around 45% since late February when the virus started spreading in northern Italy. PSA's stock is down 32%.
In December, they clinched a binding agreement to create the world's fourth-largest carmaker, with shareholders of each group holding 50 percent in the new entity.
As part of the deal, FCA is set to pay a 5.5 billion euro special dividend to its investors. Bankers and analysts have questioned FCA's ability to pay such a windfall.
""It's no longer wise to get rid of so much cash,"" said the first source with knowledge of the matter.
A second source close to the deal said that while both parties were still committed to tying the knot, they needed to see how the crisis evolved before deciding whether to renegotiate merger terms.
Analysts at Jefferies have said the merger is key to the two firms' long term competitiveness but some adjustments are ""inevitable."" They pointed to the special dividend which is expected to be paid in early 2021, just before consummation.
Global carmakers may end up selling between 19 and 24 million fewer cars this year, representing a 22% to 27% fall in global sales, according to a study by Alix Partners.

This means global auto firms would be below break-even, losing more than 100 billion euros in cash flow globally, the study said, adding that for every month of idled production in Europe, car makers would lose 7 billion euros of cash flow.

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC), the largest U.S. mortgage lender, is offering fewer home loan products during the coronavirus-fueled economic downturn, a spokesman said on Monday. The bank has paused many kinds of loans including cash-out refinance loans, most home equity loans above $250,000 and riskier non-conforming purchase loans, according to a memo seen by Reuters and confirmed by the company.
Applications for those loan types were automatically turned down as of Friday.
Underwriting some of those loans has become harder, and Wells Fargo suspended home interior inspections last week after governments across the country urged or mandated social distancing, the spokesman said. Some rivals are working around the problem by doing drive-by appraisals or having customers take pictures of properties with their phones, bank sources said.
The change comes as the coronavirus pandemic has put increased pressure on Wells Fargo's balance sheet which has been capped by regulators since 2018. The U.S. Federal Reserve restricted the bank's balance sheet at 2017 levels until it can prove it has the risk management structures which led to the 2016 sales practices scandal.
Up to now, the bank has been operating with room under its $1.95 trillion dollar cap, but amid tense demand for cash, Wells Fargo has said the cap is preventing it from helping customers and lending more.
The bank is shunning riskier non-conforming loans with downpayments of less than 20% and home equity lines of credit above $500,000, according to the memo. Home equity loans above $250,000 on properties worth more than $1 million or for 2-4 unit properties are being declined.
Wells Fargo is the largest U.S. mortgage lender, originating $201 billion in 2019, according to Inside Mortgage Finance.
""These difficult business decisions reflect efforts to prioritize how we serve customers and maintain prudent balance sheet discipline,"" spokesman Tom Goyda said.
""High-balance conforming loans will be originated only as agency loans and will not be placed on our balance sheet.""
Conventional loans guaranteed by agencies like Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac move quickly off a bank's balance sheet as they are packaged into mortgage securities to be sold to investors. But non-conforming loans with smaller downpayments and large home equity lines of credit are considered riskier and may stay on the bank's books.
The bank has also stopped buying non-conforming loans from third parties and will only accept jumbo refinancing applications from customers with at least $250,000 at the bank, the spokesman said.

(Reuters) - Airbnb said on Monday private equity firms Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners will invest $1 billion in the U.S. home rental company, bolstering its finances at a time when the coronavirus outbreak has roiled the travel and leisure industry.
The investment, which was mixture of debt and equity, raises Airbnb's cash reserves to around $4 billion. The company said it would use the funds primarily to attract more hosts, or homeowners who list their properties for rent on the company's platform.
Silver Lake and Sixth Street were among around 20 investors which approached Airbnb about investing in the company, according to people familiar with the matter. 
""While the current environment is clearly a difficult one for the hospitality industry, the desire to travel and have authentic experiences is fundamental and enduring. Airbnb's diverse, global, and resilient business model is particularly well suited to prosper as the world inevitably recovers and we all get back out to experience it,"" Silver Lake Co-CEO and Managing Partner Egon Durban said in a statement. 
Financial details of the deal were not disclosed. Airbnb lowered its internal valuation by 16% to $26 billion in early March, Reuters reported.
Shares in public competitors such as Marriott International Inc (O:MAR) and Booking Holdings Inc (O:BKNG) have plunged this year 53% and 34% respectively. 
Silver Lake is one of the most high-profile tech investors and has made high-profile bets on the likes of Twitter, Dell Technologies and Waymo, the self-driving unit of Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL).
Sixth Street was founded in 2009 and had over $34 billion in assets under management at the end of 2019 across its different strategies including private equity and private debt. 
In response to travel bans and a surge of requests for cancellations, Airbnb said last week that it was allocating $250 million to help offset losses incurred by hosts.
In March, Reuters reported that the short-term home rental platform held a phone meeting with bankers to discuss extending an existing $1 billion debt facility amid a slowdown in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The company also that $5 million from the Silver Lake and Sixth Street investment will be contributed to a relief fund for hosts in need of financial assistance.
Airbnb also plans to invest in its business for longer-term stays which can be for several months and is targeted at students or employees on extended work assignments. 
The U.S. startup announced last September plans to list its shares and has so far not changed that position.

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) was the financial adviser to Airbnb on the deal.

Investing.com - Wall Street started the week off on a strong note, with a huge jump in the major indexes.
The market rallied on signs that infections in New York and elsewhere are leveling off, although it is still way too early to say anything definitive.
Market moves in the U.K. will be closely watched tomorrow after Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s condition worsened. And investors will be anxious for any more reports on another round of stimulus funding from the U.S. federal government.
And oil prices should see more volatility as quotes from energy producers trickle out ahead of an OPEC+ meeting later in the week.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Pound Will Be Active With Prime Minister in ICU
Sterling will in focus tomorrow as more details of the prime minister’s condition are released.
Johnson was moved to the intensive care unit late Monday and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has been asked by the prime minister to deputize “when necessary”.
The pound had been rising through most of the trading day, bouncing back from oversold levels despite disappointing economic data. But it quickly moved into the red against the U.S. dollar when the report of Johnson moving to intensive care came out.
GBP/USD was flat in late trading.
2. Phase 4 Stimulus by May?
While U.S. stocks were already sharply higher going into the last hour of trading, the bulls got an extra boost right before the close from a report that another stimulus package could come from Capitol Hill.
Another round could come by May and be around $1.5 trillion, Fox Business reported, citing sources briefed by the White House and Congressional leaders.
Any more details from either the administration or legislation could keep the optimism on Wall Street going.


3. API Inventories on Tap as OPEC+ Eyed
Oil prices are laser-focused on the possibility of a global cut in crude production. OPEC+, which includes Russia, is set for a virtual meeting on Thursday that many expect to end with an agreement
The market has been expecting some kind of deal after President Donald Trump tweeted last week that Saudi Arabia and Russia had agreed to cut up to as much as 15 million barrels per day in output. But, as usual, things were not so cut and dry as they sounded in the tweet.
OPEC+ is likely to agree to cut production Thursday as long as the United States joins in cutting output, Reuters reported late Monday, citing three OPEC+ sources.
Between now and Thursday the usual U.S. data will arrive.
The American Petroleum Institute will issue its measure of weekly U.S. oil stockpiles after the bell Tuesday.
Last week the snapshot showed a huge build of more than 10 million barrels."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Monday it would suspend production of its 787 airplane at its facilities in South Carolina amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The announcement came soon after the state's governor issued an order on Monday directing residents to stay home except for essential trips.
Boeing production will be suspended until further notice after the second shift on Wednesday. On Sunday, the largest U.S. planemaker indefinitely extended the halt of its production operations at its Washington state facilities.
On Thursday, Reuters reported that planemakers - including Boeing and Airbus SE (PA:AIR) - were looking at drastic cuts in wide-body production amid a slump in demand for the industry’s largest jetliners, citing manufacturing and supplier sources.
Deliveries of long-range jets like the Boeing 777 or 787 and Airbus A350 or A330 have been hit particularly badly as airlines seek deferrals and many withhold progress payments.
On Monday, Airbus said it would temporarily halt production at its A220/A320 manufacturing facility in Alabama because of ""high inventory levels in the sites and the various government
recommendations.""
Production in Alabama will be halted this week through April 29.
Boeing said on March 23 it would halt production at its Washington state twin-aisle jetliner factory as a temporary measure to help fight the outbreak of the respiratory disease. Production had been expected to resume early this week. 
Boeing said on Sunday about 135 members of its 160,000-person global workforce had tested positive for the coronavirus.
Boeing's airline customers have deferred taking new aircraft and making pre-delivery downpayments, compounding a crisis over the year-old grounding of Boeing's previously fast-selling 737 MAX jet after two fatal crashes. Boeing halted 737 production in January. 
Boeing asked last month for at least $60 billion in U.S. government loan guarantees for itself and other American aerospace manufacturers to help the embattled industry withstand a coronavirus-related cash drain.
Boeing said last week it would suspend operations at its Ridley Township, Pennsylvania, facilities until April 20 because of the outbreak. The site includes manufacturing and production facilities for military rotorcraft, including the H-47 Chinook, V-22 Osprey and MH-139A Grey Wolf.

Boeing said on Monday that during the 787 suspension, it ""will continue to conduct enhanced cleaning activities at the site and monitor the global supply chain as the situation evolves."" Workers who cannot work remotely will receive paid leave for 10 working days of the suspension.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Monday that Cantor Fitzgerald agreed to pay $3.2 million to settle charges it provided inaccurate and incomplete ""blue sheet data"" on securities trading.
The firm admitted to the findings in paying the fine and taking remedial actions, the SEC said.
The top markets watchdog said in its order that staff at the firm ""willfully"" made submissions that contained missing or inaccurate data for approximately 35 million transactions, ""largely due to inadequate processes designed to validate the accuracy of its submissions and undetected coding errors.""
Broker dealers are required to provide the SEC with blue sheet data, which contain trading and account holder information, so the agency can analyze a firm's trading activity. It also helps inform the agency's enforcement and regulatory obligations, including investigations of insider trading.
""The SEC depends on broker-dealers to provide it with complete and accurate trade data,” said Kelly Gibson, who leads the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office.
""When they fail to meet that obligation, it hinders our ability to detect wrongdoing and protect investors.""

The SEC's order also found that Cantor Fitzgerald engaged in remedial efforts to address the cause of its deficient submissions, including the retention of an outside consultant and the adoption of new procedures for processing blue sheet requests.

Network personality Jim Cramer also shared his support for the idea on Twitter, calling for $1 trillion of 30-year bonds paying 2% interest.
This makes little to no sense. For one, the U.S. is obviously already gearing up to issue debt to fund its pandemic relief programs. I wrote last week about how some Wall Street strategists see the Treasury breaking up its sales — the general consensus is that it should flood the market with short-term bills because money-market funds are receiving waves of cash to invest. Moreover, the Treasury already issues 30-year bonds, and Cramer’s suggested rate is significantly higher than the current yield of 1.27%. If the stated goal is to borrow at the lowest cost to taxpayers, this is a losing proposal for the government.
It’s possible that the idea of U.S. war bonds is gaining traction because of talk about “coronabonds” in the European Union. They are not the same. The latter would be a shared debt instrument among all constituent countries, with proceeds directed to the areas most in need. EU leaders have talked about such securities basically since the founding of the currency bloc in 1999, but they’ve been a political hot potato because of the vastly different financial situations of rich countries like Germany compared with those of the comparatively poorer Italy and Spain. 
Another strange part of the intrigue around war bonds is that their traditional economic effects, as demonstrated during World War I and World War II, are exactly what the U.S. doesn’t need or want right now. The idea behind large-scale war bonds, in addition to raising money, is to lock up Americans’ cash in the securities to reduce their consumption and spending. Otherwise, individuals would be competing with the federal government for the same scarce resources, driving up their costs and therefore inflation as well. 
This is not the overriding concern of the U.S. economy. It might seem like forever ago, but remember that in January the Federal Reserve was obsessed with boosting inflation. Certainly no one is worried about runaway price growth at a time when more than 10 million Americans are suddenly unemployed.
On the contrary, the federal government would prefer that citizens have as much disposable income as possible to cover rent payments and other essential bills, plus support small businesses that have had to close in recent weeks.  If anything, as Bloomberg News’s Joe Weisenthal pointed out on Twitter, the most beneficial war bond instrument right now might just be stocking up on gift cards up from various local restaurants and other enterprises to help them survive this shutdown. A Washington, D.C., neighborhood even spearheaded a campaign called “Buy Restaurant Bonds” in an intentional nod to the previous war bond efforts.
Anecdotally, I played a small part in a similar effort to get cash upfront. An Italian restaurant in Brooklyn with a highly regarded wine list opened up its cellar a few weeks ago and sold any and all bottles at half the listed menu price. I bought two — I saw others purchase many, many more. This is the type of “battle” that needs funding in cities and towns nationwide. 
By contrast, it’s very much an open question whether the local restaurateur or business owner would benefit quite as much from a special war-bond program. Cramer’s pitch — “we want this piece of paper” — is more of a nod to financial market investors starved of any safe investments with a decent yield. Needless to say, that shouldn’t be the first priority in this relief effort.
As for Treasuries, one could argue they’ve been helping to fund actual war for the better part of two decades. The U.S. budget deficit reached a record $377 billion in absolute dollar terms 2003, the year the Iraq War began, and then further ballooned to more than $412 billion in 2004. The military has remained an outsized part of the federal government’s spending ever since: The Pentagon’s budget for the next fiscal year is more than $700 billion.
Put it all together, and there’s little incentive to initiate a war bond program other than as maybe a basic pitch to patriotism. A better strategy would be urging Americans to support local businesses as much as they can while having the Treasury continue to borrow in a regular and predictable manner to finance the government’s own relief efforts. Maybe that includes a new 50-year maturity. But war bonds as devised by Kudlow and Cramer are good for absolutely nothing.

Investing.com – The Dow made a bold start to the week on Monday, racking up a more than a 1,600 point gain as traders cheered signs that measures to curb the Covid-19 pandemic in hard-hit areas like New York and New Jersey were taking shape.
The Dow rose 7.73%, or 1,627.46 points. The S&P 500 gained 7.03% and the Nasdaq Composite surged 7.33%.
The rate of daily new infections and fatalities in New York had held relatively flat for a second-straight day, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Monday.
New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, meanwhile, also echoed optimism, saying his state is beginning to flatten its coronavirus curve, with the pace of new daily cases slowing to about 12% from 24% seen March 30.
Both Cuomo and Murphy, however, stressed that the batted against the Covid-19 was not over. Other parts of the country, including Boston, Detroit, New Orleans, and Philadelphia, are set for an increase in coronavirus infections, which has killed nearly 11,000 in the U.S.
Late buying in stocks was also prompted by a Fox Business report just before the closing bell that said another government stimulus package was in the works to the tune of about $1.5 trillion.
Slowing infections in Italy and Spain also added to hopes that a peak in Covid-19 cases is on the horizon and supported a strong bid in cruise lines stocks, with  Royal Caribbean  Cruises (NYSE:RCL) closing up 21%, Carnival (NYSE:CCL) up 20% and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NYSE:NCLH) up 18%.
Technology led the broader rally on Wall Street, as investors piled into FANG names and chip stocks.
Energy, meanwhile, rose 5.1% even as oil prices tumbled 8% amid uncertainty over whether OPEC and its allies will agree to cut production."

It remains unclear whether a decision will be reached about closing down Germanwings, the sources said. 
A Lufthansa spokesman said no decisions had been taken and reiterated that all options were being considered as it reviews its business and ways to cut costs to mitigate the loss of business caused by the coronavirus crisis.
German unions appealed on Monday for the airline's management to support Germanwings after Lufthansa last week rejected a union proposal to implement shortened work hours, also known as Kurzarbeit, which would have saved jobs in the short term.
Trade unions and associations VC, UFO, Verdi, IGL/TGL and ACA made a joint appeal on Monday to help safeguard Germanwings jobs.

Markus Wahl, president of Vereinigung Cockpit, said: ""Great efforts will be necessary to overcome this crisis. We as trade unions in the Lufthansa Group offer our support for solutions that can be supported by all employees.""

1380,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>",U.S. life insurers' results seen as test against lengthy coronavirus volatility,"By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - U.S. life insurers' financial results will offer a glimpse into how well their investment portfolios will withstand volatile markets and prolonged low interest rates as the coronavirus crisis rolls on, analysts and industry sources said.
First quarter results, which insurers begin reporting later in April, will test strategies and investment products, such as types of derivatives contracts, that insurers use to protect against risk in volatile markets, said S&P analyst Deep Banerjee.
""This is a good checkpoint to see if the protection that insurers have bought from themselves is working or not,"" Banerjee said.
The industry has been taking on increasingly risky investments such as corporate bonds, hedge funds and hard assets like real estate for over a decade to offset low interest rates.
But during the coronavirus rout, the riskiest investments have taken the biggest haircuts.
For example, Bridgewater Associates LP, the RayDalio-led hedge fund firm famous for making money during the2008 financial crisis, posted double-digit losses as of March 18 amid sharp market declines sparked by the coronavirusoutbreak.
But the performance of even some of the most challenged industries is better than life insurers. The S&P Life & Health Insurance index <.SPLRCLIFE> is down roughly 43% since the market high on Feb. 19 as of Monday afternoon, compared with a near 22% decline for the S&P 500 (SPX).
First-quarter results could also reflect a sales slump, adding to concerns about falling asset values and low rates, analysts said.
People buy fewer life-insurance products during a recession, plus working from home presents roadblocks for salespeople.
""There is less office time and less time to build your pipeline,"" said Piper Sandler analyst John Barnidge.
Analysts have been lowering their estimates for the industry.
Quarterly estimates for MetLife Inc (N:MET) and Prudential Financial Inc (N:PRU) are down on average 6%, according to Refinitiv data.
But Wall Street's overall predictions do not reflect the full impact of the coronavirus because some analysts have not yet updated their models.
""There could be surprises,"" said Banerjee, noting that they would likely lead to lower results, not higher.
All kinds of companies across the United States are facing coronavirus issues, as the government has told people to stay home, limited travel and required certain businesses to close. [https://tmsnrt.rs/2R7wWYX]
The profit pressure life insurers are facing is nothing compared to what those at the center of the coronavirus pandemic are suffering, but it represents an unusual slice of corporate America.
One might think a life insurer's biggest challenge at this time would be that as many as 240,000 Americans might die from the coronavirus, according to a White House task force projection, leading to elevated claims.
But the industry's $4.2 trillion invested in markets that have gone haywire has become a more pressing concern, said Howard Mills, an independent senior adviser for Deloitte.
Insurers will not have problems paying claims, as horrible as the pandemic is, because of significant cash that regulators make them set aside, said Mills.
But investment returns are at the heart of insurers' profits. ""Zero percent interest rates are seriously compounding the challenge and will hit the bottom line directly,"" Mills said.

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - RavnAir Group, the largest regional carrier in Alaska, filed for bankruptcy on Sunday and grounded all of its 72 planes, saying it was clear that government aid would not arrive before it ran out of cash in the midst of an ""astonishing"" decline in bookings and revenue due to the coronavirus.
Its Chapter 11 filing underscores the challenges facing other U.S. regional carriers that, like larger airlines, are seeking federal aid to help them through the worst downturn the industry has ever faced. 
RavnAir - which has a partnership with Alaska Airlines and interline agreements with American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines and Delta - said it applied on Friday for federal payroll support but did not know if or when it would be granted. 
The Trump administration is weighing applications from numerous airlines as it considers how to distribute as soon as this week up to $32 billion for passenger and cargo carriers and airport contractors under the CARES Act meant to help the sector cover payroll costs.
Regional airlines, which tend to serve remote communities, are particularly vulnerable to the downturn because they are not publicly traded and cannot access capital markets. They have asked the U.S. Treasury Department to prioritize assistance for them when awarding the grants.
Many of RavnAir's customers fly on Medicaid-subsidized tickets, it said, while other key customers include companies in industries like oil & gas, mining, and tourism where business is suffering. In addition, by mid-March it was receiving demands from rural hubs and villages around Alaska not to fly passengers to or from their communities, it said in a court filing.
The tale of RavnAir reflects airlines' woes across the country that began seeing a dramatic drop in bookings around March 12 when it became clear that coronavirus outbreaks were increasing across the world.
RavnAir said it had laid off almost all of its workforce and suspended operations before filing for Chapter 11 in Delaware on Sunday, but hopes to be able to restart on the other side of bankruptcy, particularly if it receives government relief.
In a letter posted Sunday, RavnAir Chief Executive Dave Pflieger said the airline was working to ""resume the vital air service you depend on to get home to your families, to your businesses, to medical appointments, and to other duties that are essential to our communities and the state of Alaska.""

On Sunday, top Democrats urged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to move quickly to release the grants without imposing unreasonable conditions.

Europe's leading planemaker said in a statement it would pause production and assembly at its German sites in Bremen and Stade and at its A220/A320 manufacturing facility in Mobile, Alabama.
These measures come on top of production pauses in France, Spain and in the UK.
The Lower-Saxony based Stade factory makes vertical tails for most Airbus aircraft and other parts for the A350 while the Bremen site adds parts to UK-built wings and makes flaps for most Airbus aircraft.
Airbus faces shortages in its own supply chains it struggles to bring production back up to previous levels after pausing activity in several factories. 

Airbus last month suspended its near-term 2020 delivery guidance due to the coronavirus crisis.

Investing.com - Tesla accelerated higher on Monday as Wall Street talked up the electric automaker's potential to grow sales by more than a quarter despite expressing concerns the coronavirus pandemic will hurt its output at its factories in both the U.S. and China and delay its Berlin factory launch.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rallied 6%.
Jefferies upgraded Tesla to buy from hold, but cut its target price on the stock to $650 from $800, estimating that the company would likely grow sales by 27% this year, despite its U.S. car factory grinding to a halt amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
Jefferies said it expected production to be almost zero for four to six weeks and run 50% below normal levels for three months. The brokerage firm also sees a virus-led impact over the longer term, forecasting that Tesla's plans to open its Berlin factory could be delayed by up to six months.
The note comes just days after Tesla reported first-quarter deliveries that not only topped analysts estimates, but also represented the ""best ever"" first quarter of production.
Tesla said it had delivered about 88,400 in the first quarter of 2020, markedly up from 63,000 vehicles delivered a year earlier and above analysts' expectations for 79,908."

The stock had surged to a record high in March as demand for the app skyrocketed with millions of people around the world using it for everything from school lessons to business meetings amid lockdowns imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
But multiple reports last week that questioned the company's data privacy practices have spooked investors, erasing nearly a third of the company's market value from its record high.
The stock was last down 7.9% at $118.05 on Monday and was the worst performer on the Nasdaq.
Brokerage  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) downgraded Zoom stock to ""underperform"" from ""neutral"". Analysts on average rate the stock ""hold"", according to Refinitiv data.
""While implied new customer growth may seem undemanding compared to recently disclosed 20x participant growth, we expect much of the recent surge will prove ephemeral, and/or comes from free users or education, which are very difficult to monetize,"" Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a note.
Last week, at least two U.S. state attorneys had sought information from Zoom following reports that questioned its privacy and security.
Some school districts in the United States have started to ban the app for online learning from home because of growing security concerns, the Washington Post reported on Saturday.
Reuters also reported last week that Elon Musk's rocket company SpaceX had banned its employees from using Zoom, citing ""significant privacy and security concerns.""
 Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) said on Monday its Teams platform, which competes with Zoom, does not use customer data for ads, and encrypts data to protect against cybersecurity threats.
While analysts believe that many issues with Zoom, especially those originating from user error, are likely to get solved in the short term, others could remain for some time.
""I think it's a legitimate reputational risk,"" DA Davidson analyst Rishi Jaluria said, adding a surge in Zoom's consumer user base could be a challenge as it was originally built to be an enterprise tool. 
Zoom's daily users ballooned to more than 200 million in March from a previous maximum total of 10 million, Chief Executive Officer Eric Yuan said last week.

Microsoft's Teams had 44 million users globally as of March 18, doubling from what it reported in November.

""With New York City numbers getting better on the weekend, people are happy that we may be closer to the top of the peak than we thought.""
Still, U.S. officials have girded the country for a ""peak death week"" from the pandemic, with the death toll topping 10,000.
Wall Street's fear gauge (VIX) fell to its lowest in two weeks, but analysts cautioned against calling a bottom. During the financial crisis of 2007-08, the S&P 500 took months to establish a bottom even after the volatility index plummeted.
Despite Monday's bounce, the S&P 500 (SPX) remains nearly 20% - or $6 trillion in market value - short of its all-time high in mid-February.

Developing-nation shares will return an average of 11% annually in the next decade, more than any other asset class, the Newport Beach, California-based firm said on its website. That’s up from its March forecast of 9%.
Research Affiliates is dialing up a prediction it made in February 2016, when the firm called emerging markets the “trade of a decade.” That proved prescient initially as stocks surged 75% over the following two years. But it’s been bumpier ever since, with the U.S.-China trade war and now the pandemic and oil-price war reducing risk appetite. MSCI’s emerging-market equity index has tumbled 23% this year amid big sell-offs from Brazil to India and Poland.
“Many companies will go bust, dividends will be slashed, many investment-grade bonds will morph into junk, foreign borrowers may default on their dollar-denominated debt and so forth,” Jim Masturzo, the firm’s head of asset allocation, wrote in a report. Yet surviving companies “will face less competition and a clearer runway to take off in the aftermath of the crisis.”
Despite the bullish long-term outlook, Masturzo flagged several potential concerns in the coming months:

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets remained sharply higher in midday trading Monday after data over the weekend suggested that the Coronavirus epidemic in Europe may be peaking, and that the same may be true in at least some of the U.S.'s hotspots soon.
By 12:15 PM ET (1615 GMT),. the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1138 points, or 5.4%, its highest in nearly a week. The S&P 500 was up 5.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 5.3%
The news followed announcements at the weekend that daily deaths from the Covid-19 virus had fallen in Spain and Italy, the two worst-affected countries in Europe. 
While U.S. data are harder to interpret and point mainly to a higher death toll in the next few days, President Donald Trump reiterated his upbeat belief that a turnaround is in sight, tweeting ""LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL!"" 
Among the biggest gainers was JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock, which rose 6% as CEO Jamie Dimon downplayed the risk of suspending the bank's dividend, even though he admitted that a ""bad recession"" is coming to the U.S. that may leave the bank sitting on heavy credit losses.
The DJIA was also lifted by a 11.1% increase in index heavyweight Boeing (NYSE:BA), which had extended the shutdown of its key Seattle production facilities indefinitely at the weekend.
Slack Technologies  (NYSE:WORK) reversed earlier losses, up 4%, after the messaging app filed plans to raise $600 million through convertible debt due in 2025. The notes would be the company's first long-term debt. Slack is still to turn a profit.
Oil and gas stocks were mixed as U.S. crude futures lost some of their stellar gains on Friday due to fears that the production cut promised by President Trump may not materialize. Trump's meetings with U.S. oil bosses at the weekend resulted in only threats of tariffs against foreign oil, rather than any sign of a cut in U.S. output that Russia and Saudi Arabia are looking for. 
Occidental Petroleum  (NYSE:OXY) rose 0.8%, while Apache  (NYSE:APA) stock was up 5.8%. Continental Resources  (NYSE:CLR) rose 0.3% and Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock was up 2.4%."

HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Luckin Coffee  (O:LK) Chairman Charles Zhengyao Lu and Chief Executive Jenny Zhiya Qian have handed over shares in the embattled Chinese coffee chain to lenders after a company controlled by Lu's family defaulted on a $518 million margin loan, one of the banks said on Monday.
The default comes after Luckin, a major rival to Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) in China, said last week that much of its 2019 sales were fabricated, sending its shares plunging as much as 82% in U.S. trading and sparking an investigation by China's securities regulator.
Some 515,355,752 class B shares and 95,445,000 class A shares of Luckin had been pledged to secure the loan, including shares additionally pledged by the family trust of Qian,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), one of the banks on the loan, said in a note to clients on Monday proposing a sale of the shares.
Luckin declined to comment. Lu Zhengyao did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It was not possible to contact Qian directly. 
If all the shares pledged under the $518 million loan are sold, Lu Zhengyao's voting interest in Luckin Coffee would not decrease, while Qian's beneficial and voting interests would decrease significantly, Goldman Sachs said, without quantifying the size of the reduction. 
The class B shares will be converted into American Depositary Shares (ADSs).
Luckin shares were down a further 13.8% in early trading in New York on Monday.

1399,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 06, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",Virus Peril May Make April Cruelest Month for Emerging Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- Emerging markets are about to find out just how much rougher April will be for them than developed economies.
The signals are in the price swings anticipated by traders.
The gap between a JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. gauge of expected swings in developing-nation currencies and a similar Group-of-Seven measure is the widest since June, after evaporating in March. Likewise, the spread between the Cboe Emerging Markets Volatility Index and the VIX gauge for U.S. stocks has grown to 1.4 percentage points from a discount of as much as 10 basis points last month.
Indeed, the Mexican peso had a torrid morning in Asia on Monday despite U.S. equity futures climbing. An economic plan unveiled on Sunday by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to counter the coronavirus fallout was “underwhelming,” said Alberto Ramos, chief Latin America economist at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). Mexican authorities “seem to be underestimating the economic impact of the viral pandemic and the need for a deeper re-orientation of fiscal policy,” Ramos said.
Oil’s newfound vigor also hangs in the balance as a row between Saudi Arabia and Russia threatens to scupper a possible deal among global producers to curb supply. The lack of such an accord would hit the world’s two largest crude exporters and other energy-dependent economies including Mexico, Colombia, Nigeria and Angola. Brent crude fell 2.5% to $33.25 a barrel at 12:15 p.m. in London.
Developing-nation central banks, meanwhile, have already used up much of the monetary arsenal needed to support their currencies and economies in the face of the virus. With interest rates in emerging economies at multi-year lows -- and near zero in the case of nations such as South Korea and Israel -- the carry returns that attract foreign funds are diminishing.
“Uncertainty around both the supply-side and demand-side for oil should continue to effect volatility,” said Marshall Stocker, a money manager at  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance Corp. in Boston, which oversees about $520 billion of assets. “Policy adventurism can be expected at the country level as there is no history from which to identify an orthodox policy response. Therefore there will be health, fiscal, and monetary-policy mistakes and achievements made this coming and in future weeks.”
Government spending pledges in some emerging markets dwarf what’s ever come before. Even so, they pale in comparison with the trillions of dollars promised in Europe and America. That discrepancy threatens to set the asset class back and is partly to blame for the record $83 billion sucked out of developing-nation stocks and bonds in March alone.

Several retailers, including Capri, have already closed their stores in the United States and Europe amid lockdowns to curb the spread of the virus that has killed about 68,000 people globally.
The company's shares, which have lost more than three-quarters of their value this year, rose nearly 25% on Monday as broader markets rallied amid hopes that the pandemic was slowing down in some of the hardest-hit regions.
Capri, which had a total of about 17,800 employees at the end of fiscal 2019, said furloughed employees were eligible for unemployment insurance and other government relief programs. It added it would need a smaller workforce once the pandemic ends.
""Given our size and scale, we believe that Capri is well-positioned to continue to operate its business despite this unprecedented situation,"" Chief Executive Officer John Idol said.
The board's annual cash compensation will be slashed by 50% and several executives including Idol, designers and Chief Creative Officers Michael Kors and Donatella Versace will forgo their salary for fiscal 2021, Capri said.
The company said it will also look for ways to reduce overall salaries at various levels by about 20% to preserve its cash flows. 

As of April 1, 2020, Capri had total cash and cash equivalents of about $900 million. It has fully drawn $300 million of availability under a revolving credit facility.

The EU will apply tariffs of 20.0-99.7% from Tuesday for the next five years, the higher rate applying to Jushi Group Co. Ltd and Zhejiang Hengshi Fiberglass Fabrics Co. Ltd in China and the lower rate to their operations in Egypt, the EU official journal said on Monday.
The European Commission, which conducted the investigation, found the market share of the producers in China and Egypt rose to 31% in 2018 from 23% in 2015, while their average sales price fell by 14%. 
It took input prices and labour costs in Turkey as a guide to establishing a normal price for glass fibre, which has a wide range of applications, such as in wind turbine blades, boats, trucks and sports equipment. 
EU producers include Belgium's European Owens Corning Fiberglas, France's Chomarat Textiles Industries, Germany's Saertex and Finland's Ahlstrom-Munkzjo Glassfibre (HE:AHM1).
A parallel case is also looking into whether the companies in China and Egypt received subsidies, the EU's first look into whether Chinese aid is unfairly helping a foreign Chinese subsidiary. It normally looks only at subsidies from the host government. That case is set to conclude in June.
A further two cases, regarding glass fibre reinforcements, centre on Egypt and Bahrain. The Commission will also investigate alleged unfair subsidies received by Chinese producer Jushi in Egypt.

It set provisional duties of 8.7% in that case. Final findings are due in July.

(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co's top boss, Jamie Dimon (N:JPM), on Monday said he sees a ""bad recession"" in 2020, and that the largest U.S. bank could suspend its dividend if the coronavirus crisis deepens.
Dimon, widely regarded as the face of the U.S. banking sector, is the most prominent voice on Wall Street so far to project that the economic cost of the coronavirus will not evaporate quickly, and said the bank's earnings will be down ""meaningfully in 2020.""
But, Dimon said, even in the worst case scenario, the bank is strong and will continue lending to customers and will not need any relief from the federal government. 
JPMorgan's stock was up 5% to $84.05 in morning trading.
JPMorgan could look at suspending dividends if gross domestic product were to fall by as much as 35% in the second quarter and the unemployment rate were to rise further to 14% in the fourth quarter of the year, the chief executive officer wrote in his annual letter to shareholders. 
Questions are mounting about whether big U.S. banks will have to cut dividends later this year as the coronavirus crisis puts a record portion of Americans out of work, making it difficult for borrowers to pay back loans.
""If the board suspended the dividend, it would be out of extreme prudence and based upon continued uncertainty over what the next few years will bring,"" Dimon said. 
Dimon highlighted some challenges seen at the bank's call centers, where a handful of staff have fallen ill, customer call volumes are at record highs and local restrictions have effectively shuttered some offices.
For customers hurt by the crisis, the bank is offering a 90-day grace period to make mortgage and auto loan payments, removing minimum payment requirements on credit cards, and waiving any late fees for those types of accounts, according to the letter.
Dimon also said that the vast majority of the bank's 16,850 ATMs were ""well-stocked and still functioning"" to provide cash for customers. 
RELIEF MEASURES
The bank said it had extended about $950 million in new loans to small businesses over the last 60 days and would still extend credit to small businesses. 
""In both our central case scenario for 2020 results and in our extremely adverse scenario, we are lending – currently or plan to do so – an additional $150 billion for our clients' needs,"" Dimon said.
Even with that lending, Dimon wrote JPMorgan currently has over $500 billion in total liquid assets and $300 billion in incremental borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Banks.
Dimon did not pass up the opportunity to suggest regulatory and fiscal policy reform, as he has often done in past annual letters. 
""After the crisis subsides (and it will), our country should thoroughly review all aspects of our preparedness and response. And we should use the opportunity to closely review the economic response and determine whether any additional regulatory changes are warranted to improve our financial and economic system. There will be a time and place for that – but not now.""

JPMorgan will also nominate former International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM) CEO Virginia ""Ginni"" Rometty for election to its board. Rometty will become the executive chairman of  IBM  on April 6.

(Reuters) - Oilfield services firm Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) on Monday was cutting about 350 employees in Oklahoma, according to a filing with the state, amid a deepening oil bust from the spread of coronavirus and a price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia. 
Staff cuts could begin this week at its Duncan, Oklahoma facility, the filing said, and will be permanent. The facility is expected to remain open. 
Energy companies have slashed spending since oil prices this year crashed more than 60%, taking prices below $30 a barrel, less than the cost of production. Halliburton last month said it would furlough 3,500 workers in Houston to cope with lower prices. 
""This was a difficult decision, but is necessary action as we face challenging market conditions,"" spokeswoman Emily Mir said in a email.
U.S. crude futures were trading at $27.29 a barrel on Monday morning, down about 3.8% after OPEC+ members delayed a meeting on output cuts.

Denver, Colorado-based hydraulic fracturing firm Liberty Oilfield Services also announced workforce reductions in the past week. Liberty said it will cut 204 workers in North Dakota, on top of the 183 it was cutting in Colorado. Shares of Halliburton were up 2.2% to $7.74. They are down 68% year-to-date.

(Reuters) -  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) said on Monday its app will list job openings in the delivery, food production and grocery industry that its U.S. drivers can access during a slump in ride-hailing demand due to the coronavirus.
Beginning on Monday, drivers can find job listings of other companies in a new section of their app, Uber said in a blog post https://www.uber.com/blog/work-hub.
Uber also said it would reach out to the more than 240,000 of its registered drivers holding commercial licenses to connect them to logistics companies for employment and contract opportunities.
It also encouraged drivers to sign up for its Uber Eats food delivery service, saying restaurant orders have seen a significant increase since mid-March.
Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement the company will keep expanding economic opportunities in coming months by using technology to create fast and flexible access to work.
The company said that while the new offer was so far limited to the United States, it was part of a global effort, but did not provide further details.
Uber said it would post openings by more than a dozen companies, including McDonald's Corp (N:MCD), FedEx Corp (N:FDX),  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS),  Pepsico  Inc (O:PEP),  Hertz Global Holdings Inc  (N:HTZ), drug store and pharmacy chain Walgreens (O:WBA) and U.S. grocery stores.
The company said it has also partnered with Domino's Pizza Inc (N:DPZ),  Target  Corp's (N:TGT) delivery service Shipt and online care matching site CareGuide to hire Uber drivers.
An Uber spokesman on Monday said the company was not receiving paid commissions from companies whose jobs it lists.
Drivers in Chicago, Dallas and Miami would also be connected to work in food production, warehouse and customer services through the company's Uber Works program, a platform launched in October to help companies fill staffing gaps during peak demand with temporary workers.
Ride-hailing has suffered a near-total collapse as large parts of the United States shut down to combat the spread of the highly infectious virus.
Drivers talking to Reuters said their income has dropped by as much as 80% and many said they had stopped driving altogether over fears of getting infected.

The crisis has also exposed the vulnerability of gig workers hired as independent contractors. While on-demand workers were included in a recent U.S. stimulus bill to receive unemployment pay they are normally not entitled to, they run into difficulty claiming those benefits.

Vir's shares jumped 35% before the bell, while GSK was up about 1%.
Drugmakers across the globe are rushing to develop a treatment or vaccine for the fast-spreading coronavirus that has killed over 68,400 people globally. There are currently no approved treatments for the disease.
The collaboration will bring Vir's monoclonal antibody platform technology and GSK's expertise in functional genomics under one umbrella.
The companies said initial focus will be to accelerate development of Vir's investigational treatments, VIR-7831 and VIR-7832, and plan to directly start with a mid-stage trial within the next three to five months.
Experts have said it could take 12 to 18 months to develop a coronavirus vaccine.
The equity investment from GSK is priced at $37.73 per Vir share, a 30% premium to the stock's Friday close. 
Vir's shares, trading at $36.50 on Monday, have more than doubled in the year up to Friday's close.
GSK has so far focused on providing adjuvants, efficacy boosters that play a vital role in many vaccines, as part of its efforts to find potential vaccines against the coronavirus.
This is California-based Vir's second partnership with a major drugmaker for the development of a potential coronavirus treatment, having last month signed a letter of intent with Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB).
 Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD) is also testing its drug remdesivir as a potential coronavirus treatment.
Moderna Inc, which started testing its vaccine candidate in people last month, signed deals with the U.S. government in March to produce massive quantities of coronavirus vaccines.

Multi-asset portfolios at Acadian Asset Management have extended a bearish stance on equities and a bullish bet on developed countries’ sovereign bonds. The allocation call is based on quantitative models with inputs like policy stimulus and valuations.
It all belies Wall Street calls for a risk-on rotation with bond yields trading near all-time lows and global stocks reeling from a more than 20% plunge.
“Acting somewhat as a shock absorber is the unprecedented stimulus that global central banks have put in the system,” director Ilya Figelman said on a recent webinar, referring to equities. “However, this stimulus, even though it’s positive, is not enough to offset the negative outlook from credit risks.”
While credit spreads have narrowed from their peaks in late March, the riskiest U.S. debt is still trading about 9 percentage points over Treasuries, levels unseen since the global financial crisis.
As the economic shutdown sparks a plunge in corporate revenues and a rise in bankruptcies, the outlook for profits and shareholder payouts is darkening. Stocks with weak balance sheets have plunged toward the lowest versus the opposite cohort since 2009,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). baskets show.
Low inflation and strong momentum are also driving the firm’s bullish stance on government bonds, says portfolio manager Clifton Hill. The firm prefers U.S., Swiss and Japanese bonds, with American Treasuries in a good position as the strong dollar keeps price growth at bay and allows room for further monetary easing.
The multi-asset team is also sticking to hedges via longer-dated stock options. It’s down on gold as a collapse in inflation expectations pushes up real yields, according to the webinar.

1411,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2020 09:16AM ET</span>",Fear gauges signal calmer trade as coronavirus deaths slow,"LONDON (Reuters) - Major stock and currency fear gauges steadily declined over the last week from 2008 levels as a slowdown in the number of coronavirus-related deaths calmed investor nerves and increased appetite for risky assets.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's fear gauge, was at 44.60 points on Monday, well below its March 16 record closing high of 82.69. It was by far the biggest drop yet seen over a fifteen-day period.
For the currencies markets, one-month gauges for implied volatility in the euro and Japanese yen fell to their lowest in a month, a sign that investors no longer expect wild price swings in euro-dollar and dollar-yen for the near future.  
""The drop in vols (volatility) is a combination of the recent actions by global central banks and markets kind of settling down a bit after the recent wild swings,"" Gavin Friend, senior FX strategist at NAB Group based in London, said.
But he said market volatility levels were still very high.
The relative calmness led to global stock markets recouping some of the steep losses incurred during March, although the MSCI World equity index (MIWD00000PUS) is down 26% from record highs hit on Feb. 19.
While the decline in volatility will offer respite to investors, it is too soon to say markets have bottomed out after a 34% plunge from record highs on the S&P 500 (SPX). 
During the financial crisis of 2007-08, the S&P 500 took months to establish its bottom even after the VIX plummeted.
For emerging markets, the mood was still very nervous. Turkish lira implied volatility gauges jumped to the highest level in a year on Monday after the lira weakened to levels last seen in August 2018.

1413,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 06, 2020 08:54AM ET</span>",Jamie Dimon Sees ‘Bad Recession’ and Echoes of 2008 Crisis Ahead,"(Bloomberg) --
Jamie Dimon said the coronavirus pandemic will lead to a major economic downturn and stress mirroring the meltdown that nearly brought down the U.S. financial system in 2008.
“At a minimum, we assume that it will include a bad recession combined with some kind of financial stress similar to the global financial crisis of 2008,” the chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. said Monday in his annual letter to shareholders. “Our bank cannot be immune to the effects of this kind of stress.”
The 23-page letter, his shortest since 2008, came less than a week after Dimon told staff he’d returned to work after undergoing emergency heart surgery. It was his first public commentary about the coronavirus since the bank’s investor day on Feb. 25. At the time, the outbreak still seemed a distant threat, with fewer than 60 cases in the U.S. and none in New York.
Dimon, the only current CEO who steered a major U.S. bank through the financial crisis, said JPMorgan’s earnings will be “down meaningfully” this year, though the bank is “unlikely” to cut its dividend. Such a move would only result from “extreme prudence,” he said. JPMorgan will give more details on the impact on the bank when it reports first-quarter earnings later this month, he said.
The 64-year-old CEO outlined initiatives his bank is taking to support employees, businesses and the community, but refrained from offering long opinions about public policy that marked previous missives.

He said 180,000, or about 70%, of the firm’s employees are working from home, and the bank is giving payments of $1,000 to those whose jobs don’t allow them to work remotely.
JPMorgan has been waiving fees for some loans, allowing customers to defer payments on mortgages and auto loans, and removing minimum payment requirements on credit cards. It’s also extended $950 million in new loans to small businesses over the past 60 days, and is planning to lend an additional $150 billion to clients across the world.
Regulatory Review
After the crisis, “we should use the opportunity to closely review the economic response and determine whether any additional regulatory changes are warranted to improve our financial and economic system,” Dimon wrote. “There will be a time and place for that -- but not now.”
Dimon has become a spokesman for Wall Street thanks to his frequent public appearances, outspoken nature and nearly 15-year tenure at the biggest and most profitable bank in America. His absence while he recovered from surgery was felt across the industry as policy makers grappled with dire warnings about the economic effects of the pandemic and governments stepped up efforts to keep millions of people at home to stem the spread of the highly contagious virus.
Dimon was more pessimistic about prospects for the economy than some industry figures were when the scale of the crisis was first becoming clear. A month ago, as stock markets were sliding, former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in a tweet to “expect quick recovery when health threat recedes.” He said the economy “will avoid systemic damage” that takes years to work through.
‘Forever Lost’
Dimon said JPMorgan has been working closely with the government during the crisis, but the bank “will not request any regulatory relief” for itself. Still, regulators could change capital and liquidity requirements to help more capital flow through the system, he said.
“Some rules can improperly prevent healthy, well-capitalized banks from lending freely in times of stress,” Dimon said. “This can hurt customers as the crisis deepens. Leaving high-quality, available liquidity undeployed in times of need is an opportunity forever lost.”
He applauded recent actions by U.S. Department of Treasury and the Federal Reserve, which he said helped mitigate the economic impact of the virus.
Until last year, the annual missives had gradually gotten longer, more than tripling in length since Dimon took over as CEO of JPMorgan at the end of 2005. The CEO writes the letters himself but drafts are reviewed and edited by the bank’s legal, accounting, compliance, public relations and government affairs teams before they’re published.

1415,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2020 07:55AM ET</span>",Total among companies seeking force majeure on EDF contracts: sources,"By Bate Felix
PARIS (Reuters) - Energy major  Total  (PA:TOTF) is among several power suppliers that tried to declare force majeure on buying nuclear power from EDF, sources said, as the coronavirus outbreak has pushed prices in the French electricity market far below existing contracts.
France's energy market regulator CRE said last week it had rejected requests from several unnamed power suppliers to activate the force majeure clause in so-called ARENH contracts which allow them to buy EDF's nuclear power at a fixed price.
The CRE did not say which suppliers declared force majeure, but three sources told Reuters that Total, EDF's (PA:EDF) biggest rival in France's retail power market, led the move.
EDF and Total declined to comment.
A spokesman for Engie (PA:ENGIE), the other major player in the French electricity market, said it had not declared force majeure on its ARENH contract. 
Under the so-called ARENH mechanism set up in 2011 to foster competition, EDF's rivals can buy up to 100 terawatt hours (TWh), or about a quarter of its annual nuclear output, at a fixed price of 42 euros ($46.29) per megawatt hour (MWh).
State-controlled EDF operates France's 58 nuclear reactors that account for around 75% of the country's electricity needs.
During the annual auction last November, high power prices in the European wholesale market saw strong demand from the ARENH mechanism for delivery in 2020.
But the coronavirus outbreak and a general confinement ordered by the government to curb its spread has led to a sharp drop in electricity demand by around 15% to 20%, according to French electricity grid operator RTE.
Due to the fall in power consumption, wholesale prices are far from the 42 euros/MWh suppliers paid for the ARENH contract. France's baseload power contract for June delivery  is trading 20.40 euros/MWh, while the contract for the third quarter  was at 26.20 euros/MWh, by 0920 GMT.
THE MARKET HAS TANKED 
""The market has completely tanked,"" said one of the sources, adding that the pandemic had led to an exceptional situation which if not dealt with could break the principle of the ARENH contract, which aims to create a level playing field between EDF's commercial arm and rivals.
France's energy market regulator CRE said in its statement last week that EDF had rejected the force majeure declaration.
The CRE added that regulators considered that force majeure could only apply if a buyer succeeded in demonstrating that its economic situation made it completely impossible to fulfil the ARENH payment obligation, which in its opinion, was not the case in this situation.
CRE said it could not suspend the ARENH contracts in their totality because that would benefit suppliers at the expense of EDF.
EDF has argued over the years that it wanted the government to scrap the ARENH mechanism because it is advantageous to rivals which buy from it when wholesale power prices are high, but turn to the market when prices are low.

The French government has launched a plan to reform the electricity market including the ARENH mechanism.

1416,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",Graphic: 'Sustainable' funds a safer harbour in coronavirus market meltdown,"By Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Funds focused on buying stocks that score well on environmental, social and governance-related metrics proved a safer harbour for investors during the coronavirus-fuelled market rout last month, Morningstar data shows.
With trillions of dollars wiped off stock market values during March, there were few places to hide completely for funds only allowed to bet on rising prices, yet investors in funds focused on environmental, social and governance metrics (ESG) lost less money than their non-ESG peers.
Some of that outperformance can be put down to the funds' typical aversion to sectors which often score less well on ESG metrics and which have been hit particularly hard during the downturn, such as airlines and oil companies.
Data from industry tracker Morningstar showed that actively managed Europe Large-Cap Blend, Global Large-Cap Blend, and UK Large-Cap Equity ESG funds, on average, all beat their non-ESG rivals, although U.S. Large-Cap Blend Equity lagged theirs.
All the funds were domiciled in Europe and state in their prospectus that they use ESG criteria as a key part of their security-selection process, or indicate that they pursue a sustainability-related theme or seek a measurable positive impact alongside financial return.
""Companies that score high on ESG tend to be large well-run businesses that treat their stakeholders well, address their environmental challenges, enjoy more conservative balance sheets, and have lower levels of controversies. Many such companies tend to be more resilient during market downturns,” said Hortense Bioy, director, Passive Strategies and Sustainability Research, Manager Research, Europe.
The biggest outperformance was in the UK, where the average ESG fund fell 14% against 16.8% for their non-ESG rivals. All of the passive ESG funds, which track movements in indices, beat their non-ESG peers, the data showed.

""The focus... on the long-term sustainability of business models and often a focus on firms that are better able to adapt to changes in society is one of the key reasons in my view,"" Jeroen Bos, head of specialised equities and responsible investing at Dutch money manager NN Investment Partners.
""These companies are often higher quality as well in combination with often having lower leverage, all factors that help in the current environment.""
Geir Lode, head of Global Equities, International at Federated Hermes, said the changing political and regulatory climate would also likely lead to further opportunities for companies which score well on ESG metrics.
""Companies which play an active role in adapting to and mitigating some of the greatest challenges that we see today in society are likely to be rewarded through future policy and legislation, promoting greater sustainable development.
""This latest crisis will perhaps hasten the speed of transition, and markets for unsustainable products and services will decline.""
Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said in a March 25 BofA Global Research research note that, from the S&P 500's (SPX) peak on Feb. 19, stocks that scored in the top quintile on ESG metrics had outperformed the market by over 5 percentage points.
The performance was ""nearly identical"" on a sector- and size-adjusted basis, they said, while the top 50 most overweighted stocks by ESG funds had outperformed the most underweighted by more than 10 percentage points.
Rob Weeber, Chief Executive at Zurich-based Tiedemann Constantia, said his firm's ESG-focused strategies had performed ""extremely well"" during the period, thanks in part to their lack of exposure to energy, airlines and resource stocks.
""The active allocation to companies such as [technology company] Zoom (O:ZM), which reduce a company's carbon footprint and the need to travel, has meant that they've held up extremely well.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Monday, as investors take comfort from tentative signs the spread of coronavirus is slowing.
At 7:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 92 points, or 3.7%, higher, futures for the Nasdaq up 281 points, or 3.7%. The Dow futures contract rose 769 points, or 3.7%. 
On Sunday, New York City, the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, reported a drop in the number of new infections and deaths. President Donald Trump voiced hope coronavirus cases were ""levelling off"" in U.S. hotspots, saying he saw ""light at the end of the tunnel"".
However, Surgeon-General Jerome Adams warned on Sunday that the coming week will be ""“the hardest and saddest week of most Americans’ lives.” The U.S. has reported over 337,000 confirmed infections from Covid-19, by far the highest tally in the world, and over 9,600 deaths.
In Europe, a week or so ahead of the U.S. in terms of the timing of the virus outbreak, figures from Spain, Italy, Germany and France suggested containment measures are limiting the spread of the disease. .
In corporate news , JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual statement to shareholders that the economic slowdown will ""include a bad recession combined with some kind of financial stress similar to the global financial crisis of 2008.""
Dimon said the bank would offer measures such as waivers for late fees and a 90-day grace period for mortgage and auto loan payments.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) is likely to be in the spotlight after announcing that it’s suspending most of its flights to the New York region from Tuesday due to the coronavirus outbreak.
American will operate just 13 daily flights to LaGuardia, JFK and Newark airports through May 6, compared with 271 a year ago.
Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) will also be in focus after Credit Suisse (SIX:CSGN) downgraded its recommendation on the video communications platform to underperform from neutral, saying it has the ""best product at the right time"" but is now expensive.
Additionally, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced it will soon be producing one million face-shields a week for medical workers.
Oil prices fell Monday as the OPEC+ group of major exporters delayed a scheduled meeting to Thursday.
The announcement of the meeting last week, to mediate a truce between Saudi Arabia and Russia in their price war, sent oil soaring last week.
The head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, Kirill Dmitriev, said Russia and Saudi Arabia were ""very, very close"" to a deal, although President Trump's efforts to persuade U.S. companies to cut production came to nothing at the weekend. 
By 7:15 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.9% lower at $27.52 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 2.7% to $33.20.

(Reuters) -  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) said late Sunday it would suspend more flights in and out of New York City's three main airports for about a month, joining other airlines that have cut flights to the area following a spike in coronavirus cases.
Between April 9 and May 6, American will operate a total of 13 daily flights from New York's JFK and LaGuardia airports and New Jersey's Newark, it said, down from an average of 271 daily flights across all three airports in April 2019.
David Seymour, American's senior vice president of Operations, told employees that demand for flights to the New York area ""is rapidly evaporating"" following an increase in COVID-19 cases and a recent advisory from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warning against all non-essential travel to and from New York, Connecticut and New Jersey.
New York has been the hardest-hit U.S. state by the coronavirus pandemic.
United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) said on Saturday that it was reducing its daily New York City area flights to 17 from 157, while JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) is cutting its schedule by as much as 80% and  Spirit Airlines  Inc (N:SAVE) is canceling all of its flights to the area.
U.S. carriers have drastically reduced their flying schedules around the world as air travel demand has plummeted due to the coronavirus, but the reductions to New York - one of the business capitals of the world - underscore the depth of the health and financial crises. 
American said it will only operate flights between 10 a.m. ET and 6 p.m. ET as turn-only operations so that no aircraft or crews remain overnight at the airports, and so that fewer New York crew will be required on the ground.
Facing what they call an unprecedented crisis, airlines around the world are seeking government aid to help them avoid employee layoffs with the hope that travel demand will eventually recover.
In the United States, top Democrats in Congress on Sunday urged the U.S. Treasury to move quickly to award $32 billion in cash assistance to airlines and airport contractors without setting onerous requirements that could lead to bankruptcies.

1419,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2020 06:55AM ET</span>",BMW sees demand falling further after first quarter sales plunge due to coronavirus,"BERLIN (Reuters) - BMW (DE:BMWG) is expecting a further decline in global demand as the coronavirus outbreak takes its toll, a spokesman said on Monday, after the German carmaker reported a 20.6% drop in first quarter sales to 477,111 vehicles.
BMW said it had seen sales growth at the start of the year. Since then, the pandemic has pushed some firms, including carmakers, to halt production at some sites and many governments around the world have introduced lockdown measures in a bid to slow the spread of the virus.
""By February, the impact of the pandemic had already led to a significant decrease in sales in China. By March, the effects of the pandemic were clearly visible in sales figures in Europe and the U.S,"" BMW said in a statement.
BMW sales to China, where the outbreak started, were down 30.9% in the January to March period. They dropped by 18.3% in Europe and by 17.4% in the United States.
A production stoppage at BMW's factories is being extended by two weeks until April 30, a spokesman said, adding the time was being used to modify factories - a task that is keeping several thousand employees busy.
BMW is responding to an expected further downturn in demand by planning ahead and adjusting production, a spokesman said.
He added that while fundamental demand was still there, the closure of retail outlets meant customers were not ordering and receiving cars like they do normally so it would take longer for markets to recover.
BMW said around 80% of retail outlets in Europe and 70% in the United States were temporarily shut due to the pandemic. 
Shares in BMW were up 5.7% at 1023 GMT, as Europe's stock markets rebounded on hopes the region might be getting to grips with the health crisis. 

Export expectations in Germany's car sector have fallen to their lowest level since March 2009, when Europe's largest economy was in the throes of the global financial crisis, Germany's Ifo institute said on Monday.

1421,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>",EasyJet founder digs in on battle with management over Airbus order,"LONDON (Reuters) - Stelios Haji-Ioannou, easyJet's (L:EZJ) founder and biggest shareholder, on Monday intensified his battle with the airline's management over a huge aircraft order with Airbus (PA:AIR) which he says it should cancel. 
Haji-Ioannou said in a statement that he had told the airline he would not provide it with any new equity until it terminates a 4.5 billion pound deal with Airbus. He said he tried to change the company's stance by calling for the removal of two of its directors. 
Stelios, as he is better known, says that the 107 planes on order are ""useless"", after the coronavirus pandemic brought air travel to an almost standstill. The huge bill for the planes puts easyJet's survival at stake, he said.
Airlines across the world are struggling to say afloat. Whole fleets are now grounded, including easyJet's 344 planes, due to travel restrictions and plunging demand over fears of contagion. 
Stelios said easyJet will run out of money by August and said he would not help it financially until the Airbus order is cancelled. He also said he wants easyJet to reduce its fleet size to 250.
Britain has told its airlines to raise new money from shareholders before it would consider helping them. While easyJet is taking advantage of government help schemes for businesses, it has not requested any specific state bailout. 
INFLUENCE
Under UK company rules, Stelios's only way of influencing management's behaviour is to call for a shareholder meeting to vote for the removal of directors. 
He plans to write to easyJet's chairman to call for two directors to be removed, adding Chief Financial Officer Andrew Findlay to an earlier call for the removal of Andreas Bierwirth.
""Terminating the Airbus contract is the only chance current shareholders have to maintain any value in their shares,"" Stelios said in his statement. 
Airbus has said the order from easyJet is firm, meaning binding, while the airline said on Monday its focus was on short-term liquidity to ensure its future. 
""We believe that holding a general meeting would be an unhelpful distraction from tackling the many immediate issues our business faces,"" the company's spokeswoman said. 
The Luton-based budget airline on Friday rejected Stelios's first call for a general meeting to remove Bierwirth on what Stelios's team called a technicality, but a meeting, held electronically, will have to go ahead at some point, his spokesman said. 
""I fully expect easyJet to follow the stipulations of the Companies Act 2006 and to call a meeting within a three week period,"" said a spokesman for Haji-Ioannou. 
The Haji-Ioannou family owns about a third of easyJet's shares and Stelios has been a long-time critic of the airline's expansion plans.

1423,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 06, 2020 05:36AM ET</span>",Bold Market Calls Abound as Minerd Says S&P 500 Could Drop 40%,"(Bloomberg) -- The dispersion of Wall Street views on the outlook for stocks has been widening for a while, and Scott Minerd may have taken things up another notch.
The chief investment officer at Guggenheim suggested over the weekend that the S&P 500 might fall to 1,500 as the coronavirus spreads and its impact is felt in the world’s largest economy. That’s a whopping 40% slide from current levels, and a call that looks eye-catching even for a noted bear.
“We need to see the other shoe drop,” Minerd wrote in a report Sunday. “When the markets start to see some of the data on unemployment rising and economic growth and corporate earnings contracting, there will be another level of panic.”
Weighing the global spread of the coronavirus against the extreme stimulus measures designed to offset its impact is increasingly driving a wedge between various market participants. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. says the worst is probably already past, and that there is potential for the S&P 500 to rally back up to 2,850.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). has said the gauge could fall to 2,000 before recovering.
Minerd is expecting an economic contraction of well over 10% this year. He also forecasts S&P 500 earnings per share of around $100, which with a traditional market multiple would put the gauge around 1,500, he said. It closed at 2,488.65 on Friday.
While he likes the Federal Reserve’s response to the pandemic, crediting emergency policy moves with helping restore liquidity, Minerd is less impressed by Congress and the White House. The fiscal programs put in place may be “nowhere near sufficient,” he said, and in some cases perhaps even misguided.
Still, Guggenheim is seeking opportunities amid the turmoil.
“We are opportunistically trying to move from some of our more conservative investments to securities that, in our view, look attractive,” he wrote. “We are looking at investment-grade corporate bonds and municipal bonds, and select securities in structured credit and high-yield, where prices have dropped and spreads have widened significantly, look interesting.”

1424,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 06, 2020 05:35AM ET</span>","StockBeat: A Macro Bounce, but BMW Shows Recovery Path Still Uncertain","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets have rocketed on Monday on the back of weekend data showing that the number of people dying from Covid-19 is falling in Italy and Spain and may also have peaked in Germany and Austria.
The numbers are the clearest sign yet that the two companies worst affected by the virus are starting to bring it under control.
That allows investors, and companies, to dream of the day that people start to buy more than the bare essentials needed to stay alive.
A BMW is, perhaps, the ideal definition of a non-essential expenditure. Around 80% of the luxury carmaker’s dealerships in Europe, and 70% in the U.S., are currently closed. Hence a predictably dire update on Monday that showed sales were down 20% in the first quarter of this year.
However, BMW (DE:BMWG) stock was among the best-performing German stocks on Monday, along with other bombed-out cyclicals in non-essential goods and services. BMW was up 7.2% by 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), while Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) preferred stock was up 7.9% and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) stock was up 7.4%.
The DAX as a whole was up 4.0%, while the Stoxx 600 was up 2.8%, approaching a four-week high.
The bounce appears to be entirely top-down, macro-driven. Nowhere in BMW’s statement did it give it any hint of when its factories might return to normal production levels, or of when its showrooms might open again. The nearest it came to any forward-looking statement was sales head Pieter Nota’s comment that “In China, we are seeing the first signs of recovery with a strong order intake.”
BMW has perhaps more reason to hope that, when the pandemic fades, demand will prove to be just ‘pent-up’, rather than entirely lost. By contrast, there will be no way for the travel sector to make up for lost Easter bookings, or the events and hospitality sector to make up for three months or more of lost parties and conferences.
But it would be naïve to think that BMW’s sales are simply going to rebound to their pre-pandemic trajectory. Households and businesses around the world are going to emerge from this episode with weaker balance sheets, making them think twice before upgrading to a new series 7 or Mini Clubman. The need to incentivize with discounts will be greater than ever. That suggests a long period of lower-than-normal profitability, with all that that implies for shareholder returns. 
Shareholders should enjoy the bounce, but be mindful that the economic policies that will dictate the shape of any recovery are still far from clear."

The Belgian carrier had previously grounded flights until Apr. 19 but said it was extending that by four weeks because of ""low to no demand"", owing to travel restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus.
The company, which has a workforce of 4,200, said it would prolong the temporary short-time work scheme under which wages are cut but topped up by the government to help companies to manage liquidity problems resulting from the crisis. 
Customers with bookings during the suspension have until August to rebook and will be able to push back travel dates as far as the end of April 2021.

When Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. brass addressed analysts during its last earnings call, much of the talk revolved around finally turning the corner after years in the doldrums. That was in January, before Covid-19 threw the global economy into a tailspin.
Now, executives are struggling to assess the damage. In the short term, Samsung’s most profitable business is riding a surge in online activity from the millions confined to home, driving demand for the memory chips that help power datacenters and cloud services. But should the pandemic persist into the second half -- a worst-case scenario -- the tech giant foresees missing its own 2020 revenue projections by a double-digit percentage, according to people familiar with internal discussions.
Samsung unveils preliminary earnings Tuesday, becoming one of the first major technology corporations to paint a picture of how the pandemic impacted the global tech industry in 2020’s first three months. As the world’s largest maker of memory chips, phones, displays and appliances, the Korean giant is exposed to the economic shocks of Covid-19 like few other tech corporations. The novel coronavirus has already forced Korea’s largest company to shut plants from Gumi at home to India, costing Samsung days of lost production. While it’s expected to post first-quarter revenue growth, the question is whether the initial surge in semiconductor demand can offset a hit from what could be the worst global economic shock in at least a generation.
“We are truly in uncharted waters as the tech industry in general has continued to grow, perhaps at varying rates, but we haven’t seen a broad-based, global downturn such as we may be in line for,” said Robert Maire, president of Semiconductor Advisors in New York. Chip demand in particular “will likely not be as robust as it could have been as demand for devices that contain semiconductors, such as smartphones, TVs and consumer electronics, will be reduced through negative economic impact.”
Foremost among the divisions under scrutiny is the semiconductor unit, which accounts for more than half of operating profits at Samsung. It’s been pounding out memory chips -- the lubricant of the tech industry -- round the clock, essential in datacenters hosting everything from video conferences to e-commerce. But executives and investors worry that prolonged Covid-19 lockdowns may crimp final demand for smartphones and other electronics -- and ultimately deal a serious blow to the chip industry’s nascent recovery.

Much of the hit could come this quarter since Covid-19 escalated globally in March. Revenue growth is likely to fall off steeply, according to Eugene Investment & Securities, which projects a 12.3% decline in the June quarter from a forecast for a mere 0.1% increase in the January to March period.
Among the analysts that cut price targets was Hana Financial Investment, which also slashed its projection for Samsung’s 2020 smartphone sales from 300 million units to 260 million. It expects OLED panel shipments to plunge 12% to 373 million this year. Now that the Euro 2020 soccer tournament and Tokyo Olympics have been postponed, TrendForce also lowered its forecast for Samsung TV shipments by 5.8% to 205.2 million units, warning that could slip further as the situation worsens in North America and Asia.
“The current financial crisis that accompanies the pandemic has produced a lot of uncertainties and could surpass the Financial Crisis of 2007-2008 in scale,” TrendForce said on March 30. “Hence, the general economic outlook for 2H20 could become even gloomier as the pandemic is not expected to be brought under control in the short term.”

That’s a far cry from just a month ago, when Samsung told shareholders the memory market will stabilize this year thanks to upgrades in manufacturing processes, datacenter expansions and the rollout of fifth-generation or 5G wireless networks. Having learned its lesson from previous industry slumps, Samsung was confident it could maintain a balance between supply and demand for memory chips, the people said, asking not to be identified talking about internal deliberations. Their prime concern was avoiding a repeat of the oversupply that triggered a chip price crash in 2019, they said.
The industry is still toting up the impact of the pandemic. In a positive scenario, analysts expect pent-up demand for smartphones and sustained use of online learning and work-from-home gear like laptops to engender a soft-landing for Samsung later this year. Just a week ago, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. and  Western Digital  Corp (NASDAQ:WDC). said they were seeing a recovery in demand from Chinese consumers for phones and computer disk drives. And Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU). has predicted stronger-than-expected revenue.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Memory chips are likely in tight supply due to disruptions in obtaining certain raw materials and equipment on the Covid-19 outbreak. This may bolster DRAM and NAND sentiment following rising contract prices in March, supported by rising remote work access needs, despite an extended smartphone shipment slump to 2Q.

It may well be that the disease will encourage shifts in consumer activity that benefit the industry in the long run, said C.J. Muse, senior managing director at Everscore ISI in New York.
“The world is changing,” said Muse. “There is clearly something that, over the long term in this kind of virus world, should be positive, given how our lives are evolving and how important the cloud is to a lot of what we do now and even more than ever.”

1428,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2020 04:40AM ET</span>",HSBC HK shareholders mull legal action over dividend suspension,"By Sumeet Chatterjee and Felix Tam
HONG KONG (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA) shareholders in Hong Kong are considering calling for an extraordinary meeting with management and taking possible legal action against the bank's decision to scrap dividend payments.
HSBC and other top British banks on Wednesday announced the suspension of dividend payouts after pressure from the regulator to save their capital as a buffer against expected losses from the new coronavirus crisis.
Founded in Hong Kong about 150 years ago as Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp, Europe's biggest lender by assets has a large number of small shareholders in the city who have long benefited from the bank's stable dividend payments.
Some of the Hong Kong shareholders have come together and created a dedicated Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, which had more than 3,000 members as of Sunday, to discuss possible action against the London-headquartered bank's dividend halt. 
""At this stage, we must call an EGM (extraordinary general meeting) to let the management explain to us,"" H.T. Chan, a 46-year-old retired driver who holds the bank's stock and is part of the Facebook action group, told Reuters.
""For legal action, it depends on what they respond in the EGM. Hopefully, we can call this meeting.""
Shareholders of a company with at least 5% of the total voting rights may require it to convene an extraordinary general meeting, according to Hong Kong laws.
As of Sunday, the newly formed HSBC Shareholders Alliance in Hong Kong had registered members with combined ownership of about 2% of the bank's stock, Ken Lui, the convenor of the alliance, told reporters on Monday. 
""Our goal is to gather 5% of shareholding to call for an EGM ... we are very optimistic as we have only set up this alliance four, five days ago.""
HSBC Chief Executive Noel Quinn in a letter to Hong Kong shareholders after the decision to suspend the dividend said the bank's board would review the position once the economic impact of the pandemic was better understood.
""We profoundly regret the impact this will have on you, your families and your businesses. We are acutely aware of how important the dividend is to our shareholders in Hong Kong.""
Commenting on the possible legal action by the Hong Kong-based shareholders, one London-based institutional investor told Reuters he believed the group had little chance of reversing the decision.
""I see the debate about the banks' dividends as a very short one: regulator tells them what to do and they comply – end of story.""
Hong Kong is HSBC's single most important market, and it is one of three note issuing banks there.
A spokeswoman for HSBC said on Sunday the bank was not able to comment on any legal proceedings not yet commenced.
""I am following the majority action. This is a significantly essential issue as you have promised substantial and persistent dividend-paying, but you fail to do that,"" said Kingsley Chow, a 39-year-old unemployed man relying on dividend income. 

""Our first demand, at least, you have to open EGM to explain to us face-to-face, not just an apology letter!,"" he wrote on the Facebook page, referring to Quinn's letter.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Stocks jumped on Monday as investors were encouraged by a slowdown in coronavirus-related deaths and new cases, while oil prices skidded after Saudi-Russian negotiations to cut output were delayed, keeping oversupply concerns alive.
Equity investors took solace as the death toll from the coronavirus slowed across major European nations including France and Italy.
U.S. stock futures rose 4% in Asian hours, trading close to its upper limit after U.S. President Donald Trump expressed hope the country was seeing a ""levelling off"" of the coronavirus crisis.
London's FTSE was up 3.2% in early trading, while Germany's DAX index was 4% higher.
""The stabilisation we are seeing in the market today is welcomed but it is something really fragile,"" said Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
In commodity markets, Brent crude fell as much as $4 after Saudi Arabia and Russia postponed their meeting, initially scheduled for Monday, to Thursday even as the virus pandemic pummels demand.
""With a very light calendar globally today, there is enough momentum to keep the equity rally running through the course of the day and also into European time,"" said Jeffrey Halley, Senior Market Analyst, Asia Pacific, OANDA.
""All bets are off after that although I could see a couple of days of positive sentiment ahead, especially if those mortality rates keep falling.""
In currency markets, sterling fell 0.06% in Asia after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital following persistent coronavirus symptoms 10 days after testing positive for the virus.
In Asia, Australia's benchmark index rose 4.33%; Japan's Nikkei added 4.24% after a slow start while South Korea's KOSPI index climbed 3.85%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was 2.18% higher.
That sent MSCI's broadest index of Asian shares outside of Japan up almost 2.03%, on track for its best performance in over a week. 
Markets in mainland China were closed for a public holiday. 
Worryingly, the number of new coronavirus cases jumped in China on Sunday while the number of asymptomatic cases surged too as Beijing continued to struggle to extinguish the outbreak despite drastic containment efforts. 
""Focus in markets will now turn to the path out of lockdown and to what extent containment measures can be lifted without risking a second wave of infections,"" National Australia Bank analyst Tapas Strickland wrote in a note.
""Key to a strong rebound in China will be the ongoing lifting of containment measures with Wuhan – the epicentre of the outbreak – set to lift containment measures on April 8.""
Strickland, however, noted many in China were still subject to social distancing and isolation restrictions to prevent a resurgence in infections.
The pandemic has claimed more than 68,000 lives and infected over a million people globally. The United States has the highest number of reported cases, at over 300,000.
Concerns about heavy damage to the global economy have pushed investors into the perceived safety of government bonds where yields are at or near all-time lows. 
""One of the major concerns of markets at the moment is the extent and the soundness of the recovery in production that we are seeing in China and other Asian countries,"" SocGen's Benzimra added.
Elsewhere in currencies, the dollar gained 0.4% against the yen to 108.93..
The euro was barely moved at $1.0819 while the risk sensitive Australian dollar was up 0.6% at $0.6037. The pound was last down 0.02% at $1.2266.
In commodities, Brent crude futures was down nearly 1.23%, or 42 cents, at $33.69 a barrel while U.S. crude slipped 1.83%, or 52 cents, to $27.82.

Spot gold added 0.54% to $1,625.2 an ounce.

1430,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2020 04:05AM ET</span>",Coronavirus turmoil spurs UK bond fund outflows - Calastone,"By Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - UK-based bond funds saw outflows of 3.7 billion pounds ($4.54 billion) in March as the coronavirus pandemic spurred a rush to cash, data from the fund transaction network Calastone showed.
Global markets have been hit hard, losing almost $8 trillion in value, according to S&P Dow Jones Indicies, as the rapidly spreading COVID-19 virus put hundreds of millions of people into government-imposed lockdowns, setting the world's economy on course for recession.
With company revenues set to slide and the prospect of bankruptcies to come, many investors fled corporate bonds, which had proved increasingly attractive over recent years given low central bank interest rates.
Data from Calastone showed particularly heavy selling of bond funds over the weeks of March 9 and March 16, although demand to sell slowed towards the end of the month.
Calastone, which provides the market infrastructure through which fund units can be bought and sold, said it sees around 90% of all flows in UK-domiciled funds, totalling nearly 200 billion pounds of transactions every month.
(GRAPHIC: UK bond funds see outflows in March - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/ygdvzmqapwa/eikon.png) 
For an interactive version of the graphic, click here https://reut.rs/2UEfUDK. 
The scale of selling was 13 times more than that seen in the previous worst month - January 2019 - since Calastone began collating the data in 2015, and wiped out accumulated inflows from the preceding eight months.
As well as the concern over widening yield spreads, as investors worried that weak sovereign and corporate borrowers may struggle to service their debts, selling was also driven by quarter-end portfolio rebalancing, Calastone said.
""Market crises are superficially all the same as volatility soars and asset prices collapse, but they differ enormously in the detail,"" said Edward Glyn, Head of Global Markets at Calastone. 
""The temporary loss of fixed income as a safe-haven asset class to counterbalance some of the huge losses in equity markets left investors with little option but to ride it out or park their money in cash or cash-equivalents like money market funds.""
While actively managed equity funds also saw heavy outflows - some 1.7 billion pounds - the big winner were equity funds that passively track an index, collectively seeing inflows of 1.4 billion pounds.
""The massive divergence between passive and active funds can be partially explained by long-term trends driving the growth of index investing and by the hard anchor of monthly direct debits, but these factors aren’t enough on their own to account for the huge disparity in March,"" Glyn said,
""It seems investors attempting to catch market troughs may simply be focusing on timing and just relying on the index to do the rest.""

1431,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2020 03:55AM ET</span>","Rolls-Royce scraps targets, dividend on pandemic hit","By Sarah Young
LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce (L:RR) is scrapping its targets and final dividend to shore up its finances as the British aero-engine maker's customers around the world ground planes due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Rolls, one of Britain's most historic industrial names, which before the coronavirus crisis struck was trying to emerge from a multi-year turnaround plan, has suspended its dividend for the first time since 1987. 
The company's engines power Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing's (N:BA) widebody jets but more than 60% of that fleet is now grounded, according to aviation data provider Cirium.
Rolls-Royce is paid by airlines based on how many hours they fly. Over the last six weeks, the headwind from coronavirus was about 300 million pounds, Rolls-Royce said, on flying hours which were 50% lower in March and expected to deteriorate further in April.
Chief executive Warren East said the company's focus was on strengthening its financial resilience, and as such it would be looking at cutting its cash expenditure, including reducing salary costs across its global workforce by at least 10% this year. 
Rolls-Royce also said on Monday it had secured an additional 1.5 billion pound ($1.8 billion) revolving credit facility, bringing its overall liquidity to 6.7 billion pounds, to give it headroom during a potential prolonged downturn. 
Withdrawing its previously announced guidance for 2020, and noting the ongoing uncertain outlook, Rolls-Royce said its board was no longer recommending its final dividend in respect of 2019, saving 137 million pounds.
The company said actions to reduce costs, including on non-critical capital expenditure projects and salary cuts and deferrals for senior managers, would have a cash flow benefit of at least 750 million pounds this year. 
Rolls-Royce also warned it was anticipating a reduction in engine delivery and maintenance and overhaul volumes, affecting its revenues in the longer term. The group's power systems business, which supplies industrial customers, is expected to weaken this year, the company said. 
Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris said that Rolls's update should give investors confidence in the company's ability to cope with the downturn. 
""There is plenty of liquidity. There are no worrying developments,"" he said. 
Shares in Rolls were up 13% at 284 pence in early trading. The stock has lost 55% over the last month.
Rolls-Royce relies on aerospace for just over half of its annual revenues, which were around 15 billion pounds in 2019, deriving the rest from its defence and power systems businesses.

The new syndicated loan has an initial maturity of 12 months with two optional 3-month extensions, added the company.

Investing.com - European stock markets posted strong gains Monday, helped by signs of a slowdown in coronavirus-related deaths in the region, and by expectations of more financial aid to help bolster its battered economies.
At 03:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index traded 2.6% higher, France's CAC 40 was up 3.3%, while the DAX rose 3.9%. The broader-based Stoxx 600 Europe index climbed 2.6%. 
The number of deaths has fallen in recent days in Italy and Spain, the two European countries worst hit, as well as in Germany, the region’s most populous country. The rate of new infections presents a more mixed picture, but has clearly slowed in Italy.
This news has raised hopes that the European continent may be on the road back to something approaching normality, although British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was taken to hospital on Sunday suffering from persistent coronavirus symptoms..
Eurozone finance ministry officials are set to hold discussions this week about how best to aid poorer states buckling under the coronavirus strain. 
The subject of joint 'coronabonds' is sure to be raised again, but more likely options include credit lines from the euro zone's bailout fund, more lending from the European Investment Bank and using a joint long-term budget directly for guarantees for leveraged borrowing.
In corporate news, shares in HSBC (LON:HSBA) climbed 3% in the positive market despite Fitch Ratings downgrading its outlook to negative from stable. The agency kept its A+ long-term default rating.
 Accor  (PA:ACCP) shares climbed over 5% after its chief executive stated the French hotel group has enough cash to operate through the coronavirus crisis. BMW shares rose 6.5% even after the carmaker reported a 20% drop in first-quarter sales.
On the flip side, Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC) shares fell 6% after the airline reported passenger volume fell by 60% year-on-year in March as it grounded more of its fleet amid global efforts to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
Oil prices edged lower as the OPEC+ group of major exporters delayed a meeting scheduled for later in the day to Thursday.
The announcement of the meeting, called last week to mediate a truce between Saudi Arabia and Russia in their ongoing price war, sent oil prices soaring last week.
The head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, Kirill Dmitriev, said Russia and Saudi Arabia were ""very, very close"" to a deal, although President Donald Trump's efforts to persuade U.S. companies to cut production came to nothing at the weekend. Trump instead threatened to levy tariffs on imports of foreign oil, something that would depress prices further outside the U.S.
At 2:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.3% lower at $27.98 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.0% at $33.77.

1434,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 06, 2020 03:10AM ET</span>","The No. 1 Source of Stock Demand Is a Goner, for Years to Come","(Bloomberg) -- Companies, the biggest source of demand for stocks in recent years, are likely to sharply cut back their purchases for years to come, preventing equities from reaching pre-coronavirus crisis valuations, according to Sanford C. Bernstein.
Diminished revenues, reduced capacity to issue high-yield debt for the purpose of buying stock and government curbs on companies taking public aid will all cause buybacks to shrink, according to the research firm and wealth manager. Buybacks could even become “socially unacceptable,” though the firm judged it too early to make a forecast on that count.
“For at least several years buybacks will be severely curtailed,” analysts including Inigo Fraser-Jenkins, who once did financial-stability research at the Bank of England, wrote in an April 6 note.
The dynamic is especially meaningful for the U.S., the Bernstein team wrote. Over the past five years, buybacks added about 1 to 1.5 percentage points to earnings-per-share growth, bolstering American stocks, the analysts estimated.
A more decisive economic role for governments -- which have moved decisively across the globe to prop up both the financial system and companies of all types -- will also likely have an impact on equities, Fraser-Jenkins and his colleagues wrote.
“As governments take a larger role in economies, this could turn the tide away from shareholders-first views of economies for some time,” they wrote. “Government’s role in financial markets cannot just be packed back into the box once this is all over.”
It’s possible that debt burdens could even go beyond the levels seen in World War II, depending on future additional rounds of fiscal stimulus, according to Bernstein. Along with the risk of faster inflation over time -- in part thanks to de-globalization -- that makes government bonds less attractive as a hedge to stocks, the analysts wrote.
“The absence of risk-free instruments that can deliver positive real return and at least a risk of higher inflation further bolster the case for gold,” on which the analysts have been positive for more than a year.

A pioneer in low-fare transatlantic air travel, the carrier's rapid expansion has left it heavily in debt. It has repeatedly raised cash from shareholders in order to stay in business and its Oslo-listed shares have plunged 78% so far this year.
""The company experienced a dramatic drop in demand following government-imposed travel restrictions and a general travel decline,"" the budget carrier said of its March numbers.
Norwegian has said it will cancel 85% of its flights and furlough 90% of staff while seeking financial aid from Norway's government.
The company last month also said it would start talks with creditors on postponing payments in order to qualify for a government rescue package requiring, among other things, that debt repayments must be put on hold for the time being.
""We will provide further financial and business updates to the Oslo Bourse when it is appropriate to do so,"" Chief Executive Jacob Schram said in a statement on Monday.
Before the outbreak in Europe of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, Norwegian had set a goal of returning to profit this year after three years of losses.

That goal was scrapped early last month however, and Schram on March 13 said the company needed access to cash liquidity ""within weeks, not months.""

Adding to the positive tone were comments from U.S. President Donald Trump, who expressed hope on Sunday that the country was seeing a ""levelling off"" in the U.S. hotspots, saying he saw “light at the end of the tunnel”. 
New York, the epicenter of the US outbreak, reported Sunday a drop in the number of new infections and deaths but, even so, has registered more deaths than the Chinese state of Hubei, where the virus originated.

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) said late Sunday that it will cap its participation in the U.S. government's small business coronavirus rescue program at $10 billion due to regulatory constraints.
The $350 billion loan program, which launched on Friday, will provide low-interest loans to help small businesses cover payroll and other fixed costs such as rent, mortgages and utilities over the next eight weeks.
""While we are actively working to create balance sheet capacity to lend, we are limited in our ongoing ability to use our strong capital and liquidity position to extend additional credit,"" Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said in a statement. 
The Federal Reserve in early 2018 ordered Wells Fargo to keep its assets below $1.95 trillion, until it had improved its governance and risk controls following a wave of sales practice scandals. The bank started 2020 with roughly $20 billion of room under the cap, according to filings. 
Wells Fargo, the fourth largest U.S. lender, has urged the U.S. Federal Reserve to lift the asset cap on the bank to help it support businesses and customers hit by economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters has reported. But so far regulators have been cold on the idea.
""We are committed to helping our customers during these unprecedented and challenging times, but are restricted in our ability to serve as many customers as we would like,"" Scharf said. 
The San Francisco-based lender said it has likely reached its $10 billion limit based on the applications it has already received, and will prioritize giving loans to non-profits and businesses with fewer than 50 employees. The bank will also give fees received from the program to non-profits focused on small business. 
Small businesses, which employ about half of U.S. private sector employees, have been dramatically hurt by the coronavirus pandemic as states have halted non-essential businesses and consumers curb their spending. 
Banks have been flooded with applications from clients looking for a piece of bailout fund.
Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), the first large bank to begin accepting applications on Friday morning, said it received 85,000 applications requesting $22 billion on the first day. 
Wells Fargo opened its portal on Saturday.
The bank said it was helping customers in other ways including deferring payments and waiving fees. Last month the bank deferred nearly $1.8 billion in payments and waved more than $28 million in fees for customers affected by the coronavirus recession.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Companies in the Asia Pacific need to raise a near record $69.3 billion to refinance their existing borrowings in the second quarter, Refinitiv figures show, as the region's capital markets remain turbulent due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The level of U.S. dollar corporate debt due to mature in the region, including Japan and China, is the second highest on record and only slightly behind the $71.4 billion that was due during the same time last year.
Some of China's largest state-owned enterprises are the leading contenders to refinance debt with oil giant Sinopec Group, which has a 5-year bond worth $2.48 billion maturing in April while power utility State Grid has a three-year $898.5 million bond expiring at the same time, according to Refinitiv.
The data shows a Soft Bank Group (T:9984) bond worth $2.48 billion due to mature on April 18, and the conglomerate flagged it planned to carry out $41 billion worth of asset sales to buy back shares and pay down debt.
Australia's banks are likely to be active in the U.S. dollar bond markets in the next few months with National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) and Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) having a combined $3.14 billion worth of bonds due to expire.
The rush of refinancing deals comes as Asia's debt markets are performing well behind the rest of the world.
Bankers said well known corporates should be able to refinance but lower rated companies and those with ratings considered 'on the edge' by ratings agencies could face trouble.
""Massive stimulus has been provided by governments worldwide as they seek to keep the wheels turning. It remains to be seen how this will translate into support for the more challenged credits in the coming weeks,"" said Raj Malhotra, head of  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN)'s Asia Pacific debt capital markets (DCM) unit.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s head of Asian DCM origination, excluding Japan, Amy Tan said an increasing number of Asian businesses were looking to diversify their funding sources this year.
""Companies are looking at all forms of alternative financing, including bank loans and local currency markets, to manage financing,"" she said.
A record $220 billion has been raised in the U.S. corporate credit market in the past fortnight, while just $2.57 billion has been raised in Asia during that same time, Refinitiv data shows.. 
The majority of the Asian volume was made up of Chinese search engine company Baidu Inc (O:BIDU) and insurer AIA (HK:1299) raising $1 billion each last week.
Nomura's head of Asia, excluding Japan, DCM syndication Alister Moss said Asian markets were lagging the United States and Europe because of their respective central banks' moves to allow increased credit purchases which gave bond markets confidence.

""We don't have that in Asia, and so our market is recovering more slowly.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street analysts and investors see a risk that stocks could retest recent lows in the coming days or weeks as they worry about the spread of the virus and its impact on the economy, although some spot glimmers of light at the end of the tunnel. 
Wall Street's main indexes fell more than 1.5% on Friday as the coronavirus abruptly ended a record U.S. job growth streak. The S&P 500 (SPX) closed at 2,488.65, after rebounding about 13% from its intra-day late-March low, although it is still down more than 26% from its mid-February record high.
Markets have shown some signs of stabilization as investors parse a broad range of signals for clues on the trajectory they may take in coming weeks. 
Some point to easing volatility and improving liquidity in fixed-income markets as signs that the worst of the sell-off may be over. Investor sentiment, often seen as a contrarian indicator, is one signal pointing to an eventual turnaround in U.S. stocks. Still, markets remain turbulent and far off their highs. 
U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams warned on Fox News Sunday that ""this is going to be the hardest and the saddest week."" 
However, there have been some positive signs. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said deaths had fallen slightly from the prior day, even though he cautioned that it was not yet clear whether the crisis in the state was reaching a plateau.
Michael Hewson at online trading company CMC Markets said that U.S. futures may get a lift on Sunday by a ""fall in the death rate in NY"" and some other places. U.S. futures were up more than 1 percent soon after opening on Sunday.
Here is a roundup of some analyst and investor views from the past few days: 
- Julian Emanuel at U.S. broker-dealer BTIG said in a research note on Sunday that if history is any sort of guide, he expects a ""retest of the March lows in April, as the public health and economic bad news is likely to reach its parabolic peak."" 
Emanuel said that part of what could make a bottom for stocks in the coming days is a realization that the real reopening date for the economy is not the end of April but rather the end of May. 
Emanuel added that stocks often trough ""when the headlines are most adverse, hope scarce, and emotions high"" and said that as investors, ""we want to be ready for that time, and we think it is coming in April."" 
Emanuel pointed to one ""uncommon phenomenon indicative of systemic hedging,"" saying the S&P 500 VIX, which measures volatility, is currently above the Nasdaq 100 VIX, which is ""usually reserved for times of market stress.""
- Whitney Tilson, founder and CEO of Empire Financial Research, a publisher of investment newsletters, who previously ran hedge fund Kase Capital, said in an email on Sunday that he believes New York City ""stopped the rapid spread of the virus around March 19,"" and that the number of new cases is now in decline. Tilson said data that NYC Health was releasing on new cases gave a more hopeful picture.
- Christopher Wood at Jefferies wrote in a research note dated Friday that they are still expecting, at a minimum, ""a re-test of the previous low on the S&P 500"", as well as a re-test of the 10-year Treasury bond yield low, and forecasts that will coincide with a renewed rally in the U.S. dollar.
Wood wrote that ""markets are heading into the peaking of the bad news in Europe at the same time as cases in Britain and America, both behind in terms of the virus cycle because of the failure to lockdown earlier, continue to rise sharply,"" Wood wrote. ""This news flow is likely to unnerve investors in the short-term for understandable reasons."" 
Still, Woods said ""when that peaking out does occur, it should generate a decent tradeable rally."" 
Jefferies equity strategist Steven DeSanctis, however, in a separate note said, said that hedge funds' de-risking ""seems to be behind us."" 
- Andrew Slimmon, managing director and senior portfolio manager on all long equity strategies at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management, said in emailed comments from a podcast on Friday that he also expects some ""retest of the lows"" but said it is possible that ""we will not get back to the lows."" 
He charts three stages of bear markets - the ""panic low,"" the ""relief rally"" and the ""retest"" and said the market is currently in the second stage. He sees financial services and consumer stocks as areas that are particularly attractive. 
- Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, wrote in emailed comments on Friday that ""April is going to be a tough one, with lots of real — and very scary — headlines. The market will certainly respond to those headlines, so we should expect more volatility and quite possibly a retest of the March lows."" 
- Michael Purves, at Tallbacken Capital Advisors, wrote on Friday that the VIX curve appears to be reflecting a few high-level but important scenarios/risks, of rolling U.S. blackouts as incremental populations get hot, and that U.S. health policy is less cohesive than it is in other countries. 
Purves also said there is ""an ever growing number of second order impacts from this economic shut down which may not reveal themselves for several months (fiscal stimulus implantation risks, food inflation, labor strikes, rising political risk, unsuccessful reboot of Asian economies, re-outbreak of Corona cases etc.)""

Rolls-Royce is also aiming to announce new credit facilities in excess of 1 billion pounds ($1.22 billion) to bolster liquidity, the newspaper said https://on.ft.com/2ULsL7q.
Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for large civil and military planes, has been hit hard by the pandemic as its airline customers park hundreds of planes. 
In March, engine flying hours were down by about 40%, the newspaper said, citing a source. The company is paid by airlines based on how many hours its engines fly.
At the end of February, Rolls Royce had forecast 2020 free cash flow of 1 billion pounds, excluding any material impact from COVID-19. The group will ditch that pledge, the FT said. 
The dividend payment of 11.7 pence per share, which has been frozen since 2016, will also be suspended, the newspaper added.
Rolls-Royce declined to comment.
In addition, the FT said the company on Monday will reopen its civil aerospace facilities in the UK with a fraction of the normal workforce, after suspending operations in March.

The company could also eventually furlough some 50% of its 7,500 UK shop-floor workers, with wages supported by government subsidy, two sources told the newspaper.

1446,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2020 07:40PM ET</span>",Solid chip sales unlikely to cushion Samsung's virus-hit first quarter profit,"By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - The coronavirus-driven global shift to working from home is set to have boosted demand for Samsung Electronics (KS:005930)' memory chips from laptop makers and data centres, but first-quarter profits are likely to remain flat as the outbreak weakened consumer electronics sales.
The South Korean tech giant is the world's largest memory chip maker, and its Galaxy smartphones are a major rival of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s products. 
Samsung, which also makes home appliances and displays, on Tuesday releases guidance for the January-March quarter profit which is widely expected to be unchanged, and come under pressure in the next few quarters as the impact of coronavirus-related factory and retail stores shutdowns bites.
""The visibility for Samsung's earnings is low for the second quarter,"" said Lee Do-hoon, an analyst at CIMB Research.
For the quarter which just ended, Samsung is likely to estimate its operating profit at 6.2 trillion won ($5.05 billion), unchanged from the same period a year ago, according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate, weighted towards more consistently accurate analysts.
However, the company already warned last month that the pandemic would hurt sales of smartphones and consumer electronics goods this year, and analysts said a prolonged virus outbreak could put higher demand for memory chips at risk.
""If COVID-19 continues into 2H20, the memory market outlook could change for the worse,"" CW Chung, head of research at Nomura in Korea, said in a recent report.
When the outbreak first started in China last year, Samsung's strategy of spreading out its production base to countries including Vietnam and India seemed to pay off: rivals such as Apple were hit by supply disruptions as China shut down factories and locked down cities to control the coronavirus.
Apple rescinded its profit forecast earlier this year due to production halts and retail store shutdowns in China.
But as the virus spread across the globe, Samsung too has had to close factories and retail stores in Europe, India and the United States, further unnerving investors: Samsung Electronics shares have slumped 15% so far this year, but outperformed the wider market's 22% fall.
Prospects for Samsung's flagship Galaxy S20 premium smartphones, launched more than one month ago, look dim. Its 5G-enabled S20 phones are already selling at a third of their launch price of $1,308 in South Korea, an official at a local carrier told Reuters.
Brokerage Hanwha Investment & Securities estimates Samsung smartphone sales fell 17% in the first quarter from a year earlier. Last year, a slump in profits at the smartphone and chip businesses more than halved Samsung's full-year earnings.
Its display business, which counts Apple and China's Huawei Technologies as customers, is likely to have swung back to a loss after three consecutive quarterly profit due to sluggish demand from its clients, analysts said.

Samsung only provides its estimates for its first-quarter revenue and operating profit on Tuesday, with details likely to be released later this month.

1447,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2020 06:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Silver Lake to seek more than $16 billion for buyout fund - sources,"By Chibuike Oguh and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - Private equity firm Silver Lake Partners is preparing to seek at least $16 billion from investors for its sixth flagship buyout fund, braving the economic uncertainty of the coronavirus outbreak, according to people familiar with the matter.
Investing the money raised in the coming months could allow Silver Lake to snap up companies at depressed valuations, given the pandemic's impact on the global economy, including the technology and media sectors that the private equity firm focuses on, the sources said.
Buyout funds typically return money to investors three to seven years following their fundraising, long after this pandemic is expected to have subsided. Nevertheless, concerns among institutional investors, such as public pension funds and insurance firms, about their liquidity amid the market turmoil will make Silver Lake's fundraising a key test of buyout firms' ability to fundraise during the crisis.
Silver Lake is preparing to start raising the new fund, Silver Lake Partners VI, in the second quarter, amassing between $16 billion to $18 billion, said the sources, who cautioned that the plans are still subject to change.
The sources declined to be identified because the preparations are confidential. Silver Lake declined to comment.
Last year, Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX), the world's largest private equity firm, raised a $26 billion flagship buyout fund while Vista Equity Partners Management LLC raised $16 billion from investors for its seventh technology buyout fund. CVC Capital Partners Ltd is also raising up to 20 billion euros ($21.63 billion) for its latest buyout fund, which is expected to be the largest ever fund raised in Europe.
More than half a trillion dollars flowed into technology-focused buyout funds, including Silver Lake, between 2008 and 2018, according to data provider Preqin, helping to support dealmaking among companies in software, social media, and cybersecurity.
Silver Lake has $43 billion in assets under management, and its portfolio of companies includes social media firm  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR), computer hardware maker Dell Technologies Inc (N:DELL), and movie theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (N:AMC), according to its website.
Silver Lake raised $15 billion from investors in 2017 for its fifth buyout fund. That fund had an initial target of $12.5 billion, and as of the end of December 2018 had delivered an internal rate of return (IRR) of 11%, according to the website of Minnesota State Board of Investment, one of Silver Lake's investors.
The prior $10.3 billion fund, Silver Lake Partners IV, had delivered an IRR of 24.4% as of the end of December, according to the Minnesota State Board of Investment. By comparison, the Minnesota State Board of Investment's entire private equity portfolio delivered an IRR of 12.5%.

(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Sunday it would extend the suspension of production operations at its Washington state facilities until further notice amid the coronavirus outbreak.
The largest U.S. planemaker said on March 23 it would halt production at its Washington state twin-aisle jetliner factory as a temporary measure to help fight the outbreak of the respiratory disease. Production had been expected to resume early this week. 
Boeing declined to say when production could resume. It said the actions were ""being taken in light of the company's continuing focus on the health and safety of employees, current assessment of the spread of COVID-19 in Washington state, the reliability of the supply chain and additional recommendations from government health authorities.""
Boeing will stop paying about 30,000 production workers this week in Washington state after it previously doubled to 10 days the amount of paid leave it gave to production workers after the suspension. Employees can use paid time off, vacation and sick leave in the interim and will continue to get medical benefits. 
Boeing said on Sunday about 135 members of its 160,000-person global workforce had tested positive for the coronavirus.
The Seattle Times reported that as of Friday, Boeing had 95 employees who tested positive for the respiratory disease in Washington state, up from 54 a week earlier. The newspaper said 14 of those work at the Everett widebody jet plant.
During the suspension, Boeing will implement additional health and safety measures, including ""new visual cues to encourage physical distancing,"" more frequent cleaning of work and common areas and staggered shift times.
""We will take this time to continue to listen to our incredible team and assess applicable government direction, the spread of the coronavirus in the community and the reliability of our suppliers,"" said Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Stan Deal. 
Boeing's airline customers have deferred taking new aircraft and making pre-delivery downpayments, compounding a crisis over the year-old grounding of Boeing's previously fast-selling 737 MAX jet after two fatal crashes. Boeing halted 737 production in January. 
Boeing asked last month for at least $60 billion in U.S. government loan guarantees for itself and other American aerospace manufacturers to help the embattled industry withstand a coronavirus-related cash drain.

Boeing said last week it would suspend operations at its Ridley Township, Pennsylvania, facilities until April 20 because of the outbreak. The site includes manufacturing and production facilities for military rotorcraft, including the H-47 Chinook, V-22 Osprey and MH-139A Grey Wolf.

U.S. lenders face growing pressure to follow their European counterparts and non-financial companies and cut dividends, as the coronavirus crisis puts a record number of people out of work, which could make it harder for borrowers to repay loans. Banks may need cash to cover those losses, critics argue.
But over the past week, executives from  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) have defended their plans to continue paying dividends to shareholders, saying their banks are well-capitalized enough to do so.
Wall street analysts, who initially thought it was impossible banks would cut dividends, are now saying it is more likely that banks, particularly those with large credit card businesses, will cut dividends later this year.

On March 27, the European Central Bank told its lenders to skip dividends and share buy backs until at least October, estimating they could save 30 billion euros by doing so.

Shares of Luckin, which competes in China with  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX), sank as much as 81% on Thursday in New York after it said the investigation had found that fabricated sales from the second quarter of 2019 to the fourth were about 2.2 billion yuan ($310 million).
""Regarding the suspected financial fraud and the extremely bad impact it has caused, Luckin Coffee hereby sincerely apologizes to the public,"" the company said in a post on its official Weibo account.
China's securities regulator said on Friday it would investigate claims of fraud at Luckin Coffee and sources said some of the banks involved in the Chinese chain's successful U.S. IPO last year were reviewing their work in the listing.
Founded in June 2017, Luckin's IPO had attracted a number of prominent U.S. investors, including hedge funds. 

Like others in the industry, the company has been hit hard by the coronavirus epidemic. In late January, it was forced to temporarily close an estimated 200 coffee shops in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the original epicentre of the outbreak, as well as many in other cities.

Sonaecom and dos Santos, who was named a suspect in a fraud investigation in Angola this year, each own 50% of holding firm ZOPT, which owns 52.15% of NOS.
The seizure affects half of ZOPT's shares, equivalent to dos Santos' holdings - but ZOPT as a whole will be deprived of voting rights, a decision Sonaecom argued ""seriously harms the interests of ZOPT and Sonaecom, both being third parties completely unrelated to the judicial process underway.""
Sonaecom said it would contest the decision as ZOPT ""is not liable for the debts of its shareholders"". Dos Santos has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
Angolan courts seized dos Santos' assets in December, but did not freeze voting rights, Sonaecom said.
In February, Portugal's public prosecutor ordered the seizure of bank accounts belonging the ex-first daughter, who also owns shares in several other Portuguese companies including oil group Galp.
Sonaecom said it would cooperate with judicial authorities while taking ""all appropriate legal action to revert and terminate the seizure procedure"".

Mexico's Grupo  Alsea  (MX:ALSEA) said it would honor March salaries and pay Chilean Starbucks workers a spot payment equivalent to 10% of their base salaries in April, according to a statement sent to Reuters.
The company said it had made the decision after a new law came into force in Chile that allowed companies to suspend labor contracts during the health crisis and for their workers to receive a limited unemployment benefit with the expectation of their jobs being revived once normal working conditions are restored across the country.
Grupo Alsea said the move was a ""responsible measure"" aimed at safeguarding positions across more than 120 outlets around Chile and it hoped to restart the contracts once the coronavirus crisis had passed, the statement added.
A union representing Starbucks (O:SBUX) workers said in a statement sent to Reuters that the suspension affected 1,600 people, around 90% of the franchise's Chilean workforce.
Andres Giordano, president of the union, said the company continued to do business through deliveries and its ""arbitrary"" action, without discussion with the union, had ""heightened uncertainty for workers and their families.""

1454,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2020 04:10PM ET</span>",Capital One says it won't use CFTC waiver related to oil lending,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lender  Capital One  Financial Corp (N:COF) said on Saturday it would not use a U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) waiver after commodity price volatility lifted the bank's derivatives exposure toward a key regulatory threshold.
The exemption relieved the firm from a requirement to register as a ""Major Swap Participant,"" or MSP, even though its growing energy swaps exposure was expected to require that by the end of the next quarter. The CFTC had announced the relief for an unnamed lender two weeks ago, and Reuters later reported Capital One was the bank.
""We are not an MSP,"" a spokesperson for the bank said in an emailed statement on Saturday.
The bank has ""notified the CFTC that we will not rely on the waiver and will register if derivative volumes reach the MSP threshold.""
The registration is related to Capital One's commercial lending to the oil and gas industry, a relatively small part of its overall business. The bank enters into commodity swaps with energy clients to help them mitigate the risk of energy price swings and the related borrowing risks.
While those trades typically do not bring the lender's swaps exposure anywhere close to the CFTC's registration threshold, a huge plunge in energy prices put it on track to hit the threshold by the end of the next quarter, the agency said in a letter on March 20.
The temporary waiver sparked worries that regulators are going too easy on banks in a bid to prop up lending, potentially exposing them to more risk down the road if energy prices do not rebound.
Following the 2007-2009 financial crisis during which several major institutions were toppled by their derivatives exposure, Congress created a slew of swap trading laws to reduce systemic risk and increase the visibility of the market.
Capital One's commercial bank ""does not engage in speculative derivatives trading"" and its normal hedging activity has not changed, the bank spokesperson said on Saturday.

The bank enters into hedges with other banks to reduce exposure to commodity risk from its hedges with oil and gas clients, reducing exposure to commodity risk to ""essentially zero, and we are subject to no outstanding margin calls,"" the spokesperson said.

1455,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2020 12:41AM ET</span>","U.S. pension funds may pour $400 billion into stocks, lifting virus-hit markets: JP Morgan","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. pension funds that delayed rebalancing their portfolios are likely to pump about $400 billion into stocks over the next two quarters, analysts at JP Morgan said, providing a potential boost to equity markets battered by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Weeks of asset price volatility may have pushed some fund managers to postpone rebalancing portfolios where equity allocations have been knocked out of whack by a sharp decline in stocks, the bank said in a note to investors. The S&P 500 fell 20% since the start of the year, marking its worst quarter since 2008.
""We still expect that US pension funds will eventually rebalance within 1-2 quarters,"" wrote strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou. 
The bank said its estimate of $400 billion in equity buying by the funds over the next two quarters could prove conservative. U.S. pension funds bought $200 billion in stocks by the first quarter of 2009, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis -- equivalent to $600 billion today, the bank said. 
Wild market swings have presented a challenge to asset managers looking to square their portfolios against a benchmark or return to their long-maintained allocation of stocks versus bonds. While the S&P is down about 24% from its February highs, unprecedented support from the Federal Reserve and a $2.2 trillion relief package from U.S. lawmakers helped stocks rally 15.5% since March 23. 
At least one fund -- the Los Angeles City Employees' Retirement System, which oversees some $15 billion -- is allowing its rebalancing to be deferred, according to a report in Pensions & Investments. The fund did not immediately respond turn a request for comment.
Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist with Reynolds Strategy, said in a note this week a rebalancing that leads pensions to sell bonds and buy stocks ""makes no sense for pensions given the capital calls they are facing from credit and related products.""
Some index providers, such as S&P Dow Jones Indices, have delayed their quarterly rebalancing due to the market volatility, potentially complicating the picture for funds that look to track index performance. 
Last week's rally in stocks may have helped boost some funds' equity allocations, making the need to increase exposure less acute, said Mike Schumacher, head of macro strategy at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities. 
The bank last week had estimated that U.S. corporate pensions will need to shift about $40 billion from fixed income into equities to maintain allocation targets. Its estimate now stands at $20 billion following last week's rally, Schumacher said. 
At the same time, mutual funds, pensions and other asset managers rebalancing their portfolio may have stoked some of last week's gains.
Steven DeSanctis, an equity strategist at Jefferies, said moves from fixed income into equities ""most likely"" happened last week, adding that ""the rebalancings don’t have to take place on the 31st.""
Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, said some of the market's recent gains have come from quarter-end and month-end rebalancing. 

""Once we get through the next couple of days, it's going to be a little bit more interesting because the question then becomes, 'Do we return really back to fundamentals and technicals?'.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - Multi-strategy hedge funds - those that bet on a broad array of markets using teams of traders, leverage and centralized risk management - have flourished as stocks ended their worst three months since the 2008 financial crisis.
Balyasny Asset Management, which invests $6 billion, ended the quarter with a 4.8% gain in its main fund after returning 3.7% in March, an investor said. Verition Fund Management's Verition Multi-Strategy Fund returned 4.5% for the year to date after a 3.75% gain in March, according to preliminary figures from an investor. And Cinctive Capital Management is up 3.25% in 2020 after a roughly 1.5% gain in March, an investor said.
Spokesmen for the funds declined to comment.
Multi-strategy funds are designed to take less market exposure, with long and short positions often sized equally. This makes them more likely to perform better when funds that take more risk stumble in volatile markets. 
The average hedge fund lost 6.9% in the first quarter, according to the HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index, with far deeper losses at some well-known funds. David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, for example, has lost 21.5%, while Renaissance Technologies' RIEF fund is off 14.4% in the first quarter, investors said. Representatives of those funds declined to comment.
Arthur Salzer, chief investment officer at Toronto-based Northland Wealth Management, said multi-strategy hedge funds like Citadel were a throwback to a more lucrative era when fund managers produced strong performance no matter the direction of the markets.
""The ability to go anywhere and do anything really makes a difference - they are designed to protect capital,"" Salzer said.
The multi-strategy funds performed far better, several investors said, because some dusted off playbooks from the last financial crisis and moved quickly to capitalize on disruptions as the spread of the coronavirus sparked panic selling.
At Cinctive Capital, the $1 billion hedge fund firm launched in September by Richard Schimel and Larry Sapanski, managers cut risk in early February and were able to jump on bargains two weeks ago, an investor said. The teams made money on long and short bets in the healthcare, technology, energy and consumer sectors, the investor said.
At Verition, a $1 billion firm that has returned an average 13% since its founding in 2008, the team made money on global credit and event-driven volatility and risk arbitrage strategies amid growing concerns that some planned mergers may collapse. 
Among the deals announced before the coronavirus upended markets were jeweler Tiffany & Co's plan to sell to LVMH and drugmaker  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV)'s $63 billion acquisition of Botox-maker Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc.
Shares of acquisition targets typically trade at a small discount to the deal price, accounting for the chance the deal fails, but in March deal price spreads widened dramatically, something Verition traders used to their advantage.
Other multi-strategy funds to perform well include Citadel's Wellington, which rose 5.7% for the year through March 31, according to a person familiar with the returns, while Millennium USA and Point72 Asset Management were essentially flat for 2020 as of Friday.

Last year, investors cooled on multi-strategy funds, which oversee $526 billion, and pulled out $18.3 billion, according to data from research firm eVestment. This year is different: investors have added $10.57 billion in the first two months of the year.

(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO)'s video-conferencing app Webex registered a record 324 million attendees in March, with usage more than doubling in the Americas, as the coronavirus-led lockdowns forced businesses to have employees work from home.
Webex and rival meeting platforms from Zoom and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Teams are being used worldwide to host everything from virtual classrooms and business meetings to church services, as people stay at home to restrict the spread of the pandemic.
Zoom's daily users ballooned to more than 200 million in March from a previous maximum total of 10 million, the company said https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/04/01/a-message-to-our-users on Wednesday. It was, however, not clear if the number was comparable with Cisco's due to the different ways the companies calculate meeting attendees.
""Webex grew 2.5 times in Americas, four times in Europe and 3.5 times in Asia Pacific. Our growth is sourced from enterprise expansion, education and telehealth,"" said Sri Srinivasan, senior vice president and general manager, Cisco Collaboration.
About 73 million meetings took place in March and well over 22 million meetings per week in the last two weeks, Sri Srinivasan added. 
Cisco said the latest user numbers have more than doubled since January. 
The explosion in demand has spurred a huge boom for what were often relatively small businesses while raising issues of privacy and abuse.
Zoom's share price has surged five-fold in value since going public in April last year, but the company has faced a backlash in the past week from users worried about the lack of full encryption of sessions and zoombombing, where uninvited guests crash meetings. 

Cisco said its Webex system, which includes teleconferencing and is older, was fully encrypted.

1458,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2020 11:10PM ET</span>",Explainer: Antitrust law won't get in the way of U.S. acting to raise oil prices,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It is illegal for oil producers to meet to discuss pushing up oil prices under U.S. antitrust law, but perfectly legal if state regulators or the federal government set lower production levels for them, U.S. antitrust experts said on Friday.
That said, the decision by a Texas state official to talk with Saudi Arabia and Russia about supporting oil prices marks a sharp contrast with U.S. policy. A year ago President Donald Trump tweeted that OPEC needed to ""increase the flow of oil. World Markets are fragile, price of Oil getting too high.""
A two-thirds drop in oil prices in the last three months has swiftly changed Washington's thinking on whether or not it should meddle in the energy market.
Trump has called on top producers to stop a market rout caused by the coronavirus pandemic, as OPEC and its allies work on a deal for an unprecedented oil production cut equivalent to around 10% of global supply.
""Trump himself, other federal officials, and Congress cannot violate antitrust (law) by any official actions they take. It doesn't apply to them,"" said Chris Sagers, who teaches antitrust at the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law.  
When oil prices are high, anti-OPEC bills, nicknamed NOPEC, gained traction in Congress. The bills would allow OPEC to be sued in U.S. courts for violating antitrust laws.
Such bills have been introduced in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives for more than a decade, but have never succeeded. In February 2019, the latest version was approved by the House Judiciary Committee.
""From an antitrust perspective, businesses have been complaining about OPEC and complaining about these foreign systems for years,"" said Barbara Sicalides, an antitrust expert at Pepper Hamilton LLP. ""I don't think it's an antitrust violation. It's certainly a change in policy.""
Oil prices have fallen to around $20 per barrel from nearly $65 at the start of the year as more than 3 billion people went into a lockdown, reducing global oil demand by as much as a third.
Texas regulator Ryan Sitton, one of three members of the Texas Railroad Commission, waded into oil diplomacy on Thursday, calling Russia's energy minister to discuss possible oil production curbs and angling for talks with Saudi Arabia as many producers in the U.S. state's biggest industry warned it was near collapse. 
The Oklahoma Energy Producers Alliance has urged its state's regulator to curtail crude oil production.

This kind of conduct in private industry would not be permitted, but under the state action doctrine it is allowed if it is done under the commission's authority, said Sicalides.

1459,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2020 11:10PM ET</span>",Soaring unemployment increases odds U.S. banks will cut dividends,"By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Questions are building about whether big U.S. banks will have to cut dividends later this year as the coronavirus crisis puts a record portion of Americans out of work, making it difficult for borrowers to pay back loans. 
Wall Street analysts were initially skeptical that U.S. lenders would have to follow European counterparts and non-financial companies that have already done so, but in recent days, some have started to take the possibility more seriously.
Banks that have heavy exposure to credit cards are most at risk, they said.
Those lenders, including  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Capital One  Financial Corp (N:COF), may breach Federal Reserve limits on using capital for dividends when loan losses escalate and erode profits.
""One of the most important variables that will determine whether banks have adequate capital to maintain dividends is the extent to which consumers draw down on outstanding credit-card lines,"" Goldman Sachs bank analyst Richard Ramsden said in a report on Thursday.
Credit cards have an ""outsized impact,"" Ramsden said, because lenders have extended some $2 trillion in those loans to consumers, and performance is so closely tied to unemployment.
Card loan loss rates may double under severe economic stress, and be more than three times the rate on commercial loans, he said.
On balance, however, ""all of the banks should be in a position to maintain dividends at, or close to, the current run rate,"" he said.
FINANCIAL HEALTH
Dividends are seen as evidence of good financial health and encourage loyalty from investors who expect that income, which makes companies leery of cutting them.
However, nearly 10 million Americans have filed jobless claims as the coronavirus has shut down retail stores, restaurants and other businesses deemed ""non-essential"" across the country.
Economists expect the unemployment rate may eventually spike as high as 20% and U.S. economic output fall as much as 34% before the country can get back to normal.
The European Central Bank told their lenders on March 27 to skip dividends and share buybacks until at least October, estimating they could save 30 billion euros by doing so.
Although major U.S. banks already halted share repurchases through June to conserve capital, they face political pressure from Democratic lawmakers, prominent former regulators and some economic commentators to cut dividends as well.
Banks have so far resisted those calls, arguing that they are financially stronger than European banks.
""Our dividend is sound,"" Citigroup Chief Executive Mike Corbat told CNBC on Wednesday. ""We plan on continuing to pay it.""
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) CEO David Solomon and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) CEO James Gorman made similar statements in television interviews this week. 
Behind the scenes, however, dividends have increasingly become a top agenda item, an industry lobbyist told Reuters, with bankers discussing what they should do and whether they should coordinate any action.
A main concern is that suspending dividends will hurt share prices at a time when stocks are already under intense stress, the person said, asking not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media.
The industry may have no choice if banks get too close to the Fed's limits on capital use for dividends, analysts said. That could happen as soon as the second half of this year, particularly for major card lenders, as delinquencies and loan-loss provisions increase, Ramsden said.

If unemployment reaches 10%, banks might report less in quarterly profits than they planned to pay out in dividends, Oppenheimer & Co analyst Chris Kotowski said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's lone Democratic commissioner on Friday called for a delay in pending rule changes due to the coronavirus outbreak, while cautioning against excessive regulatory relief in the rush to assist companies struggling with fallout from the pandemic.
Commissioner Allison Lee said the agency ought to allow an additional 60 days for public consultation on measures currently under review so as to ""adequately assess the economic effect"" of relaxing agency rules in light of the economic uncertainty caused by the fast-spreading disease.
""The Commission should carefully analyze each action it takes in light of the altered economic and social landscape,"" Lee said in a statement.
""Relevant considerations in that analysis include whether an action is directly responsive to COVID-19 and whether an action represents an appropriate use of agency resources at a time when we are routinely called upon to take emergency actions,"" she added.
The SEC in March twice issued conditional relief from disclosure requirements for public companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak. [nL1N2BI0MR]
The top U.S. markets watchdog, also granted certain investment funds and investment advisers additional time to hold in-person board meetings and submit other filing requirements, including annual and semi-annual reports.
On Thursday, Reuters reported the financial industry was lobbying for a delay to a June 30 deadline for broker dealers and investment advisers to comply with new agency disclosure rules. [nL1N2BP17U]

""It is crucial that the Commission continue to devote its resources to the most pressing issues faced by investors, market participants and capital markets more broadly,"" Lee said.

1461,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2020 11:10PM ET</span>","GM reduces loan refinancing target, may pay up for new debt","By Michelle Sierra
NEW YORK (LPC) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) will seek to extend maturities on US$6bn in revolving loans rather than refinance a US$16.5bn credit facility following discussions with its bank group during an unprecedented health crisis in the US.
The company originally went out to its JP Morgan and Citigroup-led bank group in early March requesting to push maturities on the US$16.5bn in revolving credit facilities as part of its regular-way liability management operations. 
The transaction was meant to roll over maturities, but leave pricing unchanged, several sources familiar with the discussions said. 
But GM’s decision to refinance came at a time when the company is facing a longer than expected shutdown of its plants and considerable revenue losses amid a crisis of extraordinary magnitude that has created a playing field much different from when it last underwent refinancing discussions in 2019.
Complicating negotiations further, the company decided to draw down US$16bn on its revolver on March 27 while the refinancing talks with its bank group were taking place.
“To shore up liquidity and strengthen its financial position due to global market uncertainty from the coronavirus pandemic,” the company said on March 24 about its plans to draw down the facility.
The originally proposed refinancing included a US$2bn 364-day loan and a US$4bn three-year loan. It also included a US$10.5bn, five-year facility, said several sources familiar with the original refinancing discussions. 
The new plan is expected to only address the short-term maturities, including the US$2bn one-year loan, and the US$4bn three-year loan, the sources said.
The one-year loan is looking to pay 25bp undrawn, while the three-year loan may pay 40bp undrawn. 
When fully drawn, the loans could pay 175bp over Libor, the sources familiar with the transaction said. 
An option to convert the one-year revolving credit into a term loan after one year is also expected to be removed, the sources said. 
GM’s 364-day loan currently pays 12.5bp undrawn, the three-year pays 15bp undrawn. 
The drawn margin on the two facilities is 125bp over Libor.
The new refinancing plan will leave in place the US$10.5bn credit facility. Pricing on the five-year is expected to stay unchanged at 125bp over Libor and 17.5bp undrawn.
Commitments are due April 10.
GM also has a US$3bn revolving credit it entered into in January 2019 when it refinanced the other three tranches. The new loan increased the company's borrowing capacity to US$19.5bn.

A  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) spokesperson declined to comment. Spokespeople for GM and JP Morgan did not immediately return requests for comment.

1462,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2020 08:50PM ET</span>",U.S. airlines apply for U.S. payroll help but terms still unclear,"By Tracy Rucinski and David Shepardson
CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major U.S. airlines applied on Friday for payroll grants from the U.S. Treasury meant to keep workers employed during a sharp downturn from the coronavirus, though the terms of any aid were still unclear and some warned that funds would not be enough to help them through their toughest crisis ever.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc, United Airlines Holdings Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and JetBlue Airways Corp each said they had submitted grant applications but did not disclose details or terms.
Treasury had asked companies to propose financial instruments such as warrants or equity options as possible taxpayer compensation for up to $32 billion in payroll grants for airlines, cargo carriers and airport contractors under the CARES Act passed by Congress last week.
Treasury set a 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT) Friday deadline to expedite the grants. There is a second final deadline on April 27.
The airline industry has pushed back on the possibility of the government taking an equity stake in exchange for the grants, which the companies and unions argue are strictly to protect workers.
Southwest made clear on Friday that government support is just one possible source of capital it is evaluating, with talks over the terms of any government agreement expected over the next several days.
In memos to employees, Delta and JetBlue executives warned that government funds would not be enough to help them weather an unprecedented crisis in which they are spending more cash every day than they are bringing in.
Companies were allowed to ask Treasury for the amount they paid in salaries and benefits in the second and third quarters of 2019, and must agree to keep their workforce until Sept. 30 and maintain a certain level of air service.
American Airlines, with the largest number of full-time employees among U.S. airlines at 133,700 in 2019, had said it would seek up to $6 billion in grants and $6 billion in government loans under a separate $32 billion funding option for the sector. 
American stock hit a record low on Friday, and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, which is among the largest shareholders of the top U.S. airlines, said it sold about 18% of its Delta stake and 4% of its Southwest holding.
Among cargo carriers, FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) said it could benefit from certain government relief options after outlining other steps it is taking to save cash and boost liquidity, including slashing its chief executive officer's pay and drawing down $1.5 billion from a credit facility.
Cargo carriers are suffering from disruption to global supply chains and high-margin business-to-business demand, even as ground-package delivery services increase.
Airlines have also raised debt and taken a series of cost-cutting measures as they ground an unprecedented number of planes and implement new policies on ticket refunds and exchanges in an effort to encourage passengers to book flights.
Passenger airlines are eligible for $25 billion in cash grants, cargo carriers $4 billion and airport contractors like caterers and airplane cleaners $3 billion, and an equal amount in loans.
Other airlines across the world are also seeking government aid as they brace for a prolonged downturn, with Air France-KLM in talks with banks to receive up to 6 billion euros ($6.5 billion) in loans guaranteed by the French and Dutch governments, sources told Reuters.

Planemakers are also preparing for a slump in demand, with Reuters reporting on Friday that Airbus SE is studying a sharp cut in output of its top-selling A320 jet series.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Paul Singer's Elliott International Ltd hedge fund gained an estimated 0.1% in March and is now up 2.2% for the year through the first quarter, according to an update sent to clients on Friday and seen by Reuters.
A spokesman for New York-based Elliott Management Corp did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
What drove the gains amid the coronavirus-driven market rout was unclear. Elliott invests in various types of securities and has recently engaged in activist-style bets on SoftBank Group Corp, Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR).
Elliott, founded by Singer in 1977, is one of the world's largest and best performing hedge fund firms, with $40.5 billion under management as of Dec. 31, according to a recent regulatory filing.

Singer, known for his contributions to conservative political causes, has long been known for his relatively pessimistic views of what he saw as markets that were artificially propped up by excessive government debt.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes fell more than 1.5% on Friday as the coronavirus abruptly ended a record U.S. job growth streak of 113 months, intensifying fears of a deep economic slowdown.
Even the loss of 701,000 jobs that Labor Department data showed for March did not completely capture the economic damage from the virus. The survey considered data only until mid-March, before widespread U.S. lockdowns put more people out of work.
The worldwide spread of the virus has forced billions of people to stay indoors and pushed entire sectors to the brink of collapse, triggering mass layoffs and dramatic steps by companies to raise cash.
""Even as investors may be bracing for some grim economic reports over the next several weeks, we got a very sober reminder of what is to come by way of today’s jobs report,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
Investors were also anxious heading into the weekend due to the possibility for ""particularly ugly"" weekend news on coronavirus case counts or new hot spots around the country, Luschini said. 
The S&P 500 closed down almost 27% from its mid-February record high close, or about $7 trillion in market value, and economists have cut their forecasts for U.S. GDP, with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) now predicting a 38% contraction in the second quarter. 
""This is not like December 2018. We're not likely to see a V shaped recovery because we haven't even begun to really tackle the main issue behind why this is happening. That's still an ongoing process. It's going to take time,"" said Mike Turvey, TD Ameritrade's institutional senior trading strategist
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 360.91 points, or 1.69%, to 21,052.53, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 38.25 points, or 1.51%, to 2,488.65 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 114.23 points, or 1.53%, to 7,373.08.
Of the S&P 500's 11 major sectors utilities (SPLRCU) was the biggest laggard, down 3.6%, followed by materials (SPLRCM) and financials (SPSY), with declines of more than 2%. 
Only consumer staples (SPLRCS) rose and ended the day up 0.5% as the sector is seen as a defensive play, with consumers still needing to eat and buy household goods in a recession. 
The energy sector (SPNY) was one of the best performers. U.S. President Trump met with U.S. oil company executives at the White House and said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russian President Vladimir Putin both want something to happen to stabilize the global oil market, where prices have fallen by about two-thirds this year.
Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) shares fell 3% after it said it would furlough some U.S. employees this month, while sources said luxury retailer Neiman Marcus was stepping up preparations to seek bankruptcy protection.
Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Technologies Corp (N:RTX), formed by the merger of United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) and  Raytheon Co , shed 7.75% as it pulled its 2020 outlook for its aerospace units.
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) rose 5.6% after the electric-car maker said production and deliveries of its Model Y sport utility vehicle were ahead of schedule.
On U.S. exchanges 11.57 billion shares changed hands compared with the 15.75 billion average for the last 20 sessions. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.73-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 5 new highs and 179 new lows.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), widely known as ""Wall Street's fear gauge,"" ended at 46.80, its lowest closing level since March 6.

1466,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 03, 2020 06:52PM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"By Geoffrey Smith, Yasin Ebrahim and Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Wall Street ended a volatile week on a down note as the Covid-19 pandemic kept a grip on market swings.
Oil also had its part to play in market direction, with huge spikes coming from expected production cuts, as did dour employment figures.
But away from the main headlines there were some startling moves for the stock of a French investment bank, some advice on how the auto sector may emerge from the lockdown economy and some data illustrating how consumers are ensuring they can still have a drink or two.
Here are three things that flew under the radar this week.
1. The Singular Affair of  Natixis 
The volatility caused by Covid-19 has thrown up some head-fakes, but few stranger than the one involving French investment bank and asset manager Natixis (PA:CNAT) over the last couple of weeks.
Investors in the stock have been twitchy ever since last June when it revealed that H20, its 51%-owned asset management arm, had an uncomfortably high exposure to illiquid, unrated bonds.
So, they feared the worst when it announced last month that some of its bond funds had lost over 50% in a few weeks. Morningstar castigated it for “repeated failures” of risk management. Natixis stock lost two-thirds of its value in the first two weeks of March.
Then the weirdness started.
Natixis was suddenly sucked into the basket of stocks tracked by at least one European dividend-based ETF, taking the place of real estate company Unibail-Rodamco (AS:URW) when it suspended its payout and disqualified itself from the fund’s benchmark index. Forced buying by passive investors then exaggerated an upward correction, driving the stock up over 100% over the next 10 days.
It was too good to last. Last weekend, European banking regulators recommended that the banks they supervise suspend their dividends to ensure their cash buffers are enough to weather the coming crisis. After a brief struggle with its conscience, Natixis acquiesced – promptly forcing the ETF-driven buyers to ditch it again. After a resounding 19% drop in Friday, the stock had fallen 47% in total this week, making it the worst performer of all European banks.
Efficient markets – gotta love ‘em.
2. Wall Street Looks to China for Auto Playbook
With the Covid-19 pandemic in the U.S. set for its darkest days yet in the coming weeks, many are worried about the road ahead for the auto sector. But some on Wall Street have turned to China for clues and see a recovery on the horizon as early as next year.
""China's recovering auto sales offer a useful playbook for those plotting out the coronavirus cycle in Europe and the U.S.,"" Evercore ISI said as first-quarter auto sales plunged in the U.S.
In the first quarter, Ford Motor's (NYSE:F) sales slumped 12.5%, Fiat Chrysler's (NYSE:FCAU) 10% and General Motors' (NYSE:GM) 7%.
U.S. auto sales are on course for a 12% decline this year, followed by a quick rebound expected in 2021, underpinned by global stimulus and pent-up demand, Evercore ISI estimated based on auto sales in China following the outbreak.
China recorded an 80%-to-90% fall to a 3 million to 4 million seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR), a measure used in the automobile industry to account for car sales, in February following the lockdown. It then saw a climb in March to 11 million SAAR and is forecasting a further pickup to 15 million SAAR for April. 
""We can use this China playbook -- a big down then two to three months sequentially up -- over a lengthier 4-to-6 month curve in the U.S. and Europe,"" Evercore ISI said.
But the recovery in autos, much like in other sectors, hinges on how long the lockdown measures across the U.S. remain in place.
If the stay-at-home measures are lifted, a quick recovery may lie ahead, with the auto industry going back to ""something resembling business as usual,"" said Thomas King, chief product officer for J.D. Power, according to CNBC.
3. Drinking at Home
It appears there’s only so much streaming people can do to stay occupied during lockdown. Alcohol home sales spiked in March with bars and restaurants closed across the country.
Alcoholic beverage sales jumped 55% for the week ended March 21 from the same period a year ago, according to data from Nielsen.
Spirits were the beverage of choice (perhaps because they deliver more booze for less storage space for those stocking up for the long haul). Spirits sales surged 75% from the year-ago period, wine rose a healthy 66% and beer rose 35%.
Online sales of alcohol rocketed up 234%.
Indicative of customers not used to mixing up a few drinks at home, sales of pre-made cocktails jumped 106%. The top spirits were tequila, up 90% from the same period a year ago, and gin, up 89%. When customers chose beer, 24 and 30 packs were the big sellers.
But Nielsen Vice President Danelle Kosmal said the period in question may be the peak as people bought big to hunker down and data for the week ended March 28 would be a better indicator of demand, the AP reported.
Even with the spike, beverage stocks will continue to be under pressure, as a continued surge in home purchases couldn’t hope to make up for the wholesale trade, with from businesses from local bars to sports stadiums shuttered.
In the past month, Anheuser Busch Inbev (NYSE:BUD) and Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) are down around 25%, while  Molson Coors  Brewing (NYSE:TAP) has fallen 20%.
Diageo (NYSE:DEO) is down around 17% and Brown Forman (NYSE:BFb) is off about 13%.
Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) is showing resilience, though, down just 2.4%."

(Reuters) - At least two U.S. state attorneys have sought information from Zoom Video Communications Inc following multiple reports that questioned the privacy and security of the video-conferencing app.
Zoom's popularity has surged as employees at businesses, schools and millions of other organizations across the world work from home due to lockdowns imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
""We are alarmed by the Zoom-bombing incidents and are seeking more information from the company about its privacy and security measures in coordination with other state attorneys general,"" Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Boston office on Monday warned Zoom users not to make meetings on the site public or share links widely after it received two reports of unidentified individuals invading school sessions, a phenomenon known as ""zoombombing"".
New York State AG Letitia James has sent a letter to Zoom with a number of questions to ensure the company is taking appropriate steps to ensure users' privacy and security, a spokesperson said.
Elon Musk's rocket company SpaceX on Wednesday banned its employees from using the video-conferencing app, citing ""significant privacy and security concerns,"" according to a memo seen by Reuters.
A Zoom spokesperson said the company would begin talks with officials on the issues. 

""We appreciate the outreach we have received on these issues from various elected officials and look forward to engaging with them,"" the spokesperson said.

The company has begun meeting with union-represented employees in small groups after rejecting two contract extension proposals from the union, said Ricky Brooks, president of United Steelworkers union local 13-2001, which represents hourly workers at Baytown. 
“They’ve begun in-house scare and misinformation meetings, leveraging the uncertainty of COVID-19 to get all of their issues and force the union to forego all of its issues,” Brooks said. “They have held the pattern wages hostage if the union moves to go to the table.”
COVID-19 is the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Pattern wages refers to the national pattern agreement reached in January 2019 between the USW International and U.S. refiners that sets wage increases for all USW-represented workers. 
Under the proposal rejected in January, pay was set to go up 3.5% in the first year and 4% in the second year. In the third year, the increase would match the pay hike in the new national agreement the USW will negotiate for oil industry workers with energy companies in January 2022.
Brooks said the company has suggested the pay proposals would be less if the two sides go back to the bargaining table. 
Negotiations for a new contract to replace the current pact that expires on May 15 began in December with a company-proposed three-year extension that was rejected in January by workers in the 560,500 barrel-per-day refinery and the complex’s laboratory.
Chemical plant workers accepted the extension. 
The sticking point for refinery and lab workers is Exxon’s proposal to lengthen by six months the time before a new workers’ wages reach the same level as veteran workers.
Exxon spokesman Jeremy Eikenberry declined to discuss the negotiations.
Even though the current contract expires on May 15, the refinery and lab workers could not walk off their jobs for 60 days nor could Exxon lock them out under an agreement between the company and the union.

1476,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2020 05:00PM ET</span>",U.S. regulators to go easy on mortgage firms that miss customer response deadlines: source,"By Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. bank supervisors will not penalize mortgage companies if they miss regulatory deadlines for communicating with borrowers while fielding an unprecedented surge in queries due to disruptions caused by the novel coronavirus, an official at a banking regulator said. 
The banking agencies plan to issue guidance soon that will effectively waive rules requiring mortgage lenders and servicers respond to borrowers within a specific time frame on matters such as delinquencies and balance errors, the source said. 
""There would be no...action if a bank doesn’t technically comply with mandated timelines so long as there’s a good faith effort and it’s in the interest of addressing core coronavirus concerns,"" the official said.
Lenders have been inundated with calls and queries from borrowers unable to make payments after losing jobs due to widespread business shutdowns aimed at slowing the spread of the virus. Bank operations are also struggling with much of their staff working from home. 
That has made it harder for mortgage companies to comply with laws that guard against abusive lending practices, including the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, which set stringent turnaround times for responding to borrowers on a range of issues. 
The relief would be temporary and should address worries on the part of banks that they would face strict penalties or other enforcement action if they failed to meet the regulatory deadlines, the source said. This will allow banks to focus on critical queries on repayment relief and other forbearance issues.
A spokesperson for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency declined to comment. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Federal Reserve Board did not respond immediately to requests for comment.
Big banks like  JP Morgan Chase  & Co (N:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) have all promised assistance to borrowers in recent weeks, though U.S. borrowers seeking reprieve from big banks have said they were not getting the help they expected. 
Many banks on Friday also had to reallocate staff to assist a flood of small business customers racing to secure a $350 billion pot of government rescue loans.
Banking regulators around the world have been offering breaks and easing restrictions on banks to prevent liquidity issues as the coronavirus pandemic grips the global economy. They have given breaks on banks' capital requirements, relief on new accounting requirements and have urged banks to get back into small-dollar lending.

Investing.com – The Dow capped off a wild week of trading on a sour note Friday, as the worst monthly jobs report since the financial crisis was widely viewed as an eerie signal that deeper economic pain lies ahead as the Covid-19 pandemic intensifies.
The Dow fell 1.69%, or 360 points. The S&P 500 slipped 1.51% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.53%
U.S. nonfarm payrolls fell by 701,000 in March, pushing the unemployment rate up to 4.4%. But the pace of infections in the U.S. showed little sign of abating, raising the prospect of a longer, economically bruising lockdown that will keep businesses shut and accelerate job cuts.
""This is just the start and it will get much, much worse … we could see a further 8-10 million job losses in the subsequent two weeks – we should be braced for a 10-11% reading for April unemployment rate with 15% conceivable for May,"" ING said.
That would rival some of the darkest of economic times. The Global Financial Crisis saw unemployment peak at 10%, while the post-war high was 10.8% in 1982, ING added.
The rise in coronavirus cases in the U.S. has exacerbated fears, with infections topping a quarter million and deaths surging above 6,000.
New York state, the epicenter of the outbreak, reported more than 100,000 known cases and 2,935 deaths seen overnight, its biggest one-day rise.
Less than a week after the ink dried on the historic $2 trillion coronavirus fiscal rescue package, investors are eyeing another wave of stimulus.
""The acceleration of the coronavirus demands that we double down on the downpayment we made in CARES by passing a CARES 2 package,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. ""We must extend and expand this bipartisan legislation to meet the needs of the American people."""
1479,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 03, 2020 03:54PM ET</span>",Fed Cuts Pace of QE Treasury Buying to $50 Billion Per Day,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve has further dialed back the pace at which it plans to buy Treasuries under its unlimited quantitative easing program.
The U.S. central bank, which has been aggressively purchasing Treasuries in a bid to offset the economic and market fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, on Friday said that it would dial back the daily pace of buying to $50 billion next week. The pace had been $60 billion for its most recent two days of purchases, down from an earlier speed of $75 billion per day.
The central bank announced its return to quantitative easing last month as virus concerns ripped through global markets and the prospects for the global economy cratered. It subsequently declared that it would purchase assets “in the amounts needed to support the smooth functioning of markets.”
Treasuries fell following the Fed’s announcement, taking the 10-year yield up to around 0.62%, while U.S. stocks held their decline for the day. The Bloomberg Dollar Index remained up.
The scaling back of purchases “is being seen as a sign that Fed sees less of a need to clean up balance sheets and counter the excess selling pressures that had come into the market,” said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities in New York. “That’s pushing yields higher.”
Purchases through Friday have totaled around $1 trillion. The Fed plans to buy Treasuries on Monday through Thursday next week, with markets closed Friday in observance of a holiday.
The program’s purpose -- “to support the smooth functioning of markets” that had become impaired -- has been at least partially achieved, with key metrics such as off-the-run spreads and the cash-futures basis moving back toward normal levels. Major economic and financial concerns stemming from the coronavirus pandemic nonetheless continue to affect markets.

Investing.com – The Dow deepened its selloff Friday, as rising Covid-19 infections and deaths in the U.S. raised fears about a prolonged shutdown at a time when the economy appears to be on rocky ground following the worst monthly jobs report since the financial crisis.
The Dow fell 2.43%, or 519 points. The S&P 500 slumped 2.32% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.31%.
Coronavirus infections in the U.S. neared a quarter million and deaths topped 6,000, with the country reporting 1,169 deaths on Thursday, the highest daily rise recorded worldwide so far.
In Italy, however, there is a glimmer of hope as the pace of infections continues to slow. Infections rose 4% to 119,827 overnight.
The rising infection count in the U.S. has some worried the government could extend its lockdown measures, including social distancing, beyond the end of April, a move that would throw the U.S. into further economic turmoil and deepen the widely-expected global recession. 
""This is in my lifetime humanity’s darkest hour, a big threat to the whole world and it requires for us to stand us, be united,""  Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF, said, according to CNBC. “It is way worse than the global financial crisis” of 2008-09, she said.
“This is a crisis like no other.”
Sentiment on the economy was dealt a blow as U.S. nonfarm payrolls slumped by 701,000 in March and the unemployment rate climbed to 4.4%.
But many fear the worst is yet to come as the March's jobs report did not reflect the full extent of the coronavirus outbreak.
Utilities and energy stocks led the selloff on Wall Street.
Energy stocks gave back some of their gains from a day earlier, falling 2.6%, even as oil prices continued to advance on growing hopes of production, with Russia reportedly expected to join the OPEC+ meeting on Monday.
Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly suggested oil producers should carry out a coordinated production cut of around 10 million barrels per day."

1492,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 03, 2020 01:36PM ET</span>",Oil’s Stunning Demand Collapse Threatens Closures Everywhere,"(Bloomberg) -- The survivors of oil’s last crash were the lowest-cost producers. But the crisis engulfing the industry now is so fast, the same rules don’t apply.
From the shale patch of Texas and the oil sands of Canada to the plains of Siberia, production of at least one in every 10 barrels around the world is likely to be shuttered as demand is shredded by the coronavirus pandemic. Cost won’t be the ultimate arbiter for producers this time, because as the International Energy Agency says, “there could soon be no place for their oil to go.”
Every imaginable space -- from tanks and pipelines to rail cars -- is filling to the brim. It’s a key reason that pressure is building for an output cut by OPEC and other producers at their meeting next week, though even the 10 million barrels a day of curbs that’s been touted may not be enough. Only those who can find a place to shelter their unwanted crude are likely to remain standing.
“It’s important to think about who’s going to shut in. It’s all dictated by logistics and where you sit in these major pipelines around the world,” Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., said in a Bloomberg television interview. “It’s going to be Russia, the U.S., Canada and parts of Latin America where you see the real damage.”
Staggering Destruction
The rout in demand is staggering. With large swathes of the global economy shut down to tackle the virus pandemic, with no idea of how long it’ll continue, some oil traders are estimating an unprecedented 35 million barrels a day destruction in oil use.
Even if OPEC and other producers agree to a 10 million barrels a day of output cuts -- in itself a mammoth undertaking -- the IEA estimates 15 million a day of stockpile would still build up.
When oil last collapsed five years ago it was America’s shale producers who took the immediate hit because of their sensitivity to price swings, and the nation’s industry is set to be battered again. Pipeline operators have asked drillers in Texas to ratchet back output.
This time round everyone is sharing the pain. About 7 million barrels of daily output due to be shipped next month by a range of exporters is “homeless,” with “literally nowhere to go,” consultant JBC Energy GmbH estimates.
Production is starting to buckle everywhere.
IHS Markit expects as much as 10 million barrels a day of output to be shut-in from April through June as storage fills up. In Canada, Athabasca Oil Corp. suspended some oil sands operations and Suncor Energy Inc. said last month it will partly shut some of its fields.
Brazil’s Petrobras is paring production by 200,000 barrels a day. Landlocked Chad in Africa has halted two fields, and Ecuador,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). said, “isn’t able to sell its crude anywhere to anybody.”
Producers who are operating offshore, or have access to coastal terminals, possess the widest options to reroute their barrels and will be the most “immune,” Goldman’s Currie said. Those “sitting behind thousands of miles of pipe” are the most exposed.
Russia Vulnerable
Russia, despite having helped initiate the global price war, is among those particularly vulnerable to its fallout. As sales from ports and its Druzhba pipeline melt away, the country could be incapable of selling about 1 million barrels a day of its output, according to Ed Morse, head of commodities research at Citi.
Neighbors such as Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, both far away from their customers, face “severe offtake issues,” said David Wech, an analyst at JBC Energy in Vienna.
While logistics are critical, oil’s collapse is simply making some production unprofitable. At $25 a barrel crude, about 5% of global production is losing money, according to the IEA.
Companies are also slashing spending.  BP  (LON:BP) Plc will invest less in its U.S. shale operations this year as it looks to reduce expenditure by about $5 billion, lowering production. Some North Sea fields just aren’t economical at current oil prices.
“In the short-term, low prices will decrease supply by incentivizing reduced production,” said Paul Horsnell, an analyst at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc.
Emerging Winner
Amid the carnage, there may still be a winner. Saudi Arabia, OPEC kingpin and the main architect of the bruising price war, can pump crude from its vast fields at less than $10 a barrel. It also has access to plentiful storage around the world -- from Egypt to Japan.
Riyadh is flooding the market with crude as it threatens to pump at record high levels, contributing to oil’s rout and forcing producers to consider an output agreement.
The kingdom is convening an emergency online gathering of the OPEC+ coalition on Monday. The meeting is open to producers worldwide, including the U.S. If America were to join coordinated production cuts, that would be an unprecedented move away from the country’s free-market ethics.
But there are no guarantees that a deal can be reached. And even if an expanded alliance is made and the currently discussed 10 million barrels a day of cuts are agreed, it would ultimately be insufficient in the face of such an enormous glut.
“The market is going to be shutting stuff down whether you like it or not,” said Jan Stuart, global energy economist at Cornerstone Macro LLC. “That horse has left the barn.”

1497,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2020 01:11PM ET</span>",U.S. small businesses flood Bank of America with loan applications,"By Imani Moise
(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) said on Friday it has already received about 35,000 applications for federally backed small-business loans within hours of starting to accept them.
The second largest U.S. bank by assets became the first major bank to accept applications for the massive small-business rescue program approved by Congress last week. But the bank was already being criticized on social media after its CEO said on CNBC that it was prioritizing existing customers.
""Speed is of the essence here for these types of small businesses,"" Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said in a CNBC interview on Friday. ""The money will start to go out the door once these applications are processed over the next short period of time.""
Small businesses, which employ about half of U.S. private sector employees, have been hit hard during the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which has caused cities to shut down non-essential businesses. Many people are staying home, which has sharply cut into consumer spending.
Bank of America's consumer transaction volume fell from an average of $60 billion a week to $40 billion through March, Moynihan said.
Seeking to bail out millions of small businesses and slow unemployment, Congress included $349 billion for small firms in its $2 trillion stimulus package passed last week. Small businesses will need to rely on banks to get the funds.
Banks have been scrambling to prepare for overwhelming demand for the loans while awaiting guidance from the government. As of Friday morning, competitors JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) were not accepting applications on their website.
""Wells Fargo is working as quickly as possible to be ready to assist small-business customers as part of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP),"" a spokesman said in a statement.
Bank of America is prioritizing processing applications for small-business clients that already have a borrowing relationship with the bank, Moynihan said.
""If you borrow from another bank ... Please go back to them because they're your core bank and they know you the best and can process you the fastest,"" he said.

It has also drawn criticism from Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who chairs the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. After hearing from a Bank of America customer who was denied a loan he called the credit account stipulation a ""a ridiculous requirement that isn’t anywhere in law,"" in a tweet on Friday.

1508,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 03, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",Market’s Jobs Response Signals Yield-Curve Control Is Here,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If the past two days of trading in U.S. Treasuries are any guide, yield-curve control might have already reached the world’s biggest bond market.
On Thursday, Labor Department data showed a record 6.65 million people filed jobless claims in the week ended March 28, blowing past estimates for 3.76 million. When added to the previous week’s tally, it showed almost 10 million Americans were out of work because of the coronavirus pandemic. And yet, 10-year Treasuries took those figures in stride. The borrowing benchmark fluctuated by less than 7 basis points, the tightest range since Feb. 19, the same day the S&P 500 Index hit a record high. It closed 1 basis point higher than where it started the day, at 0.597%.
On Friday, Labor Department data showed U.S. payrolls fell 701,000 in March compared with February, the first decline since 2010 and far exceeding the median forecast for a 100,000 drop. The jobless rate rose to 4.4%, the highest since 2017, and strategists are already expecting the April report to show nothing short of a crash, with 20 million jobs lost and an unemployment rate of 15%. Again, 10-year Treasuries barely budged at about 0.59%.
From an economic state-of-play perspective, Friday’s jobs report was always going to be stale. It only captured payrolls from the week that included March 12 — when many people were still reporting to work as usual. Bond traders are paid to look ahead, and no employment figures right now will help in that effort. They have the same question as the rest of America: “Is the worst over yet?”
Until they get an answer, the best way forward seems to be counting on the Federal Reserve to take whatever actions are necessary to keep the $17 trillion Treasuries market in order. Effectively, bond traders seem to be entering a period of unofficial “yield-curve control” as long as the world’s largest economy deliberately grinds to a standstill.
The increase in the Fed’s balance sheet since the job report’s reference date has been nothing short of extraordinary. The central bank gobbled up $1.5 trillion of assets in the past three weeks, far and away the steepest climb on record. It has started to scale back only slightly, while also introducing a temporary repurchase agreement facility that lets other central banks swap Treasuries for dollars. That should stem forced sales by so-called foreign official holders.
It seems reasonable to expect the Fed to continue outright purchases for the foreseeable future, given that the Treasury will ramp up issuance to cover the $2 trillion coronavirus relief package. Taking cues from the central bank is at least a more reliable strategy than trying to read between the lines of horrid jobs data. Wage growth, once the most important figure in the monthly release, is now meaningless. Average hourly earnings actually beat expectations in March by rising 3.1%, likely because a large group of lower-paid workers lost their jobs.
I have called yield-curve control, an idea championed last year by Fed Governor Lael Brainard, a bond trader’s nightmare. That’s probably still true, though the wild price swings of March were arguably even more frightening. To be clear, the central bank has not officially set any sort of target. But it has provided clear forward guidance: the Fed will buy “in the amounts needed to support the smooth functioning of markets for Treasury securities and agency MBS.”
With so much still unknown about how long it will take the U.S. to slow the pace of the coronavirus outbreak and what the ultimate economic damage will look like, it makes sense that traders would find comfort in a range. While Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). technical strategists said this week that 10-year yields could hit zero in the next three months, somewhere around the current 0.6% feels about right, given what’s known about the labor market and nationwide shutdowns so far, as well as what’s contained in the relief package.
Treasuries have little data to trade on except glimmers of hope that the global economy will get to the other side of this crisis sooner rather than later. That’s not a backdrop for decisive trades. It’s not quite yield-curve control, but it’s close.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets fell in late morning trading Friday after government data suggested that the U.S. economy shed jobs faster than widely expected as the Covid-19 started to hit and deaths in New York saw the biggest one-day rise.
By 11:25 AM ET (1525 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 370 points, or 1.7%, while the S&P 500 was down 1.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was off 1.3%.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics had said earlier that nonfarm employment in the U.S. fell by 701,000 in the month to mid-March, far more than the 100,000 drop expected.
Even those data have been largely rendered meaningless by the record spike in jobless claims in the two weeks since the cut-off date for the BLS’s report. In those two weeks, some 10 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits.
Later this morning, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said New York deaths from Covid-19 rose to 2935 from 2373.
Among individual stocks, the standout outperformer was Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which said after the bell on Thursday that it had delivered 88,400 cars in the first quarter. The company noted that it deliveries of its Model Y crossover SUV had begun in January and continued 'well ahead of schedule.' Tesla stock rose 7%.
Carnival (NYSE:CCL) shares rose 3% as the market digested the cruise line operator's mammoth refinancing earlier in the week. 
Oil producers were also in the spotlight again, as newswire reports appeared to show the makings of a global agreement to cut oil supplies and rebalance a market that is struggling badly with oversupply due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
The OPEC+ group of oil exporters, which includes Russia and Saudi Arabia, is set to hold a virtual meeting on Monday, while President Donald Trump is set to meet with representatives of the U.S. oil industry later Friday. Newswires reported a draft proposal from OPEC that Saudi Arabia was prepared to cut at least 3 million barrels a day of production, and Russia 1.5 million, if other producers such as the U.S., Canada and Brazil cut 2 million b/d."

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy plans to tighten health checks to ensure that work is not disrupted in a small northern town specialising in the production of medical supplies to tackle its coronavirus crisis.
The area snuggled around the medieval town of Mirandola has become a focus for desperate health authorities seeking to source equipment in the European country where COVID-19 has taken the most deadly toll.
Already home to a cluster of companies making high-end products for dialysis, heart surgery and transfusions, it has found itself on the front line of efforts to treat patients during the pandemic.
""This is a key strategic sector that we need to nurture and we're going to make sure it stays open for business,"" said Sergio Venturi, coronavirus czar for the northern region of Emilia Romagna where Mirandola is located.
The idea is to ask companies to carry out swab tests on their employees to help monitor the health of workers in an area deemed of national strategic interest. Faster tests being developed in a nearby laboratory could also come into play once validated. 
""What we're looking to do is ask for daily screening for all staff in the area so there's no risk of the virus leading to a shutdown. We can't afford that,"" Venturi told Reuters.
The measures underline the importance of the hub, created around 50 years ago by the pharmacist and entrepreneur Mario Veronesi.
CLUSTER OF COMPANIES
Mirandola, which has a population of only around 24,000, plays host to about 100 high-tech medical companies including Germany's Fresenius SE (DE:FREG), ventilator multinational  Medtronic  (N:MDT), and UK respiratory support group Intersurgical. 
Companies have been working flat out on coronavirus-related production such as filters and circuits to help supply oxygen, and disposable medical items to hook patients up to ventilators.
Production in the area, badly damaged in a deadly earthquake eight years ago, has shot up by more than 20%.
Dimar, one of a handful of companies producing respiratory helmets, had police and staff from Italy's Civil Protection unit knocking on its doors to take stock back to neighbouring Lombardy, one of Italy's worst affected regions.
The company, which supplies emergency departments in around 125 hospitals, has ratcheted up output of its face-covering helmets that allow patients to be treated away from overwhelmed intensive care units. 
""We wanted to double production but it's just not possible since that would require building plant and that takes more than six months,"" Dimar founder Maurizio Borsari said, adding that problems faced by suppliers, transport bottlenecks and a shortage of raw materials was also holding up work.
Borsari said police patrols in the district had risen sharply since the crisis started to protect businesses. 
LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
A dearth of equipment such as surgical masks and ventilators has left hospitals and medical staff across the north struggling to cope, and concern is growing the spread of the virus to the poorer south could cause some health systems there to collapse. 
It was another Mirandola company, UK-based Intersurgical, that in 72 hours last month built a prototype circuit developed by an Italian medical team allowing two patients to use the same ventilator – effectively doubling capacity at a stroke.
Giuliana Gavioli, regulatory director at German dialysis and blood product group B. Braun, points to the role of local expertise in underpinning broader efforts to fight COVID-19. 
""They're giving special status to this district because of its biomed pedigree and they want to get a task force in place to move on a series of fronts such as identifying product lines that can be converted to produce vital equipment and medical devices,"" she said.
She points to the example of recent start-up Tecnopolo, which has around 20 researchers.
Set up in 2015 to provide biotech research services, it now concentrates on certifying the masks made by a legion of companies around the country that have switched from other product lines such as fashion.

""Work has ballooned. We’re in contact with around 250 companies across the country that want their production lines authorised,"" says Tecnopolo coordinator Laura Aldrovandi.

""There is no agreement on Kurzarbeit, the management board is reviewing options,"" a Lufthansa spokesman said in response to a question about whether Germanwings was slated for closure or whether shortened work hours would be implemented. 
Kurzarbeit is a policy tool in Germany which allows companies to slash wage bills by tapping an unemployment fund overseen by Germany's Federal Employment Office. Once a company agrees to it, it cannot implement forced layoffs on those employees slated for shorter work hours.
Vereinigung Cockpit, and UFO, trade unions representing pilots and cabin crew had negotiated a proposal to put 1,400 Germanwings staff on shortened work hours, which Lufthansa then declined to implement.

""The future of Germanwings is increasingly called into question,"" Lufthansa added.

1516,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2020 10:55AM ET</span>",Trump to host Big Oil execs at White House to discuss market slump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with oil company executives at the White House on Friday afternoon to discuss a historic oil-price slump threatening their businesses, brought on by the coronavirus outbreak and a Saudi-Russia price war.
The administration may offer ways to help the industry weather the crisis, including waiving royalty payments drillers must pay for oil produced on federal lands, imposing an import tariff on foreign crude oil or easing shipping regulations, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Trump is also likely to highlight his efforts to push Moscow and Riyadh to end their price war and tighten the taps to boost prices, the main hope for an ailing U.S. drilling industry that supported his presidential campaign.
Friday's meeting is expected to begin around 2 p.m. ET and include representatives from  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM),  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX), Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY), Continental Resources (N:CRL), the American Petroleum Institute and others, according to three sources familiar with the matter. One of the sources said Trump would host a teleconference with scores of smaller independent drillers later in the afternoon.
Trump said on Thursday that Saudi Arabia and Russia had agreed to cut output by an unprecedented 10 million to 15 million barrels per day (bpd), representing 10% to 15% of global supply, after he discussed the issue with their leaders. 
The countries did not confirm the plan, but said they were willing to discuss ways to stabilize the market with other major world oil producers.
Trump said he had made no concessions to Saudi Arabia or Russia and did not agree to a U.S. production cut - an idea that would violate U.S. anti-trust law. A U.S. official told Reuters on Thursday that the slide in prices had already forced drillers to reduce production.
The United States in recent years has become the world's biggest oil producer, which has at times put it in competition with Russia and countries in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, even as it imposes sanctions on cartel members Venezuela and Iran.
Global oil prices have fallen by roughly two-thirds this year, raising the specter of a wave of U.S. oil drilling bankruptcies and lay-offs.
The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the U.S. oil and gas industry, had asked Trump for regulatory relief to ensure steady supplies during the coronavirus pandemic. The administration has since announced a temporary easing of environmental enforcement.

The API, many of whose members operate globally, has strongly opposed the idea of an oil import tariff, which could hurt domestic refiners and complicate projects and business relationships across borders.

“They are ready to go,” Kudlow said Friday in a Bloomberg Television interview, adding that leading bankers were talking to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin right up until the deadline yesterday. “I don’t see any barriers and roadblocks,” he said, though allowed that “there may be some small glitches.”
President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser spoke just after Labor Department data showed payrolls fell 701,000 last month in the first decline since 2010.
Separately Kudlow said the Trump administration never looked in any serious way at rolling back tariffs. “There is no tariff pullback right now,” Kudlow says, adding “individual cases can be examined.” Pulling tariffs would send the wrong signal on trade policy, and agreements made before the pandemic should be maintained, he said.
“I would not expect to see any movement on tariffs right now,” he said.

1524,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 03, 2020 09:36AM ET</span>",Beer and Beans: Americans Stocked Up Ahead of the Coronavirus Lockdown,"(Bloomberg) -- Consumer spending, which makes up 70% of the U.S. economy, is sputtering to a halt -- but not before Americans stocked up on top priorities ranging from baked beans to beer.
“There is incredible strength in consumer packaged goods,” said Stifel brokerage analyst Michael Kobrick, who tracks data from Information Resources Inc. But there’s “declining spending in discretionary items as consumers grapple with the prolonged virus response.”
Some companies, including Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc., say sales are starting to decline after the initial rush. And  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V). said this week that U.S. cardholder spending fell 4% in March alone.
Mark Vitner, senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities, said part of that pullback will be temporary: “We should see at least a short, sharp reversal once we move on to whatever the new normal is.”
Meanwhile, here’s what Americans have been snapping up -- and leaving on the shelves.
1. Food
When was the last time instant potatoes were a hot item? As consumers tried to fill up their cabinets at home with food that could last awhile -- with the possibility they would need to quarantine -- big sellers were some decidedly boring staples like powdered milk, baked beans, flour and instant potatoes, according to Stifel.
The surge in food sales is the flip side of diminishing restaurant sales, as thousands of eateries have stopped serving in the face of government orders or health advisories. Consumers stocked up and prepared for lengthy stays before returning to stores.
2. Health Care
Americans are taking much more seriously health care and hygiene, snapping up hand soap, facial tissue and gloves at more than double the rates of a year earlier.
One of the hottest items has been personal thermometers, which have almost quadrupled in sales from a year earlier. Thermometers are giving people a quick indication of whether they have a key symptom of the virus.
3. Working From Home
Working from home, and sheltering in your house or apartment, has resulted in consumers shying away from some products they used for the office.
Sales declined for a variety of cosmetics, fragrances, men’s shaving lotions, socks and shoe polish. And who’s going to the beach? While some spring breakers have violated the social-distancing guidelines in Florida, overall sales of suntan products have plunged.
4. Hoarding Paper
If there’s one thing American consumers will remember from their March shopping, it’s the frantic effort to buy – and, for some, to hoard – paper products, especially toilet tissue. Grocery stores rationed purchases, before shelves went empty. Demand for Charmin, a Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE:PG) brand, has increased so much, so quickly, that retailers have been put on allocation, which means they receive a fraction of their usual order.
The Stifel data suggest there may be a bit less panic buying now.
5 Beer, Wine
While health officials have maintained that drinking alcohol is not a helpful way to cope with the virus outbreak, Americans are going their own way. Sales of beer, wine, spirits and related products were big gainers as consumers imbibed in their homes rather than at bars or nightclubs. (Cannabis, not tracked here, has been a big beneficiary as well.)
Analysts warn that these trends might not last.
What Bloomberg Analysts Say
“Most U.S. beauty, home- and personal-care categories gained strongly from consumers’ panic-buying in the second half of the four-week period to March 22, IRI data show. More increases are likely, in our view, as the coronavirus-containment effort widens across states and bulk purchases provide a lift.”

BOSTON (Reuters) - GCP Applied Technologies (N:GCP) said on Friday that its slate of board nominees will include two new independent directors and that it will expand the size of the board by one to 10 members.
The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based chemical company is striking back at activist investor Starboard Value hours after the hedge fund announced on Thursday that it will push forward with its proxy fight and nominated eight directors.
GCP named Armand Lauzon and John McPherson, executives with construction products expertise, as director candidates.
Lauzon most recently served as president and chief executive officer of C&D Technologies while McPherson was most recently chief financial and strategy officer at Vulcan Materials Company (N:VMC).
""We have been regularly refreshing our Board to ensure our directors are diverse and have the appropriate skill sets and experience for our business,"" the company said.
GCP will re-nominate eight current board members plus nominate the two new directors. It will re-nominate Clay Kiefaber, a Starboard representative who joined the board last year, but it will not re-nominate Marran Ogilvie, who also joined the board last year after the settlement with Starboard.
Ogilvie serves on three other boards and is a candidate on Starboard's slate of directors at health-care services company Mednax. If she were re-nominated by GCP and elected at Mednax (N:MD) she would be considered to have too many public board commitments, the company said.
Both Ogilvie and Kiefaber are on Starboard's slate of eight directors, which also includes Starboard partner and head of research Peter Feld.
Investors will be able to vote for their choices at the company's annual meeting on May 28 unless the two sides reach a settlement beforehand.
For GCP this marks the second time in two years that Starboard, which owns 9% of the company, has approached with criticisms and demands. Last year the two sides reached a settlement that handed two board seats to the New York-based hedge fund known for seeking operational changes at target companies. On Thursday, Starboard said its nominees would steer the company through the current economic crisis more successfully. GCP said it is financially well positioned to navigate the COVID-19 crisis.
GCP said it has taken many steps to improve its position. It named Randall Dearth chief executive officer in August, achieved $33 million in annualized cost savings through 2019 and cut debt by nearly $450 million.

1529,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2020 08:00AM ET</span>","China probes alleged fraud at Luckin Coffee, banks review IPO work","By Julie Zhu and Zoey Zhang
HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's securities regulator said on Friday it would investigate claims of fraud at  Luckin Coffee  Inc (O:LK) and sources said some of the banks involved in the Chinese chain's successful U.S. IPO last year were reviewing their work in the listing. 
Shares of Luckin, which competes in China with  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX), sank as much as 81% on Thursday in New York after it announced an internal investigation had shown its chief operating officer and other employees fabricated sales deals.
The company said it had suspended COO Jian Liu and employees reporting to him following initial recommendations from a special committee that was appointed to investigate issues in its financial statements for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2019.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said on Friday it would investigate the case in line with any international investigation and strongly condemned any financial misconduct. 
""Regardless of the listing location, listed companies should strictly abide by laws and regulations in relevant markets, and fulfil obligations to make truthful, accurate and complete disclosures,"" the regulator said.
Luckin did not respond to a request for comment on CSRC's observations. 
At least two of the four banks which led Luckin's initial public offering (IPO) in May last year have begun reviewing their work for the float, according to four sources with knowledge of the scrutiny.
China International Capital Corp (CICC) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) have begun informal investigations into the due diligence they did for the deal, according to the four sources.
The two, along with  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) and  Haitong International  Securities (HK:0665), led Luckin's IPO, in which it raised $561 million at $17 per share, valuing the group at about $4.2 billion. 
The four banks also worked on a follow-on share sale and a convertible bond worth a total of $980 million in January.
CICC, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and Haitong declined to comment.
Luckin's shares tumbled to $6.4 by the end of Thursday trading from $26.2 at Wednesday's close, wiping out about $5 billion in market capitalisation. 
CHINA CHILL
Bankers and investors warned on Friday that Luckin's issues were likely to weigh on other Chinese companies considering a U.S. IPO - a group already affected by the trade tensions of 2019.
""Sino-U.S. relations are bad already and Luckin has provided a perfect opportunity for China bashers in the U.S. who were already suspicious about Chinese companies,"" said one Hong Kong-based investor who focuses on American Depositary Receipts - a common form of shares for foreign companies listed in the U.S.
In September, sources told Reuters the U.S. government was considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges, echoing efforts by lawmakers last June to force U.S.-listed Chinese companies to submit to greater regulatory oversight or face delisting.
“It will affect potential U.S. IPOs from China. China’s economy is not doing well already and with Luckin’s scandal these companies will face much tighter scrutiny for going public,” said a banker who specialises in tech firms' fundraisings, including IPOs. 
Luckin said on Thursday that its investigation had found that fabricated sales from the second quarter of 2019 to the fourth were worth about 2.2 billion yuan ($310 million).
That equates to about 40% of the annual sales projected by analysts, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Liu has been the COO of the company since May 2018. He could not be immediately reached for comment.
Founded in June 2017, Luckin had been one of China's few successful IPOs in New York last year, with a number of prominent U.S. investors, including hedge funds, investing in the company's shares. 

Like others in the industry, the company has been hit hard by the coronavirus epidemic. In late January, it was forced to temporarily close an estimated 200 coffee shops in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the original epicentre of the outbreak, as well as many in other cities.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open lower Friday, as investors focus on the mounting damage to the economy as global coronavirus cases leap past one million.
At 7:10 AM ET (1100 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 24 points, or 1%, lower, futures for the Nasdaq down 75 points, or 1%. The Dow futures contract fell 228 points, or 1.1%. The three main indices are on track for their third down week in four.
The Covid-19 pandemic ticked off another grim milestone earlier Friday, with more than a million cases of coronavirus registered globally, according to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University, with the U.S. having the most cases.
Over 53,000 people have died, with more than 1,000 U.S. deaths in the past day, the world’s highest daily toll.
The widespread lockdown orders offered up to contain the spread of the virus resulted in an unprecedented number of workers - 6.6 million - filing jobless claims Thursday.
There’s more employment data to come at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), with the March official jobs report survey. However, this was from the week of March 12, before any major U.S. state had gone into lockdown. For that reason, economists are expecting a drop in nonfarm payrolls of just 100,000, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Additionally, a reading of ISM's non-manufacturing activity index is due at 10 AM ET, and is expected to show a contraction in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. European services PMIs sunk to their lowest on record in March, data released earlier Friday showed.
The U.S. economy will shrink an annualized 5.5% in 2020, the steepest drop since 1946, with a huge 38% contraction predicted for the second quarter,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said Friday. U.S. unemployment will also peak at a record 15.7% in the second quarter, with cumulative job losses of 21 million in the second quarter, the bank's analysts predicted.
In corporate news, 3M (NYSE:MMM) will be in the spotlight after President Donald Trump criticized the company over its efforts to supply protective gear and invoked the Defense Production Act, which gives the federal government more control over a company’s operations.








Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) will also be in focus after they both said they will furlough thousands of workers, to combat the loss of demand caused by the virus outbreak.
The oil market pushed higher Friday, continuing Thursday’s sharp gains, after a group of major crude producers confirmed a virtual meeting will be held on Monday.
OPEC+, an alliance lead by Saudi Arabia and Russia, is seeking other major oil producers, including the U.S., to join it in a deep reduction of global crude output to stem the sharp fall in prices.
President Trump has said he will meet with U.S. oil bosses later Friday, with meetings possibly stretching into the weekend.
At 7:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 4.6% higher at $26.46 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract climbed 7.9% to $32.31.
Additionally, gold futures dropped 0.5% to $1,630.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded at $1.0808, down 0.5%."

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus is studying a sharp cut in production of its single-aisle A320, its biggest-selling family of jets, to accommodate industrial and delivery problems triggered by the coronavirus crisis, three people familiar with the matter said.
Two of the people said Airbus (PA:AIR) may have to cut its official monthly of 60 A320-family jets by as much as half for one or two quarters to avoid a glut of undelivered jets. The third said no decision had been taken on a reduced figure.
A final decision is expected before the company's shareholder meeting in mid-April.
An Airbus spokesman declined to comment, but said the company was in constant dialogue with suppliers and airlines.
On Thursday, Reuters reported that both Airbus and Boeing (N:BA) were also studying sharp cuts in wide-body production.
Airlines worldwide have grounded fleets and stopped taking deliveries of most new aircraft due to cash shortages and travel restrictions that have both hurt travel demand and interrupted the logistics of sending inspectors and pilots to take new jets.
At the same time, Airbus faces shortages in its own supply chain as it struggles to bring production back up to previous levels after pausing activity in several factories.
Airbus entered the coronavirus crisis with plans to increase A320-family production to 63 a month next year and to add a further 1-2 planes per month in both 2022 and 2023.

Those plans have been shelved, the sources said. The company suspended near-term 2020 delivery guidance last month.

Carmakers around the world are ramping up production of critical healthcare products and machines to respond to the enormous demand during the pandemic.
Italy, the epicenter of the virus outbreak in Europe, had asked Siare to triple its normal monthly production as a part of government efforts to increase the number of intensive care beds.
FCA said that with the support of luxury group  Ferrari  (MI:RACE) and holding company Exor (MI:EXOR), which controls both carmakers, it had produced the first electrovalves, a key part in ventilators, at its plant in Cento, in northern Italy.
The Cento plant is usually used to produces high-performance car engines for the global market. It had been closed because of the coronavirus but has partially reopened for this project.
""With the additional supply of electrovalves from Cento, Siare estimates that it will be able to reduce total production time for ventilators by as much as 30-50%"", the statement said.
In addition to the production of the electrovalves, a team of specialists from FCA is also working alongside Siare staff at their production facility near the city of Bologna.

""The objective is to help increase Siare's total production, with a gradual scaling up of daily output beginning from the first week of April"", FCA said.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's H&M (ST:HMb), the world's second-biggest clothing retailer, said on Friday it expected a loss in the second quarter after reporting a 46% plunge in March sales as the coronavirus pandemic took a toll on the retail sector. 
The virus outbreak that began in China late last year and is spreading around the world has prompted governments to close businesses and order millions of people to stay at home to try to slow the contagion..
It has forced H&M to temporarily close most of its stores, flag big layoffs and scrap its annual dividend for the first time since its 1974 listing.
H&M's biggest rival, Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX), has also announced big temporary layoffs, and booked a provision as the slump in demand reduced the value of its inventory.
""We have never been through times as demanding as these,"" newly appointed H&M Chief Executive Helena Helmersson told analysts and journalists on a call. 
With an unprecedented fall in sales and a dismal second quarter already priced in, H&M's shares were however up 4% by 0910 GMT as the retailer said it would cut costs and planned to strengthen its liquidity buffer with new credit. The shares plunged 40% in the past month.
Analysts at Jefferies said it was sensible to expand credit facilities ""given narrower liquidity buffers relative to peers, as we entered an elongated period of demand weakness/absence"". 
Helmersson said the situation was becoming increasingly demanding with each day the group had to keep stores closed. 
""With the dramatic decline in the market we have to make many difficult decisions and take forceful action,"" she said in a statement. 
JP Morgan analysts said H&M's March sales were not worse than feared, and highlighted e-commerce growth, cost flexibility and a fast recovery in China as positives in the report.
""While the backdrop is dire, for everyone and not just for H&M, we think the snippets provided by H&M are relatively positive versus expectations,"" they said in a research note.
OUT OTHER SIDE
H&M said it expected to cut operating expenses excluding depreciation by around 20-25% in the second quarter and lowered its investment plans for the year.
The retailer, which had more than 125,000 employees by late last year, is in talks to reduce working hours for tens of thousands of workers, and considering redundancies.
In results that still bore little mark of the virus outbreak, H&M's fiscal first-quarter pretax profit more than doubled to 2.50 billion crowns ($248 million) from 1.04 billion a year-ago. Six analysts polled between March 17 and March 26 had on average expected a rise to 1.47 billion crowns, according to Refinitiv data.
""We think the debate on H&M will be between investors looking at how ugly it can get short term and investors thinking about who could come out the other side relatively stronger,"" RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain said in a note.
""H&M should be one of those, albeit Inditex looks better placed for now given its flexible business model and stronger balance sheet,"" he said.
H&M said stocks would temporarily be growing again, having shrunk for three quarters.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets took another dip on Friday after the round of final purchasing manager indices for the month confirmed what amounts to a sudden stop in the economy all across the continent.
By 6:25 AM ET (1025 GMT), the benchmark STOXX 600 was down 0.9% at 309.24, on course to end a volatile week fractionally lower. The German DAX was down 0.6%, while the FTSE 100 was down 1.2%.
Consultancy IHS Markit revised down its flash PMIs across the board, principally because the numbers from the services sector, which accounts for the bulk of activity in every eurozone economy including Germany, were so dismal.
In Italy, the services PMI fell to 17.4, from 52.1 in February. That’s the lowest number Markit has ever reported for any of its PMIs, ever - worse even than Greece at the depths of its recession in the last decade. The Italian numbers led to the FTSE MIB being the worst performer in the region, down 1.5%.
The overall eurozone services PMI fell to 26.4, from 52.6. The only consolation, noted Paul Donovan, UBS Global Wealth Management chief economist, is that the surveys may be distorted by the nature of responses.
“You have to be a pretty unusual person to fill in a survey in this situation, which may create a bias – we do not want the views of unusual people to be presented as the views of the majority,” Donovan said.
The numbers “are now so far out of any reasonable range that they are difficult to interpret,” said Claus Vistesen, eurozone economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics. Vistesen’s base case is that eurozone GDP fell 4% in the first quarter and will shrink a further 10% in the current quarter, “based on the notion that activity will be at a hold in April and most of May.”
The Stoxx 600 Banks index, a (very) rough proxy for the service sector, fell 1.4%, as  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) fell into line with other big institutions in suspending their dividends.
Regulators in Frankfurt and London are desperate to ensure that the continent’s banks avoid asking for fresh bailouts, aware of the political difficulties that would create. However, given the surge in bad loans that seems inevitable against a backdrop of such awful macro numbers, the risk of such action (and the further dilution of existing shareholders) is already being priced in."

The aviation tycoon Tony Fernandes said the airline was in discussion with the government for a loan to support its current cash position to ride out the challenging operating environment.
Many countries have imposed travel restrictions to curb the virus spread and Malaysia is under a lockdown until April 14.
AirAsia has suspended some of its international and domestic flights since March 28.
Fernandes said the airline had enough cash reserves and did not need a bailout.
""We think the cash can last us for the most part of this year and if sales return, then we're okay. But it'd be great to get a loan as well and we're working on that with the government,"" he said.
AirAsia had a net cash position of 2.2 billion ringgit ($505 million) as of end-2019. The airline hopes to reopen sales in the middle of this month.
Fernandes denied any ongoing merger talks, but did not rule it out. Local media have reported in recent weeks that a merger between AirAsia and national carrier Malaysia Airlines could be on the cards.
Local newspaper the New Straits Times also reported this week that local airlines could get up to 10 billion ringgit in financial assistance from sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd.
Citing sources, the daily said the potential assistance, meant as a short-term relief for operating cost and improve liquidity, would come in the form of loans guaranteed by Khazanah.

The new funding comes on top of previously announced bailout measures amounting to a billion euros, in addition to securing 10 billion euros in company loans via the state's financing and export credit company Finnvera.
""This is the worst phase in Finland's economic history,"" economics minister Mika Lintila told a news conference.
The additional investment will be managed by the state's capital investment company Tesi, which will invest up to 10 million euros in viable mid-cap companies with annual revenue of at least 10 million euros and which employ at least 50 people, Lintila's ministry said in a statement.
By Friday, 332,973 workers faced statutory negotiations over dismissals or temporary lay-offs in Finland, excluding those employed by companies with less than 20 employees, ministry data showed. 
The government's other new measures to shield the country from the crisis include temporary interest rate caps on unsecured consumer loans and on debt-collection charges.
The interest rate on consumer loans will be capped at 10%, down from a 20% cap, justice minister Anna-Maja Henriksson said, adding that direct marketing of unsecured loans to consumers will be banned until the end of the year.
The restrictions on such loans, which are often marketed aggressively and target people on low incomes who may struggle to obtain funds from traditional retail banks, is aimed at protecting citizens from excessive indebtedness as the economic impact of the virus deepens, Henriksson said.
Finland will also introduce temporary legislation to allow companies to postpone annual general meetings past usual deadlines, she added, allowing time for alternative online solutions to be found while the government's ban on public meetings of more than 10 people remains in force.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's new package of economic measures to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus outbreak will be worth about 10% of its gross domestic product (GDP), Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak said on Friday.
The package will cover all economic sectors for at least the next six months, the minister told a news conference after a special cabinet meeting.
""The figure will be like those of other countries, close to 10% of GDP,"" he said, adding other details were being worked on by relevant agencies.
If possible, final approval will be sought from the cabinet on Tuesday, Somkid said.
The minister did not give a dollar value for the package, but the GDP of Southeast Asia's second-largest economy last year was 16.88 trillion baht ($512.76 billion).
The measures will be partly financed by the fiscal budget and borrowing, he said.
""This will build the confidence of people and businesses that we will get through this crisis"".
The government will keep introducing measures to help the economy, he said.
The latest package follow last month's two sets of stimulus measures together worth more than 500 billion baht.
Thailand has reported 1,978 infections and 19 deaths because of the coronavirus. 
It imposed a nationwide night curfew from Friday, after closing malls, beauty salons and arcades to limit the spread of the virus.
The Bank of Thailand (BOT) expects the economy to contract 5.3% this year, the worst since the 1998 Asian financial crisis.
The BOT is seeking a law to provide soft loans directly to struggling businesses, similar to a move many years ago when there was bad flooding, Governor Veerathai Santiprabhob told the conference.
The central bank will also seek a law to allow it to buy good quality corporate bonds that are being rolled over to support the 3.5 trillion-baht corporate debt market, he said.
It will buy at most half of the debt being rolled-over, he said.
The BOT also plans to lower the amount that commercial banks pay into the Financial Institutions Development Fund (FIDF) for two years to 0.23% of deposits from 0.46%, so that banks can cut other interest rates to help businesses, he said.

The BOT will extend deposit protection of 5 million baht for another year from August, he added.

PARIS/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) is in talks with banks to receive billions of euros in loans guaranteed by the French and Dutch governments, as the airline group braces for a sustained coronavirus shutdown, sources told Reuters.
The two states, which each own 14% of Air France-KLM, have paused a long-running boardroom feud to address the cash crunch, according to three people close to the discussions. 
Details and amounts are not finalised and could change, the people said. Under the most likely scenario, Air France may get as much as 4 billion euros in French-guaranteed loans while KLM receives close to 2 billion backed by The Hague, one source said.
The group has appointed BNP (PA:BNPP) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) to advise on refinancing, two of the sources said. 
Both banks declined to comment. 
""We are naturally in constant discussions with both governments,"" an Air France-KLM spokeswoman said, declining further comment.
The French and Dutch governments also declined to comment in detail on the Air France-KLM talks. Both countries have expressed willingness to offer financial help.

Governments around the world are scrambling to prop up major airlines that are at risk of bankruptcy as the pandemic gathers pace, gutting travel demand and bringing traffic to an indefinite standstill.
The U.S. Senate approved a $58 billion bailout for the American aviation industry on March 25. In Europe, Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) and SAS (ST:SAS) have received pledges of state support, while Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) is poised to receive billions in aid.

LONDON (Reuters) - European stock markets sank on Friday, erasing meagre gains for the week, as more companies flagged a hit to business from the coronavirus pandemic while oil prices extended their previous day's gains on hopes of a global supply cut.
With virus-fighting lockdowns raising the risk of a prolonged global downturn, investors continued to seek the safety of the U.S. dollar and government bonds, pushing U.S. Treasury yields near their lowest in three weeks.
With over a million people infected worldwide, there were more signs the pandemic would take a massive toll on economic growth.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said the U.S. economy will shrink 5.5% in 2020, the steepest drop since 1946, with a huge 38% contraction predicted for the second quarter.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.4% by 0749 GMT, taking MSCI'S All Country World Index down 0.3%.
A number of firms flagged a hit to business from the pandemic, foreshadowing a deeper earnings recession ahead of the reporting season. 
MSCI's Asia-Pacific index outside Japan dipped 0.6% while Japan's Nikkei erased earlier gains to end flat.
U.S. stock futures sank nearly 1 percent. 
Brent crude futures gained 3.64% to $31.03, extending Thursday's record 24.7% surge , while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 0.83% to $25.11. [O/R]
Trump said on Thursday he had spoken to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and expects Riyadh and Moscow to cut oil output by as much as 10 million to 15 million barrels, as the two countries signalled willingness to make a deal.
Saudi Arabia said it would call an emergency meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, state media reported.
The amount cited by Trump would represent an unprecedented cut equal to 10% to 15% of global supply, in output per day terms, a common unit of measurement.
However, Trump provided few details, an omission some analysts said was likely intentional, and which they said explained a pullback in prices in the Asian session.
""The reason the price came back down is that these figures are so unbelievable as to make one wonder whether the person saying them understood what he was talking about,"" said Marshall Gittler, head of investment research at BDSwiss Group. 
In early March, talks over production cuts between the two countries collapsed, leading them to start a price war that pushed oil prices to the lowest levels in nearly two decades.
SAFE ASSETS IN DEMAND
Investors sought the safety of government bonds. Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last yielded 0.597%, near a three-week low of 0.563% touched on Thursday.
More evidence of the damage from widespread stay-at-home orders to contain the spread of coronavirus emerged in the United States, with an unprecedented number of workers - 6.6 million - filing jobless claims.
Projections released by the U.S. Congressional Budget Office showed gross domestic product would decline by more than 7% in the second quarter as the health crisis takes hold.
The pandemic has claimed more than 52,000 deaths as it further exploded in the United States and the death toll climbed in Spain and Italy, according to a Reuters tally.
Highly rated U.S. corporate bond issuers raised a record $110.502 billion this week, according to Refinitiv IFR data, as firms borrowed cash in fear the coronavirus crisis may soon limit their access to capital markets.
In the currency market, the dollar maintained its firmness against a basket of currencies as investors and companies continued to hoard the world's most liquid currency.
The dollar index has risen 1.97% so far this week, even as extreme tightness for greenback since last month eased.
The euro dipped 0.5% to $1.0798 set for five straight days of losses, and at its lowest level since March 25. The yen also stepped back to 108.11 per dollar from Wednesday's two-week high of 106.925.
Gold prices extended the previous day's gains on the dire U.S. jobless claims figures, intensifying fears of the coming economic slowdown and driving investors toward the safe-haven metal.

Spot gold rose 0.1% to $1,613.78 per ounce after a 1.28% rise on Thursday.

Europe's largest budget airline said the impact of the coronavirus meant it was not able to provide guidance for 2021.
It reported 2020 traffic up 4% to 149 million passengers, but that was short of the 151 million it had expected as of March 10 and lower than its earlier target of 154 million.
Ryanair has been forced to park much of its fleet. It is currently operating fewer than 20 daily flights, or less than 1% of its normal schedule of more than 2,500 flights. 
For 2020 it expects to report a pre-exceptional profit after tax at the lower end of 950 million ($1.03 billion) to 1 billion euros, it said on Friday.
That is a slightly narrower range than the 950 million to 1.05 billion euro it gave in February.
The 300 million euro exceptional charge it will take for 2020 relates to the ineffectiveness on its 2021 fuel hedges. 
Ryanair said it has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, with year-end cash equivalents of 3.8 billion euros and 327 aircraft, 77% of the group's owned fleet, debt free. 
That compared to 4 billion euros in Ryanair's last update on March 16, which Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson said suggested it was burning through 100 million euros a week in its initial handling of the crisis as it grounds planes.
The cash-burn could be cut to around 135 million euros a month if the lockdown continues into the next quarter due to cost-cutting measures, Simpson said. 
He also expects Ryanair to book further exceptional charges stemming from fuel hedging in the first quarter of the financial year which has just started. 
Ryanair said it was grateful to many EU governments for their ""foresight and speed of response in recognising that airlines are one of the most exposed industries"" but emphasised that any such support must comply with EU state aid rules.
Ryanair is scheduled to release its 2020 results on May 18. 
It said it will continue to will to focus on delivering cost savings in the meantime. 

Last month it deferred all capital expenditure and share buybacks, froze recruitment and cut pay by 50%.

Some firms said they would resist such a move and Germany indicated its opposition.
Dutch insurers  NN Group  (AS:NN) and  Aegon  (AS:AEGN) slumped around 10% while France's CNP Assurances fell 7% and AXA (PA:AXAF) was down 4%. British insurers - which still need to follow EU insurance regulation during the Brexit transition period - also fell, with  Aviva  (L:AV) and  Prudential  (L:PRU) down 4%. 
The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) said late on Thursday the temporary suspensions were essential to ensure insurers and reinsurers held a ""robust"" level of reserves to protect policyholders and absorb potential losses.
Last week, the European Central Bank told lenders to halt shareholder payouts. But while most major banks in the euro zone have heeded calls to suspend their dividends, insurers may put up more of a battle. 
Germany's financial regulator BaFin said on Friday that a general payout ban for insurers and pension funds was currently not necessary.
Germany-based Allianz (DE:ALVG), the region's biggest insurer, told Reuters it was in ""good shape"" and wanted to maintain both its dividend for 2019 and a share buyback worth 1.5 billion euros.
German reinsurer Munich Re MUVGn.DE, which declined to comment on the EIOPA statement, said on Tuesday it was scrapping a share buyback but keeping a 9.8 euros per share dividend, despite a profit warning.
The suspensions should be reviewed as the financial and economic impact of COVID-19 starts to become clearer, the watchdog added.
Its statement was similar to a letter from Bank of England Deputy Governor Sam Woods on Tuesday to insurer CEOs in Britain, asking them to pay close attention to the need to protect policyholders and remain sound before taking decisions on dividends or bonuses.

In corporate news, shares in Hennes & Mauritz  (ST:HMb) climbed 6% despite the world's second-biggest clothing retailer reporting a 46% plunge in March sales as the coronavirus forced the closure of most of its shops. 
The Swedish company also said it expected to be able to cut operating expenses by around 20–25% in the second quarter while it slashed its planned capital spending for 2020 to 5 billion kronor ($494 million) from 8.5 billion.
Shares in BAE Systems (LON:BAES) dropped 1% after saying it would defer a decision on whether to pay its dividend after seeing significant disruption from coronavirus in recent weeks.
Additionally, shares in  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) dropped 2.5% and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) fell 3.3% after they announced that they would be following many of their European peers in cancelling their final dividends for 2019.
This follows the European Central Bank asking banks not to pay dividends until October in order to conserve cash. Authorities are desperate to stop a crisis in the real economy infecting the financial system too.
There’s more U.S. employment data to come at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), after Thursday’s shocking 6.6 million filing jobless claims, in the form of the official jobs report for March. 
However, the cut-off date for this data is the week of March 12, before any major U.S. state had gone into lockdown. For that reason, economists are expecting a drop in nonfarm payrolls of just 100,000, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
There are a number of important economic numbers due Friday, aside from the U.S. payrolls release, including services PMI data in the eurozone and ISM non-manufacturing PMI in the U.S. These are set to provide more information about the impact of the business lockdowns in the respective regions.
The oil market will also be in focus after Thursday’s sharp gains on the back of talk that Russia and Saudi Arabia will put their differences aside to organise a cut to global supply.

1550,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 03, 2020 03:45AM ET</span>",Retail Investors Pump Money Into Korean Stocks Like Never Before,"(Bloomberg) -- While the pros are shunning Korean stocks, the nation’s mom-and-pops are diving right in.
The benchmark Kospi index has rebounded almost 20% from a low in March, even as foreign and local funds kept fleeing the market, offloading some 24 trillion won ($19.5 billion) net of the gauge’s shares this year. That’s because retail investors -- known as “patriotic ants” for their herd behavior that’s propping up the market -- have been buying at a record pace. They’ve added 22 trillion won net of the equities, including the biggest quarterly additions since Bloomberg began compiling the data in 1997.
Known for their appetite for products ranging from complex structured notes to risky hedge funds, Korea’s individual traders usually favor short-term, speculative bets and account for nearly 60% of Kospi volume, according to NH Investment & Securities Co. The recent Bank of Korea rate cut is now also drawing wealthy investors with a long-term view to the nation’s $1 trillion stock market, Samsung Securities Co. said.
“Most retail investors were speculative traders, but recently I saw many wealthy people coming to the stock market,” said You Seung-Min, chief strategist at Samsung Securities. “Bank of Korea’s 50 basis-point cut seems to have shocked them. The government’s stronger regulations on real estate are pushing them to seek a return from stocks.”
Their favorite pick has been Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co., the nation’s biggest stock, followed by peer  SK Hynix Inc  (KS:000660) Both have tumbled 16% this year. On Naver Corp (KS:035420)., the nation’s biggest portal website, at least 80 community posts read, “Do you think it’s the right time to buy Samsung Electronics?” or “Samsung will never fail, it’s like a bond.”
“Samsung’s stock is probably a good investment for retail investors, as it is planning to offer about a 3% dividend yield for this year, higher than the interest rate in Korea,” said Chung Chang-won, an analyst at Nomura International Hong Kong Ltd. who noted it has become easier to invest in the shares since a split in 2018.
Korean regulators said in a Thursday statement that retail investors should refrain from “reckless buying” of the nation’s equities, especially with borrowed money. Leveraged investments in the market hit 10.5 trillion won on Feb. 25, the highest since June 2019, according to the latest data from the Korea Financial Investment Association.
“There is at least 1,000 trillion won of floating money in Korea,” Chung said. “They really have nowhere to invest.”"

JAKARTA (Reuters) - A plunge in the rupiah could leave Indonesian firms exposed to $4 billion in debt next year, after credit ratings agencies hit some companies this week with another round of credit downgrades as the coronavirus pandemic chokes economic activity.
Indonesia's increase in private sector debt has outstripped the global average, according to the World Bank, while French bank Natixis sees Southeast Asia's largest economy as among the most exposed to a dollar credit crunch in the Asia Pacific.
Outstanding foreign private debt was $203 billion as of January, according to Bank Indonesia (BI) data.
Fitch Ratings has put Indonesian homebuilders  Lippo Karawaci  (JK:LPKR) on a negative outlook for its B- rating amid ""unprecedented weakening in domestic demand"" as the coronavirus outbreak hits economic growth. 
Moody's Investor Services has downgraded property firm Alam Sutera Realty (JK:ASRI),  Agung Podomoro  Land (JK:APLN) and tyre-maker  Gajah Tunggal  (JK:GJTL) due to the rupiah's fall.
The rupiah  is emerging Asia's worst performing currency after losing 15% so far this year to its weakest since the 1998 Asian financial crisis.
The virus pandemic and rupiah slide weakened the balance sheets of Indonesian companies, said Moody's analyst Jacintha Poh, adding that ""this is credit negative for many companies.""
Investors in Indonesian corporate bonds usually hold to maturity as the market isn't liquid.
Poh said by telephone that large amounts of Indonesian debt will mature next year, while companies are also exposed now through interest payments.
Indonesia's central bank has since 2015 made it mandatory for companies to hedge a portion of their short-term foreign exchange liabilities.
Governor Perry Warjiyo said debtors have begun asking banks for deferral in interest payments. 
The government has alloted 150 trillion rupiah ($9.12 billion) in the budget to help companies that need restructuring as GDP growth is projected to slow to 2.3% in 2020 from 5% last year.
Coronavirus cases in Indonesia have risen to more than 1,700 and the respiratory disease has claimed 170 lives.
MATURITY WALL
S&P Global Ratings' director Xavier Jean told Reuters the rupiah's drop has hurt investor sentiment towards high-risk issuers.
This complicates refinancing needs with a debt maturity wall of $4.5-$5 billion coming in 2021 to 2023, for companies in real estate, commodities, power and the communication, media and techonology sectors, Jean said.
Fitch said companies in property, energy, metals and mining, airlines, and auto- and leisure-related sectors will all face growing debt risks.
Moody's Poh is most concerned about property firms because they borrow in U.S. dollars, but generate income in rupiah and cannot launch sales when people are told to stay home.
Poh cited Alam Sutera, Modernland Realty (JK:MDLN), Gajah Tunggal and investment firm MNC Investama (JK:BHIT) as the most affected.
A Modernland spokesman said the company had mitigated currency risks through hedging. The other companies did not respond to a request for comment.
Still, S&P's Jean said the bond markets were ""all but closed"" to weaker Indonesian companies. 

""So unless they have diversified their funding sources over the years, which few have done, refinancing risk and the likelihood of failed repayment will only go up until debt capital markets normalise,"" said Jean.

1557,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 03, 2020 02:04AM ET</span>",Stocks - Europe Seen Lower; Virus Cases Top One Million,"By Peter Nurse
Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open lower Friday, weighed by another drop in oil prices as the number of global coronavirus cases tops one million and U.S. unemployment soars.
At 2:15 AM ET (0615 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 1.0% lower. France's CAC 40 futures were down 0.7%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.3%.
Equity markets received a boost Thursday from hopes to an end of disorderly conditions in the world oil market. Crude prices jumped on the back of comments from U.S. President Donald Trump indicating that a deal between major oil producers Russia and Saudi Arabia to slash global supply was on its way.
However, the new day has seen a new tone and the oil market has handed back some of those gains amid skepticism that a deal will be announced in the new future.
At 2:!5 AM ET U.S. crude futures traded 4.6% lower at $24.16 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 4.6% to $28.56.
At the same time, the pandemic has shown few signs of abating Friday, with global cases surpassing one million, and more than 53,000 deaths. The pandemic has spread further in the United States and the death toll climbed in Spain and Italy to 10,000 and 13,000 respectively.
Further evidence of the economic damage from widespread lockdown orders to contain the spread of coronavirus emerged in the U.S., with an unprecedented number of workers - 6.6 million - filing jobless claims.
There’s more U.S. employment data to come at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), in the form of the official jobs report for March. However, the cut-off date for this data is the week of March 12, before any major U.S. state had gone into lockdown.
For that reason, economists are expecting a drop in nonfarm payrolls  of just 100,000, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com. The unemployment rate is seen rising to 3.8% from 3.5% and average hourly earnings are expected to have climbed 0.2%.

1561,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 11:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Neiman Marcus advances bankruptcy preparations - sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Mike Spector
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Neiman Marcus Group is stepping up preparations to seek bankruptcy protection, after the coronavirus pandemic forced the debt-laden U.S. luxury department store chain to close its stores, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Neiman began holding confidential discussions this week with bondholders about possible financing that would help the company continue operating while under bankruptcy protection, the sources said. The company has also started similar discussions in recent days with its lenders, one of the sources said. 
Up until this week, Neiman had received inquiries from creditors about its next moves but had not commenced discussions about a possible bankruptcy, some of the sources said. 
Even though these talks are advancing, the Dallas-based retailer is several weeks away from a potential bankruptcy, and it is still possible that it manages to escape it, the sources said. 
Creditors could give Neiman additional time to make upcoming debt payments due this month while restructuring discussions continue, which could result in a transaction that reworks financial obligations outside of bankruptcy proceedings, the sources added.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Neiman declined to comment. Last month, the company said it was ""evaluating all courses of action to preserve our financial strength"" because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Neiman reached a deal last year with creditors to rework debt and avoid a bankruptcy filing, gaining more financial breathing room. But the coronavirus outbreak forced the company to close all Neiman, Bergdorf Goodman and Last Call stores it operates through the end of April, and furlough most of its 14,000 employees.
The closures have resulted in a cash crunch just before significant interest payments on portions of its more than $4 billion of debt are due starting April 15. 
Portions of Neiman Marcus's term loan were trading at roughly 40 cents on the dollar this week, well below face value, indicating significant investor concerns about repayment, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. The price for a set of Neiman bonds has also fallen. 
Neiman has struggled following a $6 billion leveraged buyout by private equity firm Ares Management Corp (N:ARES) and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board in 2013. Like many traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, it has faced relentless competition from e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. (O:AMZN). Ares had no immediate comment, while the CPPIB did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Neiman was able to persuade creditors to restructure debt last year without resorting to bankruptcy proceedings, pushing out due dates on its financial obligations. But the deal added to the company's interest expenses on debt, and did not address its struggling business, which has worsened.
A Neiman bankruptcy filing would likely be contentious. A trustee for some of the company's bondholders sued Neiman last year, claiming the company and its owners robbed investors of the value of luxury e-commerce site MyTheresa in the earlier debt restructuring.
""If this storied brand files for bankruptcy ... MyTheresa will take center stage,"" said Dan Kamensky, managing partner at Marble Ridge Capital LP, one of the bondholders. “The private equity owners stripped the … MyTheresa asset from the company without paying a dime and leaving a carcass of a company for its creditors.""
Neiman has said the allegations are meritless and that its handling of MyTheresa was proper.

""We hit 3M hard today after seeing what they were doing with their Masks. 'P Act' all the way.' Big surprise to many in government as to what they were doing - will have a big price to pay!"" Trump said on Twitter.
At a White House briefing on the coronavirus pandemic earlier on Thursday, Trump announced he had signed a Defense Production Act order for 3M to produce face masks. ""Hopefully they'll be able to do what they are supposed to do,"" he said, without elaborating.
St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company's brands include Scotch, Post-It and Nexcare, as well as healthcare products for professionals.
White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said at the briefing, ""We've had some issues making sure that all of the production that 3M does around the world, enough of it is coming back here to the right places."" 
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the president's tweet.
N-95 face masks made by 3M and other companies are in short supply among healthcare workers treating coronavirus patients.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American Airlines Co (O:AAL) said on Thursday it is cutting additional flights this summer as travel demand has drastically shrunk amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Vasu Raja, American Airlines' senior vice president of Network Strategy, told Reuters that the airline is cutting between 70% and 75% of flights in April and about 80% of flights in May. For this month and May it is cutting nearly 90% of its international flights.
Raja said domestic demand will remain weak into May, citing of the lack of bookings.
Still, the largest U.S. airline has no plans to halt U.S. flights entirely, noting medical workers and others who must travel, sometimes for urgent medical reasons. ""We are making no plans for the cessation of flying,"" Raja said. ""The important thing is to provide a minimum level of essential service to customers ... but we do it in such a way where we don't burn an excessive amount of cash.""
Across the industry, at some major airports overall U.S. flights are down 50% to 70%, officials say. The number of people who went through U.S. airport checkpoints hit another new low on Wednesday at just 136,023, down from 2.2 million a year ago.
American also disclosed on Thursday that it will cancel more than 60% of its total international flights this summer, including an 80% reduction in Pacific capacity, a 65% reduction in Atlantic and 48% reduction in Latin America. American is also delaying the launch of new international routes until 2021, delaying the launch of new winter seasonal service and suspending 25 summer seasonal flights.
The cuts in May are striking. American Airlines will go from the pre-crisis typical 250 weekday flights from Washington Reagan National Airport to about 28 in May. It will shrink from close to 100 flights a day at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport to just 11 flights a day. At its Dallas-Fort Worth hub, American will decline from nearly 1,000 planned flights a day this summer to around 350. 
The cuts are prompted by the sharp demand reduction. ""Literally we have flights that are 5% full,"" Raja said. Washington flights are often 10-12% full and been hurt by a big decline in government travel, he added.
Still, American has no idea when things will turn around. ""If we are the bottom it is only because gross bookings have fallen to zero and they can't go any lower than that,"" Raja said. ""Pretty soon we'll even run out of people to cancel on U.S. airlines.""
American will not fly its A330 fleet through the end of the summer to conserve costs.

American has said it is eligible for $12 billion out of $50 billion in U.S. government loans and grants for the airline industry.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) on Thursday rolled out a series of safety measures for workers in Indiana who will make ventilators, outlining what could be a blueprint for opening U.S. auto plants in the coming weeks.
More than 1,000 GM workers will make the ventilators at GM's Kokomo, Indiana, plant. The automaker aims to begin mass production by mid-April and to make 10,000 ventilators a month by summer.
The measures include checking workers' temperature as they arrive for work, and each work station will be placed at least 6 feet (1.83 m) apart, GM said. 
There will be a 30-minute interval between shifts so workers can clean their work stations when they arrive and before they leave. Cleaning crews will sanitize common areas and ""touch areas"" such as door handles, at least three times per shift. 
A spokeswoman for GM said the measures may form a blueprint for safety protocols at the rest of GM's plants once the automaker decides to restart production when the pandemic crisis recedes.
Other big automakers and large U.S. employers in other industries, such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), are laying the groundwork to bring employees back to workplaces using screening and social distancing to address COVID-19 safety concerns.
Earlier this week,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said it will produce 50,000 ventilators over the next 100 days at a plant in Michigan in cooperation with  General Electric 's (N:GE) healthcare unit. It said it can then build 30,000 per month as needed to treat patients afflicted with the coronavirus.
Ford plans to deploy ""a whole host of techs to keep workers safe,"" developed in cooperation with the United Auto Workers union, Ford manufacturing executive Adrian Price said in a call earlier this week. 
Ford will organize production lines so workers are a safe distance apart and use technology to check their health, Price said. ""We have been planning the reopening of our facilities with this same approach.""

1567,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 06:19PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for April 3,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Wall Street ended up solidly in the green today, but it took an unprecedented rise in oil prices to lift it out of its uncertainty.
Energy stocks led the broader market higher after oil posted its best one-day on hopes (fueled by a tweet from President Donald Trump) that Saudi Arabia and Russia could put differences aside and slash crude output to the bone.
Oil’s unprecedented gains outweighed the unprecedented surge in weekly jobless claims. But there is more employment data to come Friday.
In addition, investors will be anxious for some more specificity about possible oil production cuts and the latest services numbers arrive.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. A Jobs Report Like No Other
Tomorrow’s employment report arrives at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT) and is a bit of an enigma.
The market will still watch it very closely, while acknowledging that the numbers will give the picture of an economy far from where we are now.
The jobs report survey was from the week of March 12, before any major U.S. state had gone into lockdown.
For that reason, economists are expecting a drop in nonfarm payrolls of just 100,000, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com. And we know 6.6 million people filed for first-time unemployment benefits last week.
The unemployment rate is seen rising to 3.8% from 3.5% and average hourly earnings are expected to have climbed 0.2%.
Beyond the headline numbers, the main thing to look out should be the measure of those who became part-time workers for economic reasons, Martha Gimbel, economist at Schmidt Futures, tweeted.
“Given how uncertain everything felt in early March (oh so long ago), it's plausible that employers cut hours and there was a jump in involuntary part-time work,” Gimbel said.


Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said earlier this week it expects the second-quarter jobless rate to come in at 13.2%, rising to 15% by midyear, Bloomberg reported.
2. Oil Market Now Needs Some Specifics
Oil came out of the blue to usurp the trading day (somewhat) from Covid-19. All it took was Trump tweeting his expectation of production cuts to send prices rocketing higher.
Crude has been beaten down so much it’s not surprising those expectations led to a spike. But as is often the case with policy-by-tweet, investors and traders are now left to look for specifics.
If production cuts do happen then will come after the OPEC+ meeting Saudi Arabia has requested. Any details on the specifics of a date and time could keep the bulls satisfied.
Saudi Arabia is willing to bring its production down to around 9 million bpd, but called Trump’s expectation of cuts of 10 million to 15 million barrels per day “exaggerated”, The Wall Street Journal reported.
Russia isn’t saying much, but any official word from them could be a market-mover as well.
3. ISM Services Seen Diving
The last batch of economic data for the week comes shortly after the opening bell when the Institute of Supply Management issues its services purchasing manager’s index (PMI) for March.
The measure of services activity, already weighted more by Wall Street than manufacturing given its greater share of GDP, has taken on new significance as the better gauge for the Covid-19-hit economy, with almost all restaurants and stores shuttered.
The index comes out at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT) and is expected to drop well into contraction territory from previous measure of solid expansion.
The ISM non-manufacturing PMI is expected to fall to 44 for March from 57.3 in February, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Given the recent numbers, a bigger drop wouldn’t be a surprise. But it should be noted that the record low for the index since its inception in 1997 is 37.3 in March 2008, the heart of the Financial Crisis."

""Financial institutions like ours are still awaiting guidance from the SBA and the U.S. Treasury. As a result, Chase will most likely not be able to start accepting applications on Friday, April 3rd, as we had hoped,"" according to the email seen by Reuters and verified by a bank spokeswoman.

1569,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 05:27PM ET</span>",Economists See U.S. Facing Worst-Ever Quarterly Contraction,"(Bloomberg) -- Economists say the U.S. is entering a sharp recession, with some projecting gross domestic product is headed for its worst drop in quarterly records back to 1947.
Containing the outbreak has forced the world’s largest economy to a sudden stop, shuttering businesses that are in turn poised to cut millions of jobs. Gross domestic product estimates range widely, but most economists expect a severe second-quarter drop will be followed by a rebound in the second half of the year as the pandemic abates.
Meanwhile, almost 10 million Americans filed for unemployment insurance in the two weeks through March 28, equivalent to the total in the first 6 1/2 months of the 2007-09 recession. Many economists see the 3.5% jobless rate -- which in February matched a half-century low -- doubling or tripling in coming months.
Estimates, of course, are evolving quickly as the deadly path of the outbreak shifts by the hour, and some can soon be overtaken by events. Here are some of the latest, with GDP expressed as the quarterly change, seasonally adjusted annual rate:

The new vehicles will use GM batteries and be assembled in GM plants in North America, the companies said. Honda plans to begin selling the vehicles in the United States and Canada in 2024.
""We are in discussions with one another regarding the possibility of further extending our partnership,"" Rick Schostek, executive vice president of American Honda said in a statement.
The relationship between GM and its smaller Japanese rival reflects industry pressures to share technology and development costs to meet demands for cleaner vehicles. Those pressures were significant before the COVID-19 pandemic slammed global vehicle demand, and promise to intensify as the crisis saps cash from manufacturers' accounts.
GM and Honda already collaborate on autonomous vehicles and fuel cell vehicle technology. The companies worked together on the design of an autonomous vehicle called Cruise Origin for GM's majority-owned Cruise Automation unit.
As part of the latest agreement, Honda will use GM's hands-free driver assistance technology, marketed by GM as Super Cruise. Honda also will incorporate GM's Onstar telematics services into the electric vehicles developed with GM.

1572,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 05:05PM ET</span>",Trump invokes Defense Production Act for ventilator manufacturing,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday invoked the Defense Production Act to aid companies building ventilators for coronavirus patients to receive the supply of materials they need.
In a memo released by the White House, Trump directed the U.S. Health and Human Services secretary to use his authority to help facilitate the supply of ventilator materials for six companies -  General Electric  Co (N:GE),  Hill-Rom Holdings Inc  (N:HRC),  Medtronic  Plc (N:MDT), Resmed Inc (N:RMD), Royal Philips N.V. and Vyaire Medical Inc.
Lawmakers have clamored for Trump to invoke the act to end or at least reduce the country's yawning shortage of ventilators. Because the fast-spreading coronavirus is a respiratory disease, the need for ventilators is multiplying by the hundreds each day. On Thursday Johns Hopkins University said more than 1 million people around the world currently have the coronavirus.
State officials and health experts said the United States will ultimately need tens of thousands of additional ventilators.
""I am grateful to these and other domestic manufacturers for ramping up their production of ventilators during this difficult time,"" Trump said in a short statement released alongside the memo. ""Today’s order will save lives by removing obstacles in the supply chain that threaten the rapid production of ventilators.""

Last week Trump first invoked the emergency powers to compel auto giant General Motors (N:GM) to produce ventilators.

The company's shares surged about 15% in extended trading.
The electric carmaker said Model Y production started in January and deliveries began in March, significantly ahead of schedule. 
It also said that its Shanghai factory in China continued to achieve record levels of production, despite significant setbacks.
Tesla last month suspended production at its Fremont, California, assembly plant under pressure from local authorities to curb the spread of the virus.

The company delivered 88,400 vehicles in the first quarter, including 76,200 Model 3/Y sedans and 12,200 Model S/X SUVs, below estimates of 93,399 vehicles, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

WILMINGTON, Del (Reuters) -  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (O:BBBY) has asked a judge to hold 1-800-Flowers.Com Inc (O:FLWS) to a $252 million deal between the companies in what appears to one of the first examples of a corporate sale coming unraveled due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The internet retailer of flowers and gift baskets agreed in February to buy the Pmall.com business from home furnishings retailer Bed Bath & Beyond, with a closing date of March 30.
Bed Bath said in its complaint, filed in Delaware's Court of Chancery, that 1-800-Flowers told it on March 24 the COVID-19 outbreak, the disease caused by the coronavirus, denied the company the resources to close the deal and integrate the business. 1-800-Flowers said it was delaying closing to April 30, according to the filing.
""Even a calamitous event such as COVID-19 does not permit a party to avoid its obligations,"" the lawsuit said. 
1-800-Flowers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Shares in Bed Bath were down about 6.8% in late trading at $3.53, while 1-800-Flowers stock was down about 3.5% at $12.20. Both trade on the Nasdaq, which was up about 0.6%.
The sale agreement contains a ""material adverse effect"" clause, or MAE, that permits 1-800-Flowers to terminate if there is an event that has a disproportionate impact on Pmall.com, as opposed to a broad-based impact across the economy. Bed Bath's court papers said 1-800-Flowers did not invoke the MAE.
Wall Street's dealmakers are closely watching the impact of the pandemic and unprecedented economic shutdown. Deal activity in the United States fell by half from a year ago in the first three months of 2020, to $252 billion.
Many pending deals were negotiated months before the pandemic intensified, raising doubts if buyers will make good on their agreements.
U.S. auto parts company BorgWarner Inc (N:BWA) threatened to walk away from a $951 million deal to buy Delphi Technologies (N:DLPH) on Tuesday after the automotive equipment supplier drew down on a credit line without its acquirer’s approval.
Despite the unprecedented impact of ""stay home"" orders that have shut businesses globally and contributed to a plunge in oil prices, corporate lawyers have questioned if buyers can get out of mergers.
Delaware judges have a history of holding buyers to deals, although in 2018 Germany's Fresenius SE (DE:FREG) was allowed to end its $4.75 billion takeover of  Akorn  Inc (O:AKRX), after the generic drugmaker suffered a dramatic decline in business.

Investing.com - Tesla surged in after-hours trading on Thursday after its first-quarter deliveries topped analysts estimates, with the electric automaker hailing its ""best ever"" first quarter of production, despite coronavirus-led disruptions.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was up 10% after the report.
Tesla said it had delivered about 88,400 in the first quarter of 2020, markedly up from 63,000 vehicles delivered a year earlier, and above analysts' expectations for 79,908.
The beat on deliveries arrived as the company said it had a record first quarter, producing 102,672 vehicles as the Shanghai factory continued to achieve record levels of production, even as the Covid-19 outbreak hurt output. 
"" In the first quarter, we produced almost 103,000 vehicles and delivered approximately 88,400 vehicles. This is our best ever first quarter performance,"" Tesla said.
Model Y production got underway in January and deliveries started in March, ahead of schedule, the company said. 
Ahead of the report, analysts had expressed little optimism that Tesla would deliver impressive first-quarter numbers, and were doubtful about the company hitting its target 500,000 delivery target for this year.
""To this point, we now believe (Tesla) hitting the 500,000 unit delivery threshold for 2020 is a virtual impossibility,"" Wedbush said, estimating deliveries to within a 400,000 to 425,000 range.

1576,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 04:27PM ET</span>",New York Unemployment Fund Nears Insolvency as Claims Skyrocket,"(Bloomberg) --
New York is the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. It’s also among the states least prepared to deal with the record surge of unemployment claims by workers in restaurants, retail shops and hotels closed to slow the outbreak.
New York’s unemployment insurance trust had about $2.7 billion at the end of 2019, less than half the minimum needed to remain solvent during a recession, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. With claims skyrocketing, the state has enough money to cover the checks for about 10 weeks, according to an estimate by the Tax Foundation, a Washington-based think tank.
“New York’s unemployment compensation trust fund is basically insolvent,” wrote Jared Walczak, director of state tax policy at the Tax Foundation. “Funds will be exhausted even more quickly should unemployment compensation claims continue to rise.”
Almost 10 million American applied for unemployment benefits in the last two weeks, highlighting the devastating economic impact of the coronavirus as shutdowns widened across the country. About 450,000 of them were New Yorkers, according to the state’s Department of Labor. Only California, Pennsylvania and Ohio saw more claims.
A spokesperson for the New York Department of Labor didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
During the Great Recession, the majority of states exhausted their unemployment insurance reserves and either borrowed from the U.S. Treasury or issued bonds to rebuild their trusts, according to Kroll Bond Rating Agency. States that have rebuilt reserves such as Georgia and North Carolina will have less pressure to raise unemployment taxes, Kroll wrote in a report Wednesday.
New York’s trust fund had a solvency level of 0.36 as of Dec. 31, where a level of 1.0 means the state could pay out claims for a year at the average level of the worst three years of the past twenty, according to the U.S. Labor Department. California, Texas, New York, Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania are among the 22 states and jurisdictions that do not meet the recommended standard of solvency. Only California’s unemployment trust fund is in worse shape than New York’s, according to the department.
Nationally, there are now nearly twice as many people claiming or already receiving unemployment benefits as there were over the comparison period, meaning that with current claims, states would run out twice as fast, the Tax Foundation’s Walczak wrote.
The economic stimulus signed by President Donald Trump provides additional federally-funded benefits to unemployed workers, and expands eligibility to previously uncovered workers, but states are still on the hook for regular benefits.
“The state will have to borrow from the federal government, and will ultimately have to pay back those loans with interest, while New York employers will eventually face higher federal unemployment insurance taxes to compensate the federal government for extending loans to the state,” Walczak wrote.

1578,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 04:10PM ET</span>",Coronavirus punishes Warren Buffett's equity holdings,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic may have erased around $64 billion of value from Warren Buffett's equity portfolio at  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), setting up the conglomerate for one of the largest quarterly losses ever by an American company.
""The headline number will be ugly,"" said James Shanahan, an Edward Jones & Co analyst with a ""buy"" rating on Berkshire, referring to net results. 
Berkshire's portfolio of U.S.-listed stocks, including Kraft Heinz Co (O:KHC), may have shrunk by 26% in the first quarter if Berkshire did no buying and selling, according to Refinitiv data and regulatory filings. 
By contrast, the Standard & Poor's 500 (SPX) fell just 20%, and Berkshire's own stock fell about the same.
Buffett urges investors to think long-term, focusing on Berkshire's operating results and the intrinsic value of its stock holdings, some of which it has owned for decades.
In his Feb. 22 shareholder letter, Buffett said he expects the stocks to deliver ""major gains,"" albeit irregularly.
Still, the declines reflect challenges the pandemic poses even for Buffett, the world's fourth-richest person according to Forbes magazine and among its most esteemed investors.
They also followed Buffett's prediction in a Feb. 24 interview on CNBC, five days after the S&P 500 set an all-time high, that Berkshire would outperform in down markets, and over the long term perform ""in a very, very safe manner.""
The 89-year-old Buffett had prostate cancer in 2012, and last month began working at his Omaha, Nebraska, home rather than Berkshire's office two miles away. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to his assistant.
Berkshire owns more than 90 businesses such as the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, its namesake energy company and smaller businesses such as See's candies and Borsheims jewelry. AIRLINES STAGGER Since 2018, an accounting rule has required Berkshire to report paper gains and losses from its stocks with earnings, resulting in huge gyrations.
For example, annual net income swelled to $81.42 billion in 2019 from $4.02 billion in 2018, a down year for stocks, while operating profit fell 3% to $23.97 billion.
After taxes are factored in, Berkshire's first-quarter net loss could rival quarterly losses of $44.9 billion posted by AOL Time Warner in 2002, or $42.5 billion by General Motors (NYSE:GM) in 2007. Berkshire's loss could grow further if it wrote down its 26.6% Kraft Heinz stake, which some analysts call overdue. But it would likely fall short of American International Group Inc's (N:AIG) $61.7 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 2008. Much of the weakness likely came in financials, where the value of Berkshire's disclosed stakes in Bank of America Corp (N:BAC),  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) and  American Express  Co (N:AXP) fell about $27 billion in the quarter. Berkshire's stake in Apple Inc (O:AAPL), its largest holding, may have fallen nearly $9 billion. Another $5 billion may have disappeared from stakes in the four biggest U.S. carriers:  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL), Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL). And Occidental Petroleum Co (N:OXY) sank 72%, stung by plunging oil prices and leverage after it bought Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC), which Berkshire helped fund with $10 billion of preferred stock throwing off $800 million of annual dividends. FOOD NOURISHES
Quarterly results are expected around May 2 when Berkshire holds its annual meeting, though the pandemic forced Buffett to cancel the surrounding ""Woodstock for Capitalists,"" a weekend of events that normally draw more than 40,000 people to Omaha.
At least four Berkshire-owned stocks rose last quarter. Perhaps unsurprisingly, all are associated with consumer staples or healthcare, sectors that many investors expect to outperform in down markets.
They included retailer Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), biotechnology company Biogen Inc (O:BIIB), kidney dialysis provider  DaVita Inc  (N:DVA) and grocer  Kroger Co  (N:KR).
Another grocer in Berkshire's portfolio, Costco Wholesale Corp (O:COST), fell just 3%. It remains unclear how the pandemic might let Buffett whittle Berkshire's $128 billion cash pile. Buffett prefers buying whole companies to stocks, but has not made an ""elephant"" sized acquisition since 2016. He could also offer lifelines to companies, as he did during the 2008-2009 financial crisis for  General Electric  Co (N:GE),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and even Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG). Shanahan said Buffett could find many new places to invest.
""I would be super-disappointed if he didn't put tens of billions of dollars of his capital to work in the first half of this year,"" he said.

Investing.com – The Dow rallied on Thursday, but traders had to contend with another wild session on Wall Street, as oil prices mounted their biggest one-day percentage gain ever, overshadowing a record jump in jobless claims amid a coronavirus-led lockdown across swathes of the country, with infections topping 1 million worldwide. 
The Dow rose 2.24%, or 470 points. The S&P 500 added 2.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.7% higher.
Oil prices settled up 24%, their highest ever percentage gain, pushing energy stocks and the broader market higher, as President Donald Trump talked up the potential of a Russia-Saudi oil-production-cut agreement.
""Just spoke to my friend MBS (Crown Prince) of Saudi Arabia, who spoke with President Putin of Russia, & I expect & hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels, and maybe substantially more which, if it happens, will be GREAT for the oil & gas industry!"" Trump tweeted.
Reports that Russia is planning to stick it out with the lower oil price environment raised some concern that the Kremlin may be wary of striking a deal with Saudi Arabia to cut production. Russia's revised budget for 2020 reportedly shows the country is planning for a $20-a-barrel oil price environment, Bloomberg reported.
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabian officials said Trump's claims of cuts of more than 10 million barrels per day were an ""exaggeration,"" The Wall Street Journal reported.
Even if managed, a 15 million bpd cut is unlikely to prevent glut in supply, with Stacey Morris at Alerian estimating the coronavirus impact had slashed demand by about 20 million bpd, The Wall Street Journal reported.
""Clearly, it's (the potential cut) better than the alternative of doing nothing and waiting for physical storage constraints to limit production,"" Morris said. ""However, even if cuts total 15 million bpd, the global oil market could still be in an oversupply situation.""
Ahead of nonfarm payrolls report due Friday, jobless claims were higher than expected with another 6.65 million Americans filing for first-time unemployment insurance last week.
Utilities and materials also contributed to broad-based rally, with the rising Covid-19 infections seemingly taking a back seat.
Coronavirus infections reached 1 million worldwide, with more than 50,000 dead so far.  "

The nominees have experience in finance, operations, strategy as well as construction products and are ""uniquely capable to help govern the Company through and after this crisis and position it for future success,"" the filing said.
GCP's stock price climbed more than 5% to trade at $16.68 in afternoon trading. Over the last 52 weeks the stock price has dropped 46.8% and is off 26.4% since the start of 2020. Starboard has criticized the company, which is worth roughly $1.14 billion, for having missed its own financial expectations and that its stock price lagged behind its peers.
This marks the second time in two years that Starboard has become involved with GCP. Last year the company handed the hedge fund two board seats.
Since then the company has run a strategic process to consider options, changed its chief executive officer and cut costs. 
This year the company has tried to work collaboratively with Starboard to avoid a proxy fight, a spokesman said.
But the hedge fund is pushing ahead with a ""self-serving proxy fight that is out of touch with the realities of the current operating environment and global crisis,"" a company spokesman said. ""It is designed to undermine a Board and management team - that have been delivering positive financial and operating results and prudently managing the balance sheet - with directors who have limited experience in the sector and have yet to provide any plan.""
Starboard said in its filing ""we recognize the COVID-19 crisis has created a difficult environment for many companies and their respective employees, customers, and partners. GCP is no different and needs strong leadership and oversight during these challenging times."" 
This marks the second time this year that Starboard has asked for additional board seats at a company where it won board seats in 2019.
In March Starboard nominated four directors, including Feld, to the board of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) where it was able to help name a director in 2019.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force has recommended the release of up to $924 million in payments to Boeing (NYSE:BA) that were held back due to flaws in the KC-46 air refueling tanker, according to a memo seen by Reuters and a source familiar with the situation.
The recommendation, which was sent to Air Force contracting officials, is aimed at maintaining the financial health of suppliers to the Department of Defense, and will free up funding for numerous contractors, not just Boeing.
Boeing's financial situation has become increasingly precarious as economic fallout from the coronavirus has frozen key lending markets and cut off demand for Boeing's commercial aircraft.
The Air Force has the right to hold back about $28 million of the cost of each of the first 52 KC-46 Pegasus jets on order to ensure Boeing delivers fully functional tankers.
Thirty-three of the aircraft, which refuel other aircraft mid-air, have so far been delivered. The Air Force plans to buy 179, but the program has been plagued with problems, including foreign object debris found onboard the planes and issues with a camera system used during the refueling process. 
In addition, a second person familiar with the matter said the Air Force and Boeing have a memo of agreement that would allow the flying tanker jet to enter service for refueling missions. So far the jet has only been flying cargo missions.
The agreement, expected to be announced later on Thursday, focuses on the remote vision camera system and will allow for a series of new technical upgrades to cameras, processors and displays on the jet.
Boeing has temporarily shut several production lines in Washington state due to the spread of the coronavirus.
On Monday, the Air Force announced an additional major technical issue with the KC-46 Pegasus related to fuel leaks that could endanger the aircrew and aircraft.

An Air Force spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Investing.com – The Dow climbed on Thursday, after briefly swinging negative as traders assess a potential Saudi-Russia agreement to cut production.     
The Dow rose 1.39%, or 290 points, but had been 500 points up at the highs of the day. The S&P 500 added 1.45% and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.87 higher.
Oil prices settled up 24% after Trump stoked hopes of production cuts and an end to the Saudi-Russia price war  
""Just spoke to my friend MBS (Crown Prince) of Saudi Arabia, who spoke with President Putin of Russia, & I expect & hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels, and maybe substantially more which, if it happens, will be GREAT for the oil & gas industry!"" Trump tweeted.
The potential for a 15 million bpd cut, however, is unlikely to prevent glut in supply, with Stacey Morris at Alerian reportedly estimating the coronavirus impact had slashed demand by about 20 million bpd, The Wall Street Journal reported.
""Clearly, it's (the potential cut) better than the alternative of doing nothing and waiting for physical storage constraints to limit production,"" Morris said. ""However, even if cuts total 15 million bpd, the global oil market could still be in an oversupply situation.""
The rally on Wall Street comes even as jobless claims were higher than expected with another 6.65 million Americans filing for first-time unemployment insurance last week.
The bearish labor market report arrived ahead of the nonfarm payrolls due tomorrow, but it is unlikely to ""reflect the true extent of job losses as the survey period covered the second week of March, before social distancing and business closures put millions out of work,"" RBC said.
Utilities and materials also contributed to broad-based rally, with the rising Covid-19 infections seemingly taking a back seat.

1589,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 03:19PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar Rides Euro Slump Higher as Jobless Claims Hit Record,"By Yasin Ebrahim 
Invesing.com – The dollar shrugged off earlier-day blues on Thursday, as a record jump in jobless claims led some to seek safety in the greenback a day ahead of the nonfarm payrolls report.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.52% to 100.27.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims rose by 3.3 million to a seasonally adjusted 6.6 million, well above economists’ forecast for an increase of 3.5 million.
The sharp rise in initial jobless has set a bearish tone for the nonfarm payrolls report due on Friday, with some keen to assess how deep the coronavirus-impact has been on the hiring in March.
But the report will not be a true reflection of the job losses as ""the survey period covered the second week of March, before social distancing and business closures put millions out of work,"" RBC said.
The dollar was also helped by a plunge in the euro as eurozone wholesale inflation data fell short of expectations, exacerbating fears the economic bloc is set for a deep recession that could rival the Great Recession that unfolded from December 2007 to June 2009.
EUR/USD fell 1% to $1.0844.
""With most eurozone countries in partial or full lockdown, GDP contraction this year is likely to rival the Great Recession,"" ING said in a note.
The bold claim is not without merit as the European Commission has also flagged similar concerns.
""Assuming an extension of the health crisis up to the beginning of June or beyond, the fall in economic activity in 2020 could be comparable to the contraction of 2009, the worst year of the Economic and Financial Crisis,"" the European Commission said last month."

(Reuters) - Battered S&P 500 stocks may get fresh interest from investors turning to dividends in a world of shrinking bond yields. 
The dividend yield on the S&P 500 now exceeds the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury by its highest margin in nearly five decades after a flight to safe-haven assets compressed government bond yields to record lows. 
Graphic: S&P 500 dividend yield vs 10-year Treasury https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdpzdrzpwa/SPX%20Div%20Yield%20Take%20Five.png
Wall Street's coronavirus sell-off has left the S&P 500 down 26% from its February record high, lifting its dividend yield to 2.46%, the highest since 2009, according to Refinitiv's Datastream.
By comparison, investors' rush to government bonds has pushed the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasuries to record lows, most recently on Thursday at 0.59%. Bond yields fall as prices rise. 
With Treasury yields so low, ""income-seeking investors should consider stocks with both high dividend yields and the capacity to maintain the distributions,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) recommended in a note to clients this week.
The bank's report highlighted a list of 40 companies with comparatively high dividend yields, a long history of dividend payouts and stable balance sheets, among them  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), Johnson & Johnson, Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. 
Historically, 10-year Treasury yields have almost always been higher than S&P 500 dividend yields, with a handful of exceptions since the 2008 financial crisis. At over 1.8 percentage points, the current spread between the S&P 500 dividend yield and 10-year Treasuries is the largest since at least the early 1970s, according to Datastream data, which does not go back any further.
Attractive dividend yields on Wall Street may not last, however. Goldman Sachs warned in its report that S&P 500 dividends are likely to shrink by 25% in 2020 as companies vulnerable to the economic shock of the coronavirus outbreak cut or scrap payments to shareholders.
Companies borrowing government money under a $2 trillion economic stimulus package approved last week are not allowed to repurchase shares or pay dividends until they repay their loans. Corporations including Boeing (NYSE:BA), Macy's (NYSE:M) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) have already suspended their dividends. 
S&P 500 dividends in the March quarter reached a record $127 billion, up 8% from the previous year, according to S&P Dow Jones analyst Howard Silverblatt. However, in the same quarter, a total of 13 S&P 500 companies reduced future dividends by $13.7 billion, including 10 companies that suspended their dividends, he said.
In another report, BofA Global Research estimated that in an extreme scenario in which troubled industries slash dividends to zero, the S&P 500's overall dividend yield would fall by only about 9 basis points.

""We recommend high quality and safe - not high - dividend yield companies until credit conditions stabilize,"" BofA Global Research wrote.

1593,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 02:35PM ET</span>",U.S. small business bailout starts Friday. Is the government ready?,"By Andy Sullivan and Ann Saphir
(Reuters) - Chris Hurn, founder of Fountainhead Commercial Capital, has received 7,400 small business loan requests in the past two weeks, more than his business has handled in its five years of existence. 
The Lake Mary, Florida-based non-bank lender is just one of thousands of financial institutions across the country preparing to dole out $349 billion in government-backed loans and grants starting Friday, just one week after they were created as part of the $2.3 trillion fiscal stimulus bill.
The brand-new Paycheck Protection Program, aimed at keeping large swaths of Main Street afloat as the coronavirus pandemic spreads, enlists the U.S. Treasury, the Small Business Administration (SBA), and many of the country's financial institutions in an effort that economists say is crucial to keeping the United States from plunging into a deep downturn. 
It offers government-backed, low-interest, forgivable loans, to businesses that keep employees on their payroll despite the shutdowns, part of the Trump administration's push to keep Americans off of unemployment benefits. 
It also throws the nearly 67-year-old SBA into a higher profile role than ever before, one that some lenders worry it could struggle to fill. 
GIANT EXPANSION 
The rescue package amounts to a giant expansion of activity for the 3,300 people who work at SBA. The $349 billion in loans Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is hoping to move quickly through that program is 12 times the $28.1 billion in loans the SBA approved in all of fiscal 2019. 
According to budget documents, the SBA approved 58,000 loans through its main program in the most recent fiscal year, 16% short of its target figure. Millions of small businesses could apply for the paycheck protection program on Friday alone.
The new program requires banks to verify lenders' payroll costs, and that they were negatively impacted by the coronavirus, and then register the loans with SBA to make sure borrowers are not double-dipping. The loans are backed by the U.S. Treasury. 
The agency, which has its roots in a Depression-era program, has seen declining demand for its loans in recent years due to the strong economy. 
It will be handling this record volume at a time when most government employees are encouraged to work from home, something just half of the SBA's employees were eligible to do in 2017, the most recent year for which figures are available. 
An SBA spokeswoman told Reuters the agency has a ""flexible workplace policy that enables both full telework and in-office capabilities."" 
The SBA didn't address questions about whether the agency might struggle to handle the program.
Government watchdogs have repeatedly found that the SBA has not done enough over the years to verify that lenders are only working with applicants who can't get credit elsewhere - one of the central pillars of the existing program. 
That's not a requirement of the new program, which is open to all existing employers that have been hurt by the coronavirus. What's not clear is how ably the agency can conduct the proper oversight, said William Shear, who investigates the SBA for the Government Accountability Office.
""What is SBA going to do, if anything, in overseeing these lenders? Are they going to be spot-checking some loans?"" he said.
Some of the country's big banks, worried the program poses too much legal and financial risk, have threatened not to participate.
Hurn says his company won't be able to provide any loans until SBA provides more information and guidance. The idea that the SBA could roll out the regulations Friday morning and ""that we are going to be pumping money out by 4 p.m., that's just a fantasy right now,"" he said. 
SPEED IS KEY 
Mnuchin has pledged that the first businesses may get their money as quickly as 48 hours, compared with 30 days or more it takes to process normal SBA loans. 
U.S. businesses with fewer than 500 employees account for 44% of U.S. GDP and support 61 million jobs, according to Moody's.
Treasury is enlisting banks, credit unions, and small business loan specialists like Fountainhead to get the money out quickly. On Tuesday it put out a call for others lenders to apply as well. 
""They say this program will start on Friday, but we have serious doubts that it will,"" said Sam Taussig of online lender Kabbage Inc., which applied on Tuesday. 
Guidance so far for lenders and borrowers has been sparse. Treasury has released a two-page borrower form that lenders will need to translate into a lending agreement and program into an online application that can be sent to the SBA. 
Even if the lender can get that done quickly, the SBA's intake system, known as ETRAN, could be problematic, Taussig said.
ETRAN ""is a technology junkyard...a disaster on a normal day that is liable to break, or produce error codes,"" he said. 

Hurn said he's worried the program's Friday launch won't be reassuring to U.S. businesses. “If it lands with a thud tomorrow, which I think is very possible, based on what information still needs to come out, that is going to make people feel even more dire.”

(Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp said it has terminated a $3 billion tender offer for additional WeWork shares agreed last year with shareholders, drawing threats of legal action and plunging the floundering office space company further into crisis.
The tech investment giant said in statement that given its duty to its shareholders it could no longer proceed with the deal, citing criminal and civil probes into the startup, WeWork's failure to restructure a joint venture in China and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. 
A special committee of WeWork's board said it was disappointed and is considering ""all of its legal options, including litigation.""
SoftBank's decision to rescind the offer means the Japanese firm is no longer obligated to proceed with a further $1.1 billion in debt financing for WeWork. It also underscores the depth of the disarray at WeWork, which is undergoing a drastic restructuring and whose earnings are at risk as many countries impose orders to stay at home due to the pandemic.
""WeWork is in real trouble and SoftBank's withdrawal from the share purchase worsens the situation materially,"" Richard Windsor, an independent analyst, wrote in a note. 
The startup, which lost $1.25 billion in the third quarter, told investors last week that it had $4.4 billion in cash and cash commitments and would be able to weather the economic downturn.
The tender offer, which would have mostly benefited a select group of shareholders including ousted co-founder Adam Neumann, had been agreed in October as part of bailout plan by SoftBank after WeWork's IPO plans flopped. Investors had been concerned about its losses and a business model that involves taking long-term leases and renting out spaces for a short term.
In November, sources said the New York State Attorney General was investigating WeWork, examining whether Neumann, indulged in self-dealing to enrich himself. A spokeswoman for Neumann declined to comment at the time.
SoftBank said in its statement that there were ""multiple, new, and significant"" pending criminal and civil investigations in which authorities have also requested information about WeWork's financing activities and communications with investors.
Following the termination of the deal, SoftBank shares closed up 2.5%, outperforming a 1.4% decline for the broader Tokyo market. 
SoftBank itself has been under growing financial strain, with souring tech bets bringing it under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management and pushing it into a radical pledge to raise $41 billion by selling down core assets to raise cash for share buybacks and to reduce debt.

A merger of its U.S. wireless unit Sprint with T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) was completed on Wednesday, which will provide an undetermined gain to be booked in the quarter ending June and will reduce strains on its balance sheet.

1596,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 02:10PM ET</span>","EU tells insurers to suspend dividends, avoid bonuses in pandemic","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Insurers and reinsurers in the European Union should temporarily suspend dividends and share buybacks, and consider postponing bonuses as well to ensure continuity in services during the coronavirus pandemic, the bloc's insurance regulator said on Thursday.
The virus has led to lockdowns of economies and a rising number of insurance claims as travel and events are canceled, and business disrupted.
The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) said it was essential to ensure insurers and reinsurers hold a ""robust level"" of reserves to protect policyholders and absorb potential losses.
""This objective requires that (re)insurers take all necessary steps to continue to ensure a robust level of own funds to be able to protect policyholders and absorb potential losses,"" EIOPA said in a statement.
""This prudent approach should also be applicable to the variable remuneration policies,"" EIOPA said.
Insurers should review their current remuneration policies, practices and rewards and ensure they reflect ""prudent capital planning"" and the current economic situation.
""In such context, the variable part of remuneration policies should be set at a conservative level and should be considered for postponement,"" EIOPA added.
Insurers that consider themselves legally required to pay out dividends or large amounts of variable remuneration should explain the underlying reasons to their national regulator, it said.
The suspensions should be reviewed as the financial and economic impact of the COVID-19 epidemic starts to become clearer, the watchdog added.
The statement is similar to a letter from Bank of England Deputy Governor Sam Woods on Tuesday to insurer CEOs in Britain, asking them to pay close attention to the need to protect policyholders and remain sound before taking decisions on dividends or bonuses.

1597,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 02:05PM ET</span>",EU banking watchdog sets out relief for virus-hit loans,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union's banking watchdog published guidance on Thursday to help banks avoid having to step up provisioning for loans to companies temporarily hit by the coronavirus crisis.
Several EU countries have introduced stop-gap ""moratoria"" such as repayment holidays for companies and individuals as large parts of the economy are in lockdown and unemployment rockets.
""The EBA sees the payment moratoria as effective tools to address short-term liquidity difficulties caused by the limited or suspended operation of many businesses and individuals,"" the European Banking Authority said in a statement.
Under mandatory accounting rules, banks must step up provisioning, which eats into profits and capital, if the repayment on a loan is missed.
Banks had called for more detailed guidance from EBA on how moratoria can in practice avoid having to reclassify - and therefore increase provisioning - for a loan when a repayment is missed for whatever reason.
Banks are called on to roll over working capital loans for businesses on a daily basis and wanted to know what to do if a repayment was missed, a banking industry official said.
""Do we say 'sorry', no money?"" the official added.
Bankers said the moratoria were introduced piecemeal by national governments across the bloc rather than a single measure under EU law, creating legal uncertainties.
In a bid to reassure lenders they are on solid legal territory in following the guidance, EBA sets out the legal basis in EU law for its advice.
EBA said a payment moratoria does not lead to reclassifying a loan if it was launched in response to Covid-19 and is being broadly applied to a wide range of borrowers, adding it only changes the schedule of payments. It does not apply to new loans granted after the moratorium was launched, EBA said.
The guidelines will apply to moratoria introduced before 30 June, 2020, but this could be extended, if considered necessary.
In the meantime, banks should collect information for their regulator about the scope and effects of the use of the moratoria, EBA said.
""Institutions are expected to make use of the general payment moratoria in a transparent manner, providing relevant information to their competent authorities, while specific disclosure requirements to the public will be published at a later point in time,"" EBA said.

But banks must continue to apply provisioning rules where borrowers face longer-term financial difficulties, and identify where short-term ""payment challenges"" may lead to insolvency and therefore need to be adequately capitalised, EBA said.

Investing.com - The coronavirus pandemic has put health masks at the top of the list of must-have essentials for health care professionals and individuals alike, but manufacturers are warning it could be months before they can meet demand. 
Despite doubling its production of N95 masks since January, considered the gold standard by medical workers and public-health officials, 3M (NYSE:MMM) has conceded that it just can't keep up with demand, The Wall Street Journal reported.
“The demand we have exceeds our production capacity,” 3M Chief Executive Mike Roman said in an interview.
By mid-March, 3M doubled mask production to nearly 100 million per month globally, including 35 million per month in the U.S. at plants in South Dakota and Nebraska. But that is well below the estimated 300 million that U.S. healthcare workers would need monthly to fight a pandemic, according to the Journal. 
3M said it plans to hire 1,000 workers to make 20 million N95 masks per month by May at plants in Rhode Island and Arizona, as part of a move to double its global mask production over the next year."

LONDON (Reuters) - The world's top oil and gas companies are rushing to raise tens of billion of dollars in debt to help them weather one of the worst downturns in the sector's history while faced with high fixed costs and looming dividend payments. 
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa),  BP  (LON:BP), France's Total, Norway's Equinor and Austria's OMV have all tapped bond markets this week, raising more than $10 billion according to Reuters calculations.
Oil prices sank 65% in the first three months of the year to lows of $22 a barrel as strict movement restrictions imposed around the world to limit the spread of the coronavirus led to a collapse in demand for transportation fuels, while a fight for market share between top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia accelerated price falls. 
The top five so-called oil majors saw their combined debt rise to $230 billion last year as they borrowed to maintain capital spending while giving back billions to shareholders.
(GRAPHIC-Big Oil's rising debt: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/9153/9134/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
This week's forays into the bond markets come after  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) raised $8.5 billion last month, while Shell also announced a $12 billion revolving credit facility this week. 
""All the majors are shoring up liquidity to cover mid-term requirements. No one wants to be at the back of the queue,"" said a banker involved in debt raising. ""The companies want to demonstrate they are able to ride out the storm,"" he added.
The European bond issues were all reported to be over-subscribed despite credit agencies downgrading the ratings or ratings outlooks of the oil majors in recent days.
A Shell spokeswoman said the debt raising was ""part of actively managing our liquidity, in addition to our additional credit facility"".
OMV confirmed the tranches. BP and Total did not respond to requests for comment. Equinor said on Wednesday the bond would ""strengthen our financial resilience and flexibility"".
The oil majors are expected to report sharp drops in revenue in the first quarter with analysts saying some would need to borrow money to cover spending and dividend payouts.
Although the recent collapse in prices is now forcing them to sharply scale back discretionary spending, none have so far indicated an intention to reduce dividends, although investors and analysts said they might be forced to in case of a protracted downturn.

1606,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 12:36PM ET</span>",T-Mobile’s Jumbo Bond Draws Good Reception,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A headline from three days ago read “Banks Stuck With $23 Billion of Loans for T-Mobile’s Sprint Deal.” A group of 16 banks would have to provide money to T-Mobile US Inc. to close its planned acquisition of Sprint Corp. because they couldn’t sell debt to third-party investors. T-Mobile would refinance the bridge loan in the bond market as soon as financing conditions improved.
Well, that was quick.
The mobile carrier plans to tap the corporate-bond market Thursday with a deal of about $10 billion, with proceeds helping repay that $19 billion bridge credit agreement (it signed a new $4 billion term loan on Wednesday as well). Even though it’s one of the biggest debt sales of the year, financial markets still remain highly volatile and T-Mobile’s credit rating was cut this week deeper into speculative grade, the company received more than $30 billion of orders from investors, Bloomberg News’s Molly Smith reported.
That’s impressive, considering that the initial pricing levels for this investment-grade offering were already favorable for the company. T-Mobile’s 10-year bonds are expected to yield around 375 basis points more than benchmark Treasuries, Bloomberg News reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. By comparison, a Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) index of triple-B corporate bonds with an average maturity of 11.75 years has a spread of 359 basis points, near the lowest since March 18. That’s close enough — and it’s likely that T-Mobile’s gap will narrow with such a large order book.
It’s even more interesting to compare this new deal, with the lowest investment grades of Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and BBB- by S&P Global Ratings, and T-Mobile’s last offering in January 2018, which is speculative grade. The company priced 10-year bonds at the time at a spread of 209 basis points more than Treasuries, to yield 4.75%. T-Mobile’s spreads are now much wider, even though this new debt is “senior-secured,” but 10-year U.S. yields are more than 200 basis points lower than they were 26 months ago. That means the all-in 10-year yield for T-Mobile will probably be about 4.35% — a good deal lower than the previous rate.
This is important context to remember for both companies and bond buyers. The rapid price swings across markets in the past month and the focus on yield spreads have somewhat masked the fact that whenever the outlook starts to stabilize, borrowing costs will once again be as low as ever for creditworthy corporations. The benchmark 10-year yield is a mere 0.6%, near the all-time low closing level of 0.54% set on March 9. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). technical strategists said in a report Thursday that the benchmark could reach 0% this quarter and potentially even turn negative if governments struggle to contain the coronavirus outbreak.
With so much uncertainty, it’s understandable that T-Mobile seized on this window to get on with its plans. It formally completed its merger with Sprint on Wednesday morning. Mike Sievert, who was named chief executive officer, told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday that the timing of the bond sale relative to the bridge loan was “coincidental.” The fact that the group of banks was ready to help get the acquisition over the finish line was the most prudent first step, he said. Then the company deemed the market had thawed enough to borrow.
“We’ve been watching the markets over the past few days and seeing an improving condition for us to go to the market with this investment-grade offer. Today looked like the right day,” Sievert said. “The last couple of days, obviously we were in the process of taking down the bridge and we had the merger news that made the last couple of days the wrong time to be in the market.”
Obviously, T-Mobile would have had a better borrowing backdrop a few months ago. But large companies are rarely in position to perfectly time the market. In most cases, good reception is enough.

1607,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>",Uber to start shipping car disinfectants to drivers,"(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc will begin shipping disinfecting car spray to selected drivers in areas most affected by the coronavirus outbreak, an executive said on Thursday.
The company had promised to supply drivers with sanitizers in early March. Then it closed all of its local hubs, places where drivers can go to receive in-person help or use the bathroom, leaving drivers in the dark over where to receive supplies.
Uber senior vice president of global rides and platform operations, Andrew Macdonald, said on Twitter that the company had received an initial batch of 30,000 bottles of cleaning spray by Atlanta-based company Zep Inc. 
He said select drivers could place an order in the app and receive shipment free of charge.
""As a start, we’re prioritizing the most active drivers in a few cities, incl. NYC,"" Macdonald wrote on Twitter, adding that the company was working on securing more supplies.
Previously, Uber said suppliers had prioritized orders for healthcare, with its own orders being moved down the queue several times.
 Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) last week said it had distributed many supplies to drivers while its hubs were still open and was working a way to distribute them now, but declined to provide additional details.
Lyft did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
Ride-hailing demand has grinded to a halt in most U.S. cities, with a majority of Americans now under some form of lockdown.

The epidemic has also exposed drivers and companies to the downside of an ambiguous contractor model, leaving drivers more vulnerable than traditional employees.

1608,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>",Your money: How to adjust your autopay spending during the coronavirus pandemic,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coronavirus lockdowns might have caught a lot of people by surprise last month, but with April's new billing cycle, it is time for cash-strapped Americans to rethink automatic spending habits. 
Are you turning off that monthly parking pass? Your gym membership? What about the balance due for summer camp? 
You may have many recurring charges on credit cards you do not even notice most months, what experts refer to as gray charges. 
""This is a time more than any other that people need to be aware of where their money is going,"" said Haroon Mokhtarzada, co-founder and chief executive of Truebill, a free service that evaluates your spending and helps you cancel services you no longer want.
Automation is usually helpful in personal finance, but it makes things tricky with the economy on pause. 
Ramit Sethi, author of ""I Will Teach You to Be Rich"" and one of the chief proponents of this approach, is now hosting fireside chats on YouTube to coach his followers on how to turn off some of those payments and ask for help (https:// 
""You should call your credit card company, your student loan company, and your landlord,"" Sethi said. ""Many companies are willing to help by pausing payments, restructuring payments, or even waiving payments altogether.""
If you want help with everyday expenses, you will need to dig a little deeper. Here is how to handle some scenarios: 
*Commuter benefits
If you have pre-tax deductions taken from your paycheck for rail passes or parking, log onto the website that administers the service, like WageWorks, and shut it off. Wait times could be long for a customer service agent if you cannot figure out how to do it electronically. You also may have already missed the window for April, depending on your billing date. 
WageWorks advises that normal refund policies are still in place. If your pass does not expire, just hold on to it for now, the company said (https://www.wageworks.com/commuter-covid/). 
*Gym memberships
Many national fitness chains have Covid-19 information pages available online, although messaging varies. 
Some, like LA Fitness, immediately paused all billing and waived all freeze fees. Members inadvertently billed during the freeze will get their membership time extended, said Jill Greuling, president of club operations for the chain. 
Others have evolved. 24 Hour Fitness said in a statement that it closed gyms on March 16, and effective April 16, it will suspend all membership billings, if the clubs are not open by then. Anyone billed for closed days from March 17 through April 15 will ""receive additional days of club access"" added on to the end of their membership. 
Gym memberships are notoriously hard to cancel. 
""Some you have to come in person to cancel, and bring a form,"" noted Adam Dell, head of digital product management for Marcus by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and founder of Clarity Money. So for now, you might want to accept the freeze. 
Beware of simply cancelling the automatic payment through your credit card. Because you are under a contract, the gym could send your account to collections, and that could damage your credit score. 
*Summer programs
Like many summer programs, Camp High Rocks in Brevard, North Carolina, moved back its ""pay in full"" date, which parents often set up to autobill to credit cards. 
Payments that had been due in April are now postponed - with some camps extending the due dates to June. There is a big question mark hanging over whether there will be summer camp at all for children across America, as schools remain closed. 
""We tell parents that if we can’t open, we’ll refund the money,"" camp director Don Gentle said. Ideally, families will take up the offer to roll over the deposit to 2021.
So far, only two families out of about 500 have canceled, one because of job loss. 
Some camps may also offer cancellation insurance, much like trip insurance, said Susie Lupert, executive director of the American Camp Association of New York and New Jersey. Your individual camp would know the details. 
As a parent, Lupert said she was doing the same thing as everyone else, waiting to see what happens. 

""We're under the assumption that they're happening, and if they don't, we'll deal with it,"" Lupert said.

1613,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 12:09PM ET</span>",An Outbreak Among Farm Workers Would Be Catastrophic,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There is no evidence that Covid-19 has been transmitted by food or food packaging, according to U.S. federal health agencies.  How the virus fares among food workers may be a different story.
By law, food manufacturers must prevent anyone who is sick or has a communicable disease from handling, processing or preparing food for human consumption. But much of the food supply chain is staffed by low-wage workers, many of them undocumented immigrants with limited ties to health services.  
The Pew Research Center has estimated that about one quarter of U.S. farm workers are undocumented. A U.S. Department of Labor survey estimated that the share of field workers who are undocumented is closer to half. The food processing industry also has high numbers of undocumented workers, as do many of the nation’s smaller grocers and fast-food restaurants.
Immigrant farming communities are often close-knit, with laborers living and working in close proximity. As the California-based Western Growers Association states, “Social distancing is difficult or perhaps impossible in certain settings such as harvesting, transport (of workers) and housing.” One California grower told National Public Radio that if the coronavirus penetrates the agricultural community, “it will spread like wildfire.”
California, the nation’s largest agricultural state, moved early against the virus. It was the first state to order residents to stay home, on March 19. For now, Covid-19 deaths in California are growing at a slower rate than in New York, doubling every three or four days in California instead of every one or two. But farm workers, like those who work processing chickens or stocking grocery shelves, can’t work from home.
Moreover, undocumented workers are at “high risk” of being uninsured, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report. And uninsured workers are less likely to visit a doctor or health clinic when sick, or to have a regular source of medical care.
Fruit and vegetable farmers, in particular, have complained of labor shortages in recent years. The farm workforce is aging, the work is hard and, until the coronavirus outbreak, unemployment was low. President Donald Trump’s immigration policies have further reduced the supply of labor while also making it more precarious for immigrants to get access to public health services. Robots are not coming to the industry’s rescue anytime soon.
There is no shortage of food in the U.S. — and there very likely won’t be. Food is grown in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. But the logistical miracle that is the U.S. food supply chain is already stressed by panic buying at grocers and a huge disruption of markets, including thousands of suddenly closed restaurants. (It’s not easy to reroute to markets food that was previously destined for restaurants.)  The supply chain could be further undermined by outbreaks of coronavirus among agricultural workers.
The Trump administration last week eased rules on foreign agricultural guest workers. It says it has suspended immigration arrests at hospitals, though it’s not clear that the announcement will ease the anxiety of undocumented immigrants. Rural hospitals will get assistance from the rescue package that Congress passed last week.
But such actions will hardly fill the gaps in production and distribution if coronavirus sweeps across the farm sector. “It could have a devastating effect on the ability to produce food,” Dale Moore, executive vice president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, told me.
While farms are taking safety precautions, encouraging social distancing and better hygiene, there’s little contingency planning for labor in the event of significant outbreaks. How would labor — including skilled work — be replaced? “What exactly that looks like,” Moore said, “is an evolving process.”

Investing.com - Soaring oil prices helped Wall Street shake off harrowing layoff numbers Thursday and push the major indexes firmly into the green after a rocky open.
Crude prices jumped 20% after President Donald Trump tweeted he expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to cut production by at least 10 million barrels and possibly up to 15 million barrels per day. Whether that's even obtainable with the full cooperation of OPEC+ is still unclear.
The Dow rose 0.9%, helped by energy components  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon (NYSE:XOM), both up more than 7%.
The S&P 500 rose 1.2% and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.9%.
The SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSE:XOP) rose 5.8%.
The mood was decidedly more bearish at the open as more evidence of the huge economic disruption of Covid-19 arrived.
Another 6.65 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week, over twice as many as the 3.3 million who claimed a week earlier (the number was revised up by 20,000). In all, 6% of the U.S. workforce have hit the jobless rolls in just two weeks.
 Luckin Coffee  (NASDAQ:LK) stock fell 71% after the Chinese coffee house chain said it had suspended its chief operating officer and withdrew its last two quarterly reports while it investigates suspicions of ""misconduct"".
Short-seller Muddy Waters Research had called the stock a fraud in January after evaluating anonymous research that suggested the company’s sales were inflated.
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock rose 2.8% on the prospect of a major competitor in China leaving the market.
Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) stock fell another 5.2% on growing concerns about its data privacy policy, and about its valuation, after an uncontrolled surge in demand on the back of the Covid-19-driven boom in working from home.
The company reported earlier that average daily users had soared to 200 million from a maximum of 10 million before the crisis. It didn’t break out how many of them were using the premium, paid-for service."
1618,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 11:05AM ET</span>",Virus forces Luxottica to break Italian August holiday tradition,"MILAN (Reuters) - Eyewear maker Luxottica said it would cut to just one week its customary August closure, a move which other firms may seek to replicate to relaunch production after the forced shutdown in the current coronavirus crisis.
The decision by the Italian arm of eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica (PA:ESLX) impinges on the sacredness of the traditional August shutdown, when people head for the beaches emptying cities and bringing business activity to a halt.
In a sign that a return to normality for the industry is still a long way away, the organisers of the world's biggest eyewear trade fair MIDO, which had been rescheduled to July, said it had been moved to February 2021.
Ray Ban-owner Luxottica, which in 2018 joined forces with French lens maker Essilor to create a global leader in the eyewear industry, said it would close down only for the mid-August week. 
It would normally give its staff three weeks off in August.
""All employees will in any case be guaranteed two consecutive weeks of vacation and an additional third week to be scheduled according to organisational needs"", the company said.
To stem coronavirus contagion, the Italian government on March 23 enforced a shutdown of all non-essential business activity which has been extended until at least April 13, hitting sectors such as cars, clothing and furniture.
It had previously closed down shops, cafes and restaurants, depriving large swathes of its already fragile economy of regular cash flows.
Luxottica, which is both a manufacturer and a retailer with a vast shop network, has closed down all its Italian activities.
To weather the halt, Luxottica is tapping a government's temporary-layoff scheme. 
The company said it would top up the pay provided by the state under the scheme to guarantee employees their full salary.
It also said its management had agreed to voluntary pay cuts for the duration of the emergency following a decision by CEO Francesco Milleri to halve his compensation.

1619,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>","PIMCO sees short, severe recession; positioned defensively","By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pacific Investment Management Co (PIMCO), one of the world's largest investment firms, told clients on Thursday the coronavirus outbreak is likely to cause a short and severe recession, and that the risk of a slow recovery or a relapse will keep its investment strategy defensive for the time being. 
The global economy is likely to begin to recover in the next 6-12 months, it said in a note. But that could easily be jeopardized by the unprecedented nature of the crisis, the potentially high rate of corporate defaults and the possibility of a resurgence in infections after the recovery has begun, said Joachim Fels, global economic adviser at the Newport Beach, California-based firm, which has $1.91 trillion assets under management.
""There is no precedent and thus no good playbook for the global recession that is currently unfolding,"" said Fels. 
""In this highly uncertain environment – as PIMCO has done during previous periods of extreme dislocation – we will focus on a defensive approach at a time of heightened volatility. We will look to position to take advantage of normalization of market conditions over time but, for now, we believe a caution-first approach is warranted in an effort to protect against permanent capital impairment.""
For now, that means a preference for U.S. government debt, for high-quality assets that may currently be mispriced - including agency mortgage-backed securities and Treasury Inflation-Protection Securities, high-grade corporate debt - and caution around lower-grade credit and emerging markets. 
The scope of the Federal Reserve' and global central banks' response to the effects of the coronavirus and the strength of the U.S. economy going into the crisis will make it possible to avoid an economic depression, PIMCO wrote. 

Still, investors should be prepared for a materially different economic landscape and a significant defaults among highly levered companies. Although those conditions may ultimately create investment opportunities, PIMCO is not yet seeking them out, it said.

1620,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 10:55AM ET</span>","Hungary, eager for loan, wants to classify details of Budapest-Belgrade Chinese rail project","BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary wants to classify all data included in contracts for the $2.1 billion, tax-payer funded Budapest-Belgrade rail project for ten years, according to draft legislation, to ensure a loan deal is signed ""as soon as possible"".
The project, part of Beijing's One Belt, One Road initiative intended to open new foreign trade links for Chinese firms, has been stalled for years.
The bill, dated March 31 and submitted by Deputy Prime Minister Zsolt Semjén to parliament, argues that its aim is to help secure a loan from the Chinese Export-Import Bank to finance the project.
A key piece of data in the loan agreement is what interest rate Hungary will pay. Observers suggest that negotiations about the loan have been dragged out because of disagreements on the exact terms. 
The bill declares the project to have an ""overriding public interest"" and exempts it from several rules that regulate construction. Some 85% of the financing is going to come from China as a loan while 15% is provided by Hungary. Hungary has already applied for the Chinese loan. 
""This bill is essential to ensure that the loan agreement is signed as soon as possible,"" the government argues in the legislation. 
The 150-km (93-mile) Hungarian stretch of the railway will be built by CRE Consortium which includes holding company Opus Global, controlled by Lorinc Meszaros, an associate of Prime Minister Viktor Orban. 
The other half of the winning consortium is owned by China Tiejiuju Engineering & Construction Kft. and China Railway Electrification Engineering Group Kft., representing the Chinese state railways company.
According to a statement by Opus in 2019, the holding company could earn revenues worth about 295 billion forints ($1 billion) from the project over the planned five-year construction period. 
The project has suffered significant delays. China, Serbia and Hungary signed a memorandum of understanding on the 370-km (230 mile) rail route in December 2014 in Belgrade and the project was expected to be finished by 2017.
Construction in Serbia started in late 2017 after Serbia borrowed $297.6 million from China’s Exim Bank.

1631,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 10:35AM ET</span>",Healthcare stocks show their defensive allure in ailing market,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic is throwing a spotlight on stocks in the U.S. healthcare sector, home to the companies that could develop treatments, vaccines and improved diagnostics needed to tackle the greatest public health crisis in a century.
Healthcare (SPXHC) has held up better than most S&P 500 sectors. Since the S&P 500 hit an all-time high on Feb. 19, healthcare is down about 18% as of Wednesday, while the benchmark index (SPX) has tumbled 27%.
The sector is typically considered a defensive area of the market because some investors believe consumers will continue buying healthcare products even during uncertain times. 
Shares of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have led the pack, including those working on potential treatments and other ways to address the rapidly spreading outbreak.
In particular, shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:REGN) and  Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD) have risen 24% and 8%, respectively, since the S&P hit its peak. 
""A lot of these companies are working on a solution to the problem,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer with Greenwood Capital in South Carolina. ""We can debate what it means to them ... monetarily, but perception-wise they are viewed as a safe haven because of that.""
Greenwood Capital in recent weeks bought shares of Regeneron and Roche Holding AG (S:ROG), a Swiss company that has diagnostics and a potential therapy for the new coronavirus.
The purchases added to the firm's overweight position in healthcare, although it has pared its sector holdings during the recent outperformance, Todd said.
Healthcare lagged the market's big gains in 2019. Institutional investors generally held a lower weighting in healthcare relative to benchmark indexes before the pandemic took hold this year, said Rebecca Chesworth, senior equities strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors.
Healthcare ""has been one of the most popular places to put money in the past couple of weeks,” she added.
The sector recently traded at 12.9 times forward 12-month earnings estimates, compared to 14 times for the overall S&P 500, according to Refinitiv Datastream.
Pharmaceutical and biotech stocks, including Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:VRTX), make up eight of the sector's top ten performers since Feb. 19, all of which have gained or fallen far less than the broader market.
“In general, if you are on a drug, you are staying on that drug,"" said Teresa McRoberts, a portfolio manager who focuses on healthcare at Fred Alger Management. ""So that part of their business is pretty safe.”
Some areas of the sector have been hit hard by the vast ripple effects of the virus, particularly medical device companies dependent on elective procedures that are being delayed to preserve hospital capacity and resources for coronavirus patients. Shares of Zimmer Biomet Holdings (N:ZBH) and  Stryker  Corp (N:SYK), which make knee and hip replacements, are down 44% and 36%, respectively, since Feb 19.
Shares of hospital chain HCA Healthcare Inc (N:HCA) have slumped 44% over that period as hospitals lose high-margin elective procedures and cope with severe disruption from the influx of coronavirus patients, said Jeff Jonas, healthcare portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds.
Jonas, however, believes those areas could be quicker to recover than other parts of the economy when the pandemic recedes.

""You're going to be more nervous about getting on a plane, staying in a hotel, going out to dinner in the aftermath of this then you are about going back to see your doctor or to get a procedure done,” he said.

1652,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 10:30AM ET</span>",Ford says post-crisis support for U.S. customers 'would be appropriate',"By Nick Carey and Sanjana Shivdas
(Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co 's (N:F) U.S. sales chief said on Thursday the automaker believes some level of government stimulus will be needed for consumers once the coronavirus pandemic recedes and that the crisis will spur a permanent shift toward more online vehicle sales in America.
""It’s hard to determine how long and what the lingering effects of this will be,"" Mark LaNeve told Reuters after the company reported lower quarterly sales as a result of the pandemic. ""But certainly we believe that some level of government stimulus post crisis to help customers and the auto industry to recover would be appropriate."" 
The No. 2 U.S. automaker posted a 12.5% fall in U.S. auto sales for the first quarter.
Government orders for businesses to shutter and consumers to remain at home in the face of the coronavirus pandemic stalled demand across the auto industry. 
Economists say the stay-at-home measures have pushed the economy into recession. The number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits last week shot to a record high of 6.65 million.
During the Great Recession, the U.S. government rolled out a ""cash-for-clunkers"" program, which offered consumers rebates of up to $4,500 to trade in older gas guzzlers.
Ford is currently ""thinking over ideas"" for government stimulus for consumers that it will discuss with its government affairs team, LaNeve said.
He said around 93% of Ford's 3,100 U.S. dealers are doing some or all aspects of sales online, from virtual tours to financing and home delivery, as the pandemic has shuttered showrooms in a growing number of states.
""Good dealers have been doing remote delivery for the last 20 years, but it was maybe one a week,"" he said. ""Now they’re doing almost every delivery that way."" 
Ford is beefing up its existing online tools to support virtual sales through its dealers, and LaNeve said the coronavirus crisis will push more sales to the internet in the long term.
""This has just turbo charged the adoption of those processes by both customers and the dealers,"" LaNeve said. ""To be honest, I think a big chunk of that stays with us even when we’re through the crisis.""
Ford's passenger car sales fell 36%, while sports utility vehicle sales dropped 11% in the first quarter.
The company did not provide monthly sales figures, but estimated that industrywide U.S. new-vehicle sales fell 39% in March. LaNeve said Ford's sales decline was lower than that.

Despite Italy's lowest death toll from coronavirus in six days on Wednesday, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said a national lockdown in place since March 9, and due to expire on Friday, would be extended until at least April 13.
The lockdown measures include a freeze on all non-essential economic activity, including car production.
Gianluca Ficco, a representative of the UILM metal workers' union, said unions had started talks with Fiat Chrysler (FCA) to make sure all health and security requirements were met in factories, with a view to resuming operations after the lockdown.
""At the moment the date we're looking at is April 14,"" he said.
The sites would be the assembly lines for Jeep's Compass and new hybrid models in Melfi in southern Italy; Atessa's plant making light commercial vehicles in central Italy; and preparatory operations for the new electric 500 in Turin's Mirafiori factory, he said.
A spokesman for FCA confirmed on Thursday that, if the government allowed production to restart after April 13, those three operations would be the group's priority. 

Last week, before the national lockdown was extended, the carmaker had told unions it would have been ready to resume the same three operations on April 6 if the government had given its go-ahead.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower but quickly rebounded on Thursday after another record-breaking rise in initial jobless claims underlined the scale of the damage being wrought on the U.S. economy by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Another 6.65 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week, over twice as many as the 3.3 million who claimed a week earlier (the number was revised up by 20,000). In all, 6% of the U.S. workforce have hit the jobless rolls in just two weeks.
By 10:05 AM ET (1405 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 62 points, or 0.3%, at 21.006 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were up 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively. All three had been indicated to open sharply higher before the report was released.
Oil and gas stocks were the big outperformers, tracking a sharp rebound in crude prices after President Donald Trump predicted a peace deal to end the crude price war within a few days. Trump, who has spoken to both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the last few days, is due to meet with U.S. oil company bosses on Friday.
 By 10:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 8% at $21.94, having earlier risen as much as 11%. 
Occidental Petroleum  (NYSE:OXY) stock rose 6.4%, while Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rose 2.3% and Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock rose 4.3%.
 Luckin Coffee  (NASDAQ:LK) stock fell as much as 81% after the Chinese coffee house chain said it had suspended its chief operating officer and withdrew its last two quarterly reports while it investigates suspicions of ""misconduct"".
Short-seller Muddy Waters Research had called the stock a fraud in January after evaluating anonymous research that suggested the company’s sales were inflated.
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock rose 3.8% on the prospect of a major competitor in China leaving the market.
Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) stock fell another 12.4% on growing concerns about its data privacy policy, and about its valuation, after an uncontrolled surge in demand on the back of the Covid-19-driven boom in working from home.
The company reported earlier that average daily users had soared to 200 million from a maximum of 10 million before the crisis. It didn’t break out how many of them were using the premium, paid-for service.
Carnival (NYSE:CCL) stock opened sharply lower but recovered somewhat after the cruise line operator struggled to find buyers for its equity in its $6 billion recapitalization. The company placed $500 million in new stock at $8 a share, having initially wanted to sell $1.25 billion. The result is that the company emerges from the recap more leveraged than it intended to be. On the upside, it managed to sell the senior debt tranche at a yield of around 11.5%, a full percentage point less than initial reports suggested was likely.

1659,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 09:15AM ET</span>","Lights, camera, audit: accountants grapple with remote company check-ups","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - As audit season begins for British companies, some auditors stuck at home in coronavirus lockdown are turning to cameras to check clients' inventories, plant and equipment for compiling annual accounts.
Tuesday was the end of the financial year for many listed companies in Britain, a time when auditors traditionally hit the road to physically verify and even count stock or inventory that can represent a big chunk of a company's assets.
Lockdown means they are unable to make the journey.
""Normally we have significant teams out counting but we are now looking at different ways of doing this,"" said Hemione Hudson, UK head of audit at PwC, one of the world's ""Big Four"" accounting firms.
""We are looking at some clients to see how we can access their cameras from a live perspective, we have one team planning to do it this week,"" she said, adding that PwC would then consider what additional steps would be needed to back this up. 
One option is to use cameras already installed in a company's warehouse to verify its stock levels. Another idea for checking on a company's car inventory, for example, is to film live each vehicle identification number one by one, Bob Neate, head of UK audit at Mazars, said.
Analysing client data could also be used to work out the level of inventory, backed by retrospective physical checks, Hudson added.
But there are challenges.
Scott Knight, head of audit at BDO, said hotels and restaurant groups would be challenging as this usually involves onsite checks to ensure that staff on the payroll are real people.
""Other difficulties arise from not being able to discuss issues in person, and not being able to physically observe the controls that are used to run a company,"" Knight said.
""There are noises that some accountancy firms are avoiding signing off audit reports until things become clearer,"" said Knight, who did not say if using cameras was an option.
The upshot will be audits flagged as having ""limited scope"" or with modifications, such as a note added to say there were no first hand checks.
Companies are worried that such ""qualifications"" to their annual accounts could make investors nervous and trigger selling in their shares and potentially also put them in breach of loan covenants.
ON CAMERA
Neate said he was in talks with clients about alternatives to site visits, including cameras.
""We have formed a view that it is unlikely that using a camera on its own would give us the evidence we need,"" he said.
Cameras could be used in combination with on-site checks once the lockdown has ended, along with reconciling figures with records, Neate said.
Britain's Financial Reporting Council, which regulates auditors, issued guidance last week that said auditors should agree what can be done remotely, what can be done using technology, and to flag areas where confirmation is contingent on being physically present at a later stage.
""We would like clearer guidelines on what's acceptable. The FRC recognises the challenge but we as auditors have to make a decision on what is acceptable,"" Neate said.
The FRC had no immediate additional comment.
BROKER PRESSURE
Companies usually have four months after the end of their financial year to publish an annual financial statement. Last week British regulators gave them an extra two months to the end of September.
The Financial Conduct Authority has urged markets not to penalise companies that use the extension.
Many companies may opt for a limited scope audit rather than use the extra time because they are under pressure from their corporate brokers to stick to the normal reporting timetable, Neate said.
""I think there will be some limitations to scope, but I am not starting from a point where every audit has a limitation,"" Hudson said.
Another challenge will be to check whether companies remain a ""going concern"" after the stresses and strains of the coronavirus crisis.
Given these circumstances, it will be difficult for auditors to gauge which debts a company can collect, which of its contracts have become too onerous, and to what extent have intangible assets, such as goodwill inherited from a merger or takeover, become impaired.
""We don't know when a company can restart operations, or when they do, whether their market will have changed, or how quickly they can come back,"" Hudson said.

(Reuters) - EU consumers should be able to sue carmakers in their national courts if they have bought cars with emission cheat devices installed, an adviser to the Court of Justice of the European Union said on Thursday.
The opinion, if followed by Europe's top court, raises the possibility of legal complaints from consumers across the European Union.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) told Reuters it does not agree with the legal opinion, adding it ""remains to be seen"" how the court will decide.
The court typically rules within two to four months of an adviser's opinion. Judges follow them in the majority of cases, but are not bound to do so.
The case followed a request from an Austrian court handling a claim by the Austrian consumer association VKI on behalf of 574 owners of manipulated vehicles. The court wanted to know if it had jurisdiction to hear the case.
""The question of jurisdiction has arisen primarily in Austria. Therefore, even if the Court of Justice of the European Union were to follow the advocate general, hardly anything would change for plaintiffs, defendants and courts in other countries,"" VW said in an emailed comment.
Advocate general Campos Sanchez-Bordona said the general rule was that applicants should sue in courts where the defendant is domiciled. However, in cases of tort there was also the possibility of suing in the courts where the alleged harm occurred.
The VKI wants compensation for the difference between the price consumers paid for vehicles, and the value of a manipulated vehicle. It also wants coverage for future damages, such as a drop in the value caused by driving bans.
The advocate general concluded the place where the damage occurred was the place where the car was bought. 
""A company can be sued by the purchasers of vehicles that it manipulated before the courts of the member state where the vehicles were purchased,"" the court said in a statement.
VW fitted 360,000 vehicles in Austria with defeat devices, according to a report by the European Commission.
The company admitted in 2015 to using illegal software to cheat U.S. diesel engine tests, a scandal that has cost it more than $30 billion in vehicle refits, fines and provisions. 
Nearly all U.S. owners of affected cars agreed to take part in a $25 billion settlement in 2016 in the United States.

The carmaker is in talks with Germany's consumer protection organisation to seek a deal in a class action lawsuit there.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany is in talks to provide Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) with billions of euros in state aid and could take a stake in the airline, which has grounded more than 90% of its fleet due to the coronavirus pandemic, people close to the matter said. 
The government and airline are discussing loans as well as a possible equity investment as Lufthansa grapples to cope with Berlin's order to all but halt its operations, the people said.
""We are in close contact with the federal government to secure our liquidity"", a Lufthansa spokesman said, but declined to comment on the details. 
A spokesman for the Economy Ministry declined to comment.
Lufthansa is working with banks including  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in its talks with the German government, the people said. Goldman Sachs (N:GS) had been well-placed to secure a leading role, but it remains unclear whether the U.S. bank has been mandated, they added.
Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Last week, Lufthansa said it had not yet applied for state aid but was in talks with lenders and authorities about what kind of help would be possible if needed.
Competitor American Airlines (O:AAL) intends to apply for up to $12 billion in U.S. government aid, executives said in a memo to employees on Monday.
Lufthansa may need state support of a similar magnitude, an industry banker said. 
The coronavirus crisis has cut Lufthansa's sales from passenger flights to almost zero, but shorter working hours as well as lower fees for airports and air traffic control have brought down costs. 
Lufthansa has applied for short-time work for around 87,000 crew and ground staff at its core brand until the end of August. 
Short-time work is a form of state aid that allows employers to switch staff onto reduced working hours during an economic downturn to keep them on the payroll. It has been widely used by German industry, including its car sector. 
With planes unable to fly because of travel restrictions, compounded by a plunge in demand over fears of contagion, airlines worldwide have grounded most of their fleets, and many have said they need government support to survive. 
Last week, airlines urged governments to speed up bailoutsto rescue the air transport industry, as they doubled theirestimate of 2020 revenue losses from the health crisis to morethan $250 billion. 
Germany stands ready to take over Condor as a deal for the airline to be bought by Polish rival LOT is likely to collapse in the industry turmoil caused by the coronavirus crisis, people close to the matter have told Reuters. 
In the United States, the treasury is preparing to provide up to $25 billion in direct grants to the airline industry. 

Last week, investors led by Singapore state investor Temasek put together a $13 billion funding package for Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL) in the single biggest rescue so far for an airline hit by the coronavirus pandemic.

1663,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 08:55AM ET</span>",Aerospace suppliers face bailout dilemma over job cuts,"By Allison Lampert and Tracy Rucinski
MONTREAL/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Aerospace suppliers are drawing up plans to lay off workers as coronavirus quarantines cripple their cash balances - but bailout conditions and fears of losing critical skilled labor are forcing managements to juggle survival and future growth.
The coronavirus epidemic, which has surpassed 878,000 known cases globally, has battered aviation as airlines ground planes everywhere, sending ripples through a global supply chain.
""With the airlines not flying, they're not ordering new planes; they're not taking delivery of planes that are coming off the line. They're not servicing the planes, so even the aftermarket has dried up,"" Eric Fanning, chief executive of the U.S. Aerospace Industries Association, told Reuters.
Many suppliers - especially those who make structural parts and lack a recurring market for repairs and replacements, unlike makers of limited-life components - are having to face hard choices over furloughing staff as they try to conserve cash.
""Their workforce is their crown jewel. Aerospace and defense have a critical problem finding the right workers for all the jobs that they have,"" Fanning said.
Sekisui Aerospace, a Seattle-based subsidiary of Japan's Sekisui Chemical (T:4204) which makes composite parts for  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus SE (PA:AIR), plans to pay employees through April 8 after closing for a compulsory lockdown. It's not yet clear what Sekisui will do after that.
Fearing skill shortages, companies across the U.S. supply chain are weighing whether to apply for loans under a $2.3 trillion government coronavirus aid package approved last week.
To qualify, mid-sized companies must plan to restore at least 90% of their pre-crisis workforce within four months of the U.S. government declaring the health emergency is over.
But that condition assumes a relatively sharp bounceback that airlines say is far from certain - even allowing for a demand boost from the sheer scale of the stimulus.
REVISING PLANS
Companies that three weeks ago were looking at cutting headcount to adapt to a 30-50% drop in demand ""are now going back and revising their plans again to meet the terms of the loans,"" said Regina Lee of consultancy AlixPartners.
The International Air Transport Association, representing airlines, warned on Tuesday the crisis could last until the fourth quarter and that any rebound would be short-lived if there was a new winter wave of coronavirus.
""Before the crisis we were in hiring mode. Now we have stopped all hiring,"" said Martin Brassard, chief executive of Montreal-based Heroux-Devtek (TO:HRX), which makes landing gear.
It has already laid off 85 workers in the Montreal area because of confinement rules, but hopes to use its backlog of defense orders to avoid further cuts. 
Information Engineering Group, a nearby company that makes software to manage airport executive lounges, has laid off some workers but wants to be positioned for an eventual recovery.
""We want to make sure the talent we have is not lost,"" said managing director Michael Di Corpo. ""We are trying to weigh that balance as we move on.""
Still uncertain is to what extent Boeing will itself apply for government help and how much aid it would funnel to suppliers, who are already reeling from the 737 MAX grounding.
""We have got to help them through it, and that's what will really help on the recovery side of this,"" Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said in a Mar 24 interview.
Planemakers can offers cash advances, loans or continued orders. But experts say such help does not always trickle down to so-called Tier-3 firms deep in the supply chain.

""If your engine has 1,000 parts and you have 999 of those parts you don't have an engine that flies,"" said AIA's Fanning.

Brent crude futures rose 11.0%, or $2.72, to $27.46. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures increased 10.14% or $2.08, at $22.39.
Trump said he had talked recently with the leaders of both Russia and Saudi Arabia and believed the two countries would make a deal within a ""few days"" to lower production and thereby bring prices back up.
Shares in British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) added 3.0% after a person familiar with the matter said British Airways was in talks with its union about a plan to suspend around 32,000 staff so it can survive the coronavirus pandemic.
Euro zone government bond yields rose as investors cautiously moved back into riskier assets. The 10-year German government bond yield rose 4 basis points to -0.426%, pulling away from the lows of -0.55% touched on Monday. 
The yield on safe-haven 10-year U.S. Treasuries - which falls when prices rise - fell as far as 0.5680%.
""There had been fears about the bond market blowing up, but for the time being there's a return to normal correlation in the market, so we don't see a vicious cycle where bonds bring down equities and equities brings down bonds,"" said Savary.
U.S. labour market data is likely to provide the next test of market sentiment and of the pain in the world's largest economy.
Initial claims for jobless benefits last week probably broke the previous week's record of 3.3 million, with 3.5 million expected, according to a Reuters survey of economists.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said on Thursday it expected the U.S. jobless claims to jump to a record 6 million for March 22-28.
""Jobless claims will be the timeliest hard data point for assessing the depth of the recession and catching the start of the recovery,"" Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a note to clients.

China and South Korea have shown signs of controlling the virus, reporting falling numbers of new cases, but progress remains fragile and infections are soaring globally.
The World Health Organization said the global case count would reach 1 million and the death toll 50,000 in the next few days. It currently stands at 46,906.
Trump, who had initially played down the outbreak, told reporters at the White House on Wednesday that he is considering a plan to halt flights to coronavirus hot zones in the United States.
In currency markets, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood flat at 99.625 after a gain of 0.53% overnight. The euro traded down 0.3% at $1.0934 as the dollar advanced.
Sterling reached a three-week high versus the euro and gained against the dollar on Thursday. It was last up 0.9% versus the euro at 87.81 pence per euro, its highest since March 11.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European cities cracking down on short-term rentals of private homes like those on Airbnb got a boost on Thursday after an adviser to Europe's top court said they have the right to vet such rentals to tackle the shortage of long-term housing.
The homesharing site's rapid growth over the last decade has posed a challenge for authorities in cities from Amsterdam to New York and Paris which have accused Airbnb of worsening housing shortages and pushing out lower-income residents.
The case before the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) concerned two Parisian apartment owners who were fined by the city's authorities for letting out their homes on Airbnb without permission.
The owners took their case to a French court which asked the CJEU for guidance. The court's advocate general Michal Bobek said the public interest trumps EU rules known as the services directive on the freedom to provide services in the bloc.
""A shortage of long-term housing constitutes an overriding reason of public interest capable of justifying a national measure, which requires authorisation to be obtained for the repeated letting of residential accommodation for short periods to a transit clientele,"" Bobek said.
Airbnb said it took note of the non-binding opinion.
""Airbnb is not party to this case, which only applies to the renting of second homes in Paris. The vast majority of hosts in Paris share their primary homes and the CJEU has already set out how Airbnb should be regulated in Europe,"" the U.S. company said in a statement.
The court will rule in the coming months. Judges usually follow four out of five such recommendations.
At close to 60,000 listings, Paris has the largest number of Airbnb listings than any other city in the world. The city allows its homeowners to rent out their apartments on short-term rental websites for up to 120 days a year.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open solidly higher Thursday, rebounding after sharp losses Wednesday, helped by a recovery in energy prices on rising hopes of a truce in the Saudi-Russia oil price war.
At 7:00 AM ET (1100 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 42 points, or 1.7%, higher, futures for the Nasdaq up 94 points, or 1.3%. The Dow futures contract rose 387 points, or 1.9%. The three main indices all fell 4.4% Wednesday.
Helping Thursday’s tone has been the hefty rise in the price of crude oil after U.S. President Donald Trump raised hopes of a deal between Saudi Arabia and Russia to end their price war which has contributed to the price of oil slumping around 66% this year, making many U.S. oil producers uncompetitive.
At 7:00 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 10.2% higher at $22.38 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract climbed 10.5% to $27.32.
Trump said he had talked recently with the leaders of both Russia and Saudi Arabia and believed the two countries would make a deal within a ""few days"" - lowering production and bringing prices back up.
He also said he would be meeting with oil executives, where he is expected to discuss a range of options to help the industry.

That said, most eyes Thursday will be on the release of the latest unemployment data in the U.S. later in the session.
The weekly U.S. initial jobless claims, one of the earliest gauges of economic trends, jumped to 3.28 million last Thursday, blowing past the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982. This offered up the starkest evidence of the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Economists now expect claims for first-time unemployment benefits to have jumped by 3.5 million last week, when the figures are released at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). 
The forecasts in a Reuters poll range from 1.5 million to 5.25 million, but Goldman Sachs said the number could be as high as 6 million.

""The spread of COVID-19 has caused an exceptional situation and the H&M group is forced to make several difficult decisions,"" a company spokeswoman said in a statement to Reuters.
""Dialogue with employees on temporarily shortened working hours affecting tens of thousands of employees globally has been initiated in several markets. It also concerns officials at central functions.""
H&M said in March it was taking several measures in respect of buying, investments, rents and staffing to cut costs, warning it may affect tens of thousands of employees.
At that time, it also said it had decided to scrap its proposed dividend in a historic move, at a time when around 70% of its stores were temporarily closed due to the virus outbreak. 
H&M is due to publish its full earnings report for December through February, its fiscal first quarter, on Friday. It has already reported that sales in the quarter grew 8%.

1672,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>",German carmakers had crisis call with Merkel: Handelsblatt,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - The bosses of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) held a crisis call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday to discuss how to get production restarted, Germany's Handelsblatt newspaper reported on Thursday.
Carmakers have halted production at some sites as governments around the world have imposed lockdowns on their populations in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess last week said the carmaker might have to cut jobs if the pandemic is not brought under control as it is still spending about 2 billion euros ($2.18 billion) a week.
Handelsblatt cited participants in the call as saying carmakers were particularly concerned about the supply chain.
A Volkswagen source told Reuters the carmakers discussed the situation in the industry and how production could be started up again after the coronavirus crisis. There was agreement that an EU-wide approach to re-starting production was needed, the source said.
""It doesn't help if one country forges ahead and then everything in Italy or Spain is still at a standstill,"" the source said, adding that such a scenario would result in gaps in the supply chain.
The Volkswagen source said in the talks there had been agreement that a working group, including the government, industry and the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases, should be set up to develop standards for protecting employees when production is restarted, such as protective clothing, masks, distancing workers and frequent cleaning of sanitary facilities.
The source said the carmakers also discussed the situation facing car suppliers and that while big original equipment manufacturers were well provided for in terms of liquidity, that was not the case for many suppliers.
A source at Daimler said Merkel, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz and Joerg Hofmann, head of the IG Metall trade union, had all taken part in the meeting with Daimler CEO Ola Kaellenius, BMW boss Oliver Zipse and Volkswagen CEO Diess.
A survey published on Wednesday showed Germany's export-dependent manufacturing sector saw the steepest decrease in output in almost 11 years in March, as the coronavirus pandemic forced plant closures in Europe's biggest economy.

1673,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>","British Airways in union talks to suspend around 32,000 staff: source","By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways (L:ICAG) is in talks with its union about a plan to suspend around 32,000 staff, a person familiar with the situation said, marking one of the industry's most dramatic moves yet to survive the coronavirus pandemic. 
Having already agreed a 50% pay cut for its pilots, the British flag carrier is now nearing agreement on a deal to suspend around 80% of its cabin and ground crew, engineers and office staff to see it through the worst crisis in its history. 
Owned by IAG, one of the largest and most financially robust airline companies in the world, British Airways has already said it is in a fight for survival.
""The deal is not done yet,"" the source said. 
It has joined the global industry push to ground flights and slash costs. In recent weeks Qantas Airways (AX:QAN) put two-thirds of its workforce - 20,000 workers - on leave while Lufthansa applied for short-time work for around 31,000 crew and ground staff at its core brand until the end of August.
British budget airline easyJet (L:EZJ) has said it will lay off its 4,000 UK-based cabin crew for two months.
U.S. airlines are set to receive $25 billion in grants to cover payrolls over the next six months, but are still encouraging workweek reductions, unpaid leaves and early retirements as they face more cancellations than bookings. 
The companies are trying to avoid making staff redundant so they can respond quickly to any increase in capacity when a recovery comes.
British Airways has been in talks with the Unite union for a week. ""Unite has been working around the clock to protect thousands of jobs and to ensure the UK comes out of this unprecedented crisis with a viable aviation sector,"" a spokesman for the union said.
IAG, which owns 598 aircraft across its network which includes Aer Lingus, Iberia and Vueling, is cutting capacity by 75% in April and May. BA has already suspended flights from Britain's second busiest airport, Gatwick, and London's City Airport.
With planes unable to fly because of travel restrictions, compounded by a plunge in demand over fears of contagion, airlines worldwide have grounded most of their fleets, and many have said they need government support to survive.
In Europe more than 20,000 flights departed or landed on January 23. Two months later, after Italy emerged as an epicenter for the virus and travel restrictions went into force, flights dropped to fewer than 5,000 per day.

Britain has launched a job retention scheme which covers 80% of someone's salary capped at a maximum of 2,500 pounds a month. But some airlines including rival Virgin Atlantic have said they will collapse if they do not get more help.

1674,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 05:30AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Big Oil Roars Back on Talk of Crude Peace Deal,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s oil and gas majors surged on Thursday amid growing talk of a ‘peace deal’ to end the price war in global markets.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa),  BP  (LON:BP),  Total  , Eni, Repsol (MC:REP) and Equinor (OL:EQNR) all rose to their highest levels in nearly a month after President Donald Trump said he thought Saudi Arabia and Russia could strike some kind of deal within a “few days”. His comments came after telephone calls in recent days to both President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Royal Dutch Shell (AS:RDSa) shares rose 8.2%, while BP  (LON:BP) shares rose 7.4%,  ENI  (MI:ENI) stock rose 5.7% and Total (PA:TOTF) stock rose 3.6%. They were all helped by a Goldman Sachs research note arguing that the group should still be able to pay their prized dividends this year, in contrast to most of the rest of the stock market. Goldman analysts argued that the group’s breakeven price for covering capex and dividends has fallen to around $44 a barrel, from as high as $60 after the last negative price shock.
Their heavy weightings in local indices helped the FTSE to a gain of 0.5%, and the CAC 40 and FTSE MIB to gains of 0.4% each. The benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 0.3%
Trump has styled the price war a dispute between Russia and Saudi, but that is misleading as the real target of both countries has been the U.S., which has increased production by some 5 million barrels a day in recent years, grabbing global market share from both.
On Wednesday, the two big exporters saw the clearest evidence yet that their strategy is working, as Whiting Petroleum, the biggest shale producer in North Dakota with output of over 120,000 barrels a day, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. BP also said it would cut its capex at its U.S. shale subsidiary by half this year, leading to a drop of around 14% in that unit’s output.
Trump is set to meet with U.S. oil bosses on Friday. As  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) CEO Scott Sheffield said repeatedly last week, the U.S. industry is split three ways between distressed shale producers who are so indebted that they have to keep pumping no matter what, majors like Exxon (NYSE:XOM) who are happy to see weaker rivals go to the wall so that they can pick up the pieces afterwards, and a group in the middle – including Pioneer – who risk falling into the first category if crude prices don’t stabilize soon.
Trump may find it easy to dress up a cut in U.S. output as a peace offering to Russia and Saudi, given that the U.S. is fast running out of places to store all the oil that can’t be sold at present. Crude oil stocks rose 13.8 million barrels last week, while U.S. gasoline stocks rose by 7.5 million barrels. Texas Railroad Commissioner Ryan Sitton tweeted that producers are already being asked by pipeline companies to shut in production, given the lack of offtake.
On the surface, Saudi and Russia are still toughing things out, but the strain on both is showing. Saudi Arabia confirmed its output would rise above 12 million barrels a day this month, but storage at its key Fujairah facility is also nearly maxed out, according to Argus Media, which may complicate that plan.
Russian news site RBC, meanwhile, reported on Thursday that the price Russian export prices no longer cover the combined cost of production, transportation and taxes, meaning that they are losing money on every barrel exported now."

The British budget airline said it had received the request and was considering its response. ""Shareholders are advised to take no action at this time,"" it said. 
EasyJet has been under pressure from its founder who asked in a letter on Sunday for it to cancel or renegotiate a 4.5 billion pound ($5.6 billion) order for 107 Airbus planes because the extra aircraft would destroy shareholder value.
Haji-Ioannou, who along with his family owns about a third of easyJet's shares, has been a long-time critic of the airline's plans, saying it was putting expansion before profit growth.

1676,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 04:36AM ET</span>","‘Highly Bullish’ Survey May Mean Stock Bottom Not In, RBC Says","(Bloomberg) -- Institutional U.S. equity investors are very bullish on stocks -- which could mean investors haven’t yet capitulated and the bottom hasn’t been reached in the coronavirus sell-off, according to RBC Capital Markets.
Respondents to RBC’s survey of American stock investors were the most bullish since it began in early 2018, encouraged by what they see as attractive valuations, faith the Federal Reserve will continue to support equities and a belief that the economic damage from the coronavirus crisis will be manageable, strategists including Lori Calvasina said in a note Thursday.
“This surprisingly high level of bullishness supports our own view that we haven’t yet seen investor capitulation, echoing what we’ve seen in other data sets,” the strategists wrote. “We view capitulation as a necessary, though not sufficient condition for stock market bottoms in major drawdowns.”
The figures stand in contrast to the December 2018 survey “when bears spiked and bulls eased back,” they added.
Nearly two-thirds of the 185 institutional investors responding thought the S&P 500 Index would bottom at 2,100 or higher, according to the survey, which was conducted between March 25 and 31. The U.S. benchmark reached an intraday low on March 23 around the 2,192 level and closed just below 2,471 Wednesday.
Still, 57% of respondents expected a trough in the second quarter, compared with 19% who think the lows have already occurred, according to the report. Those bulls have company, with Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson saying the benchmark was unlikely to retest the March lows, and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.’s John Normand writing that the market rout is probably past its worst point.
GDP Key
On the economic front, most respondents think U.S. gross domestic product won’t fall by more than 20% in the worst quarter and that a recession will end in the fourth quarter. This is an important piece of data for market watchers, the RBC team argued.
“If evidence that the most negative GDP quarter will be worse than 20% and that the contraction will last beyond 3Q emerges, it is likely to destabilize the market,” the strategists wrote. “If evidence emerges that the impact will be less severe, it can help the stock market stabilize and move higher.”

1677,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 04:20AM ET</span>",Elon Musk's SpaceX bans Zoom over privacy concerns -memo,"By Munsif Vengattil and Joey Roulette
(Reuters) - Elon Musk's rocket company SpaceX has banned its employees from using video conferencing app Zoom, citing ""significant privacy and security concerns,"" according to a memo seen by Reuters, days after U.S. law enforcement warned users about the security of the popular app.
Use of Zoom and other digital communications has soared as many Americans have been ordered to stay home to slow the spread of coronavirus. 
SpaceX's ban on Zoom Video Communications Inc illustrates the mounting challenges facing aerospace manufacturers as they develop technology deemed vital to national security while also trying to keep employees safe from the fast-spreading respiratory illness.
In an email dated March 28, SpaceX told employees that all access to Zoom had been disabled with immediate effect. 
""We understand that many of us were using this tool for conferences and meeting support,"" SpaceX said in the message. ""Please use email, text or phone as alternate means of communication.""
Two people familiar with the matter confirmed the contents of the mail. 
A representative for SpaceX, which has more than 6,000 employees, did not respond to a request for comment. Chief Executive Musk also heads electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
NASA, one of SpaceX's biggest customers, also prohibits its employees from using Zoom, said Stephanie Schierholz, a spokeswoman for the U.S. space agency.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Boston office on Monday issued a warning about Zoom, telling users not to make meetings on the site public or share links widely after it received two reports of unidentified individuals invading school sessions, a phenomenon known as ""zoombombing.""
Investigative news site The Intercept on Tuesday reported that Zoom video is not end-to-end encrypted between meeting participants, and that the company could view sessions.
""We want to start by apologizing for the confusion we have caused by incorrectly suggesting that Zoom meetings were capable of using end-to-end encryption,"" the company said in a blog post. ""Zoom has always strived to use encryption to protect content in as many scenarios as possible, and in that spirit, we used the term end-to-end encryption."" (https:// The company added that it encrypts all content from Zoom meetings where everyone is using the Zoom app and the sessions are not being recorded. It said it was unable to currently encrypt content when users log in using other devices. Zoom did not immediately respond to requests for comment on SpaceX's decision. 
As a defence contractor, California-based SpaceX has been classified as an essential business, allowing it to stay open through shutdowns in California and Texas, the development and testing hub for its Starship rocket that could be used to get to the moon and Mars and send national security satellites to space.

Thursday was a down day for credit in Asia. Yield premiums on Asian dollar bonds and the cost of insuring debt against default in the region both increased, as more dour news on the coronavirus pandemic limited risk-taking. Read more about that here.
Still, for investment-grade credit, the peak of the rout was probably in March, as unprecedented steps by the Federal Reserve to pump liquidity into the financial system have been helping since then, Lotfi Karoui, strategist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a report. Spreads on such debt though will likely remain in recession territory for another two quarters, and the outlook for the high-yield market looks grim, he said.
“The potency of the policy support greatly limits the scope for spreads to revisit the March wides,” Karoui wrote. “By contrast, the numerous fundamental headwinds facing the HY market will likely push spreads wider from current levels.”
Emerging-market debt is also being targeted by sellers, traders say. Those economies are suffering disproportionately from the collapse of commodity prices, supply chains, trade and spending, and monetary and fiscal stimulus measures could worsen the massive exodus by foreign investors.

By Wednesday's close, the index was 23.5% lower from its January high of 175.13.
Many corporations are warning about a hit to their earnings this year as the virus outbreak has disrupted supply chains and business activities around the world.
Price valuations of Indonesia, Philippines, India and Vietnam shares have fallen sharply this year, the data showed.
At the end of March, South Korea, China and Vietnam shares were the cheapest in the region, with P/E multiples of 8.89, 8.94 and 9.06, respectively.
On the other hand, New Zealand shares were the most expensive, with a P/E ratio of 23.72.
Victor Carlström, chairman of investment firm Vinacossa Enterprises, said he would wait for some more weeks before buying Asian shares despite valuations being very attractive.
""If I had already sold, I would definitely not buy back before we have the facts,"" Carlström said.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to edge higher Thursday, after Wednesday’s sharp losses to start the month, but the tone remained cautious as investors awaited key U.S. unemployment data.
At 2:15 AM ET (0615 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 1.7% higher. France's CAC 40 futures were up 0.4%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.5%. 
The three cash indices all posted losses of around 4% Wednesday as the damage done by the virus outbreak continued to weigh on investor sentiment.
The Covid-19 pandemic has shown few signs of abating Thursday, with global cases on track to hit one million within a day or two, stretching across more than 200 countries.
It’s Europe where the most deaths have been recorded, with Italy leading the way with over 13,000 and Spain just behind with over 9,000 fatalities.
That said, the attention is now shifting to the U.S., after President Donald Trump's recent grim press briefing, in which he warned Americans of a ""painful"" two weeks ahead. 
The starkest evidence of the economic damage caused came last week when weekly U.S. initial jobless claims, one of the earliest gauges of economic trends, jumped to 3.28 million, blowing past the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982.
This week, the numbers could well be worse.
Economists expect claims for first-time unemployment benefits to have jumped by 3.5 million last week, when the figures are released at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). 
The forecasts in a Reuters poll range from 1.5 million to 5.25 million.
In corporate news, Delivery Hero (DE:DHER), one of the world's top online food delivery marketplaces, announced measures Thursday to support restaurants that are trying to survive coronavirus lockdowns by ramping up deliveries to consumers stuck at home.
French food services and catering company Sodexo (PA:EXHO) could be in the spotlight after senior managers agreed to pay cuts, which it said would help fund a 30-million-euro ($33-million) program to aid staff facing lay-offs as a result of the crisis.
 Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) has decided to cancel the 2019 dividend following a recommendation from the European Central Bank. This follows similar steps taken by many of its European peers.
Oil markets bounced strongly Thursday after President Trump stated late Wednesday that Russia and Saudi Arabia would make a deal to end their price war within a ""few days"".
Global oil prices have fallen by roughly two-thirds this year as the coronavirus has slammed global economies at the same time major producers Saudi Arabia and Russia have started to flood the market with oil.
At 2:15 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 7.9% higher at $21.91 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 10% to $27.33.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,597.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0947, down 0.1% on the day.

1689,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 01:45AM ET</span>",Boeing to offer voluntary layoffs to employees to tide over coronavirus fallout -sources,"By Eric M. Johnson and Shubham Kalia
SEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is set to offer buyout and early retirement packages to employees, two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, a bid to mitigate the financial fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. 
Boeing was initiating a voluntary layoff plan that allows eligible employees who want to exit the company to do so with a pay and benefits package, one of the people said. 
Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun is expected to detail a voluntary layoff plan in a memo to employees as early as Thursday, the second person said. 
Reuters reported last month, citing industry sources, that layoffs or furloughs were a ""real possibility"" as deferred aircraft deliveries and downpayments due to a virus-related plunge in air travel forced Boeing to consider tougher steps to reduce cash outflow. 
A representative for Boeing declined to comment. 
Boeing, which calls itself America's largest exporter, has some 150,000 employees worldwide, nearly half of whom are clustered around marquee factories in Seattle's Puget Sound region.
The buyout plan comes three weeks after the U.S. planemaker said it would freeze hiring and overtime pay except in certain critical areas to preserve cash. 
The coronavirus pandemic has compounded the year-old crisis over the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX following fatal crashes that killed 346 people in a five-month span.
Boeing halted 737 production in January. 
Last week Boeing halted operations at its twin-aisle factory and other facilities around Seattle after more than a dozen employees were infected - at least one fatally - by the virus that causes COVID-19. 
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Wednesday that an announcement on early retirement and buyout packages could come as early as Thursday. 

Boeing has called for a $60 billion bailout in access to public and private liquidity, including loan guarantees, for the struggling U.S. aerospace manufacturing industry.

1690,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 01:40AM ET</span>",Best of the worst: Some U.S. bond funds escape full trauma of energy meltdown,"By Tim McLaughlin
BOSTON (Reuters) - A handful of U.S. bond funds with heavy exposure to energy debt managed to beat their benchmark in March by avoiding the most calamitous corners of an industry waylaid by a crash in prices that dragged crude to 18-year lows.
It was a hollow victory for investors, who suffered heavy losses no matter what fund they held. The coronavirus pandemic whipsawed global markets already hit hard by the eruption of an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.
""There were few places to hide,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. 
By that measure, the $802 million DWS High Income Fund  hemorrhaged the least in March among 10 rivals with the highest exposure to the energy sector and at least $500 million in assets, according to a Reuters analysis of Morningstar Direct data. 
The DWS fund's total return of -10.1% beat the 11.73% decline in the ICE/BofA U.S. High Yield Index.
Heading into March, the DWS fund's largest energy holding, DCP Midstream Operating LP's 2025 bonds, were trading at 104.50 cents on the dollar, only to plunge to 56.50 cents by March 23. Fund managers were not available for comment.
The bonds recovered to 67.50 cents on the dollar by the end of March, after Denver-based DCP Midstream announced it would cut 2020 capital spending by 75% to about $150 million.
The $1.3 billion American Beacon SiM High Yield Opportunities Fund (O:SHOYX) produced a -16.7% total return, worst among the 10 funds with the highest exposure to energy debt. The range of exposure among the funds was 12% to 14% of assets.
One of the fund's largest energy holdings at the end of February was debt issued by  California Resources Corp  (N:CRC). The company, which was spun off from Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) in 2014, has struggled with the debt load it inherited from its former parent. 
California Resources' 2022 bonds held by the American Beacon fund had dropped to 23 cents on the dollar by the end of February. The fund valued the oil producer's bonds at $4.4 million, from a par value of nearly $20 million.
Market speculation that the company might file for bankruptcy has made those bonds nearly worthless, trading at a penny on the dollar. That came despite the company's statement last month that it had significant operating flexibility and was ""considering all options"" to work through the downturn.

On Thursday, Sodexo said Chairwoman Sophie Bellon would waive 50% of her remuneration over the coming six months, as would Chief Executive Denis Machuel, along with his variable remuneration for fiscal year 2020.
Sodexo added it had reinforced health and safety measures for its staff, against the backdrop of the pandemic.

Last month, Sodexo, which, alongside British company Compass (L:CPG), ranks among the world's largest catering groups, suspended its annual forecast and said the pandemic could hit annual sales by 2 billion euros. [nL8N2BB0V5]

But that would still leave the public finances much more exposed to short-term interest rates, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. If the economy rebounds and rates rise, then so will the amount the government spends paying debt interest.

Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is among manufacturers worldwide who are responding to a fall in demand, as well as supply chain challenges following measures taken to rein in the pandemic.
In a statement the company said the halt was extended from April 12 to comply with government orders for a suspension of all non-essential activities. 

Volkswagen said it would continue to pay employees during the suspension. Mexico reported 37 deaths, up from 29 a day earlier, and 1,378 infections, up from 1,215, because of the virus.

(Reuters) - Carnival Corp (N:CCL), the world's largest cruise operator, said it has raised $6.25 billion by issuing new debt and equity on Wednesday, borrowing at a high cost to weather the economic storm of the coronavirus pandemic.
Despite having its cruise ships idled to comply with coronavirus travel restrictions, the company was able to attract enough investors that its capital raising was oversubscribed several times over, albeit at a steep price, sources told Reuters.
Carnival priced $4 billion in bonds maturing in 2023 - upsized from the $3 billion originally planned - with a yield at par value of 11.5%, it said in a statement. 
By comparison, Carnival paid a 1% yield in October, when it borrowed 600 million euros ($657.7 million) in the European debt market. Moreover, Carnival had to use its ships as collateral to attract bond investors on Wednesday. 
The company also raised $1.75 billion in convertible notes with a 5.75% coupon, it added.
Beyond the bond issues, Carnival also issued new stock to raise $500 million, less than the $1.25 billion it was targeting. The issue was priced at $8 per share, the company said. 
Carnival shares had tumbled 33.2% on Wednesday on the capital raising news, ending at $8.80.
The funds are expected to be enough to cover Carnival's existing financial obligations for the next 12 months, the company said on Tuesday. 
While Carnival is deemed investment grade by rating agencies, demand for the deal came largely from investors in junk-rated debt given the imperiled state of the cruise industry, the sources said. 
U.S. companies raised a record $109.1 billion through investment-grade bond sales last week, days after Yum Brands Inc (N:YUM) reopened the U.S. market for junk-rated issues after its longest lull since the 2008 financial crisis.

Shares in Carnival have fallen more than 80% this year.

Last month, 992,392 light vehicles were sold, down from about 1.4 million in February, according to Wards Intelligence.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for U.S. cars and light trucks sales was estimated at 11.4 million units, down from 16.8 million units in February, Wards Intelligence said.
Moody's Investors Service said on Friday that U.S. light vehicle sales would fall at least 15% in 2020 as the ratings agency sharply cut its 2020 outlook for global auto sales, with Western Europe expected to take the biggest hit.
The development comes as the United States is looking at an increasing number of deaths from the coronavirus outbreak, with Reuters' tally showing more than 4,500 deaths and over 200,000 infections.

President Donald Trump and his top healthcare advisers urged Americans to follow strict social distancing measures ahead of a ""tough two weeks"" that could see at least 100,000 deaths from the coronavirus.

Each firm is likely to advise on aid to one of three subsectors: commercial airlines, cargo carriers and firms critical to national security, such as  Boeing Co  (N:BA), the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.
The appointments could be disclosed this week, WSJ said, adding the plans are yet to be finalized.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged the Treasury earlier in the day to not hold up $25 billion in cash grants approved by Congress last week to airlines for payroll costs.
Congress approved legislation last week authorizing the $25 billion for passenger airlines, as well as $4 billion for cargo carriers and $3 billion in cash for airport contractors like caterers and airplane cleaners.

Moelis declined to comment. Treasury, PJT Partners and Perella Weinberg Partners did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.

The fee Korean Air Lines Co. paid underwriters to issue won notes jumped to a record 1.157%, four times what it was charged in a similar deal in September. And an unusually numerous 15 sales managers took part in the offering of won-denominated debt backed by sales of future passenger tickets this week, as brokerages spread the risk of doing the deal around.
Companies worldwide are rushing to sell bonds to build cash buffers, even as borrowing costs have shot up by a record this year due to the virus outbreak. But debt issuance has been sparse so far among airlines, one of the sectors hit hardest by the pandemic. Underscoring the sector’s grim outlook, an aviation consultant warned that the coronavirus crisis will bankrupt most airlines in the world by the end of May unless governments and the industry take coordinated steps to avoid such a situation.
Investors get extra protection to buy debt-laden Korean Air’s asset-backed securities, in the form of a trigger that may force the firm to repay early if ticket sales fall below certain levels. As the pandemic drained travel demand, sales of tickets from March 1 to March 12 dropped to 27% of normal levels during the period, according to the prospectus for the notes.
“The biggest concerns among investors are that it’s hard to tell how long the virus impact will last, how much more money airline companies will need and how severe their conditions are,” said Kim Eun-gie, credit analyst at Samsung (KS:005930) Securities Co. in Seoul. “We haven’t reached the worst yet.”
Korean Air believes the funds raised through the asset-backed securities reflect market confidence in the carrier, a spokesperson said. The airline plans to generate more revenue though the sale of idle assets, as well as through increased cargo operations, the person said.
Troubled Sector
The domestic rivals of Korean Air are also struggling. One example of that is increased uncertainties over whether a planned purchase of Asiana Airlines Inc., the nation’s second-largest carrier, will go ahead, after the recent drop in its share price.
Budget carriers are hurting as well, and the government is providing a 300 billion won emergency loan program for them.
The big number of underwriters on Korean Air’s latest deal was “very unusual,” but it was a positive sign that state-run Korea Development Bank was among the managers, said Han Kwang-youl, credit analyst in Seoul at NH Investment & Securities Co. That may suggest that the government is willing to save the airline at least, Han said.
