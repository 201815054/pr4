Cboe also said it was halting trading of the much smaller VanEch Russia Small-Cap ETF.
""Cboe BZX Exchange has declared a Regulatory Halt in RSX and RSXJ that is effective for all U.S. equities markets. As a result of this trading halt in RSX and pursuant to its rules, trading in the options in RSX on Cboe's options exchanges has been halted,"" a Cboe spokesperson said in an email. 
Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the West's financial sanctions, and Moscow's controls on money entering and leaving Russia, the VanEck Russia ETF has tumbled over 60% in the past week, including a 2.4% drop on Friday. 
On Wednesday, VanEck said it was temporarily suspending the creation of new shares of its main Russia ETF.

Investors exchanged about $88 million worth of the fund's shares on Friday, down from an average of $309 million per session over the past 30 days, according to Refinitiv data.

1,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2022 06:01PM ET</span>","Apple shareholders approve CEO Cook's annual compensation, civil rights proposal","By Danielle Kaye and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) -Apple Inc shareholders approved Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook's annual compensation in a virtual meeting on Friday, and voted in favor of a proposal urging Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to oversee a third-party civil rights audit of the company's policies and practices.
By approving Cook's pay package with 64.4% of votes cast in favor, investors rejected some concerns, including from proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), over the magnitude and structure of his equity award. ISS had urged shareholders to vote against the pay package.
Cook, who took the helm in 2011, last year received a compensation package with a total value of $98.7 million, a sum 1,447 times that of the average employee, thanks to a stock grant as part of a long-term equity plan.
He earned $14.8 million a year earlier.
Cook received 333,987 restricted stock units in 2021 in his first stock grant since 2011 as part of the long-term equity plan. He will be eligible to receive additional units in 2023.
Apple said in its latest proxy filing that Cook's stock award was aligned with the interest of the company's shareholders.
Cook took the helm in August 2011 after company co-founder Steve Jobs stepped down months before his demise. The stock has risen over 1,100% since he took the top job.
SOC Investment Group Executive Director Dieter Waizenegger, a proponent of the civil rights proposal that passed with 53.6% of votes cast in support, said this outcome should push Apple to combat inequality and address harm to marginalized groups.
""I think the patience of investors has run out,"" Waizenegger said. ""It's time for Apple to take a serious step, including a third-party independent review of its measures.""
A shareholder proposal urging Apple to report on its use of concealment clauses also passed by a narrow margin, with 50% of votes cast in favor of it.
Shareholders voted against proposals calling on Apple to increase transparency in the company's efforts to protect workers in its supply chain from forced labor and another on gender and racial pay gaps.
Apple had opposed these transparency proposals, while ISS had urged shareholders to support them.
Nearly 34% of votes cast supported a resolution demanding greater transparency in the iPhone maker's efforts to protect workers in its supply chain from forced labor. 
Traditionally, shareholder proposals that receive more than about 25% support of votes cast tend to spur management to make changes, corporate governance experts say. Directors who fail to resolve shareholder concerns can face negative votes themselves the following year.
A group of shareholders had asked Apple's board to prepare a report on how the company protects supply-chain workers from forced labor. Apple and independent third parties audited the company's global suppliers in 2020 and found no evidence of forced labor, its latest proxy filing said.
Also voted down was a proposal requesting that Apple report on its gender and racial pay gaps, with 66.4% of votes cast against it. ""We will continue to press Apple to do better and think different about how they can create a more diverse, equitable organization,"" said Natasha Lamb, a managing partner at investment firm Arjuna Capital, a proponent of the proposal.
More than 31% of votes cast supported a shareholder proposal that asks Apple to disclose the number and categories of apps removed from the App Store at the request of governments.

Shareholders also approved Apple's board of directors and the retention of Ernst & Young as its accounting firm.
Apple outlined on Tuesday its actions in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including pausing all product sales in Russia. The company also said it has stopped all exports into its sales channels in the country and limited Apple Pay and other services in Russia.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Swedish telecoms company Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), its chief executive and chief financial officer have been named as defendants in a U.S. class action lawsuit for misleading investors about the company's dealings in Iraq, a filing to a New York court said on Friday.
Ericsson is at the centre of a scandal over potential payments to the Islamic State in Iraq. On Wednesday the U.S. Department of Justice said it was in breach of a 2019 deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) for failing to fully disclose details of its operations in Iraq.
The filing, by law firm Pomerantz to the District Court of Eastern District of New York, said that Ericsson among other things had misled investors by overstating the extent to which it had eliminated the use of bribes. 
An Ericsson spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment but Ericsson said in a brief statement that the company and ""certain (company) officers"" had been named as defendants in connection with ""allegedly false and misleading statements"" concerning Iraq.
Under the conditions of the 2019 DPA, Ericsson paid more than $1 billion to resolve a series of corruption probes, involving bribery in China, Vietnam and Djibouti, and agreed to cooperate with the department for ongoing investigations.

Ericsson has lost almost a third of its market value since media reports of the alleged bribes broke in February. 
Ericsson said that an internal probe, which ended in 2019 but was only made public in February after media inquiries, had identified payments designed to circumvent Iraqi customs at a time when militant organisations, including Islamic State, controlled some routes.

PARIS (Reuters) - The world's leading luxury brands said on Friday that they planned to temporarily close stores and pause business operations in Russia.
Birkin bag maker Hermes and Cartier owner Richemont were the first firms to announce such moves, followed by LVMH,  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and Chanel. 
Doing business in Russia has become complex since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which prompted the United States, Britain and the Europe Union to impose sweeping sanctions.
""Given our increasing concerns about the current situation, the growing uncertainty and the complexity to operate, Chanel decided to temporarily pause its business in Russia,"" the French luxury fashion house said in a LinkedIn post.
Luxury giant LVMH, which owns such brands as Christian Dior, Givenchy, Kenzo, TAG Heuer and Bulgari among others, will close its 124 boutiques in Russia from Sunday but will continue to pay the salaries for its 3,500 employees in the country, a spokesperson told Reuters. 
French multinational Kering, whose brands include brands as Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta and Boucheron among others, has two shops and 180 employees, which the company will continue to support. 
While affluent Russians are keen consumers of luxury goods, analysts say the proportion of luxury sales generated from Russian nationals is small compared to the industry's main growth engines, China and the United States.
Richemont, which also owns Dunhill, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Montblanc, Piaget, and Van Cleef & Arpels among other brands, has around a dozen directly operated stores, mostly in Moscow. It said in a statement it had suspended commercial activities in Russia on March 3 after stopping Ukraine operations on Feb. 24, the day Russia launched its invasion.
Hermes, which has three stores in Moscow, had planned to open an outlet in St. Petersburg later this year.
Investment bank Jefferies estimates that Russians account for around $9 billion in annual luxury sales, which is around 6% of Chinese spending and 14% of U.S spending on luxury goods.

Swiss watchmaker Swatch Group (SIX:UHR), which owns high end watches and jewellery labels including Harry Winston, said it would continue its operations in Russia, but was putting exports on hold ""because of the overall difficult situation"". 
L'Oreal, LVMH and Kering have all pledged financial support to help Ukrainian refugees and Richemont said on Friday it was initiating a ""significant donation"" to Medecins Sans Frontieres.

(Reuters) -Russia said it would block Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for excluding state media and CNN said it would stop broadcasting in Russia after a new law punishing ""fake news"" raised the stakes in Moscow's fight with foreign corporation.
Friday marked an escalation in the dispute that began after the invasion of Ukraine. Russia blocked a wave of media companies and new, big names announced they were shutting down Russia sales, including  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and video game maker  Electronic Arts Inc . (NASDAQ:EA)
Russia said that Meta Platforms Inc's Facebook was being blocked for restricting state-backed channels, and it also blocked websites of the BBC, Deutsche Welle and Voice of America for what it said was false information about the war in Ukraine. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) will also be blocked, Russian media said.
The BBC said it would temporarily suspend its work in Russia after introduction of a new law that could jail anyone found to be intentionally spreading ""fake"" news.
AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)'s CNN is stopping broadcasts to ""evaluate the situation and our next steps moving forward,"" a spokesperson said.
Meta's head of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said the company would continue to do everything possible to restore its services.
""Soon millions of ordinary Russians will find themselves cut off from reliable information, deprived of their everyday ways of connecting with family and friends and silenced from speaking out,"" he said, in a statement posted on Twitter.
Many Russians have downloaded VPN software to avoid state restrictions, but internet provider Cogent, which said it was the second-largest carrier out of Russia, disclosed plans to cut service, partly to avoid being used for cyberattacks.
A slew of major Western brands in a broad range of industries has exited from Russia. Some of the best known have sharply rebuked Moscow for the attack on Ukraine. Others have described reacting to circumstances, including luxury goods maker LVMH which on Friday said it would temporarily shut 124 shops in Russia.
Canadian Tire also announced it would temporarily close 41 Russian stores of its Helly Hansen outerwear and luggage group, and private jet maker Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Inc said it had suspended all activities with Russian clients, adhering to international laws.
Shipping and supply-chain issues have made it difficult to work in Russia, as well. Companies form Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp have taken actions from stopping sales and operations to exiting completely. Agricultural commodity merchant Louis Dreyfus announced suspension of operations in Russia on Friday.
NO EASY ANSWERS
Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov laid out options for foreign companies on Friday: stay in the country, exit entirely or hand over their holdings to local managers until they return.
No route comes without risks. Those staying could face a backlash in Western markets where the public has rallied to Ukraine's cause, those transferring shares could be handing over the keys with few guarantees, while those quitting may face a big loss at best, or might have to sell for a nominal sum.
""It's a complicated process,"" said Darren Woods, chief executive of U.S. energy company  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), which is exiting oil and gas investments that involve partnerships with Russia's Rosneft and others worth $4 billion.
Companies have had little time to prepare. 
Russia's invasion - which Moscow calls a ""special operation"" - prompted the United States and Europe to impose swift and sweeping sanctions, affecting everything from global payments systems to a range of high-tech products.
""Western companies probably haven't lost so much money so quickly due to geopolitics since the Shah was overthrown in Iran,"" said Renaissance Capital chief economist Charlie Robertson, referring to the Islamic revolution more than four decades ago that led to an exodus of Western businesses.
STAYING PUT
Yet some companies plan to keep going. Italian tyre maker Pirelli said it had set up a ""crisis committee"" to monitor developments but did not expect to halt production at either of its two Russian plants.
For companies packing up, the Russian first deputy prime minister said a fast-track bankruptcy plan ""will support the employment and social well-being of citizens so that bona fide entrepreneurs can ensure the effective functioning of business.""
So far global companies, banks and investors have announced they have exposure in some form to Russia of more than $110 billion. That amount could rise.
BASF SE (OTC:BASFY), the world's largest chemicals group, said it was halting new business in Russia and Belarus, except for food production for humanitarian causes. It also hinted at the minefield of new rules sanctions have introduced.
""BASF will only conduct business in Russia and Belarus that fulfils existing obligations in accordance with applicable laws, regulations and international rules,"" it said.
Swiss food giant Nestle SA (SIX:NESN), maker of KitKat bars and Nescafe coffee, said it was halting advertising in Russia, while Swiss watchmaker Swatch Group (SIX:UHR) said it would continue operations in Russia but would put exports on hold.

 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said it had been stress-testing its operations given its big technology centre in Russia but was assured it could run its everyday business globally.
The German lender had opened a new office in Moscow in December, a move it said at the time represented ""a significant investment and commitment to the Russian market.""

Sideloading, the practice of downloading apps without using an app store, is among the reforms that lawmakers hope will open up the market for apps.
Congress is currently considering a bill aimed at reining in app stores run by Apple and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, which would require companies to allow sideloading. Apple has argued that such a practice would be a security risk as it keeps tight control of the apps in the store in order to keep users safe.
In a letter dated Thursday and sent to key members of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Apple said it was aware that a critic, computer security expert Bruce Schneier, had called its concerns about sideloading ""unfounded."" 
Apple went on to argue that most malware does not rely on technical tricks to gain access to devices but instead tricks the human user to download it. It argued that Apple's review of apps that are put into the App Store ""creates a high barrier against the most common scams used to distribute malware.""
Apple acknowledged that Schneier was correct that state-sponsored attackers could get through smartphones' security controls but argued that these sorts of attacks are a ""rare threat.""
""There is ample evidence showing third-party app stores are a key malware vector on platforms which support such stores,"" Apple said in the letter which was viewed by Reuters.
It was sent to Senate Judiciary Committee chair Dick Durbin, the top Republican, Chuck Grassley as well as Amy Klobuchar, chair of the antitrust subcommittee, along with the top Republican, Mike Lee.

The committee voted in early February to approve the bill. The measure would also bar companies from requiring app providers to use their payment system and would prohibit them from punishing apps that offer different prices or conditions through another app store or payment system. 
The biggest technology companies, including Meta Platforms Inc's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), have been under pressure in Congress over allegations they abused their outsized market power. A long list of bills is aimed at reining them in, but none have yet become law.

Western nations including Canada have imposed sanctions on prominent Russians, taken steps to stop business with the country and closed their airspace to Russian-owned, chartered or operated aircraft.
“We will continue to adhere to international laws, regulations and sanctions, as they evolve,” the Montreal-based company said in a statement.
Bombardier said the suspended activities include all forms of technical assistance.
The company has said about 5% or 6% of its business jet deliveries traditionally go to customers in the region. Its latest reported order backlog is $12.2 billion.
Canada exported nearly C$112 million ($87.97 million) in aircraft to Russia in 2021, the highest level in the last five years, according to government data.
Separately on Friday, Transport Canada said it had cleared a private aircraft to depart from Yellowknife without passengers, after determining that the plane, while not Russian-owned or registered, had ""operated contrary"" to the country's airspace restrictions when it landed on March 1.

The Canadian regulator fined Geneva-based aircraft operator Dunard Engineering Ltd C$15,000 and imposed C$3,000 fines on each of the plane's two pilots, along with a Russian national who chartered the plane.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Data showing a vibrant U.S. jobs market strengthened the dollar and spurred commodity prices higher, but the war in Ukraine overshadowed the blowout report as the euro plunged on the worsening outlook for slower European economic growth.
The U.S. unemployment rate fell to a two-year low of 3.8% as job growth surged in February, a bright spot for an economy that faces mounting headwinds from rising inflation, tighter monetary policy by the Federal Reserve and geopolitical tensions. 
The euro tumbled below $1.10 for the first time in almost two years and hit a fresh seven-year low against the safe-haven Swiss franc as Russian forces seized the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and fighting raged elsewhere in Ukraine.
European stocks sank to near one-year lows, with the pan-regional STOXX 600 index sliding 3.56% to increase losses for the week to 7% - its worst weekly decline since the depths of a pandemic-fueled sell-off in March 2020.
The major U.S. stock indices declined less as Europe's dependence on Russian energy and its proximity to Ukraine has slammed the continent more than other parts of the globe.
If it were not for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Federal Reserve would likely raise interest rates by 50 basis points at its policy meeting in two weeks, said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.
The jobs data is a blowout number but it doesn't ease Fed Chair Jerome Powell's job as he raises interest rates to tame inflation as the economy slows, Kinahan said.
""He has a tough needle to thread here, in terms of making sure that tighter money doesn't upset what's already a very fragile situation,"" he said.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.53%, the S&P 500 lost 0.79% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.66%.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe closed down 1.65%.
The dollar rose more than 1% against a basket of six trading currencies at one point. A key measure of economic expectations, the gap between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes, flattened to under 25 basis points.
A flattening curve can mean investors expect rate hikes soon and are losing confidence in the economic growth outlook.
However, a yield curve that is flat or flattening ""isn't necessarily a bad omen for markets,"" said Jeff Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments. 
""Given all the uncertainty with the Ukraine situation, the higher inflationary backdrop and some slower global growth as a result, we think that you could see a more dovish Fed than currently is being priced in the financial markets,"" he said.
A closely watched measure of money-market stress and dollar funding conditions rose to its highest level since May 2020, reflecting the increased risk of banks hoarding the U.S. currency and squeezing liquidity. 
European bond yields fell along with the euro as investors worried that higher commodity prices will dent growth in the European Union.
The euro fell 1.17% to $1.0934.
Commodity markets headed to their biggest weekly gains in years as the shuttering of Ukrainian ports and sanctions against Russia sent energy, crop and metal buyers scrambling for replacement supplies.
Crude oil, which has hit its highest level in a decade this week, soared again in a volatile session as the disruption of Russian exports outweighed hopes for more Iranian supply if Washington reaches a nuclear deal with Tehran.
U.S. crude futures posted their biggest weekly gain since April 2020, up 25.9%. U.S. crude settled up $8.01 at $115.668 a barrel, while Brent rose $7.65 to $118.11.
Aluminum touched a fresh record high in London, heading to its biggest weekly gain on record amid fears of a squeeze on the metal from Russia. Nickel reached an 11-year high for similar reasons.
Palladium prices rose above $3,000 per ounce for the first time since May 2021 as concerns over supply shortages from top producer Russia mounted and the war in Ukraine bolstered demand for safe-haven gold. 
U.S. gold futures settled 1.6% higher at $1,966.60 an ounce.

Overnight in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares ex-Japan tumbled as much as 1.5% to 585.6, the lowest level since November 2020, taking the year-to-date losses to 7%. 
Stock markets across Asia were in a sea of red, with Japan losing 2.2%, South Korea 1.1%, China 0.9% and Hong Kong 2.5%, while commodities-heavy Australia was down 0.6%.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 slipped to a weekly loss Friday, as the escalating Russia-Ukraine conflict roiled investor appetite and overshadowed a much better than expected monthly jobs report.  
The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5%, or 179 points, the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.7%.
Expectations for a ceasefire dwindled after Russia seized a Ukrainian nuclear plant and escalated its attack on several cities on Friday, forcing investors to pull out of risk assets including stocks and into safe-haven bonds and gold.  
The rising geopolitical tensions offset data showing the U.S. created more jobs than expected in February, and the unemployment rate slipped to the lowest since February 2020.
Nonfarm payrolls increased 678,000 in February, well above consensus expectations for 400,000 new jobs, while the unemployment rate fell by more than expected to 3.8%.
Wage growth, however, was flat, missing expectations for a 0.5% monthly rise despite numerous reports of companies having to hike wages to attract workers.
""The flat average hourly earnings number was a relief to see given the increasing inflationary worries,” Eric Diton, president and CEO of The Wealth Alliance, told Investing.com in an interview on Friday.
But the Russia-Ukraine conflict is likely to disrupt supplies of key commodities including wheat, corn, oil and gas, speeding up the pace of inflation.  
“In terms of total natural resources, Ukraine is fourth in the world by total value, and first in Europe in terms of farmable land area,"" Diton added. ""The Ukraine-Russia conflict is a big inflationary tailwind.""
Energy stocks continued to ride the rise in oil prices higher as reports that the White House is considering a ban on Russia oil imports to the U.S. added to concerns of tighter global energy supplies.
Technology and financial stocks were the biggest sectors keeping the market in the red, with the latter under pressure from falling bank stocks as Treasury yields dropped in the wake of concerns about global growth, and falling bets on aggressive Fed rate hikes.
Regional banks including SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB), Invesco (NYSE:IVZ),  Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY), were down sharply, with latter falling by more than 8% despite Goldman Sachs reiterating its buy rating on the stock.
Big tech continued to trend lower, while losses in chipmakers NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) offset gains in Broadcom.
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported fiscal first-quarter results that topped Wall Street expectations on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares more than 3% higher.
The chipmaker also guided fiscal second-quarter growth well above expectations on “broad-based demand, lean channel inventory and growing backlog despite stable albeit extended lead times  [of about] 50 weeks,” Credit Suisse said in a note as it reiterated its $700 price target on the stock.
Kroger (NYSE:KR), meanwhile, was up more than 6% after the grocery chain detailed long-term growth plans that included a commitment to return about 8% to 11% to shareholders amid a boost from initiatives to bolster its digital growth.
Gap (NYSE:GPS) reported a narrower-than-expected fourth-quarter loss and upbeat guidance, but concerns about supply chain disruptions and rising labor costs weighed on sentiment, forcing the stock to cut its intraday gains."

Investing.com -- Shares of sporting goods retailer  Hibbett Sports  Inc (NASDAQ:HIBB) reversed losses after earnings came in below analyst expectations, ending the session up 2.8%. 
Earlier in the session the stock fell to a low of $45.33 Friday, 
The Birmingham, Alabama-based business announced earnings per share of $1.25 on revenue of $383.35 million. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.35 on revenue of $414.66 million.
Hibbett's fourth-quarter comparable sales decreased 1%. In addition, brick and mortar comparable sales fell 1.6%, although e-commerce comparable sales increased 1.8%.
The company said that after a strong sales trend leading up to the Christmas holiday, traffic and transactions declined in the back half of the quarter. 
""We believe disruption in the supply chain, most notably in the footwear category, coupled with consumer concern over inflation and an increase in COVID-19 cases driven by the Omicron variant were significant contributors to the sales shortfall,"" the company said.
Looking ahead, the company expects to face further challenges in the 52-weeks ending Jan. 28, 2023. Hibbett cited ongoing supply chain disruption, a lack of stimulus and unemployment benefits, inflation, wage pressures, and a more cautious consumer as potential headwinds this year. 
As a result, Hibbett expects total net sales to be relatively flat this year, with comparable sales forecast in the negative low-single digits for the year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global banks face an arduous and costly process if they decide to close businesses in Russia, banking sources and experts say, complicating decisions over whether they should withdraw.
Sanctions placed on Russia following its week-old invasion of Ukraine and retaliation from Moscow have raised questions over how much longer banks can continue. 
One banking source raised particular concerns about how banks navigate an order on rouble lending and the implications for foreign companies in Russia. Banks are also weighing the risk to their reputations in staying there.
While banks have not yet announced exits, at least one global lender with operations in Russia is creating an in-house team and working with outside lawyers and consultants to determine whether and how it could exit before making public announcements, one banking source said.
British energy giants BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa) last week said they would quit Russia. BP is abandoning its stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft, resulting in charges of up to $25 billion, it said.
However, banks will find it harder to extricate themselves, experts say.
""For an oil company, walking away from refinery assets in Russia might be as simple as dropping the keys and leaving but a unilateral exit is not possible for a financial services firm,"" said Dan Awrey, a professor at Cornell Law School who specializes in financial regulation.
Under normal circumstances, banks would not be able to exit a country without the consent of its regulators and central bank. They would also need a willing buyer to take control of their loans and other commitments, experts say.
""You can't just unilaterally walk away from lending commitments and other types of financial claims,"" said Awrey. ""There's somebody on the other side and that will make it much more complicated.""
Of particular concern was an order from the Kremlin http://kremlin.ru/acts/news/67886 dated March 1, prohibiting rouble lending and credit to persons of foreign states that commit unfriendly acts, one banking source said.
Banks would need to work out the implications of that for their operations and whether it prohibited overseas companies in Russia - from countries that sanctioned Moscow - from accessing rouble credit facilities, which would deal a blow to them being able to operate in the country, that source said. The source questioned whether foreign banks could continue to operate in Russia given the circumstances.
Global banks are also trying to figure out how the U.S. sanctions on the Russian Central Bank may affect related infrastructure and market plumbing, and are being very cautious where they identify a nexus with the central bank, according to two U.S.-based industry sources. That could also make global banks reluctant to transact in roubles. 
Sanctions have effectively ended any realistic chance of global banks selling Russian assets, said one senior banking source who asked not to be named. That leaves winding down assets or writing them off as the only viable options, the source said, which would involve a financial hit.
One option being assessed is whether banks could be sued by clients in Russia if they walk away from commitments, that banking source said.
Some banks could look to keep skeleton operations in Moscow, rather than pulling out entirely, the same source said. That would avoid the complication of having to re-apply for a banking license and build a business from scratch in the future. 
U.S. banks with Russia operations declined comment or did not respond to comment. 
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), the U.S. bank most heavily exposed to Russia, is already experiencing how difficult it is to leave.
The bank announced last year that it would sell its Russian consumer business as part of a broader restructuring. The only publicly named buyer had been Russian state bank VTB Bank, which is the subject of U.S. sanctions. 
It is doubtful whether Citigroup would be able to transact with another Russian buyer due to the sanctions and foreign banks are unlikely to want to buy Russian assets at the current time, analysts and lawyers say.
Citigroup Chief Executive Jane Fraser said Wednesday it was ""too early to tell"" whether a sale can proceed. Meanwhile, its Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said the bank could have to write off nearly half of its $9.8 billion Russian exposure.

Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) is considering leaving Russia, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters this week, a move that would make it the first European bank to do so since the country's invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. banks had already cut their exposures after sanctions were placed on Russia following its annexation of Crimea in 2014. However, banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Citigroup have continued to underwrite and advise on Russian deals, and keep staff in the country.

LONDON (Reuters) -Russia's global financial isolation intensified on Friday as the London Stock Exchange (LSE) suspended trading in its last Russian securities and some insurers withdrew cover from exporters over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Banks, investors and insurers have in recent days ratcheted up that pressure by exiting investments in Russia and halting the provision of their services. 
The LSE said it had suspended global depositary receipts (GDRs), which represent shares in a foreign company, for eight Russian companies, including Magnit and Sistema, after freezing trading in 28 firms on Thursday.
Later on Thursday the exchange said it had also suspended some exchange-traded-funds' with Russian securities.
The trading halts come as Britain, the European Union and the United States continue to roll out financial sanctions on Russia to prevent its companies from accessing Western markets.
In another turning of the screws on Moscow, trade credit insurers, who provide a financial safety net for exports and imports, are pulling back from covering businesses exporting to Ukraine and Russia given the risks of sanctions, high claims or missed payments, industry sources said.
The move in the nearly $3 trillion global market will heap further pressure on Russia's already teetering economy.
""In this last week, trade credit insurers will have paused supporting new risk for Ukraine and Russia,"" said Nick Robson, global leader for credit specialties at insurance broker Marsh.
European Union officials are also examining curbing Russia's influence and access to finance at the International Monetary Fund following the invasion, six officials told Reuters. [L2N2V71XO]
""For its part, Washington will continue to embrace multilateral sanctions, (and) target the wealth of Russian oligarchs as part of a pressure campaign,"" Isaac Boltansky, policy director for brokerage BTIG wrote in a note on Friday. 
INVESTORS OUT
British insurer and asset manager Royal London became the latest Western investor to say it will sell its Russian assets as soon as possible, after a rush of similar announcements in recent days.
""We can't trade these things anyway, but as soon as we can, we obviously intend to divest,"" Royal London Chief Executive Barry O'Dwyer told Reuters.
The CEO of another major British investment group,  Schroders  (LON:SDR), said on Thursday Russian stocks and bonds are now ""in the realms of utterly uninvestable"".
Swiss wealth manager Julius Baer has halted new business with wealthy Russians, two sources familiar with the bank's operations told Reuters.

Some investors are however piling into funds linked to Russia, seeing current distressed levels as a potentially cheap entry point for Russian assets.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said it has been stress-testing its operations in Russia, where it employs some 1,500 workers in a major technology centre, as banks with a significant Russian presence grapple with the ramifications of its growing financial isolation.

Airbnb Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky tweeted on Thursday the suspension, which also includes Russian ally Belarus. It aligns his company with other major Western names including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google.
""People are booking Airbnbs in Ukraine they don't intend to stay in just to help Hosts,"" Chesky added, noting a way some outsiders have found to send financial support to Ukrainians.

The company did not immediately respond to a request for additional details on the suspensions in Russia and Belarus. Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) is Airbnb's second-biggest market after North America.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 fell Friday, as a strong monthly jobs report was offset by an escalating Ukraine-Russia conflict that is poised to push inflation much higher.
The S&P 500 fell 1.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1%, or 328 points, the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.0%.
Expectations for a ceasefire dwindled after Russia escalated its attack on key Ukrainian cities on Friday, forcing investors to pull out of risk assets including stocks and into safe-haven bonds and gold.
The rising geopolitical tensions offset data showing the U.S. created more jobs than expected in February, and the unemployment rate slipped to the lowest since February 2020.
Nonfarm payrolls increased 678,000 in February, well above consensus expectations for 400,000 new jobs, while the unemployment rate fell by more than expected to 3.8%.
Wage growth, however, was flat, missing expectations for a 0.5% monthly rise despite numerous reports of companies having to hike wages to attract workers.
""The flat average hourly earnings number was a relief to see given the increasing inflationary worries,” Eric Diton, president and CEO of The Wealth Alliance, told Investing.com in an interview on Friday.
But the Russia-Ukraine conflict is likely to disrupt supplies of key commodities including wheat, corn, oil and gas, speeding up the pace of inflation.  
“In terms of total natural resources, Ukraine is fourth in the world by total value, and first in Europe in terms of farmable land area,"" Diton added. ""The Ukraine-Russia conflict is a big inflationary tailwind.""
Energy stocks continued to ride the rise in oil prices higher as reports that the White House is considering a ban on Russia oil imports to the U.S. added to concerns of tighter global energy supplies.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Friday it denied a General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) request that would have allowed the automaker to avoid fixing headlight glare problems on about 725,000 U.S. sport utility vehicles.
If the agency had agreed to declare the problem inconsequential, GM would not have been required to notify customers of the problem and provide a free fix. 
The Detroit automaker argued the issue did not impact vehicle safety and petitioned NHTSA in 2019 to declare the issue inconsequential for GMC Terrain vehicles from the 2010 through 2017 model years. GM said the issue has been corrected in replacement parts and does not affect current generation vehicles. 
NHTSA said in certain weather conditions such as snow and fog the headlight issue could cause ""glare to other motorists driving in proximity.""
GM said Friday it was aware of the agency's ruling and ""will review NHTSA’s decision and explore potential next steps.""

GM told NHTSA it was aware of ""only a single customer

Investing.com --  Volkswagen AG  (DE:VOWG) announced Friday it plans to build a new manufacturing facility in Germany. 
Volkswagen shares fell 8%.
The announcement comes shortly after the news that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s long-awaited German gigafactory has gained conditional approval.
Volkswagen's new plant is set to cost approximately €2 billion ($2.2 billion) and will be in Wolfsburg-Warmenau, close to the company's main plant.
The new plant will make a new model of electrically powered sedans, codenamed Trinity. The plant's construction is scheduled to begin in spring 2023, with the production of Trinity starting in 2026.
“With this decision we are strengthening and sustaining the competitiveness of the main plant and giving the workforce a robust long-term perspective,"" said Volkswagen CEO Ralf Brandstätter.
The company added that the new Trinity factory ""is a key component of the largest modernization program in the history of Volkswagen’s main location.""
Volkswagen said it aims for a production time of 10 hours per vehicle at the factory, significantly less than the current time it takes to build other vehicles at other sites. In comparison, it reportedly takes the company more than 20 hours to manufacture each Golf or Tiguan model."
20,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 04, 2022 02:09PM ET</span>",White House Considering Ban on Russian Oil Imports to U.S.,"(Bloomberg) -- The Biden administration is weighing a ban on U.S. imports of Russian crude oil as Congress races toward passing such a restriction to punish the Kremlin for its invasion of Ukraine.
Conversations are taking place within the administration and with the U.S. oil and gas industry on the impact such a move would have on American consumers and the global supply, according to people familiar with the matter. A White House spokesperson said no decision has been made.
Russian oil made up only about 3% of all the crude shipments that arrived in the U.S. last year, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show. U.S. imports of Russian crude so far in 2022 have dropped to the slowest annual pace since 2017, according to the intelligence firm Kpler.
When other petroleum products -- such as unfinished fuel oil that can be used as a feedstock to produce gasoline and diesel -- are included, Russia accounted for about 8% of 2021 oil imports, though those shipments have also been trending lower in recent months.
Cutting consumption of Russian energy isn’t the only move the administration is considering. One person familiar with the deliberations noted that Russia is already in a full-on financial crisis, with the ruble cratering, stock trading halted and sovereign and corporate debt battered. 
Among the implications of an oil ban the White House is assessing is if the move would actually hurt the Russian economy, or if the crude would simply go to other markets and drive up U.S. gasoline prices.
The average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline was $3.84 Thursday, according to auto club AAA. Brent crude oil was trading at over $115 a barrel as of 1:44 p.m. in New York.
“Any restrictions on Russian flows would cause pain exclusively on the side of the buyer because the Russians can easily place their fuel oil in China or India,” said David Wech, chief economist at oil-data provider Vortexa Ltd. “That would put the U.S. in a difficult position because of the impact on gasoline prices,” he said.
Senators Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, and Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, recently introduced legislation that would block the flow of Russian oil and gas into the U.S., and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has joined with Republicans in backing the idea. One of the people said the administration of President Joe Biden is in close touch with Manchin on the proposal, which the Senate has allowed to bypass the committee process.
There’s discussion about the need to include a provision in the legislation introduced by Manchin and Murkowski about consulting with allies. 
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki as recently as Thursday spoke out against the idea. 
“Our objective and the president’s objective has been to maximize impact on Russia while minimizing impact to us and our allies and partners,” Psaki said at a briefing Thursday. “We don’t have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy, and that would raise prices at the gas pump for the American people, around the world.” 
But Psaki added: “We are continuing to look at other options we could take right now to cut U.S. consumption of Russian energy.”

BRINDISI, Italy (Reuters) - Prosecutors investigating suspected flawed parts produced by an Italian company for the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliner are expected to wrap up the probe by July, when they will say if the alleged defects could threaten the airplane's safety, two sources said.
A team of independent experts appointed by the prosecutors is analysing the components and their impact on the overall airworthiness of the aircraft, the sources close to the matter told Reuters.
The experts are currently focusing on the bigger components, including titanium parts that help secure the aircraft's floor, which were removed in Italy from around 30 fuselages intended for Boeing 787 airplanes, a third source said. 
In October, Boeing said some 787 Dreamliner parts supplied by Italy's Manufacturing Process Specification (MPS) had been improperly manufactured, marking the latest in a series of industrial snags to hit the wide-body aircraft.
Boeing was not immediately available for comment on Friday. In December it said that the issues with parts supplied by Italy's MPS and Processi Speciali did not affect airworthiness.
MPS and its now-bankrupt predecessor company Processi Speciali had supplied floor fittings, spacers, brackets and clips to Italian aerospace group Leonardo, which makes two fuselage sections for the Boeing 787 at its plant in Grottaglie, near Brindisi. Both Leonardo and Boeing have dropped MPS from their suppliers' list.
Leonardo, which has previously said it too is a victim of the suspected failure to meet specifications by its former suppliers, declined to comment on Friday.
In December, prosecutors ordered the seizure of titanium and aluminium parts supplied by MPS and its predecessor to Leonardo's Grottaglie plant.
Initial results of the investigation launched by Brindisi prosecutors suggest that MPS and Processi Speciali produced more than 4,000 flawed parts between 2016 and 2021 for the Boeing 787, the prosecutors said in a confidential report seen by Reuters in December.
Prosecutors allege that MPS or Processi Speciali made parts using titanium and aluminium of different quality and origin from those ordered by the customer, breaching the relevant technical specifications.
Eight individuals, including the former head of MPS and the former head of Processi Speciali, are under investigation for fraud and for actions threatening the safety of air transport.

The former head of MPS and the former head of Processi Speciali have both previously denied any wrongdoing.
Court appointed administrators for both MPS and its predecessor did not reply Reuters request for comment. The lawyer for the former heads of MPS and Processi Speciali heads was not available for comment.

See for a Factbox on commodity price gains since the close on Feb. 23, the day before the invasion started.
Following are some details about Russia's major commodity exports.
CRUDE OIL
Russia is the world's third largest oil producer after the United States and Saudi Arabia with output of 11 million barrels per day (bpd).
It rivals Saudi Arabia for the title of the world's largest oil exporter with around 7 million bpd of crude and oil products exported abroad, of which Asia takes around a half while Europe, the United States and the rest of the world take the rest.
GAS
Russia is the world's second largest gas producer after the United States and the largest exporter, with flows going predominantly to Europe and covering 40% of the continent's gas needs.
COAL
Russia is the world's sixth largest coal producer with output of 400 million tonnes of coal, amounting to more than 5% of global production. 
It is the world's third largest exporter, shipping more than half its output overseas, with China being the main destination.
ALUMINIUM 
Most Russian metal producers have so far escaped sanctions imposed by the West since Moscow annexed the Crimea in 2014.
One exception is the world's largest aluminium producer outside China, Rusal, under sanctions imposed by the United States between April 2018 and early 2019.
Rusal produced 3.8 million tonnes of aluminium in 2021, about 6% of the estimated world production.
Europe, Asia and North America are Rusal's main markets. Miner and commodity trader Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) has a long-term deal running until 2025 to buy primary aluminium from Rusal. 
COBALT
Data from U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) shows Russia produced 7,600 tonnes of cobalt last year, more than 4% of the global total. 
Russia was the second largest producer, far behind the Democratic Republic of Congo which produced 120,000 tonnes. 
Nornickel is the largest producer in Russia, selling 5,000 tonnes in 2021. Nornickel sells most of its output to Europe.
COPPER
Russia produced 920,000 tonnes of refined copper last year, about 3.5% of the world total, according to USGS, out of which Nornickel produced 406,841 tonnes. 
Asia and Europe are the main export markets. 
NICKEL
Nornickel is the world's top producer of refined nickel. It produced 193,006 tonnes in 2021 or about 7% of global mine production estimated at 2.7 million tonnes. It sells to global industrial consumers under long-term contracts. 
PALLADIUM AND PLATINUM
Nornickel is also the world's largest producer of palladium and a major producer of platinum. 
It produced 2.6 million troy ounces of palladium last year or 40% of global mine production and 641,000 ounces of platinum or about 10% of total mine production.
GOLD
Russia is the world's third largest producer of gold after Australia and China and accounts for about 10% of global mine production, which according to the World Gold Council totalled 3,500 tonnes last year. 
Russian gold is produced by companies that include Polyus and Polymetal. Russian miners mainly sell their gold to the country's commercial banks which then export it. 
TITANIUM
Russia's VSMPO-Avisma supplies titanium to Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus.
Data from USGS shows Russia produced 27,000 tonnes of titanium sponge and Ukraine 5,400 tonnes last year, 15% of the global total at 210,000 tonnes.
STEEL
Russia produced 76 million tonnes of steel or nearly 4% of the global total, according to the World Steel Association.
Severstal, NLMK, Evraz, MMK and Mechel are Russia's main producers. They export about half of their production, mainly to Europe.
DIAMONDS
State-controlled Alrosa, the world's largest producer of rough diamonds, produced 32.4 million carats in 2021, about 30% of the global total. It exports mostly to Belgium, India and the United Arab Emirates. 
FERTILISERS
Russia is a major producer of potash, phosphate and nitrogen containing fertilisers - key crop and soil nutrients. It produces more than 50 million tonnes a year of the fertilisers, 13% of the global total.
Phosagro, Uralchem, Uralkali, Acron and Eurochem are the biggest players. 
They export to Asia and Brazil. 
GRAINS/OILSEEDS
Russia and Ukraine are both major wheat suppliers, accounting for a combined 29% of global exports, the bulk of which go through ports in the Black Sea.
The movement of vessels on the smaller Azov Sea has already been suspended and if shipments are disrupted from the Black Sea it will leave major importers, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, scrambling to find alternative supplies.

Ukraine is one of the world's top four corn (maize) exporters along with the United States, Argentina and Brazil.

ZURICH (Reuters) - A Swiss member of parliament has filed a criminal complaint against  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), he told Reuters on Friday, asking the country's attorney general to investigate potential sanctions violations after the Financial Times this week reported the bank had asked investors to destroy documents linked to loans to Russian oligarchs.
The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that Credit Suisse had asked hedge funds and other investors to destroy documents relating to its richest clients' yachts and private jets. The report cited three individuals whose firms had received the request, and linked the request to an attempt to ""stop information leaking about a unit of the bank that has made loans to oligarchs who were later sanctioned"".
Credit Suisse said on Thursday no client data had been erased within the bank when it asked investors to destroy documents relating to a transaction in November last year, in reaction to the report.
In a letter addressed to Swiss Attorney General Stefan Blaettler, Geneva-based member of parliament Carlo Sommaruga said he believed the request could amount to sanction violations.
""It is clear that if the (details) mentioned are correct, they are undoubtedly acts intended to conceal the existence of property belonging to oligarchs solely for the purpose of escaping sanctions decided by the European Union and Switzerland,"" Sommaruga wrote in the letter dated March 2.
Le Temps first reported on the complaint, which Sommaruga confirmed to Reuters. Reuters reviewed the complaint. 
""The destruction of documents mentioned by the Financial Times could also be considered as destruction of evidence
and obstruction of criminal proceedings,"" Sommaruga said. ""In this context, I ask the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland to open a criminal investigation in order to establish the facts and to indict the natural and legal persons who gave the orders to carry out and implemented the possible criminal acts.""
The Office for the Attorney General did not immediately respond to a request for comment, sending an automated message that it was outside its operating hours. 
Credit Suisse declined comment.
On Thursday, the bank said the letter mentioned by the Financial Times related to a synthetic risk transfer transaction undertaken in November 2021, adding its request was unrelated to recent sanctions.

""No data, client-related or otherwise, has been erased within Credit Suisse and, for clarity, this is in no way linked to the recent implementation of additional sanctions – with which we are fully compliant"", the bank said.
It said its entitlement to request the destruction of the data was stipulated under a non-disclosure agreement.

28,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2022 01:05PM ET</span>",Russian lender TCS gets money flow from sanctioned rivals,"(Reuters) -Russian lender TCS Group Holding on Friday said it was benefitting from increased liquidity as volatility and outflows hit its sanctioned rivals, and that central bank efforts to support the embattled sector were bearing results. 
Major banks have been excluded from the SWIFT global messaging network, making it hard for lenders and companies to make and receive payments as Western nations seek to isolate Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, something Russia calls a ""special military operation"".
""Banks which have been sanctioned have seen some volatility and outflows, I believe that is now calming down a little bit,"" Co-CEO Oliver Hughes said on an investor call as the lender reported record annual net profit.
""But we were actually, somewhat bizarrely, the beneficiaries of some of that liquidity coming in because we are not a sanctioned bank. We are now seeing inflows of liquidity increasing.""
Russia's central bank has started carrying out daily repo auctions to help Russian banks manage their liquidity. It hiked its key interest rate to 20% on Monday. 
CURRENCY SCRAMBLE
Queues developed at some ATMs in Moscow this week as Russians sought to get their hands on foreign currency.
Hughes said demand at Tinkoff machines for conversions from roubles to dollars had actually been quite mild and that some were depositing cash. 
""We have seen queues around our ATMs on some days, but it is people depositing roubles and dollars on their accounts, not just withdrawing,"" Hughes said. ""There has been this weird two-way movement. It is difficult to pinpoint one particular trend."" 
Last year's net profit of 63.4 billion roubles ($561 million) came at around $860 million in dollar terms when calculated against the rouble's 2021 average rate of 73.65.
Co-CEO Pavel Fedorov, said Tinkoff was committed to remaining a public company and to servicing its debt.
Trading of TCS' London-listed global depositary receipts was suspended on Thursday along with several Russia-based companies.
Should that suspension last a long time, Tinkoff, which had 20.8 million customers by year end, said it may consider moving its primary listing from London to Moscow, or look at a third location. 
""Our immediate focus now lies in making sure all our systems work as usual,"" Hughes and Fedorov said in a statement. ""We have all hands on deck. We have ample rouble and FX liquidity and a solid capital position.""
BOND BUYBACKS?
TCS said it may, at any time and from time to time, buy its outstanding debt in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise.
""Such repurchases, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors,"" TCS said. 
Full-year revenue grew by 40% to 273.9 billion roubles and the bank's return on equity increased to 42.5% in 2021 from 50.6% a year earlier. 
Its share price had plunged over 90% since Russia launched its assault on Ukraine last week by the time trading was halted. 

Already eyeing expansion in Asia, Tinkoff on Friday said it was also looking at one market in Latin America on the acquiring and payments side.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Stellantis is considering the production and sale of a hybrid vehicle powered by electricity and ethanol in Brazil by 2025, and plans to launch a new brand in the country this year, the company's chief operating officer for South America said on Friday.
Antonio Filosa said the company plans to launch 16 new models and seven electric and hybrid models in the region by 2025, in a plan that aims to boost French brands Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) and Citroen without losing sight of Fiat and Jeep's market leadership.
""Around 2025, if everything goes right, we could start proposing this type of technology,"" Filosa said when questioned about a potential launch in 2026. He added, however, that the company still does not have a definitive timeframe.
""Ethanol is very relevant in Brazil and less so in other Latin American countries, but it is starting to gain relevance in other countries such as India,"" said the executive, underlining that the development of the ethanol hybrid would first focus on the Brazilian market.

Filosa also said Stellantis is preparing the launch of a new brand in the region - the group currently works with seven brands in South America - but did not confirm which one.
""You will know later this year. It starts with an 'A', but it is not Alfa Romeo,"" the executive said. In Stellantis' brand portfolio, the only other brand that has the initial letter ""A"" is Italy's Abarth.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss wealth manager Julius Baer has halted any new business with wealthy Russians, two sources familiar with the bank's operations said, as European lenders try to limit their exposure to Russia's elite amidst tightening sanctions.
Wealth managers in Europe have sought to distance themselves from the economic and political fallout of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and Julius Baer this week began blocking any new business with Russian clients, the people said.
The European Union last week imposed sanctions blocking Russian citizens and residents from making new deposits above 100,000 euros ($109,160) into European bank accounts. However, Russian residents of an EU member state and dual citizens of a member state were exempted from that ban.
Switzerland on Monday followed the European Union's lead in imposing sanctions against Russia, and on Friday broadened its sanctions to include other financial restrictions already covered by the EU's moves.
That included blocking deposits above 100,000 Swiss francs ($108,885) from Russian citizens or from individuals and legal entities residing in Russia, as well as requiring banks to report on existing deposits from Russian clients above 100,000 francs.
However, already ahead of that move, Swiss wealth managers have sought to limit their exposure to Russian clients after previously finding themselves in the crosshairs of U.S.-imposed sanctions, including against Russia in 2014 and 2018. 
""As a global company, we are used to operating in different jurisdictions and are obliged to comply with all applicable regulations. At the same time, we are well used to operating in neutral territory as a Swiss company,"" Zurich-based Julius Baer said, adding it took appropriate measures as necessary.
Wealth managers say European banks are currently taking an even more cautious approach than dictated by European sanctions by declining any new business with Russian clients, regardless of where they reside or whether sanctions apply to their money.
""If you go out to various custodian banks in Europe, nobody wants to touch a Russian contact,"" said one London-based wealth manager, who asked not to be named. ""They're fine with their existing Russian client base and the assets that they hold. (But) if you go to all the obvious players, they'll immediately say no (to taking on any new Russian clients).""
The uncertainty has caused a number of Russian clients who already bank in Europe to seek out new relationships, the person said.
""In the last few weeks, we've had inquiries from a number of Russian families asking if they could work with us,"" the London-based wealth manager, who typically works with clients in the $30 million-$50 million range, said. ""And we would never generally get inquiries from Russian families. It's not the area we operated in.""
In Switzerland, the world's largest centre for offshore wealth, major wealth managers are aligned in shying away from taking on business with any new Russian clients, another person said, adding business with existing Russian clients - including wealthy individuals not on the sanctions list - could also presently be ""challenging"".
Julius Baer, which conducts business out of Zurich and Moscow as well as operating a Russia desk out of Dubai, declined to identify the size of its exposure to Russian clients.
""Russia is one of Julius Baer's core markets, along with numerous other major countries. We have been serving clients from Russia for over two decades. In Moscow, we are represented by Julius Baer CIS Ltd, an investment advisory firm licensed by the Central Bank of Russia,"" the bank said in a statement.

(Reuters) - Companies returned to Europe's corporate bond market to issue debt on Thursday after it remained frozen for a week following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
U.S. medical device company Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) American launched three, six, nine and 12-year bonds for a total of 3 billion euros to buy back U.S. dollar bonds. Bazalgette Finance, a special purpose financing vehicle backing the Thames Tideway Tunnel, launched a 300 million pound, 12-year green bond, according to Refinitiv's IFR. Both marked the first deals in the market since last Wednesday.
Marco Stoeckle, head of corporate credit research at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), noted that the first issuers came from safer sectors, as would be expected after the market effectively froze.
""It's really hard to say this is the beginning of a longer-term trend because (issuance) could dissipate within minutes if we see the wrong headlines."" 
European investment-grade corporate bond yields rose 50 basis points in February, with the market underperforming the U.S. one and suffering its worst monthly loss since March 2020, according to BofA indexes. The ECB's hawkish turn and then the invasion made yields, that move inversely to bond prices, more than double this year. 
STOP-AND-GO
This week's reopening pales compared to around $30 billion investment-grade companies in the United States raised on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to IFR.
European issuance had already slowed prior to the invasion and is expected to remain stop-and-go depending on daily market conditions. 
Issuers are still coming to terms with the rise in borrowing costs, according to a senior banker who arranges debt sales for European companies. 
""Some issuers are ready to go, some are struggling to get their heads around it and the pipeline will change,"" the banker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said. 
Bankers told Reuters some companies have delayed planned debt sales to later this month or even May, some have dropped out as they no longer see market conditions as attractive for opportunistic deals. Others may have sought alternative financing, for example private debt, the bankers said. 
""Most of our issuers are quite liquid and have robust cash balances so aren't in an immediate need to rush to markets and pay large concessions,"" another corporate debt banker said.
Before the invasion many analysts were expecting more corporate bond offers this year to fund mergers and acquisitions as well as capital investments. Bankers say now issuance may fall short of those expectations given the prevailing uncertainty. 

""The financing will get done if it needs to get done but the opportunistic elements of it will be harder sell right now,"" the first banker said.

(Reuters) -European stocks sank to near one-year lows on Friday, as auto and bank stocks took a battering on reports of a nuclear power plant on fire amid fierce fighting between Ukraine and Russian troops.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 3.6%. It lost 7% this week - its worst such fall since the pandemic-fuelled selloff in March 2020. 
It has lost more than 6% since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last week with Europe's dependence on Russia for energy as well as its proximity to the conflict hitting it more than other parts of the globe. Asia has lost more than 4% since then, while Wall Street indexes have made up losses with the S&P 500 up close to 2%.
There was global alarm when Russian forces seized the largest nuclear power plant in Europe after a building at the complex in Ukraine was set ablaze.
""The possibility that there could be a nuclear disaster, was almost incomprehensible, and this sort of brings it home,"" said Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell. 
""The fallout is going to be with companies and investors for years to come.""
Safe-haven gold and bond prices jumped as investor nerves ran high, with a measure of volatility in euro zone stocks hitting 45 points for the first time since June 2020. 
Euro zone banks tumbled 7.9% as government bond yields fell, with soaring commodity prices, triggered by Western sanctions against Russia - a top commodity exporter, raising concerns about runaway inflation and slowing economic growth.
The auto-heavy German DAX closed down 4.4% to over one-year lows as carmakers tumbled 5.6%, to be among the worst performers this week among European sectors.
""No one buys a new car when commodity prices are going through the roof,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. ""Their sales and margins are going to be significantly lower. Consumer disposable income is going to take a significant hit because of higher food and gas prices.""
Among other regional indexes, France's CAC 40 dropped 5.0%, Italy's FTSE MIB sank 6.2% and UK's FTSE 100 slid 3.5%.

Dutch bank ING dropped 9.7% after it said that about 700 million euros ($771 million) in outstanding loans were affected by ""new sanctions on (Russian) specific entities and individuals"".
 Michelin  (PA:MICP) dropped 7.2% after the French tyre maker said it would temporarily halt production at some of its plants in Europe due to logistical issues.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) on Monday issued permits to self-driving units of General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc to allow for passenger service in autonomous vehicles with safety drivers present.
CPUC said the GM unit Cruise and Alphabet's Waymo are under Drivered Deployment permits authorized to collect fares from passengers and may offer shared rides. Prior to the announcement Cruise and Waymo had been permitted to provide passenger service only on a testing basis with no fare collection permitted.
Starting Monday, Cruise is allowed to provide the ""Drivered Deployment"" service on some public roads in San Francisco between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. at speeds of up to 30 miles per hour, while Waymo can offer service in parts of San Francisco and San Mateo counties at speeds of up to 65 miles per hour, CPUC said. Neither company is allowed to operate during heavy fog or heavy rain.
Earlier this month, GM and Cruise petitioned U.S. regulators for permission to deploy a limited number of self-driving vehicles without human controls like steering wheels or brake pedals.
Waymo on Monday said it would use what it has learned operating its autonomous commercial ride hail service in Arizona and apply it ""to our growing service in San Francisco.""
Waymo said it has tens of thousands of riders on a waitlst in California after it launched a tester program in August. ""We’ll begin offering paid trips through the program in the coming weeks,"" the company said.

Prashanthi Raman, Cruise's vice president for global government affairs, said in a statement the announcement was ""another positive incremental step forward. Our mission has always been to launch a driverless commercial ridehail service here in San Francisco, and that’s what we’ll continue working with our regulators to deliver.""
Cruise has not received a response from the CPUC on its request for a driverless deployment permit.

Workers at meat plants have alleged that their employers conspired to exchange compensation data to hold down employee wages.
According to WSJ, plaintiffs in a case in Maryland federal court allege industry officials used data exchanges and annual events to compare staff benefits.
The meat industry has been fighting surging costs for more than a year, which is what they cite to defend higher prices and shortages.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday said it ordered venture capital fund Alumni Ventures Group LLC (AVG) to repay $4.7 million to affected funds and pay a $700,000 penalty for making misleading fee statements and breaching operating agreements.
Without admitting or denying the allegations by the Wall Street regulator, the New Hampshire-based fund will pay the penalty and its chief executive, Michael Collins, agreed to pay a $100,000 fine, the SEC said in its order.
Friday's charges allege that while AVG's marketing communications represented that it had an ""industry standard"" management fee, the representations ""led some investors to believe that AVG would collect a two-percent management fee during each year of its funds’ 10-year term, and separately collect a 20-percent performance fee.""
Instead, AVG’s typical practice was to assess management fees totaling 20 percent of an investor’s fund investment, which represented ten years of two-percent annual management fees.
The charges come as the Democratic-led SEC has stepped up scrutiny around private funds, including a measure meant to boost the disclosures of fees charged to investors.

“Venture capital fund advisers, like all advisers to funds, must accurately describe their fees and abide by the funds’ agreements,” said Adam Aderton, who co-leads the enforcement division's agency's asset management unit.
“When appropriate, enforcement actions like this one hold firms accountable when they fail to meet these obligations.”

Investing.com -- Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has received authorization to initiate commercial production at its new factory in Berlin, according to local German officials. 
The factory will be Tesla's first gigafactory in Europe. However, previously, there were months of delays in gaining approval for the plant in Brandenburg.
Tesla is expected to begin vehicle production in 2021, but various issues such as the pandemic, supply chain challenges, and legal and administrative difficulties with environmentalists halted progress.
Locals and environmentalists did everything they could to stand in the way of the plant, with complaints about destroying the natural habitat and raising concerns regarding the factory's water demand as the area suffered droughts in recent years.
The plant, located southeast of Berlin, is expected to produce 500,000 vehicles a year.
In a press conference, Brandenburg officials called the approval a success.
However, according to a report from CNBC, the approval doesn't mean Tesla is able to begin production immediately. According to the report, it is subject to a public objection period and other final inspection conditions. 
Tesla shares are down around 1% Friday."

Investing.com – Sweetgreen, Inc. (NYSE:SG) stock soared 17% Friday after the salad chain easily surpassed fourth quarter estimates for revenue, driven by consumer appetite for greens and healthy eating in a post-pandemic world.
Total revenue in the fourth quarter climbed 63% to top $96 million, aided by same-store sales change of 36% and 35 net new restaurant openings.
Higher footfalls at existing outlets and prices hikes contributed to the sales jump, according to the company.
The company terminated its loyalty program, a move that boosted margins. At restaurant level, profit margin improved to 13%.  Sweetgreen  said scheduling of staff is now more efficient and that’s helping the margins too, which are partially offset by higher wages in a tight labor market.
Net loss jumped more than 50% to over $66 million, owing to stock-based compensation and higher other expenses owing to its public debut in November. Loss was also wider than expected.
In the current year, the company expects to open 35 new restaurants on a net basis with revenue coming in at $525 million at the center of its guidance range. Revenue in the year ended December 26 was $340 million.
Sweetgreen said it’s a long-term focused company and plans on only giving annual guidance. However, as a one-time exception, it issued quarterly guidance, too. Revenue in the first quarter is seen at $101 million at the center of its guidance range."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As the United States and Western allies grapple with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration is taking a unique approach to fighting a surge in Russian disinformation and propaganda. 
Unlike its European allies, the White House is not directly pushing the giant U.S.-based tech and social media companies that control the flow of information to billions of people to take down disinformation or accounts that spread it, administration sources with direct knowledge of the matter say. 
U.S. officials are instead focusing on calling out pro-Russian media outlets for spreading disinformation, rapidly sharing intelligence about Russia's military moves and propaganda, and exposing what it calls Moscow's plans to stage ""false flag"" attacks designed to provoke sentiment against Ukraine.
""We are proactively putting out information on the intelligence we have gathered, what we are seeing, debunking claims that are false, making sure our allies and partners have the right information,"" one such source said. ""The idea is to counter Russia's narratives and make people understand that things being pushed to them is disinformation."" 
That is an extension of a strategy of releasing to the public U.S. intelligence information about the Russian military build up near Ukraine before the invasion. 
""Preempting what the Russians were doing and pointing things out and being bold in the way the administration revealed intelligence was very valuable,"" said Brian Murphy, former head of the Department of Homeland Security's intelligence branch, and now vice president for strategic operations at Logically, a firm that offers services to reduce the spread of disinformation.
A White House National Security Council (NSC) spokesperson said the administration is ""extremely careful"" with what it declassifies but ""there is value to the public"" in exposing disinformation operations. 
Tech platforms like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have become virtual battlegrounds during the Russian invasion, as Kremlin-backed media publish information that often contradicts reporting from fact-based news outlets on the ground in Ukraine. 
Facebook owner Meta has blocked Russian state media outlets from users' feeds in Europe, under pressure from EU officials. Twitter and other social media are being restricted in Russia, and the tech companies face further punitive measures there. Several tech giants are also restricting Russian state media from making profits from ads on their platforms, and Meta is demoting posts from Kremlin-related outlets. 
The Biden administration has identified outlets that are publishing information it believes to be Russian propaganda through accounts with millions of followers, but has not pressured tech companies to block or remove them. 
For example, conservative financial news website ZeroHedge, was named last month by U.S. intelligence as one such vehicle. The outlet is still tweeting information to over one million followers.
The account doesn't violate Twitter's rules of service, the tech company says - and the White House is not pushing for a ban, sources say. That would raise questions about American press freedom, free speech issues and could start a fight with the tech giants that the administration does not want. 
The White House also views Russian disinformation differently, sources said, than for instance, the spread of vaccine misinformation, which was killing Americans and pushed Biden to fight social media companies, albeit briefly.
In this instance, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the FBI are working with the NSC to stop Moscow from peddling false narratives about Ukraine, the sources said. 
The State Department's Global Engagement Center (GEC) has been sharing information with U.S. agencies and foreign governments about Russian disinformation on social media, news outlets, and Russian proxy websites, a State Department official told Reuters. 
GEC has been in regular contact with social media companies, ""who have updated the department on their actions to cease monetizing sanctioned Russian individuals on their platforms,"" the official said. 
While GEC does not request the removal or labeling of content it shares its analyses with the platforms to identify and counter Russian disinformation.
WORKING IN AMERICA, BUT NOT RUSSIA 
So far, the approach has been effective in the United States and Europe, experts say, but not in Russia where the Kremlin has tight control over the media. 
""Russian propaganda did not quite take off inside the United States in this instance...because of some of the work the Biden administration has been doing,"" said Larissa Doroshenko, a researcher at Northeastern University.
But, she added, ""it wasn't as effective in Russia obviously because of how thick the propaganda from the Kremlin is.""
The situation highlights the asymmetric battle democratic governments face against autocracies in information wars. Beijing and the Kremlin regularly demand local news and social media companies censor information they consider critical of the government, or that runs contrary to the official point of view. 
Last month, the United States alleged Russia has been preparing to fabricate a pretext for an invasion of Ukraine by creating a very graphic propaganda video that would depict a fake attack by Ukraine against Russia.
That video has not surfaced, because, U.S. officials believe, they pre-empted it. 
The Kremlin and pro-Moscow news outlets have accused Kiev on television and social media of carrying out bombings and other non-existent attacks and warned of an alleged attempt by Ukrainian saboteurs to blow up a chemical storage facility in eastern Ukraine. 
Russian reports accuse Ukraine of plotting a genocide against ethnic Russians and the United States of using proxy forces to plot a chemical attack - examples Biden called ""outlandish and baseless claims"" in a Feb. 22 speech. 

The proactive U.S. moves represent an advance from 2016 when officials in the Obama administration, some of whom now work for Biden, and U.S. intelligence agencies failed to identify and stop Russia from launching a disinformation campaign and interfering with the U.S. elections.
Back then, Russian trolls used a large network of fake accounts to spread incendiary political content to millions of Americans, took advantage of existing divisions in American society and sowed doubt about the election process.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets were lower again in early trading on Friday as fears of tighter sanctions on Russia - and the consequent disruption of global energy and food markets - outweighed a broadly positive jobs report for February. 
Commodity prices are set for their biggest weekly gain since the 1960s as prices for everything from crude oil and natural gas to wheat, aluminum and nickel have skyrocketed in response to growing expectations that the West will close the current loophole in its sanctions packages. 
Calls for a tightening of sanctions have multiplied as Russia's attacks on Ukrainian cities have intensified this week. They grew louder still after Russian shelling caused a fire at Europe's largest nuclear power plant late on Thursday. The plant has now been captured and the blaze - which never seriously threatened the plant's reactor buildings - has been brought under control.
By 10:10 AM ET (1510 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 485 points, or 1.4% at 33,309 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.6%. 
Higher global energy and food prices, if sustained, typically lead to sharp slowdowns in global growth, which would hurt multinational U.S. companies disproportionately. The domestic economy, however, still appears to be in robust health, having added 678,000 nonfarm jobs in February, far more than the 400,000 expected. The unemployment rate fell to 3.8%, its lowest since the start of the pandemic, while higher wages appeared to be drawing more workers back into the labor force: The participation rate rose to 62.3%. 
There were also signs that inflationary pressures emanating from the labor market may be subsiding a little, a trend that, if confirmed, would reduce the need for aggressive monetary policy tightening later this year. Average hourly earnings growth slowed to 5.1% on the year from a downwardly revised 5.5%. 
Among early movers, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock stood out from the crowd with a rise of 0.6% after winning conditional approval to start production at its new factory outside Berlin in Germany. Oil and gas stocks also stood out as crude prices roared higher in response to the announcement of fresh sanctions on the Russian refining sector. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock rose 7.0%, while  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rose 1.4% and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock rose 2.1%. 
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock also stood out with a 2.4% rise after well-received earnings on Thursday, but the majority of moves were downward. Airline stocks fared particularly badly, with United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock falling over 7% and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) falling 5.4% on a combination of fears about higher fuel costs and disruptions to long-haul services from the closure of Russian airspace. 
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock fell 2.0%, as the software giant announced that it would halt all new sales in Russia, joining a growing list of essential Western suppliers of goods and services to limit their activities in the country.  Elsewhere, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock fell 3.6%, although its disappointing guidance, which warned of product shortages and rising input costs, was made to seem less exceptional by the broader market move."

Major luxury brands have raised prices throughout the coronavirus emergency to protect margins and, more recently, to counter rising costs of transport, logistics and raw materials. But Chanel has been more aggressive than rivals, in a move that analysts say also aims to increase the exclusivity of the brand.
Its small classic handbag cost 7,750 euros ($8,454) on Chanel's French website on Friday, 6% more than in November last year. The same bag sold for 5,500 euros in January 2021 and 4,550 euros in November 2019. 
According to analysts at Jefferies, Chanel has hiked prices of its iconic handbags by an average of 71% since before the pandemic. In Hong Kong, the small classic handbag now costs 96% more than at the end of 2019.
Chanel said in a statement: ""What has been implemented yesterday is not a price increase, but a harmonisation of the prices of our entire in-store offer, a principle we have been applying since 2015 and which aims to avoid excessive price disparities between the markets where we are present.""
A spokesperson confirmed that prices on its core handbags and accessories and seasonal ready-to-wear rose on Thursday by 6% per cent in the euro zone, 5% in Britain, 5% in South Korea, 8% in Japan and 2% in Hong Kong. Prices remained unchanged in China and the United States. 

Jefferies said the price differential for Chanel handbags between China - where prices remained unchanged - and Europe had fallen below 10% after Thursday's price move, compared to 30-40% for most luxury brands.

The newly adopted sanctions come into effect Friday at 6pm Zurich time, Economics Minister Guy Parmelin told reporters in the Swiss capital Bern.  
The country made the decision to follow through on Monday under pressure form the EU to join in punishing the Kremlin and facing criticism from Swiss opposition politicians. Switzerland said the implementation of these sanctions is compatible with its tradition of neutrality and remains open to hosting peace talks as the need arises.
Swiss steps include sanctions in the financial sector that the EU adopted on March 1, in particular with regard to SWIFT. The government said it will freeze assets of more persons with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, bringing the total number of those sanctioned to over 660. 
Separately, the government has secured the natural gas it needs for this winter and spring but is working to secure it for next winter, said Energy Minister Simonetta Sommaruga. 
Switzerland is considering special protection for Ukrainian refugees to fast-track a right of residence. While it discusses with cantonal governments the so-called S statute which would give Ukrainians a right to live for up to a year in Switzerland, the government has given Ukrainians the right to travel to Switzerland visa-free for up to 90 days, said Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter.

Investing.com – Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) stock jumped 0.4% Friday after the chipmaker projected another quarter of strong sales, pinning its hopes on its traditionally strong segments while new “growth pillars” emerge.
Net revenue in the fourth quarter ended January 29 climbed 68% to $1.34 billion on strong contributions from cloud, 5G, and auto segments which together represented 40% of total revenue. The company is also expecting strong growth from the enterprise networking end market as more corporates embrace a flexible, hybrid model. Quarterly revenue in the segment jumped 64%.
Marvell designs and makes chips that go into data centers and vehicles. It also gives designs to companies like Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) for making chips.
The company expects its current quarter revenue to be $1.42 billion with a variation of plus/minus 3%. Adjusted gross margin is seen at 65-66%.
Adjusted profit per share in the fourth quarter was 50 cents.
The gains in the stock came in even as several brokerages cut their price target after the fourth quarter results announcement.
Summit Insights analyst Kinngai Chan downgraded the chipmaker’s shares to ‘hold’ on expectations industry demand will normalize in the second half of the year, according to StreetInsider.
“While our checks also indicate Marvell’s new design wins will carry a higher ASP as well as a higher gross margin compared to its existing designs, we think most of the upside is now priced-in,” Chan said in a client note. ASP refers to average selling price.
The lowest price target came in from  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), which sees the stock at $70 against its previous peg of $80.
Among the brokerages cutting the targets were Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), UBS (NYSE:UBS), Rosenblatt, B. Riley (NASDAQ:RILY) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)."

56,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2022 08:41AM ET</span>",Analysis-Chinese brands stay put in Russia for now despite Western exodus,"By Josh Horwitz and Brenda Goh
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese firms are staying put in Russia for the moment despite a growing exodus of Western companies - albeit bracing for growing uncertainty - taking a cue from Beijing's stance of refraining from criticizing Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.
Even as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), fashion chain H&M and many other Western companies have cut or paused business in Russia amid a tide of sanctions and international criticism of President Vladimir Putin's actions, Chinese firms so far have stayed largely silent about their operations in Russia.
The Chinese government, which struck a ""no limits"" partnership accord with Russia just weeks before Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion, has blamed NATO expansion for the crisis and urged talks to resolve the situation. On social media, the Chinese public has shown overwhelming support for Russia's attack, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"".
Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing faced a public backlash in China last week after it announced it would pull out of Russia, with social media users accusing it of succumbing to U.S. pressure on Moscow. It later reversed the decision without giving an explanation.
Lenovo, the world's No. 1 personal computer maker, was also subject to heavy criticism in China when a local Belarusian news outlet reported, without saying where it got the information, that it would cease supplying Russia. Lenovo did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment on the issue.
The relatively small size of the Russian market for Chinese firms would however make it easier for them to change tack and join foreign rivals in departing, especially as Moscow faces economic collapse due to growing Western sanctions. 
""For most Chinese companies, Russia is just too small of a market for the business to be worth the risk of getting cut off from developed markets or being sanctioned itself,"" wrote Dan Wang, an analyst for Gavenkal Dragonomics, in a research note. 
Russia's smartphone market, for example, totalled 31 million units last year, or just one-tenth of China's domestic market size by comparison, according to research firm IDC. 
PAUSING FOR ASSESSMENT
By opting to stay in Russia, Chinese companies may be in a position to grab market share. But how long more they will be able to sell there for is a big question, given escalating sanctions and export curbs, analysts said.
In the realm of smartphones, Chinese brands such as Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) and Honor vie with market leader Samsung (KS:005930) and Apple for sales in Russia, while Chinese automakers such as Great Wall Motor and BYD have also targeted the Russian market in recent years. 
These Chinese smartphone makers use chips designed at least partially with U.S.-origin technology. 
This potentially subjects them to secondary sanctions against Russia via the Foreign Direct Product Rule, which stipulates that products with a certain percentage of U.S.-origin technology cannot be shipped to targeted parties without a proper license.
Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), two companies that produce critical technologies such as chips and networking gear, are themselves subject to U.S. restrictions, and also rely on overseas technologies to produce final goods.
""Chinese companies will have to make intuitive and technical judgments on the likelihood that the products they’re manufacturing and their related inputs and plants are captured by these complex regulations,"" said Nathan Bush, who practices trade and antitrust law at DLA Piper in Singapore.
He said Chinese firms are likely pausing to assess their supply chain's vulnerability given the ""devilishly complicated"" nature of the foreign direct product rules.
Xiaomi and Honor did not respond to requests for comment. Huawei, SMIC, Great Wall and BYD declined to comment. 
At least for now, it appears that China Inc is trying to conduct business as usual in Russia and is ready to bite the bullet. 

On March 2, the day Apple announced it would pull out of Russia and the rouble tumbled against the U.S. dollar, a commentator asked the Instagram account of Xiaomi Russia whether they planned to raise prices. 
""Prices on our official website have not changed,"" Xiaomi Russia replied.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian startup Meesho, which counts Facebook-owner Meta Platforms and SoftBank Group's Vision Fund 2 as its investors, is aiming to go public in early 2023, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The Bengaluru-based social commerce platform is working to be ready for a listing by the end of 2022 and is evaluating both Indian and U.S. exchanges, according to an internal document seen by Reuters.
In September, Meesho raised $570 million at a valuation of $4.9 billion in a Series F funding round led by Fidelity Management & Research Company and B Capital Group.
Resellers on the company's platform offer a variety of unbranded products, ranging from clothes to cosmetics to household appliances, predominantly in the country's smaller towns and cities. 
Users can resell products from the supplier marketplace for a profit margin to customers, largely through Meta-owned platforms WhatsApp, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram.
""Meesho is filing documents by January next year and wants to essentially be done with the IPO by the first half of 2023,"" the source, who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to talk to media, said. 
The company did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Reuters.
Dhiresh Bansal, a former JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) investment banker hired as chief financial officer in November, has been tasked with getting the startup's books in order and plug in any gaps in finances, the source added.
Meesho had 17.8 million monthly transacting users on its platform as of September https://medium.com/meesho-tech/a-570m-fundraise-to-fuel-bharats-e-commerce-dreams-1bfc754ce7fe, surging from 5.5 million in March.
Indian technology startups listed on the domestic bourses to mixed reception in 2021. While food delivery firm Zomato and cosmetics-to-fashion retailer Nykaa had blockbuster listings, digital payments app Paytm crashed on debut.
Founded in 2015 by Indian Institute of Technology graduates Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Barnwal, Meesho also provides logistics and payment tools to sellers.
Facebook's investment in Meesho in June 2019 was the Silicon Valley giant's first equity investment https://meesho.io in an Indian startup.

The current chief compliance officer, Mary McNiff, will remain in the role until later this year when she will take another job at Citi, according to the memo sent by Chief Executive Jane Fraser to employees on Friday and seen by Reuters.
Federal regulators in October 2020 directed Citigroup to pay a $400 million fine and fix persistent risk management and operational problems that have led to multiple violations and penalties over the years. Among the requirements was setting a timeline for transferring its compliance functions to its general counsel from its chief executive.
The reason for requiring the transfer was not spelled out, but some governance experts say that compliance staff should have independence from executives who might benefit from short-cutting.
This past October, Citigroup named a new general counsel, Brent McIntosh. McNiff will now report to McIntosh until she changes jobs. She had been named compliance chief in June 2020.
Citigroup executives have said that resolving the regulatory orders is a top priority and is driving a multi-billion dollar push to overhaul its information systems and processes. They have declined to estimate how much more time and money will be required to satisfy regulators.

The memo from Fraser also said that Jessica Roos, who became Citi's chief auditor in April 2019, is becoming the head of a new business services office created to accelerate the drive to link and simplify the bank's data, processes and controls.
Roos will be succeeded by Nadir Darrah, who was recently chief auditor of the bank's primary subsidiary. He joined Citi in 2015.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Geopolitics and technology intertwined at the Mobile World Congress this week as more than 61,000 people gathered in the Spanish city of Barcelona even as Russia's invasion of Ukraine overshadowed one of the pandemic's most-attended conferences.
GSMA, the organiser of the telecoms industry's four-day biggest annual gathering, condemned Moscow's actions and barred the Russian pavilion.
Before the start of the congress, it had said a handful of Russian firms and people would be banned because of sanctions, but declined to specify how many did not come beyond saying the impact was minimal.
In-person conferences worldwide came to a halt at the start of the pandemic and are only slowing picking up again. Last year's MWC only drew about 20,000 attendees, a far cry from 110,000 in 2019. Other events such as CES in Las Vegas attracted around 45,000 attendees earlier this year, down from 200,000 before the pandemic.
The number of attendees at this year's MWC exceeded expectations. 
""I think the level of enthusiasm has never been greater, the need of having this show has never been greater,"" Mats Granryd, director general of organizer GSMA told Reuters.
He said the pandemic has made people appreciate the benefits of socialising at large conferences, visible in packed networking terraces across the sprawling congress grounds.
Top executives of companies from more than 100 countries took the stage to condemn Russia's invasion, announce a halt to their Russia operations and detail support for local employees.
Software publisher Kaspersky Labs was one of the Russian companies present, while Ukraine's biggest mobile operator Veon was also there.

Some attendees wore ribbons in Ukraine's national colours, handed out by protesters who gathered at the entrance holding a sign that read ""Cut Russia off, no tech for aggressor"".
But on the crowded floors of the event, telecom buzzwords such as 5G and edge computing were still the most-discussed topics.

Panasonic is looking at building the factory, to cost several billion dollars, in either Oklahoma or Kansas close to Texas, where Tesla is preparing a new EV plant, NHK reported. NHK gave no timeline for Panasonic's U.S. project.
NHK did not cite the source of its information. Panasonic said the reported plan was not something it announced.
A long-time supplier for Tesla, Panasonic has said it plans to begin mass-producing the new type of lithium-ion battery for Tesla before the end of March 2024 with two new production lines at its western Japanese plant in Wakayama.
The 4680 format (46 millimetres wide and 80 millimetres tall) battery is about five times bigger than those currently supplied to Tesla, meaning the U.S. car maker will be able to lower production costs and improve vehicle range.
Panasonic's relationship with Tesla stretches back more than a decade when Tesla signed an agreement that made the Japanese company its key battery supplier.
Since then, Tesla has ramped up production and diversified its supply chain to other firms, including Chinese manufacturers of cheaper lithium iron phosphate (LFP) powerpacks such as Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (CATL). 

South Korea LG Energy Solution Ltd also plans to make 4680 batteries, sources told Reuters last year. 
Shares of Panasonic were down 3% in morning trade in Tokyo compared with a 2.5% decline for the broader Nikkei 225 index.

Investing.com –  Smith & Wesson  (NASDAQ:SWBI) stock tumbled 19% in premarket Friday as market for guns and firearms cooled off “significantly” in the quarter through January.
Net sales plunged 31% to $178 million as the market retreated from the height of the pandemic surge, and according to President and CEO Mark Smith, “Seems to now be following pre-pandemic historical demand patterns.”
Brokerage Craig-Hallum cut the target for the stock to $17 from $25 earlier, according to StreetInsider. The stock closed at $17.89 Thursday.
Margins shrank, too. Also, thanks to expenses incurred on the relocation of the company’s headquarters to Maryville, Tennessee from Springfield, Massachusetts as a proposed law in Massachusetts sought to prohibit the company from manufacturing certain firearms that contributed as much as 60% to the company’s revenue in the last financial year.
Last year, Iowa, Tennessee, and Wyoming joined the list of states that allow those 21 and older to carry handguns without a permit. Even before that, Tennessee ranked as one of the most violent states in the U.S.
Net profit in the third quarter nearly halved to $33 million on an adjusted basis. Both sales and earnings were below estimates.
According to the company, the demand surge that began in March 2020 generated enough cash for it to become debt-free and buy back $200 million of stocks besides paying dividends and making investments in the business. After all that, it still was left with $107 million in cash, the company said.

""Only bookings for foodstuff, medicines and humanitarian supplies (except dual use) will be accepted after extensive screening,"" Maersk said in a statement.
Denmark-based Maersk added that it would be unable to receive payments from or make payments to any bank that is under sanctions imposed on Russia.
Belarus is a close ally of Russia and some Russian forces that entered Ukraine came from Belarusian territory for what Russia has called a ""special military operation"".
Maersk and other major container lines this week suspended almost all cargo shipments to and from Russia, and have warned that foodstuffs and medical supplies risk being damaged or spoiled due to significant delays at ports and customs.
The European Union on Wednesday approved new sanctions against Belarus for its role in the invasion, effectively banning about 70% of all imports from that country, and on Friday suspended cooperation and research programmes.
Sweden's IKEA and Swiss engineering and automation group ABB have also halted their Belarus operations.
Maersk said it had also temporarily suspended new intercontinental rail bookings between Asia and Europe until further notice.

""If you have cargo currently in transit or have completed a booking before this suspension was announced, we will do our utmost to get it delivered to its intended destination across the normal routes,"" the company said.
All new air bookings to and from Russia and Ukraine have also been suspended, Maersk added.

66,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2022 07:26AM ET</span>",Dassault CEO frustrated over fighter talks with Airbus,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) -Dassault Aviation voiced frustration over a dispute with partner Airbus about the next phase of work on the European FCAS fighter project and said it was important to establish clear leadership.
The Future Combat Air System (FCAS), which has been dogged by political and corporate differences, has been designed to replace the Eurofighter and Dassault’s Rafale with a combination of manned and unmanned aircraft from 2040. The project's main government backers are France, Germany and Spain.
""I accept to be leader if I have the leverage to be leader,"" Chief Executive Eric Trappier said, referring to Dassault's responsibility for the core fighter element of the design.
Dassault and Airbus have been at odds over responsibility for flight controls, but Trappier said Dassault was prepared to share some of the work as long as it was free to run the first of seven project 'pillars' - involving the aircraft - as agreed.
""We have made enough efforts,"" Trappier said, adding talks had been 'difficult' in the face of new demands since September.
Airbus did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Some defence analysts have speculated that differences over FCAS could sink the project and reshuffle industry alliances. 
Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said last month, ""we continue to work with our industrial partners with the objective to move on to the next development phase later in the year"".
Announcing results earlier on Friday, Dassault said it was targeting agreement on the next stage of the FCAS project, known as phase 1B, before end-year. Trappier said the process had dragged on ""in my opinion for too long"".
GERMAN SPENDING
Trappier told a news conference that Dassault, which built France's Rafale alone after Paris pulled out of the Eurofighter programme in the 1980s, had benefited from developing its flight controls hand-in-hand with the warplane itself.
He acknowledged Airbus' reputation for advanced flight controls for its jetliners but noted its design bureau was based in France, rather than at its defence factory near Munich.
Airbus represents Germany and Spain in the project so its work on the fighter needs to be handled by those countries.
Because it represents two nations, Airbus will have industrial responsibility for two thirds of FCAS, while Dassault will have one third.
Trappier contrasted splits over FCAS with an agreement last week to launch an Airbus-led Franco-German-Italian 'Eurodrone,' whose flight controls will be built by Dassault. 
The French CEO meanwhile raised concerns over Germany's tentative decision to seek American F-35 warplanes.
Germany could purchase U.S. F-35 fighter jets built by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) to replace its ageing Tornado, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Sunday.

The move involves a more pressing schedule and different role compared to the broader FCAS project, but Trappier said others were watching Berlin following the historic policy shift.
""If the first decision after raising the (German defence) budget to 100 billion euros...is to buy the F-5 F-35 that is going to cool our feelings of support in that type of area,"" he said.

Europe's economy is the most vulnerable to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and investors have ramped up selling of the single currency this week as the outlook for the economy darkened.
Against the Swiss franc, the euro fell 0.7%, taking its losses to more than 3% this week. That puts it on track for the biggest weekly drop since January 2015.
It was last trading at 1.008 francs per euro.

The euro weakened 0.8% against the dollar, falling below $1.10 for the first time since May 2020. It is down more than 2.6% this week and on track for its biggest loss since April 2020.
A huge blaze at the site of Europe's biggest nuclear power station was extinguished on Friday, and officials said the plant in southeastern Ukraine was operating normally after it was seized by Russian forces in fighting that caused global alarm.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - RWE on Friday said one of its long-term gas contracts with a Russian supplier was dormant, limiting the exposure for Germany's largest power producer in case supplies are disrupted as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
Shares in German gas suppliers have been hit on fears they could be forced to buy the fuel at much higher prices on the spot market to honour their contracts if supply from Russia is suspended or reduced.
RWE, which has long-term gas contracts with Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), told Reuters that because the contract was on hold it posed no risk to the company, comments that led its shares to extend gains and rise as much as 6.1%.
RWE, which along with Uniper is one of the main German importers of Russian gas, also said it had in total contracted a maximum of 15 terawatt hours (TWh) of gas deliveries from Russia by 2023.
Half of that is to be provided within the next 12 months, it added.
Bernstein, in a note to clients, said this was significantly below its own 50 TWh estimate. ""Therefore, the impact from say a 20% loss of volumes is under 300 million euros ($329 million), significantly below our estimate of 1.8 billion euros,"" the brokerage said.

RWE did not provide any further details, including the identity of the supplier.

Investing.com – Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) stock was up 2% premarket reacting to a report Friday in The Wall Street Journal that Hellman & Friedman has taken a 7.5% stake worth about $1.4 billion in the software firm.
The stock was up about 2% after WSJ said the private equity firm’s first purchases of the stock happened in mid-late December when several quarters of disappointing results led to the departure of its CEO and a slump in its market cap.
According to the paper, the stake would make Hellman & Friedman the largest active shareholder of Splunk, a nearly $20 billion market cap company. Silver Lake, a PE focused on technology firms, is also a Splunk shareholder.
Demand for security software that firms like Splunk offer have boomed in the pandemic as companies went hybrid and a need for securing remote-placed systems surged.
Last month, according to another report in WSJ, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) had made a takeover offer worth more than $20 billion for Splunk. The deal didn’t materialize.
The bid had stalled by then and the hiring of a new CEO suggests Splunk plans to go it alone at least for now.
Splunk has a new CEO in Gary Steele. Steele was the CEO of Portera before he founded his own firm Proofpoint (NASDAQ:PFPT), an information security company that PE firm Thoma Bravo bought last year. He has also held various leadership roles at Sybase, Sun Microsystems, and Hewlett-Packard."

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Friday after Russian troops bombarded and then captured Ukraine’s largest nuclear power station, intensifying the conflict ahead of the release of key U.S. employment data.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 300 points, or 0.9%, S&P 500 Futures traded 37 points, or 0.9%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 105 points, or 0.8%.
The main Wall Street indices have been roiled over the last week following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The conflict shows few signs of abating with Russian forces shelling key civilian infrastructures, including in Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv in the northeast.
In a new development Friday, Russian forces seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, after setting parts of the complex ablaze during an intense bombardment.
Fears of an environmental disaster have largely been allayed, as U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said there were no indications of elevated radiation levels at the plant. But the plant provides more than a fifth of total electricity generated in Ukraine and its capture adds to worries the conflict will cause a massive disruption to global energy supplies.
Away from eastern Europe, the main focus Friday will be on the closely watched monthly U.S. jobs report, which is expected to show continued strengthening in the labor market for February.
The data are released at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT) and are expected to show a rise of 400,000 payrolls, with the unemployment rate falling to 3.9% and growth in average hourly earnings dropping to 0.5% for the month.

73,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2022 06:36AM ET</span>",Sacklers to pay $6 billion to settle Purdue opioid lawsuits,"By Dietrich Knauth, Jonathan Stempel and Tom Hals
(Reuters) - The Sackler family owners of Purdue Pharma LP reached a deal with a group of attorneys general to pay up to $6 billion in cash to resolve widespread litigation alleging that they fueled the U.S. opioid epidemic, bringing the OxyContin maker closer to exiting bankruptcy. 
The attorneys general for eight states and the District of Columbia, who had blocked a previous settlement that included a $4.3 billion cash payment, announced the deal after weeks of mediation with the Sacklers.
The family agreed to pay at least $5.5 billion in cash, which will be used for abating a crisis that has led to nearly 500,000 U.S. opioid overdose deaths over two decades. 
The value of the deal could grow as the family members sell additional assets.
The Sackler family owners said in a statement that they ""sincerely regret"" that OxyContin ""unexpectedly became part of an opioid crisis."" 
The family members said they acted lawfully but a settlement was by far the best way to help resolve a ""serious and complex public health crisis."" 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain must approve the deal, which protects the Sacklers from civil lawsuits. Purdue requested a March 9 hearing for Drain to review the agreement.
Purdue said on Thursday that the new settlement would provide additional funding for opioid abatement programs, overdose rescue medicines, and victims, while putting the company on track to resolve its bankruptcy case on ""an expedited schedule.""
When the bankruptcy plan takes effect, Purdue Pharma will cease to exist. It will emerge as a new company, Knoa Pharma LLC, owned by the National Opioid Abatement Trust, an entity controlled by creditors of Purdue.
Opioid overdose deaths soared to a record during the COVID-19 pandemic, including from the powerful synthetic painkiller fentanyl, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. 
The Sacklers' agreement follows an announcement on Friday by the three largest U.S. drug distributors and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) that they would finalize a $26 billion plan to settle allegations over their role in the opioid crisis.
Purdue filed for bankruptcy in 2019 in the face of thousands of lawsuits accusing it and members of the Sackler family of fueling the opioid epidemic through deceptive marketing of its highly addictive pain medicine.
The company pleaded guilty to misbranding and fraud charges related to its marketing of OxyContin in 2007 and 2020. Members of the Sackler family have denied wrongdoing.
The new deal was announced over two months after U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon overturned the earlier settlement, which contained sweeping legal protections for the Sacklers from future opioid-related litigation.
Eight states, Washington D.C. and the U.S. Department of Justice’s bankruptcy watchdog said at the time that the Sacklers should not be afforded such protections since they did not file for bankruptcy themselves. 
While bankruptcy judges have increasingly granted such releases over the years when approving a reorganization plan, McMahon ruled that the bankruptcy court did not have that legal authority.
As part of the new deal, the holdout states and D.C. agreed to drop their opposition to the protections.
SERVING JUSTICE
Connecticut's William Tong, one of the attorneys general who agreed to the settlement, said he recognized its limits.
""No one is under any illusion this solves all the problems we're facing,"" Tong said at a news conference. 
Tong and the mediator urged Drain to allow victims of the opioid epidemic to address the court when the judge considers approving the settlement and to order the Sackler family members to attend.

The mediator, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman, said in a court filing it was her ""heartfelt belief"" that doing so would ""serve the ends of justice.""
Under Thursday's settlement, $276 million of the increased Sackler contribution will be dedicated to the eight states that had opposed the prior deal and the District of Columbia.

Investing.com – Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock fell 2% in premarket Friday as traders focused on the slowdown in February sales, ignoring its second quarter performance that beat estimates.
Costco also continues to warn of container delays, higher labor and freight costs, and chip shortages, all of which are hampering deliveries.
Same-store sales growth in the four weeks ended February 27 slowed to 10.6% on an adjusted basis from 10.8% in the four weeks ended January 30. Those numbers were surprising as they accompanied the quarterly disclosures that revealed an over 11% growth in comparable sales in the 12 weeks ended February 13, reflecting that higher prices of food and groceries are beginning to bite.
Costco relies on consumers looking for bargains while they do bulk shopping, a habit that got further boost in the pandemic. It was expected to weaken with the reopening of offices, but trends at retailers like Kroger (NYSE:KR) indicate people are still stocking up more than usual, preferring to eat home-made food.
While the elevated level of shopping undergoes adjustments in the post-pandemic world, record-high inflation is finally hurting pockets even as supply chain issues linger.
“Despite all the supply chain issues, we're staying in stock and continue to work to mitigate cost and price increases as best we can,"" Reuters quoted Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti as saying.
Second quarter adjusted earnings per share were $2.92 cents on net sales of $51 billion, up 16%. Both earnings and sales beat estimates."

Investing.com – Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock traded 2.8% higher premarket after the company promised another strong quarter, banking on demand from enterprise, and cloud clients for its semiconductors and infrastructure software solutions.
""Enterprise spending is on fire ... and we are seeing a big part of that,"" Reuters quoted President and CEO Hock Tan as telling analysts.
Net revenue in the first quarter ended January 30 grew 16% to a record $7.7 billion and the company projects this to rise to $7.9 billion in the current one, growing on a year-on-year basis as well.
""Broadcom's record first quarter results were driven by strong enterprise demand, and continued investments in next generation technology by hyperscale and service providers,"" Tan said in a statement.
Hyperscalers refers to big spenders on technology, the likes of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Alphabet’s Google uses Broadcom’s networking chips in its data centers and Apple deploys Broadcom chips in iPhones to connect to Wi-Fi networks and peripheral devices. Surging demand for 5G technologies is another growth driver at Broadcom.
The pandemic fueled the demand for mobiles, laptops, and other gadgets and consequently the demand for chips that go into those devices.
Demand for Broadcom’s electronic components was up about 20% last year and is on course for a similar increase in 2022, Bloomberg said. However, Tan expects return of historical rates of about 5%.
“If anyone tells you otherwise, don’t believe it, because it has never happened,” he said.

Looking for ways to support markets hurt by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Western sanctions, authorities are planning to spend the NWF money on buying Russian securities in a move similar to what they did in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea.
The new law allows the rainy day fund to be used to buy stocks and bonds even if its liquid portion drops below 7% of gross domestic product (GDP).
The government is currently only permitted to spend money from the fund when its liquid assets exceed 7% of GDP, but Russian authorities are scrambling to limit the damage done by unprecedented Western sanctions. 
The parliament, called the Duma in Russian, said the eased requirements were part of a set of laws designed to make the Russian economy and households more resilient in the face of sanctions.

As of Feb. 1, the liquid assets of the NWF stood at $112.7 billion, or 8.8 trillion roubles, equal to 6.6% of GDP projected for this year.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.

TORONTO (Reuters) - TD Bank's planned $13.4 billion purchase of First Horizon (NYSE:FHN) Corp would give it access to one of the fastest growing regions in the United States, but some investors expressed concerns about the deal's timing and the target's higher costs.
TD's biggest-ever acquisition, which would make it the sixth-biggest U.S. lender by assets, found support from investors for the constructive use of its C$22 billion ($17.4 billion) of excess capital, the highest among Canadian banks.
But First Horizon's high total expenses compared to peers, TD's own underwhelming lending in the United States and a tougher regulatory environment may pose risks, analysts and investors said.
TD shares are down over 6% since the deal was announced on Monday, a decline compounded by first-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat estimates but were rated below other major Canadian lenders.
The Canadian banks index has lost 1.7% in that time. 
Investors noted that First Horizon had just finished integrating fellow southeast U.S. lender Iberiabank (NASDAQ:IBKC_old) Corp, which it merged with in 2020.
""You're buying a bank that just went through an integration and you're putting it through another one,"" said Steve Belisle of Manulife Investment Management. ""It seems like it was done very quickly... it can lead to disruption."" 
While TD has been prudent on deals, it was ""facing pressure to go out and buy,"" said Bryden Teich of Avenue Investment Management, after it missed out on another U.S. deal to Bank of Montreal in December.
Teich too expressed concern about First Horizon's recent merger, pointing to a commercial real estate loan book that nearly tripled between 2019 and 2020, and consumer property lending that almost doubled. Even so, First Horizon's loan book size remains less than a tenth of TD's total.
""First Horizon is an extremely well-managed premier regional bank with a strong presence in highly attractive markets across the U.S. Southeast,"" TD said in a statement. ""We have a proven track record of successful integrations and have full confidence the same will hold true for this deal.""
HIGHER COSTS
First Horizon also has higher expenses than its typical peers, making it a questionable fit for TD, Christopher Whalen of Whalen Global Advisors said in a research note on Thursday.
First Horizon's fourth-quarter expenses excluding one-time items as a proportion of revenues - the efficiency ratio - was 63.3%, and nearly 71% overall. That compared with 59% for its peer group, according to a report https://www.ffiec.gov/npw/FinancialReport/ReturnFinancialReportPDF?rpt=BHCPR&id=1094640&dt=20210930 from a U.S. regulatory panel. TD's U.S. expenses were 57% of revenues, its first-quarter results showed. 
The majority of First Horizon's loans are tied to short-term rates, which will boost interest income and lower the efficiency ratio when interest rates rise, the bank's Head of Investor Relations Ellen Taylor told Reuters.
Whalen also said TD's lending in the United States was underwhelming. TD's U.S. loans accounted for less than one-third of its total assets there, compared with a peer average of 59%, with much of the rest in debt securities, according to a regulatory report https://www.ffiec.gov/npw/FinancialReport/ReturnFinancialReportPDF?rpt=BHCPR&id=3606542&dt=20210930.
""What is the point of (TD CEO Bharat) Masrani buying more retail deposits if the TD bankers cannot fill the existing balance sheet with quality loans?"" Whalen asked.
TD could also face regulatory challenges following U.S. President Joe Biden's executive order in July tightening rules governing mergers and acquisitions, and due to delays filling a leadership vacancy at a key regulator, Edward Jones Analyst James Shanahan said. 
But TD's assurance it will maintain First Horizon locations, invest in retaining staff and make an additional payment to the target's shareholders if the deal is delayed would curry favour with regulators, said Kingwest & Co Portfolio Manager Anthony Visano.

""We have a very good relationship with the regulator,"" TD Chief Financial Officer Kelvin Tran said in an interview. ""The regulator needs to go through their process.""

(Reuters) - Roman Abramovich will not rush his divestment of English football team Chelsea FC, an adviser on the sale process told Reuters, even as Britain is considering sanctions against the Russian billionaire.
Chelsea FC tapped Joe Ravitch, the co-founder of investment bank Raine Group LLC, to find a buyer after Abramovich decided this week to put the football club he has owned for 19 years up for sale. The move follows Russia's invasion of Ukraine that has triggered an international backlash against businessmen with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces mounting pressure from political opposition as well as members of his own party for Abramovich to be included in sanctions that his government has started rolling out against so-called Russian oligarchs. British officials have said they are considering the move but must build a solid legal case before proceeding.
Ravitch said in an interview that his client would take enough time to strike a balance between securing a fair price and finding the ""best steward"" for Chelsea FC and its supporters.
""We are not going to rush anything. It is very important that Chelsea have the right owner to guide the club forward,"" Ravitch said, adding that he could not publicly discuss details of the sale process. A spokesperson for Abramovich did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Abramovich has instructed his aides to set up a charitable foundation that will receive all net proceeds from the sale of Chelsea FC for the benefit of victims form the war in Ukraine.
People familiar with the matter said Abramovich expects the West London club to fetch more than 3 billion pounds ($4 billion) and that the sale process may run for about a month before a buyer is identified and a deal is agreed.
In a sign that Abramovich won't compromise on his valuation expectations, Chelsea FC rejected an offer of 2.5 billion pounds from an investor last week, one of the sources said, without disclosing that party's identity. Abramovich bought Chelsea FC in 2003 for a reported 140 million pounds. 
Todd Boehly, the U.S. billionaire investor who owns stakes in the baseball club LA Dodgers and the basketball franchise LA Lakers, is putting together a bid for Chelsea FC, the sources said. He is working together with Swiss billionaire businessman Hansjörg Wyss, the sources added. Further details of that offer could not be learned.
A spokesperson for Boehly declined to comment. Wyss did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Chelsea FC wants to ensure that its change of ownership will not be politically controversial in Britain in light of the conflict in Ukraine, so the buyer is unlikely to come from countries including China and Saudi Arabia, the sources added.
BILLIONAIRE SPORTS CLUB
Ravitch, who is fluent in Russian, has spent years building up a global clientele. A U.S. national, he worked with the first president of the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin's government in the 1990s as lawyer for Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, advising on how to draft laws on private property ownership.
Ravitch then spent 16 years with stints in New York, Hong Kong and London as a banker at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), where he helped launch the Yankee Entertainment and Sports Network and create NBA China, before co-founding Raine in 2009 with Jeff Sine, a former senior banker at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). 
At Raine, Ravitch worked on a series of deals for the Football Group, which owns the English football club Manchester City, including its $500 million stake sale to private equity firm Silver Lake last year, and a $400 million stake sale to investors led by China Media Capital in 2015. He also advised  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd vice chairman Joe Tsai on gaining full control of U.S. basketball team Brooklyn Nets in a deal that valued the team at $2.35 billion in 2019. 
Ravitch started to work with Chelsea FC in 2018 on a range of deals, including a stadium investment, media rights and joint ventures in China. 
The Raine Group specializes in media, sports and technology deals and has advised many business moguls including SoftBank Group Corp CEO Masayoshi Son. Raine also has an investment fund business and oversees $4 billion in growth equity and venture capital. It has backed U.S. sports betting firm Draftkings Inc, audio platform SoundCloud and Vice Media, where Ravitch currently sits on the board. 

Abramovich's investment in Chelsea FC in 2003 coincided with the most successful era in the team's history, in which it won five Premier League titles, five FA Cups and the Champions League twice.
The 55-year-old, who has Israeli and Portuguese citizenship, became one of Russia's most powerful businessmen after the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union. Forbes has put his net worth at $13.3 billion.

Public broadcaster NHK said the average payout of about 380,000 yen ($3,290) for each plaintiff covered three class-action lawsuits, among more than 30 against the utility, which are the first to be finalised. 
A massive tsunami unleashed by an earthquake of magnitude 9.0 off Japan's northeastern coast, struck Tepco's Fukushima Daiichi power plant in March 2011, to cause the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.
About 470,000 people were forced to evacuate in the first few days, and tens of thousands have not yet been able to return. 
Friday's decision came as the court rejected an appeal by Tepco and ruled it negligent in taking preventive measures against a tsunami of that size, the broadcaster said. 

The court withheld a verdict on the role of the government, which is also a defendant in the lawsuits, and will hold a hearing next month to rule on its culpability, NHK added. 
Lower courts have split over the extent of the government's responsibility in foreseeing the disaster and ordering steps by Tepco to prevent it.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply lower Friday on the signs of intensifying fight in Ukraine, with an attack on a nuclear plant reinforcing fears of an environmental catastrophe compounding the humanitarian one that is already happening. 
By 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 2.1% lower and the CAC 40 in France dropped 2.2% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 fell 1.6%.
In the latest development, Russian troops have occupied the nuclear plant at Zaporizhzhya in Ukraine after a bombardment that caused an overnight fire, raising fears of a serious environmental incident.
These concerns have been partially eased after U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said there was no indication of elevated radiation levels at the plant, but it prompted U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson to announce he would call for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has set in motion a broader disruption of global energy markets, which can only be exacerbated by the capture of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant. Such a disturbance could severely hurt global growth for years to come, given Moscow’s significance in the production of crude and gas. 
Oil prices edged lower, handing back early gains following the news of the nuclear plant attack, which makes it likelier that Europe and the U.S. will close the loophole in its current sanctions package that allows payment for energy supplies to continue uninterrupted. Russia is the world's biggest energy exporter.
So far, the West has stopped short of targeting Russia's oil and gas exports, but customers are largely steering clear of them anyway due to fears of becoming entangled in the sanctions.
By 3:50 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $107.44 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.7% to $109.70. Both contracts climbed to multi-year highs on Thursday before a sharp pullback.

Dassault Aviation (PA:AM) stock rose 1.3% after the maker of Rafale fighter jets reported a steep rise in annual earnings fuelled by higher deliveries of its warplanes, even as it expected to post lower sales this year than in 2021.
On the economic data front, Eurozone retail sales for January are due later Friday, but the main focus will be on the U.S. monthly employment report which is expected to show another month of strong job growth.
This would provide the Federal Reserve with room to lift interest rates later this month, something Chairman Jerome Powell repeated on Thursday he would back during the second day of his Semiannual testimony to Congress.

86,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2022 03:10AM ET</span>",Dassault Aviation sees lower sales in 2022 after military earnings boost,"(Reuters) -France's Dassault Aviation said on Friday it expected to post lower sales this year than in 2021, as it reported a steep rise in annual earnings fuelled by higher deliveries of its warplanes.
The maker of Rafale fighter jets saw its operating income more than double to 527 million euros ($580.33 million) from 261 million in 2020, while net sales climbed to 7.23 billion euros from 5.49 billion the previous year.
Chief Executive Eric Trappier said 2021 had been an ""exceptional"" year for Dassault's order intake, though the period had been marked by inflation and supply chain disruptions.
Dassault said its order intake jumped to 12.1 billion euros last year, including previously reported orders for 51 Falcon business jets and 49 Rafales, of which 37 were for export. 
Defence intake fuelled the jump, accounting for some 9.2 billion euros of order intake, up from 1.5 billion in 2020.
Dassault had already reported 30 Falcon deliveries in 2021, down from 34 in 2020, and 25 Export Rafales, up from 13.
The group expects to deliver 13 Rafale and 35 Falcon jets in 2022.
Dassault noted that no agreement had yet been reached with Airbus on the next phase, 1B, of the Franco-German-Spanish fighter project known as FCAS.
Dassault's objective is to make a decision on the next-generation manned and unmanned future combat system this year, it added in the results statement.
The value of Dassault's stock has soared by nearly a fifth since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine nine days ago, as investors bet on bigger military budgets and Germany pledged to spend more than 2% of the country's GDP on defence. 
Dassault's shares were up around 2% in early trading in Paris.

The group proposed a dividend of 2.49 euros per share.

Investing.com -- Russia's biggest Internet company warned late on Thursday that it may default on its dollar bonds due to the extended suspension of its common stock and depositary receipts. 
 Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX) operates search, ride-hailing, and e-commerce activities among other things. It is legally domiciled in the Netherlands and listed on Nasdaq but almost all of its operations are based in Russia.
The company warned that investors have the right to redeem its convertible notes, with accrued interest, if its stock stays suspended for five days or more, a threshold which is due to be crossed on Friday. 
There are currently $1.25 billion in such notes outstanding (excluding accrued interest), while the company has less than $400 million in dollar liquidity available. Restrictions imposed over the last two weeks mean that it will be unable to convert its ruble liquidity into dollars.
""The Yandex group as a whole does not currently have sufficient resources to redeem the Notes in full,"" Yandex said in a statement. ""In the event that we were prevented from distributing additional funds from our Russian subsidiaries to our Dutch parent company, Yandex would not have sufficient resources to redeem a majority of the Notes.""
The company said that neither it nor its executives have been targeted directly by sanctions so far, and added that under existing conditions, it can still operate normally for 12 months or more. However, its e-commerce and ride-hailing operations are likely to be distracted by the suspension of services in Russia by Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) this week. The company also admitted that its Market Place unit would be affected by the increasing boycott of Russia by Western companies.
Yandex was worth just under $7 billion when its shares were suspended at the end of February. At its peak in November, it had been worth over $30 billion."

In a statement composed of bullet points and pictures, it did not specify where that 700 million euros is.
It said it has 5.3 billion euros in loans to Russian borrowers, representing 0.9% of its total group loan book.
In Ukraine it said it had 500 million in loans, representing 0.1% of its loan book.

The bank said that moves to cut off some Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system that underpins global payment transactions had ""currently no material effect"" on ING.
ING has wholesale banking operations in Russia with around 400 employees and has around 100 employees in Ukraine, it has said previously.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open sharply lower Friday amid signs the fighting in Ukraine is intensifying, with an attack on a nuclear plant reinforcing fears of an environmental catastrophe compounding the humanitarian one that is already happening. 
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 1.5% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 1.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.8%.
In the latest development, Russia was accused of shelling a Ukrainian nuclear plant at Zaporizhzhya, the biggest in Europe. This move prompted U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson to announce he would call for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council.
U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said there was no indication of elevated radiation levels at the plant, which provides more than a fifth of total electricity generated in Ukraine. Reuters reported that Russian forces had captured the plant.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has set in motion a broader disruption of global energy markets that could severely hurt global growth for years to come, given Moscow’s significance in the production of crude and gas. 
“This is going to be a really big disruption in terms of logistics, and people are going to be scrambling for barrels,” said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit. “This is a supply crisis. It’s a logistics crisis. It’s a payment crisis, and this could well be on the scale of the 1970s.”
Oil prices traded higher Friday on the news of the nuclear plant attack, which makes it likelier that Europe and the U.S. will close the loophole in its current sanctions package that allows payment for energy supplies to continue uninterrupted. Russia is the world's biggest energy exporter.
So far, the West has stopped short of targeting Russia's oil and gas exports, but customers are largely steering clear of them anyway due to fears of becoming entangled in the sanctions.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% higher at $109.22 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.2% to $111.78. Both contracts climbed to multi-year highs on Thursday before a sharp pullback.

92,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2022 01:35AM ET</span>",Stuck but not sweating it: some U.S. investors in Russia not kneejerk-selling,"By Davide Barbuscia
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. investors may be in a rush to dump Russian assets after Western allies hit Moscow with sanctions, but a few fund managers with a relatively small exposure to Russia are avoiding kneejerk decisions amid trading constraints and price dives.
International sanctions have increasingly punished Moscow after the invasion of Ukraine, prompting Russian authorities to ban Russian brokers from selling securities held by foreigners.
While there has been a rush from investors to announce they are trying to extricate themselves from Russian investments, this is complicated by trading halts and the prohibition from Moscow on selling foreign assets.
But some U.S. investors can afford not to panic, as their small exposure to Russian stocks and bonds does not dramatically affect portfolio returns, and sharp drops in valuations and liquidity concerns discourage rushed exits.
""What we're doing is not making any precipitous decisions,"" said Michael Kushma, chief investment officer of Global Fixed Income at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management.
""We're facing a very challenging, illiquid situation ... So if you take on a position, you're worried what's going to surprise us tomorrow,"" he said, declining to disclose his exposure to Russia but saying positions had been adjusted as tensions rose.
In response to Western sanctions, Russia on Tuesday temporarily halted foreign investors from selling Russian assets, saying business needed a chance to make a considered opinion. Russia's central bank on Monday suspended stock market trading on the Moscow Exchange.
The moves came after valuations dropped dramatically across asset classes in the past week.
Yields of 10-year Russian OFZ bonds, which move inversely to prices, hit their highest since early 2016. London-listings of Sberbank and Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) have been all but wiped out.
Marcelo Assalin, head of William Blair Emerging Markets Debt, said his firm had very little exposure to Russian bonds and he was not trying to sell, also pointing to lack of liquidity in the market.
""I am skeptical that investors will find liquidity to sell sizable positions here, so I don't think marketability is something that investors can find in the marketplace at this point,"" he said.
Bernard Horn, lead portfolio manager at Polaris (NYSE:PII) Capital Management, said his only direct exposure to the Russian market was in shares of diamond mining company Alrosa, and he was in no rush to sell. 
""We're not able to transact in the stock anyway, and there's no real reason for us to get to panicked about it,"" he said, adding that some investments had in fact increased in value from the Ukraine crisis.
""We have more exposure that's benefiting in some way from the shortages of things like methanol, fertilizer, gas, copper. All that in some ways is more than offsetting our exposure to Alrosa,"" he said.
Jon Maier, chief investment officer at exchange-traded fund provider Global X said he had a very small exposure to Russian assets and getting rid of that exposure was not a concern.
On the other hand, he was seeing increased interest in an ETF which invests in companies that could benefit from the adoption of cybersecurity technology, he said, adding weekly inflows in that fund were about $80 million as of Feb. 28.
The risk of cyber attacks from Russia has intensified after Western sanctions.

Uncertainty about the conflict as well as the risk of more punitive sanctions were distorting prices, reinforcing the case of holding tight or even potentially buying assets on the cheap at a later stage.
""This to us is a huge shock but it's a temporary shock,"" said Morgan Stanley's Kushma.

(Reuters) - Shares in Grab tumbled 37% on Thursday after Southeast Asia's no. 1 ride-hailing and food delivery firm posted a $1.1 billion quarterly loss and a worse-than-expected drop in revenue, hit by promotional offers and higher driver incentives.
Singapore-based Grab Holdings Ltd has poured money into incentives to attract drivers as ride-share demand recovers from pandemic lows, and also offered aggressive food-delivery promotions as people began to dine out more with the easing of COVID-19 restrictions.
But the incentives ate into sales in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 - the first it has reported as a public company -which slumped 44% to $122 million. 
""We plan to be judicious and disciplined in allocating capital, as we double down on the long-term growth opportunities of our on-demand, advertising and financial services businesses,"" Chief Financial Officer Peter Oey said in a statement.
The loss for the whole year ballooned to $3.56 billion versus $2.75 billion in 2020.
Grab is fighting to retain its market-leader position in the face of stiffer competition from GoTo, a company formed by the merger between ride hailing app Gojek and e-commerce firm Tokopedia, as well as Southeast Asian tech firm Sea Ltd.
Shares of Grab skidded to their lowest ever on Thursday at $3.09, wiping off more than $7 billion from its market value.
Since going public in December after a $40 billion merger with a blank check firm, Grab's stock has shed nearly three-quarters of its value.
Still, the incentives managed to boost gross merchandise volume (GMV), a measure of transaction volumes, which rose 26%.
Grab said it expects GMV growth between the second and fourth quarters of 2022 to jump 30% to 35% year-on-year, and predicted it would break even on an adjusted EBITDA basis in its food delivery unit by the first half of next year.

""We believe the 30% sell-off in share price is unwarranted,""  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts said in a note, adding that broad market weakness amid geopolitical instability might have prompted some investors to cut losses.
Revenue from Grab's mobility unit, which accounted for 86% of overall sales, declined 27% in the quarter. Revenue from its food delivery services unit plunged 98%.

It has ""proactively advocated"" with ""index providers to remove Russian securities from broad-based indices,"" Rich Kushel, head of the portfolio management group and Salim Ramji, global head of iShares and index investments, said in a joint statement on Thursday.
Russian securities account for less than 0.01% of their clients' assets, they said. 
Western sanctions on Moscow after it invaded Ukraine last week have prompted a wave of investors to announce they were cutting positions in Russia.
Canadian asset manager Purpose Investments said on Thursday it had divested all direct holdings of Russian companies as of Feb. 28 and pledged to stop new investments as long as Russia's invasion continued.
Efforts by investors to cut positions have been complicated, however, by a Russian ban on local brokers from selling securities held by foreigners.
BlackRock said earlier this week it was consulting with regulators, index providers, and other market participants to ensure its clients could exit their positions in Russian securities, where allowed.
Major index providers FTSE Russell and MSCI said on Wednesday they were removing Russian equities from all their indexes. FTSE Russell said the decision will be effective from March 7, while MSCI said its decision will be implemented in one step across all MSCI indexes as of the close of trading on March 9.
""We will continue actively consulting with regulators, index providers and other market participants to help ensure our clients can exit their positions in Russian securities, whenever and wherever regulatory and market conditions allow,"" the Thursday statement said.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a LinkedIn posting that while the company did not have offices or operations in Ukraine or Russia, it was what doing what it can to provide support to colleagues and their families who have been directly impacted. 
""BlackRock and its people have also rallied to provide financial assistance to Ukrainian refugees on the ground,"" Fink wrote.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Detroit's Big Three automakers said on Thursday they will allow autoworkers to stop wearing masks at workplaces where U.S. health officials have said it is safe to do so.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Chrysler-parent Stellantis NV and the United Auto Workers union said in a joint statement they would adopt the new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance allowing workers at U.S. facilities to not wear masks regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status, if those facilities are not in high-risk counties. 
The CDC said Thursday that 93% of Americans live in counties that are not high-risk.
Nearly all of Michigan, where the Big Three automakers have many of their plants are in areas where the CDC has deemed it safe to take off masks, including in the counties home to the headquarters of GM, Ford and Stellantis North America.
Other states home to many plants like Ohio and Illinois are also mostly deemed safe to drop masks, according to the CDC.
The Big Three, unlike some other major manufacturers, never mandated vaccines for thousands of unionized U.S. workers.
Last fall, Ford and Stellantis both required its U.S. salaried non-union workers to be vaccinated to seek exemptions.
GM, Ford and Stellantis all mandated vaccines for all autoworkers in Canada.

In August 2021, the U.S. automakers reinstated requirements to wear masks at all U.S. plants, offices and warehouses after a surge in COVID cases. 
The CDC and other global public health agencies have advised wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID but some have raised questions about their efficacy. Mask mandates have been opposed by various government officials and people who see the mandates as a government overreach.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Friday morning, with investors weighing the escalating Russian invasion of Ukraine and the global growth risks from soaring costs of commodities including oil.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.90% by 9:44 PM ET (2:44 AM GMT). Data released earlier in the day showed that the jobs/applications ratio was 1.2, and the unemployment rate was 2.8%, in January 2022.
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 1.13%, with the consumer price index growing 3.7% year-on-year and 0.6% month-on-month in February.
In Australia, the ASX 200 fell 0.86%, with retail sales growing 1.8%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 2.19%.
China’sShanghai Composite was down 0.27% while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.35%.
U.S. Treasuries rallied, with the benchmark 10-year yield falling below 1.80%. The gap between two-year and 10-year yields is the smallest since March 2020, indicating expectations of slower economic growth.
In the latest news on the invasion, Russia began shelling the Zaporizhzhia power plant in Enerhodar, Ukraine. Some investors warned that the West’s sanctions in response to the invasion are creating risks including high raw material costs, as well as damage to global confidence that could decrease investment and the potential for credit stress to ripple through markets.
Slowing profit growth, tightening liquidity, and valuations that have yet to become cheap were already challenges, and “what you are seeing on the geopolitical front is only exacerbating those issues,” Richard Bernstein Advisors LLC deputy chief investment officer Dan Suzuki told Bloomberg.
Russian President Vladimir Putin told his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron he plans to fulfill the goals of his invasion, which includes toppling the Ukrainian government. The U.S. stepped up sanctions, targeting eight wealthy Russians and their families, while S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings slashed Russia’s credit rating for the second time in a week.
Central banks’ monetary policies were also on investors’ minds. In a second day of testimony before Congress, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reaffirmed that the central bank is set to start a series of interest-rate hikes while emphasizing that the Fed would move judiciously.
Powell added that the Russian invasion is leading to risks for inflation and growth. He again backed a quarter-point interest rate hike later in the month, but added, “we are prepared to raise by more than that” at one or more meetings if the move fails to bring inflation down.
“Rising commodity prices are a big concern for the market, prompting fears of stagflation. The economic clinch point of this war is commodity prices. Higher energy prices, slowing growth, and surging inflation are not a good outlook,” City Index senior financial markets analyst Fiona Cincotta told Bloomberg.
U.S. data released on Thursday showed that the services PMI was 56.5 in February and that 215,000 initial jobless claims were filed over the past week. Investors now await the latest U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, due later in the day."

Here are some actions by large multi-national companies:
LEAVING RUSSIA
Energy companies led by BP (NYSE:BP), Shell (LON:RDSa) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) are promising to sell Russia stakes and exit the country. Among many others, Accenture (NYSE:ACN), with 2,300 employees in Russia, said it would discontinue business and Mercedes-Benz Group said it plans to spin off its stake in Russia's Kamaz.
HALTED SERVICES
Boeing (NYSE:BA) has cut sales and support for aircraft, saying it was and would follow U.S. sanctions. Washington's export rules were changed to clamp down particularly on technology that could be used by the military, affecting a broad swath of industry, such as PC maker Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL), which has stopped sales to Russia. Russia has banned Western airlines from Russian space.
 United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX), two of the world's largest logistics companies, halted delivery service to Russia and Ukraine.
Travel booking software provider Sabre (NASDAQ:SABR) Corp said it has terminated its distribution agreement with Aeroflot, hurting the Russian flag carrier's ability to sell tickets.
CLOSED AND OPENED STORES
Clothing retailer H&M, car companies including GM and BMW as well as spirits maker  Diageo  (LON:DGE) and motorcycle maker Harley Davidson are among global companies that are not selling. Most are not exporting goods to Russia, which would be difficult given decisions by shipping companies to drop Russian service.  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and IKEA, a Swedish furniture retailer with a chain in Russia, are temporarily closing their stores.
By contrast, restaurateurs Burger King and Papa John's underscored that the restaurants flying their flags in Russia were owned by local businesses. ""We do not have plans to ask the independent franchisee who owns and operates Papa Johns stores in Russia to close their stores,"" the pizza maker said.
HALTED PRODUCTION
Ford has discontinued operations, but its joint venture partner still has a factory in the country. Many other automakers including France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Japan's  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, have described shutting local manufacturing, some noting a lack of supplies.
HARSH WORDS
Many major global brands are using rarely heard corporate language that clearly blame Russia for attacking Ukraine. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Ford used very similar language to describe deep concern about the invasion of Russia. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) Chief Executive Vicki Hollub labeled the invasion ""insane and inhumane"" in comments made a day after the invasion.
SHOCK ACTIONS
Oil company BP's decision to sell out of Russia at a cost of as much as $25 billion was a shock for an industry that has worked very closely with Russia. Condemnations by Apple and Disney were unusual.
ON THE SIDELINES

Many commodity traders such as Cargill are not saying much. Big consumer brands include Nestle, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Pepsi, Oreo-cookie maker Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) have yet to comment on the status of their operations in Russia.
McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), which has 847 restaurants in Russia, 84% of which are company-owned, has not commented on its operations.

(Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google said on Thursday that it had stopped selling online advertising in Russia, a ban that covers search, YouTube and outside publishing partners.
The move by the world's top seller of online ads by revenue follows similar pauses in Russia by  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""In light of the extraordinary circumstances, we're pausing Google ads in Russia,"" the company said in a statement. ""The situation is evolving quickly, and we will continue to share updates when appropriate.""
Google earlier had banned Russian state-funded media from buying or selling ads through its technology. It also had invoked its sensitive events policy, which bars marketing that seeks to take advantage of the war, with an exception for protest or anti-war ads.
Russia's communications regulator Roskomnadzor on Monday ordered Google to stop showing ads that contained inaccurate information about casualties sustained by Russian forces and Ukrainian civilians.
On Thursday, the regulator told Google to stop showing YouTube ads with “false political information” about Ukraine that aimed ""to misinform the Russian audience” about current events, the Wall Street Journal reported.
Moscow in the past has fined or restricted access to services that ignore its demands.
Google last year paid more than 32 million roubles in fines over content violations.
The SPARK business database showed last year that Google's turnover in Russia in 2020 was 85.5 billion roubles ($790 million).

(Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower on Thursday, with growth stocks including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) denting the Nasdaq, as the Ukraine crisis kept investors on edge.
Tesla dropped 4.6% and Amazon lost 2.7%, both contributing more than any other stocks to the Nasdaq's steep decline.
The S&P 500 growth index dipped 1.1% while the value index edged up 0.1%.
Reflecting a defensive mood on Wall Street, the S&P 500 utilities index rallied 1.7% and real estate climbed 1.1%.
With Russia's invasion of Ukraine now a week in, hundreds of Russian soldiers and Ukrainian civilians have been killed, and Russia itself has been plunged into isolation.
""The market is entirely locked on what this geopolitical turmoil looks like,"" said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky. ""Volatility is likely to remain for probably the near term, and maybe even the medium term, because I just don't see what an acceptable off ramp in the next couple of weeks for Ukraine or Putin.""
Also, soaring prices of oil and other commodities have stoked fears that recent high inflation could combine with stagnant economic growth, making it more difficult for the Federal Reserve and other major central banks to manage interest rates. [O/R]
The percentage of fund managers who expect so-called stagflation within the next 12 months stood at 30%, compared with 22% last month, a survey from BofA Global Research showed.
Wall Street surged in the previous session after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he would back a quarter point rate increase at the March 15-16 meeting, assuaging some fears of a more aggressive hike.
""We are going to stay in a tight range until we have the Fed meeting in two weeks because there's limited earnings,"" predicted Jay Hatfield, chief investment officer at Infrastructure Capital Management in New York.
""There's no real reason to be long, unless, of course, there's some peace or stability in Ukraine, which doesn't seem likely.""

The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.56% to 13,537.94.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.6 billion shares, the lowest in six days, according to Refinitiv data.
Meanwhile, data showed a measure of U.S. services industry activity dropped to a one-year low in February and employment contracted.
Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co jumped almost 12% after the grocer forecast upbeat annual same-store sales and profit, encouraged by strong demand for its pick-up and delivery services and sustained home-cooking trends.
 American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO) Inc slid 9.3% after the apparel chain forecast a decline in earnings for the first half of 2022.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.48-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.12-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

S&P downgraded the sovereign rating to ""CCC-minus"" from ""BB-plus"" less than a week after dropping it from investment grade. 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two, has thrown its financial markets into turmoil after several countries imposed sanctions and global brands exited the nation in droves.
""The downgrade follows the imposition of measures that we believe will likely substantially increase the risk of default,"" the agency said.
New restrictions from the G7 countries and capital controls introduced by the Russian government to protect the rouble could constrain the nation's ability to pay its debt, S&P said. 
The ratings agency also warned of further downgrades as it kept the sovereign on negative watch.
""We expect to resolve the CreditWatch placement once we have more clarity on the technical ability and/or willingness of the government to honor its debt obligations in full and on time.""
The ability to honor debt obligations is already in question. Russia's National Settlement Depository said Thursday that coupon payouts due Wednesday on the country's OFZ government bonds had been made only to local holders, citing a central bank order barring payments to foreigners.
Russia has over $700 million worth of government bond payments due this month. Its ample reserves would allow to cover those payments, but a freeze on some assets and other measures could affect its ability to make them.

Five-year credit default swaps, the cost to insure against a Russian default, this week traded near 2,000 basis points from just over 200 bps in mid-February. Those were quoted Thursday around 1,300 bps.
Rating agencies Fitch and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) downgraded Russia's rating by six notches to junk status on Wednesday, saying Western sanctions threw into doubt Russia's ability to service debt and would weaken the economy. That sent the Russian rouble to record lows against the dollar and euro on Thursday.

(Reuters) - Sneaker maker  Nike  and home furnishings firm IKEA shut down stores in Russia on Thursday, as trade restrictions and supply constraints added to political pressure for companies to stop business in Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine.
French bank Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) said it was working to cut its risks in Russia, fearing a tit-for-tat response by Moscow to Western sanctions, as more companies from vodka maker  Diageo  (LON:DGE) to Toyota suspended business in the country.
Globally known companies including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Ford and Shell (LON:RDSa) have condemned Russia's attack, but some of the announcements on Thursday were more practical, focused on supplies and sanctions as shipping routes closes and governments banned exports to Russia.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Chief Executive David Calhoun, in a note to staff, acknowledged the violence in Ukraine but avoided politics. 
""Moving forward, Boeing will continue to follow the lead of the U.S. government and strictly adhere to the export controls and restrictions that have been announced governing work in Russia,"" he said in the note seen by Reuters, which described suspension of work in Russia and Ukraine.
Brazilian plane-maker Embraer joined Airbus and Boeing in halting parts supplies to Russian airlines.
Home furnishings retailer IKEA said it would close outlets in Russia and Russian ally Belarus, affecting 15,000 workers, and described its shutdowns in non-political terms. 
""The war has both a huge human impact and is resulting in serious disruptions to supply chain and trading conditions, which is why the company groups have decided to temporarily pause IKEA operations in Russia,"" IKEA said in a statement.
Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) said it was ""deeply troubled by the devastating crisis in Ukraine"" and described its closing of stores in this way: ""Given the rapidly evolving situation, and the increasing challenges of operating our business, Nike will be pausing operations in Russia.""
Some companies, including McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) have been quiet about plans. 
The chief of New York state's pension fund said on Thursday that they and other companies with a large footprint in Russia ""need to consider whether doing business in Russia is worth the risk during this extraordinarily volatile time.""
The costs of corporate actions are starting to add up, with more than $110 billion in Russia exposure announced by global companies, banks and investors.
Norway's $1.3 trillion wealth fund said its Russian assets, worth around $3 billion before the invasion, have now become effectively worthless.
""They are pretty much written off,"" CEO Nicolai Tangen told Reuters.
TJX (NYSE:TJX) Cos Inc said on Thursday it would sell its 25% stake in Russian low-cost apparel retailer Familia, which cost it $225 million in 2019. Because of a decline in the rouble and TJX said it may take an impairment charge due to the sale.
SANCTIONS RISKS
Underscoring the challenges global companies are facing as they comply with sanctions against Russia, Societe Generale said on Thursday it could see an ""extreme scenario"" where Russia strips the bank of its local operations. The lender has a $20 billion exposure to Russia.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) said on Wednesday it could face billions of dollars in losses on its exposure to Russia and was looking to exit Russian assets. Bank shares have taken a drubbing in recent days amid fears of possible writedowns and weaker economies.
Western sanctions - including shutting out some Russian banks from the SWIFT global financial network, new export controls, and closure of air space - have led dozens of global companies to pause operations in the country, hammered the rouble and forced the central bank to jack up interest rates.
Spanish fashion retailer Mango said on Thursday it was temporarily closing its shops and its online sale website in Russia, and Spirits company Diageo, the maker of Smirnoff vodka and Guinness, said it had paused exports to Ukraine and Russia. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) said they had stopped sales in Russia.
Accenture (NYSE:ACN) said it was discontinuing its Russian business, which had nearly 2,300 employees.
Britain said on Thursday it will ban Russian companies from the London insurance market, the world's largest commercial and specialty insurance centre.
Hundreds of Russian soldiers and Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than one million people have fled Ukraine in the week since President Vladimir Putin ordered the attack.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation” that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
SCRAMBLED SUPPLIES
With a shortage of components, more carmakers are halting production at their factories in Russia, including Russia's biggest carmaker, Avtovaz - controlled by France's  Renault  (PA:RENA).
Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201) said on Thursday it has suspended vehicle exports to Russia, while Japanese peer Toyota said it would halt production at its Russian factory from Friday and indefinitely stop vehicle exports to the country.
Auto supplier Magna said it was idling six plants in Russia.

The world's biggest shipping lines, MSC and Maersk have suspended container shipping to and from Russia.
Japan Airlines and ANA Holdings, which normally use Russian airspace for their Europe flights, said they would cancel all flights to and from Europe on Thursday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of nearly 600 tech employees at The New York Times Co has voted to unionize as the company faces claims it unlawfully interfered with labor organizing, according to election results announced on Thursday.
The workers voted 404-88 to join The NewsGuild of New York, which already represents other Times employees, according to the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The bargaining unit, known as the Times Tech Guild, is now the largest tech-worker union in the U.S., according to the NewsGuild.
Danielle Rhoades Ha, a spokeswoman for The New York Times, said the company looked forward to negotiating a contract with the union. 
""We continue to believe this election process was critical so our colleagues could learn more about the union, hear both sides of the argument and, ultimately, make an informed decision,"" she said.
In a statement, the Times Tech Guild said unionizing will enable its members to have a say in their pay, benefits and working conditions. 
""We look forward to working with management to win a strong contract that will not just ensure equity and respect for tech workers, but will also set industry standards across the board,"" the union said. 
The New York Times had argued the unit was inappropriate because it includes employees with five distinct job functions, and should have included only about 360 product engineering workers. The company had also said many of the workers in the unit are managers or supervisors who are barred from joining unions.
An NLRB official in January said the Times was precluded from pursuing both of those arguments because it had not provided enough information about the employees' working conditions.
In December, the NLRB general counsel issued a complaint accusing the Times of unfair labor practices in connection with the union campaign.
According to the complaint, management during a virtual meeting last May told some employees they were barred from showing union support while acting as supervisors of interns, and has continued to maintain that policy.

The Times has denied wrongdoing. A hearing is scheduled before an administrative judge for March 14.
The NewsGuild also represents some employees of Reuters.

Political pressure is building for companies to halt business in Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine. Some big companies have already said they will do so, including sneaker maker  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and home furnishings firm IKEA.
""Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and its highly unpredictable foreign policy are a threat to the global economy,"" New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who oversees the state's public pension fund, said in a statement. 
""We're encouraging the companies we invest in to do a risk analysis and determine what is in the best interests of their company and their shareholders,"" he said.
McDonald's - one of the first western brands to open in Moscow in 1990 as the Soviet Union was crumbling - has 847 locations there, 84% of which are company owned. 

Pepsi is also notable as one of the few Western products allowed in the Soviet Union. It has two production plants and sells snacks and beverages in the country, according to its most recent annual report for 2021.
The companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Both companies have about 4% revenue exposure to Russia, according to a J.P. Morgan Report.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management has reduced the Russian exposure in its GQG international equity fund to about $222 million, according to a statement and a spokesperson, down from over $1.7 billion six months ago.
The Goldman Sachs GQG Partners International Opportunities Fund was 0.99% exposed to Russia as of the end of February, Goldman Sachs said in a statement on its website, with holdings in Lukoil, Rosneft and Gazprom (MCX:GAZP).
The fund is Goldman's only fund with Russian exposure, according to data from research firm Morningstar on the top 100 open-end and exchange-traded funds worldwide in terms of estimated U.S. dollar exposure to Russian securities.
""Coming into 2022 we saw attractive growth opportunities and valuations in many Russian companies"", the firm said.
""The actions by the Russian government this year began to outweigh the positive fundamentals we were seeing in many companies. We have been reducing our exposure to Russian holdings since early January, and they are now concentrated in the energy sector,"" it said.
A spokesperson said the fund had $22.45 billion in assets as of the end of Feb., with Russian exposure equivalent to $222.3 million.
This is down from exposure of more than $1.7 billion as of September, according to Morningstar data.
Western sanctions on Moscow after Russia invaded Ukraine last week have prompted a wave of investors to announce they were cutting positions in Russia.
Goldman said it has also marked down the value of its Russian assets after the country's central bank closed the local market to all foreign investors, complicating plans to ditch or evaluate assets. 

""Under these circumstances, the Russian securities in the portfolios for which we determine valuations are now being 'fair valued' in the absence of true market values,"" it said.
Fair value determinations ""resulted in significant discounts to the market values that existed prior to the actions of the Central Bank of Russia,"" it added.

TotalEnergies said on Tuesday it would provide fuel to the Ukrainian authorities and aid to refugees in Europe, but stopped short of joining rivals Shell (LON:RDSa) and BP (NYSE:BP) in planning to exit positions in oil-rich Russia.
COMMUNICATIONS
More than a dozen telecom providers are either providing free international calls to Ukraine or are scrapping roaming charges there.
Firms which have taken measures include A1 Telekom Austria (OTC:TKAGY) Group, Altice Portugal, AT&T (NYSE:T), Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY), Orange, Proximus, Swisscom, Telefonica (NYSE:TEF), Telenor, Telia Company, TIM, KPN, Vivacom and Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD).

FOOD AND BLANKETS
Poland's largest food retailer Biedronka said it would hire family members of its 1,800 Ukrainian employees, who would each receive a 1,000 zloty ($233) grant. It also pledged $1.2 million to deliver basic food, hygiene and cleaning products to refugees. 
Jysk will provide refugees in need with blankets or other items from the Danish home retailer's stock, a spokesman told Reuters on Thursday as the group reopened eight stores in western Ukraine. 
ACCOMMODATION

Polish hotel chain Arche Hotels said on Saturday it had already put up 1,000 refugees and prepared to accommodate 5,000, while its establishment in Lublin, 100 km (62 miles) from the border, had collected bedding, clothing, Polish language books and toys for children fleeing Ukraine.

(Reuters) - Chip company Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc on Thursday forecast second-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates on the back of strong demand from enterprise and cloud clients, and the ramp-up in 5G technology.
""Enterprise spending is on fire ... and we are seeing a big part of that,"" Broadcom's chief executive, Hock Tan, told analysts on a conference call. He said that the sector has been recovering strongly from a ""trough"" in the first quarter of last year.
Broadcom forecast current-quarter revenue of about $7.9 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $7.43 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Shares of the San Jose, California-based company rose about 2% in extended trading. So far this year they have declined about 12% amid a rout in tech stocks.
Broadcom's chief financial officer, Kirsten Spears, told analysts that the company's hardware had an order backlog of over $25 billion at the end of the quarter compared with $22 billion in the previous quarter. 
""This paints a picture for continued strong demand to continue throughout the year,"" said Logan Purk, analyst at Edward Jones.
Broadcom, which counts Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a major customer, is also poised to gain from the global rollout of 5G wireless technology, which is likely to boost demand for its chips used in handsets, telecom equipment and other devices.
""We think most of Broadcom's end-markets and major customers' demand remain healthy in the near term,"" said Kinngai Chan, analyst at Summit Insights Group. 
""Our checks, however, do indicate some double ordering by its customers and expect demand to begin to normalize in 2H22 as supply improves.""

Adjusted revenue for the quarter ended Jan. 30 was $7.71 billion, up 16% year-on-year and slightly higher than Wall Street's expectation for $7.60 billion. 
Excluding items, the company earned $8.39 per share, beating estimates of $8.08.

Sales at Costco, which relies heavily on customers seeking a treasure-hunt shopping experience at its cavernous warehouses, have benefited following the rollout of vaccines and easing of COVID-19 curbs. 
Even with the reopening of restaurants and outdoor eateries, consumers have retained pandemic-induced habits of cooking and eating more at home, bolstering sales at retailers including Costco and Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co.
There has been strong demand for high-margin items in recent months as social events and travel have resumed, boosting sales at retailers.
However, the company said it was still pressured by container delays, higher labor and freight costs and chip shortages, which were impacting deliveries.
""Despite all the supply chain issues, we're staying in stock and continue to work to mitigate cost and price increases as best we can,"" Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said.
Comparable sales, excluding the impact of fuel and currency fluctuations, jumped 11.1% in the second quarter, compared with Refinitiv IBES estimates of an 8.74% rise.
Total revenue rose 16% to $51.90 billion in the second quarter from a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $51.47 billion.

Net income rose to $1.30 billion, or $2.92 per share, in the quarter ended Feb. 13, from $951 million, or $2.14 per share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting it to report profit of $2.74 per share.
Still, shares of the retailer fell about 1% in extended trading as same-store sales growth in February slowed to 10.6% on an adjusted basis from 10.8% in January.

(Reuters) - Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) on Thursday forecast 2022 earnings above estimates, betting on strong demand for its Old Navy and Athleta clothing brands as Americans return to offices and social events thanks to declining Omicron cases. 
Shares of the apparel retailer jumped 7.2% to $15.67 in extended trading, as it also posted a smaller-than-expected loss for the fourth quarter.
Many apparel chains have struggled to keep up with rising demand though, as port congestion and tight capacity delay shipments.
Gap has had to use pricier air freight to bring in goods, and said its inventory at the end of the first quarter would rise in the mid-20s percentage range as it orders early to counter longer in-transit times.
""(Customers are) leaning into categories like dresses or new silhouettes and pants for back-to-work ... as well as denim with new leg shapes. It's a pretty radical change from last year,"" Chief Executive Sonia Syngal said on an earnings call.
Gap forecast fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings per share between $1.85 and $2.05, above Refinitiv IBES estimates of $1.86.
It also expects to benefit from tie-ups with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to sell home goods and with rapper Kanye West to launch new styles.
The strong outlook contrasts those from rivals Abercrombie & Fitch and  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO), which have warned of freight expenses pressuring their margins in the first half of 2022.
In the near term, Gap is not immune to the industry-wide supply snags either.

The Banana Republic parent, whose comparable sales growth in the quarter ended Jan. 29 missed estimates, indicated that sales pressure had continued into the current quarter. 
It projected net sales to fall in the mid- to high-single-digit percentage range, compared with estimates for a 3.8% decline.

McDonald's last month said it would remove the enclosures, known as gestation crates, from its U.S. supply chain by 2024, pushing back a 10-year goal it set in 2012.
Icahn says McDonald's policy is misleading because the company allows pork producers to keep pigs in crates for the first four to six weeks they are pregnant.
Here are some companies' policies:
MCDONALD'S: McDonald's says it expects to source 85% to 90% of its U.S. pork from sows, or mother pigs, not housed in gestation crates during pregnancy by the end of the year. More than 60% of McDonald's U.S. supply chain phased out the use of the crates for pregnant sows by early 2022, the company says. McDonald's says it sources about 1% of U.S. pork production.
WENDY'S: Wendys Co says it will shift its supply chain to ""open pen/group housing for confirmed pregnant sows"" by the end of 2022. Under the plan, sows may still be housed in individual crates for four to six weeks until pregnancy is confirmed, Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) says. About 10% of Wendy's bacon and sausage was sourced from confirmed-pregnant sows held in open pens or group housing at the start of 2022, the company says.
BURGER KING: Burger King owner Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) Inc says it is on track to eliminate suppliers' use of gestation crates for housing pregnant sows in North America, Australia and New Zealand by 2022. Company executives ""understand that crates may still be used by suppliers prior to confirming a sow's pregnancy,"" a spokesperson says. In Europe, the company has committed to eliminating the use of gestation crates for non-pregnant sows.
TARGET:  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) pledged in 2012 to work with vendors to eliminate sow gestation crates by 2022. The company says sows will be housed in open groups after pregnancy is confirmed and that Target is working toward an ""overall crate-free goal.""
HUMANE SOCIETY: The Humane Society of the United States says the term ""confirmed pregnant"" is a ""made-up euphemism for keeping pigs in gestation crates for an arbitrary amount of time."" Pigs, which are artificially inseminated to become pregnant, should not be confined in gestation crates so small that they cannot turn around, the group says.
SMITHFIELD FOODS: McDonald's supplier Smithfield Foods, the world's largest pork producer, says it provides ""group housing for pregnant sows during their 16-week gestation period."" 
Owned by Hong Kong-listed WH Group (OTC:WHGLY) Ltd, Smithfield says it uses individual crates for breeding ""to help ensure a sow's successful conception, a practice supported by multiple scientific studies.""
The Humane Society, in a lawsuit against Smithfield, says the company has deceived consumers about its use of restrictive, individual crates during gestation. Smithfield denies the claims.
TYSON FOODS: Meat processor  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) says it owns and raises less than 10% of the pigs used in its pork business. The company's suppliers ""choose their sow housing systems, with a growing number converting to open pen gestation,"" the company says.

As of 2019, about 53% of Tyson-owned sows on contract farms were housed in open pens, the company said. When including independent suppliers, 21% of Tyson's total pork supply was derived from sows housed in open pen systems as of 2019.
Tyson said in a 2019 report that industry research had ""yet to conclusively prove which sow housing system best facilitates responsible production across all welfare and sustainability focus area.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Carl Icahn is broadening a push to get McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) to improve suppliers' treatment of pigs raised for bacon and sausage.
The billionaire activist investor, who has described himself as an animal lover, on Thursday called on the burger chain to make a global pledge to eliminate the use of metal enclosures to house pregnant pigs. He has said the enclosures, known as gestation crates, are ""obscene"" and cause pigs unnecessary pain.
McDonald's last month said it would remove gestation crates from its U.S. supply chain by 2024, pushing back a 10-year goal it set in 2012 with Icahn's urging. 
Pork producers use the crates, which are about 7 feet (2.1 m) long and 2 feet wide, to confine mother pigs with no room to turn around.
Icahn said he also wants McDonald's to commit to buying pork from suppliers that abide by standards set in a California animal-welfare law, Proposition 12. Approved by California voters in November 2018, the measure prohibits confining a breeding pig with less than 24 square feet of usable floor space.
McDonald's had no immediate comment on Icahn's call for a global commitment or on his demand that the company buy only from suppliers that comply with Proposition 12.
Icahn nominated two members to McDonald's board of directors in an escalating fight over the treatment of pigs by suppliers.
""Perhaps if McDonald's leaders applied the same efforts they do towards obtaining better compensation packages for themselves to getting their suppliers to become completely gestation crate free, we wouldn't be having this proxy fight,"" Icahn said.
Icahn and his daughter, Michelle Icahn Nevin, have said McDonald's claims are misleading because the company allows producers to keep pregnant pigs in gestation crates for the first four to six weeks of their 16-week pregnancies. 
Asked to comment, McDonald's said it has not backtracked on its 2012 pledge. The company said last month that a move to ""crate-free"" pork is impossible with the current U.S. pork supply and would be ""a departure from the veterinary science used for large-scale production.""
McDonald's said it expects to buy 85% to 90% of its U.S. pork from sows, or mother pigs, not housed in gestation crates during pregnancy by the end of 2022. 

Ten years ago, the Humane Society of the United States worked with Icahn as an adviser and pushed  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) for a board seat to fight the use of gestation crates. The Humane Society's CEO at the time did not get the seat.
Icahn and his daughter said they are also concerned with other welfare issues for farm animals.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Citibanamex is spending 1.4 billion pesos ($67.8 million) to remodel more than 1,200 branches in Mexico with plans to expand, a top executive said on Thursday.
The bank, one of Mexico's largest, has already begun the expansion, and plans to open 50 branches in the first half of 2022, Daniel Garduno, Citbanamex's corporate director of commercial banking, said in a news conference.
""We are making profound changes,"" said Garduno, as the bank looks to open slimmed-down, higher-tech branches in light of the sale of Citibanamex's consumer unit, which was announced in January. 
Executives said Citibanamex will open five new types of branches, from self-service centers to branches modeled after convenience stores.
""We're looking to offer the best financial experience in the country,"" Garduno said in a press release, emphasizing improved customer satisfaction in a country where 52% of those surveyed in a 2021 study said banks don't care about their clients.
Executives said the sale of the unit, part of  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Chief Executive Jane Fraser's plan to exit international operations, would not affect client service.
""Our commitment to Mexico is more active than ever,"" Alberto Gomez, Citibanamex's corporate director of institutional development, told reporters.

(Reuters) - Reflecting growing animosity across the United States toward Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, lawmakers in New Jersey's largest city have voted to suspend the licenses of gas stations branded with the name of a major oil company based in Moscow. 
The Newark City Council passed a resolution 8-0 on Wednesday urging the city to suspend all licenses of two local Lukoil gasoline stations to show support for Ukraine. 
""This is a step on the city side to do what the rest of the world is doing to impose some pressure on Russia to stop this horrific invasion,"" said Council Member Anibal Ramos, who represents a part of Newark where many Ukrainian-Americans live. 
Ramos said the city's business administrator will make the final decision on the resolution. 
The measure comes as a flood of Western businesses cut ties with Russian entities while Washington imposes various sanctions against Russia. 
It is unclear how the resolution may affect Moscow-based Lukoil, among the world's largest oil producers. There are 230 U.S. franchises of Lukoil North America, a company subsidiary. New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania stations are owned by franchisees. 
Newark franchisee Roger Verma said on Wednesday he supports Ukraine, but a suspension would cripple his business, which employs 16 workers.
""I am baffled and confused how shutting down an American-based small business owner is sending a message to support,"" Verma said. 
#BoycottLukoil was used on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to urge Americans to stop patronizing the gas stations. 

""We're not going to help finance the war machine,"" said retired information technology specialist Jeffrey Andrew of Maplewood, New Jersey, after protesting at a Lukoil station in nearby Union, New Jersey. 
Company officials were not available for comment. The board of Lukoil in Russia on Thursday called for the war to end, media reported.

Visa, the world's largest payment processor, is reducing interchange rates for both online and in-person consumer credit transactions for 90% of U.S. businesses, the document showed. 
An interchange fee is the charge a merchant pays to the card-issuing bank every time a consumer swipes their card. 
The changes will apply to merchants with $250,000 or less in Visa consumer credit volumes, according to a source familiar with the matter who declined to be identified because the document is confidential. 
Visa and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) have seen more consumers turn to online modes of payments, as people use cards to pay for clothes, food, groceries and even leisure spending since the start of the pandemic.

The two payment processors last year had postponed plans to raise the fees U.S. merchants pay when customers use cards online until April 2022.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump will turn over some documents to New York's attorney general for her civil probe into his business practices, but need not answer questions under oath while he appeals a judge's order that he testify.
The developments are part of an agreement on Thursday between the former U.S. president, his oldest children Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, and Attorney General Letitia James.
They followed a Feb. 17 ruling by Justice Arthur Engoron of a state court in Manhattan that James could enforce subpoenas for the Trumps' testimony and documents from Donald Trump, after having found ""copious"" evidence of possible financial fraud.
The Trumps appealed on Feb. 28.
James' three-year probe and a parallel criminal probe led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg have focused on whether the Trump Organization misstated the values of its real estate properties to obtain favorable loans and tax benefits.
The Trumps have denied wrongdoing, and none has been accused of criminal wrongdoing.
Thursday's agreement, which Engoron approved, requires Donald Trump to comply ""in full"" with James' subpoena for documents and information by March 31.
It also requires the Trumps to submit for questioning within 14 days if the state Appellate Division rejects their appeal, unless that court or the state's highest court puts the case on hold.
Both sides will speed up the appeals process, with briefing completed by March 31.
In their appeal, the Trumps have said testifying in James' probe would violate their constitutional rights because their words could be used against them in Bragg's criminal probe.

Donald Trump, a Republican, has accused James of prosecuting him in a ""witch hunt"" because she opposes his politics, and accused state judges of bias against him.
James and Bragg are Democrats. The attorney general joined the criminal probe last May.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said on Thursday he was inviting labor union United Auto Workers (UAW) to hold a vote at the electric carmaker's California factory.
The announcement comes as the billionaire entrepreneur criticized the Biden administration and Democrats for a proposal to give union-made, U.S.-built electric vehicles an additional $4,500 tax incentive. Tesla and foreign automakers do not have unions at their U.S. factories.
Organizing a Tesla plant would be a major victory for the UAW, which has largely failed to win the backing of workers at foreign-owned automakers' or EV startups' assembly plants, many of which are in the U.S. South. Tesla also has a plant in Austin, Texas.
In his tweet on Thursday, Musk said the real challenge was the negative unemployment in Bay Area, and not compensating people well would make them leave as they have many offers.
""I'd like hereby to invite UAW to hold a union vote at their convenience. Tesla will do nothing to stop them,"" he said https:// UAW did not have an immediate comment about Musk's tweet, but analysts said his actions over the past year do not match the rhetoric. Musk has also faced the ire of U.S. National Labor Relations Board, which last year ruled the company violated U.S. labor law and ordered Tesla to direct him to delete a 2018 tweet saying employees would lose their stock options if they formed a union. Tesla subsequently appealed the NLRB ruling with the New Orleans-based U.S. Court of Appeals and that case is still pending.  Tesla has been also hit by a string of lawsuits on racial discrimination and sexual harassment by current and former workers. A California civil rights agency also filed a lawsuit accusing Tesla of failing for years to address widespread racist conduct at its Fremont assembly plant. Tesla has said it does not tolerate discrimination and has taken steps to address complaints by workers.  U.S. President Joe Biden has often praised the electric-vehicle (EV) efforts made by Detroit automakers General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, including during his State of the Union Speech on Tuesday, even though they sell fewer EVs than Tesla.  Last month, Biden, whom Musk earlier this year compared to a ""damp sock puppet,"" acknowledged Tesla's leadership role in making EVs after Musk repeatedly complained about being ignored. Last fall, Musk said Biden's EV policy appeared to be controlled by labor unions. UNION VOTE  The latest tweet could help Musk improve his image with the administration and workers, Harley Shaiken, labor professor emeritus at University of California Berkeley, said.  But he and other experts doubted whether Musk would stay neutral even if a union vote is happening.  ""He has a history of being quite anti-union. I personally don't take him at face value on this,"" Jeffrey Hirsch, labor & employment law professor at University of North Carolina, said. Under federal law, at least 30% of workers at a plant or company must sign a petition showing they want to join a union for an election to be held. Typically, unions like the UAW will not seek an election unless they feel they have the necessary support to win the majority backing necessary.  Experts say UAW could get a majority of workers to sign cards saying they want to be represented by the union and call on Musk to recognize a union without an election.  
Last November, 10 environmental and advocacy groups, including Sierra Club, Greenpeace and League of Conservation Voters, called on EV startup Rivian Automotive to work with labor groups to ensure a clean future and high-paying jobs, and to allow a union voting process in its plants. Rivian could not immediately be reached on Thursday.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - SpaceX chief Elon Musk warned there was a high chance the company's Starlink satellite broadband service could be ""targeted"" in Ukraine, which has been hit by Russian invasion. 
The warning came days after an internet security researcher warned that devices used for satellite communications could become ""beacons"" that Russia could target for airstrikes.
""Important warning: Starlink is the only non-Russian communications system still working in some parts of Ukraine, so probability of being targeted is high. Please use with caution,"" Musk tweeted. 
He asked users to ""turn on Starlink only when needed and place antenna away as far away from people as possible"" and ""place light camouflage over antenna to avoid visual detection."" 
On Saturday, Musk said Starlink was activated in Ukraine and SpaceX was sending more terminals to the country, responding to a tweet by a Ukraine government official who asked Musk to provide the embattled country with Starlink stations.
On Monday, Ukraine said it had received donated Starlink satellite internet terminals, but an internet security researcher warned these could become Russian targets.
""...if #Putin controls the air above #Ukraine, users' uplink transmissions become beacons ... for airstrikes,"" John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab project, tweeted.
""#Russia has decades of experience hitting people by targeting their satellite communications,"" he added in a series of 15 tweets detailing the risks. (https:// Ukraine Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov thanked Starlink for ""keeping our cities connected and emergency services saving lives!"" But he said the country needs generators to keep Starlink service online due to Russian attacks on infrastructure.  In response, Musk said SpaceX was updating software to reduce peak power consumption, so Starlink can be powered from car cigarette lighters. ""Mobile roaming enabled, so phased array antenna can maintain signal while on moving vehicle,"" he said.  
Tim Farrar, a consultant in satellite communications, said Starlink antennas, which look like home satellite television dishes, are not designed to be used while in motion, and it was not clear what Musk meant by the tweet.  Russia and Ukraine have agreed on the need to set up humanitarian corridors and a possible ceasefire around them for fleeing civilians, both sides said after talks on Thursday, in their first sign of progress on any issue since the invasion, which Moscow calls a ""special operation.""

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 slipped Thursday, as investors piled into defensive sectors of the market amid ongoing concern Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will add to the red-hot pace of inflation that threatens to derail the economy. 
The S&P 500 fell 0.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%, or 96 points, the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6%.
Utilities, a defensive corner of the market, was the biggest sector gainer as investors mulled the prospect of further inflation pressures following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as prices for oil, wheat and precious metals trend higher.
The five-year breakeven rate on Treasury inflation protected securities – a closely watched gauge of inflation expectations -- jumped to 3.23%, a record high.
U.S. oil prices briefly rose to $116 a barrel intraday, pushing gas prices above $5 a gallon in some parts of the U.S. Oil prices ended the day in the red in a dramatic turnaround after the German Economy Minister Robert Habeck said he wouldn't support a ban on imports of Russian oil, gas and coal.
In testimony on Thursday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the upward pressure on inflation was expected to continue for “at least awhile” and flagged the risk that the Ukraine crisis will prolong supply chain problems, which have been a key driver of inflation.
“It is not going to help at all with supply chains, because ships are not being offloaded,” Powell told members of the Senate on Thursday.
There was some progress on the Ukraine-Russia talks, meanwhile, as both sides agreed to reportedly agreed to organize safe corridors to evacuate civilians and to deliver humanitarian supplies.
French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly warned, however, that “the worst is still to come” in Ukraine as Putin is hellbent on taking “full control” through either diplomatic or military measures.
Tech stocks struggled to add to their gains from a day earlier, with big tech mostly lower, while semiconductor heavyweights like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel also weighed on the sector.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) fell more than 1% after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to underweight from equal weight and cut the price target to $47 from $55, citing “more actionable opportunities elsewhere.”
While the longer term turnaround capability in Intel’s core business is a positive, the “next couple of years are likely to see the stock move sideways and we see more actionable opportunities elsewhere in our coverage,"" Morgan Stanley said.
Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) slumped 15% after reporting fourth-quarter results that beat Wall Street estimates, but guidance fell short, stoking concerns of slowing growth ahead.
 Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY) jumped about 9% despite quarterly revenue and full-year guidance below analysts estimates.  
Kroger (NYSE:KR) surged 11% after reporting earnings per share of $0.91 and revenue of $33.1 billion that beat estimates of $0.74 and $32.9 billion respectively, while guidance was also stronger than expected.
The weakness on Wall Street comes just a day ahead of the monthly jobs report expected to show the economy created about 600,000 jobs last month. 
""The monthly jobs report is going to be huge for the market ahead of the inflation data expected next week, which I think will be elevated,""  John Luke Tyner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, said in an interview with Investing.com on Thursday. ""Our estimates is around 500,000 jobs, but I wouldn't be too surprised by a stronger print.""
""There are still a number of people on the sidelines, but the reduction in stimulus and government subsidies as well as the gap up in wages could entice people to work,"" Tyner added. "

(Reuters) - Flush with cash after bumper earnings, mining companies straddle a delicate balancing act as they benefit from soaring commodity prices amid the Ukraine-Russia crisis but also potentially face high inflation that could hit short-term demand and slow down growth plans, analysts said. 
The world's largest listed miners, including BHP Group (NYSE:BHP),  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) and Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) are sitting on huge piles of cash after skyrocketing prices for copper, iron ore, coal, nickel and other resources buoyed profits. 
High metals prices have so far outpaced inflation, which, partly driven by pandemic-related supply bottlenecks and tightening labour markets, is a thorn in the side of mining giants because it pushes costs up.
But the Ukrainian conflict could roil the world's economic outlook in unpredictable ways, exacerbating those inflationary pressures, analysts say. 
The United States and Europe imposed sanctions against Russia's central bank and disconnected key Russian banks from the main global payments system. In retaliation, Russia could launch counter-sanctions and shut energy supplies altogether, the analysts said. 
""Energy is a big cost input for mining operations,"" said Andrew Swart, head of Deloitte's mining & metals practice, adding that mining companies should brace for higher global energy prices given that Russia is a big oil producer.
A typical mine sees about 20-25% of its costs linked to energy.
""The Russian invasion in Ukraine has brought a whole bunch of new inflationary constraints into the global economy,"" said Tyler Broda, head of European metals and mining research at RBC Capital Markets.
""Whether it is the potential for scarcity of metals, meaning that we can't actually produce things, or the potential for Russia to implement counter-sanctions and shut gas supplies, but also just the impact of inflation on aggregate demand at these high levels,"" he added.
POTENTIAL RIPPLE EFFECTS
Russia is the world's biggest supplier of palladium and third largest producer of oil, nickel and aluminium. It is also a top exporter of coal and steel.
""The biggest impact for the industry right now is losing access to metals,"" Broda said.
So far, mining companies say, the impact of the conflict on business has been limited. 
""The effects to look out for will likely be around disruptions to the flows of physical products, but it's still too early to see, albeit the metals markets seem to be pricing in concerns around constrained supply,"" Anglo American said in an email.
Western companies, including energy producers BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa) are severing ties with Russia, abandoning or exiting their operations and investments there.
Glencore, which has a 10.5% stake in EN+ Group, the parent company of Russian aluminium producer Rusal, did not go as far, but said on Tuesday that it is reviewing its stakes in Russian entities, including a 0.57% stake in oil giant Rosneft.
Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) said it is ""closely monitoring the situation in Ukraine and related sanctions."" It, too, has an alumina refinery joint venture with Rusal in Australia. 

After the bumper profits reported in the last earnings seasons, analysts had predicted that rampant demand for metals to feed the energy transition and constrained supply would encourage miners to approve more projects, even in jurisdictions previously shunned for reports of human rights abuses or considered risky, such as Congo and Zambia.
    ""The big miners, the likes of Rio and BHP, have no use for their cash right now. Their cupboard is bare in terms of options to invest in projects,"" said Glyn Lawcock, head of mining research at Barrenjoey. ""They believe right now with elevated pricing comes elevated equity pricing.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The current rally of U.S. grain and oilseed prices could help bolster American farm incomes this year, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine roils commodity markets over fears of massive disruption of exports from the Black Sea region, an economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago said Thursday.
But how big of a financial boost this ultimately will be for farmers remains murky, as production costs are soaring and the levels of pandemic and trade war-related supports the federal government has paid out since 2019 are falling.
""While the rally of agricultural prices is helpful, inputs are higher too,"" Chicago Fed economist David Oppedahl said during a Federal Reserve webinar about U.S. agriculture.
U.S. net farm income is forecast to be $113.7 billion this year, a 4.5% drop from 2021, according to data released in February from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
But USDA's forecast is as of Feb. 4, or 20 days before Russia invaded Ukraine.
In its wake, Chicago Board of Trade wheat futures prices have jumped 26% and corn futures are about $1.00 per bushel from its record high. Russia and Ukraine combined account for about 29% of global wheat exports and 19% of corn exports.
Direct government payments are forecast to reach $11.7 billion in 2022, down from an estimated $27.1 billion in 2021, $46.6 billion in 2020 and $22.4 billion in 2019, according to the most recent USDA data.
At the same time, spending on nearly all categories of farm expenses is expected to rise this year. Total production expenses -- which includes fuel, fertilizer and crop chemical costs, among other things -- are forecast to be the highest seen since 2015, when adjusted for inflation, the USDA data shows.

Such financial tensions are also being seen to the north. Canadian farm income looks to decline 26% this year to C$19.7 billion from record levels in 2021, due to last year's drought, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, the country's agriculture ministry, said on Feb. 24.
""There's certainly a lot of uncertainty and we'll just have to keep track of things going forward and see how things shake out,"" Oppedahl said.

Spain's Amadeus IT Group SA has also begun suspending distribution of the state-backed airline's fares in its systems, and said it has stopped new commercial projects in Russia.
Sabre said it was taking ""immediate steps"" to remove Aeroflot's flight content from its global distribution system (GDS), a marketplace used by travel agencies and corporations to reserve flights.
GDS providers such as Amadeus and Sabre use software networks to distribute airline tickets.
""We are complying, and will continue to comply, with sanctions imposed against Russia,"" Sabre Chief Executive Officer Sean Menke said.

Sabre and Amadeus are the latest in a wave of companies to cut ties with Russian firms in the wake of broad sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. 
Sabre also said it would evaluate whether more actions were needed after taking into account legal considerations and any countermeasures that could be implemented in response.

Investing.com – Inflation fears returned to the stock market on Thursday, as investors weighed rising prices for fuel and other commodities amid the escalating crisis in Ukraine.
Russia continued to step up its attacks on its neighbor as the U.S. added more oligarchs and Russian officials to a sanctions list, threatening to seize the luxury yachts and other property of these individuals and their families. It also imposed a travel ban on nearly two dozen individuals to the U.S.
Tech stocks and other growth stocks weighed on the indexes, which were negative with a half-hour of trading left in the session. Oil prices shot up to levels not seen in the last decade, as the international benchmark Brent crude reached nearly $120 a barrel. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin told French President Emmanuel Macron that Russia would achieve the goals of its military intervention, Reuters reported.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell returned to Capitol Hill on Thursday to deliver the second day of his semiannual report to lawmakers, this time in the Senate. On Wednesday he told House members he was inclined to raise interest rates by a quarter-point when the central bank holds its policy meeting later this month.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Crude oil
U.S. oil prices hit their highest level since the 2008 financial crisis, as the mother lode of sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices skyrocketing for a third straight day.
U.S. crude’s West Texas Intermediate, or Crude Oil WTI Futures, benchmark reached an intraday high of $116.50. Analysts will be watching to see how much extra sanctions and the possibility of a new agreement that would allow Iran to export again affect the near-term price.
2. Rivian about-face
Earlier this week, electric vehicle maker  Rivian Automotive  Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) said it was raising prices because of its own rising costs, and that did not sit well with the people who were on the preorder list. On Thursday, Rivian issued a mea culpa and reversed its decision. 
But the shares continued to fall, even after Wednesday’s 13% drop. Analysts will be watching for signs investors have shaken off the blip.
3. Jobs, jobs, jobs
Friday will bring the closely-watched jobs report from the government, which is expected to show continued strengthening in the labor market for February. It is a key gauge the Fed uses when considering whether and how much to change rates to respond to economic conditions. The data are released at 8:30 AM ET.
On Thursday the weekly job claims report showed applications for unemployment insurance fell by more than forecast to the lowest level since the start of the year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The California Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest U.S. pension fund, said on Thursday it has ceased all transactions in Russian publicly traded equity and has stopped the flow of any new investments into the country due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
CalPERS is also assessing its real estate investments in Russia, the fund operator said in a statement.
As of March 2, CalPERS owned around $420 million of Russian public stocks and $345 million in illiquid real estate assets, according to a letter the fund operator sent to California Governor Gavin Newsom seen by Reuters.
CalPERS' total investments in Russia represent about 0.17% of its total investment portfolio and it holds no Russian debt, the letter said. 
Western sanctions on Moscow have prompted a wave of investors to announce they were cutting positions in Russia. Authorities in Russia, however, have banned local brokers from selling securities held by foreigners.
""It is important to note that current sanctions, market restrictions, and closure of local stock exchanges have placed significant constraints on CalPERS’ ability to liquidate its holdings,"" CalPERS said in the letter, signed by Theresa Taylor, president of the CalPERS Board of Administration.

The pension fund also said it was reviewing all its investments in emerging markets, including Russia, due to the impacts the crisis has had on all financial markets.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 struggled for direction Thursday, as investors piled into defensive sectors of the market amid ongoing concern Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will add to the red-hot pace of inflation that could hurt the economy.
The S&P 500 fell 0.64%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4%, or 119 points, the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.7%.
Utilities, a defensive corner of the market, was the biggest sector gainer as investors mulled the prospect of further inflation pressures following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as prices for oil, wheat and precious metals trend higher.
The five-year breakeven rate on Treasury inflation protected securities – a closely watched gauge of inflation expectations -- jumped  to 3.23%, a record high.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ben & Jerry's was sued on Thursday by its longtime Israeli ice cream manufacturer, which said the company illegally severed their 34-year relationship after halting sales in Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories.
Avi Zinger said Ben & Jerry's refused to renew the license for his American Quality Products Ltd because he would not abide by the company's decision to stop selling its products in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and parts of East Jerusalem.
Ben & Jerry's and its parent Unilever (NYSE:UL) Plc declined to comment on the lawsuit, which was filed with the U.S. District Court in Newark, New Jersey.
Founded in 1978 by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield in a renovated gas station, Ben & Jerry's has long positioned itself as socially conscious, and retained independence to pursue that mission after being acquired by Unilever in 2000.
But the sales boycott announced in July sparked a backlash, including divestments by pension funds and accusations of anti-Semitism by some Jewish groups.
According to Thursday's complaint, Ben & Jerry's had ""repeatedly promised"" Zinger it would renew its license with his 169-employee company beyond its scheduled Dec. 31, 2022 expiration, but caved to pressure from Israel's opponents.
Zinger, an Israeli citizen, said the only reason for the reversal was his ""refusal to comply with their unlawful demand that plaintiffs violate Israeli law by boycotting parts of Israel.""
His lawsuit seeks an injunction maintaining the status quo until the case is resolved, plus unspecified damages.
Most countries consider Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories illegal, which Israel disputes.
In announcing the boycott, Ben & Jerry's said selling ice cream in those territories was ""inconsistent with our values.""
Ben & Jerry's accounts for about 3% of the global ice cream market.
Cohen and Greenfield, who are Jewish, are not involved in Ben & Jerry's operations.

They wrote in the New York Times in July that they supported Israel but opposed its ""illegal occupation"" of the West Bank.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Universal Music Group NV (AS:UMG) on Thursday reported a 19% rise in full-year core earnings for 2021, in line with expectations, due to growing revenue from streaming services and ad-supported social media platforms.
UMG's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) came in at 1.79 billion euros ($1.98 billion), compared with 1.50 billion euros in 2020.
Analysts had forecast 2021 EBITDA at 1.78 billion euros, according to Refinitiv data. Earnings per share for 2021 were 0.49 euros, the company said.
Universal indicated that EPS was impacted by the fall in value of its stakes in two listed companies, Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) and Tencent Music. 
Universal, the largest of the ""big three"" record labels, represents stars such as Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, The Weeknd and Korean pop stars BTS.
""If you look at subscription and streaming revenue, it continues to grow very well,"" CFO Boyd Muir said on a call after earnings were published, pointing to a 19% rise in the fourth quarter.
That business line accounts for roughly half of the company's sales. Since the mid 2010s, consumers have increasingly adopted paid music subscription music services such as those offered by Spotify and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) . They are also listening to more music in video clips on social media platforms such as TikTok or YouTube. 
Universal receives royalties from both, and those trends have led to a recovery in the fortunes of the music industry, where Universal competes with Warner and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Music. 
""We see a long runway ahead for subscriber penetration, and also for continued growth in advertising monetization"" Muir said.
He forecast a ""strong"" 2022 and said the company would improve margins and grow revenues in the high single digits in the medium term.
Revenue in 2021 rose 14.4% to 8.5 billion euros, beating estimates of 8.4 billion euros.
UMG was spun out of France's Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) in September, in Europe's largest stock market listing of 2021, with shares initially surging from a reference price of 18.50 euros.

They are down about 19% in 2022 amid a broad tech sell-off. Before the earnings were announced, shares closed on Thursday at 19.36 euros.

Generali said that it would be closing its Moscow office and would wind down its Europ Assistance business in Russia, confirming an earlier source-based Reuters report.
Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy's biggest bank, is conducting a strategic review of its presence in Russia, while helping staff in Ukraine leave the country, a spokesperson said.
Earlier, Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) warned of the possibility that Russia could strip the bank of its local operations, in one of the starkest warnings yet from a Western company about the potential impact of the Ukraine crisis.
The French bank, whose $20 billion exposure to Russia is one of the largest among foreign lenders, said it was working to reduce risks in the country.
Generali said in a statement that it will also give up its seats on the board of Ingosstrakh, one of Russia's largest insurers in which it holds a 38.5% stake.
""There are no immediate plans to sell the stake in the short term but the group is assessing its options,"" a source close to the matter told Reuters of the Generali move.
Europe's No 3 insurer said its exposure to the Russian market in terms of investments and insurance business was under constant evaluation. The moves come as Western countries seek to distance themselves from Russian business after President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into its neighbour Ukraine.
Intesa has financed major investment projects in Russia, such as the Blue Stream gas pipeline and the sale of a stake in oil producer Rosneft. It handles more than half of all commercial transactions between Italy and Russia.
CONDEMNATION
With 800 staff in Ukraine, Intesa said it was providing assistance to its employees on the ground by offering accommodation in the other countries where it operates.
In central and eastern Europe, Intesa also has subsidiaries in Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
""We fully condemn what is happening,"" its spokesperson said.
Intesa's credit exposure to Russia was 5.57 billion euros ($6.16 billion) at the end of 2021, or 1.1% of its total, while its subsidiaries in Russia and Ukraine have assets of 1 billion euros and 300 million euros respectively, which together represent just 0.1% of its total.
A UniCredit spokesperson declined to comment on whether Italy's second-biggest bank could take similar action over its business in Russia, where it runs the country's 14th largest bank with around 4,000 staff.
UniCredit, whose exposure to Russia totals 14 billion euros, could easily absorb a full writeoff of its Russian business given its ample capital reserves.
But that would still leave it with some 6 billion euros in cross-border exposure, including loans to large corporates. 

A full write-off of its Russian business would cost UniCredit just over 1 billion euros, sources told Reuters on Wednesday, shaving 35 basis points off the bank's highest-quality capital ratio.

Preorders as of March 1 will not be subject to the new prices, and customers who canceled orders can reinstate them with the original price, Chief Executive Officer RJ Scaringe said in a letter to clients on Thursday.
The Amazon-backed company on March 1 increased the base price of the Rivian R1T electric pickup to about $79,500 from $67,500, while the R1S SUV went to $84,500 from $70,000. 
The price hike spurred some customers to cancel orders and express frustration, accusing the company of ""betraying"" its early supporters, according to social media postings.
""It was wrong and we broke your trust in Rivian,"" Scaringe wrote.
""I have made a lot of mistakes since starting Rivian more than 12 years ago, but this one has been the most painful.""
Rivian stock, which plunged over 13% on Wednesday, extended losses on Thursday, down 4%. 
Scaringe reiterated that the price increase was prompted by inflationary pressures and higher component costs.
Average new vehicle pricing across the United States has risen more than 30% since 2018 when it started to receive preorders for the RIT, he said. 
Rivian reservation holders welcomed the move. 
""I'm back on with Rivian. Super sincere apology from RJ and they are making it all good,"" Zach Jump-Start Marino, who canceled his pre-order after the price increase, said.
""100% trust and confidence restored. This is the right move,"" Zack Nelson, who made a reservation for R1T in 2018, tweeted. 

The new prices will remain in place for orders placed after the announcement. 
""We think the damage has been done and many customers will be purchasing EVs from competitors instead,"" said Garrett Nelson, analyst at CFRA Research.

The agreement is the latest sign of corporate and government interest in offshore wind as a new domestic industry that will help reduce climate-warming emissions and create thousands of jobs. New York has a goal of developing 9 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035, enough to power up to 6 million homes.
Norway's Equinor and Britain's bp said in a statement that they would spend up to $250 million on upgrading the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal. The waterfront site was chosen because it is the only such facility in the New York City area that could accommodate the scale of offshore wind components, the companies said.
The commitment to using the Brooklyn site and the Port of Albany was part of how the companies won contracts with the state earlier this year. 
In a separate statement, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said the deal would support more than 1,000 jobs at the complex.
Equinor and bp are partners in the Empire Wind and Beacon Wind offshore wind projects that, combined, will one day be capable of producing enough electricity to power 2 million homes. They are expected to start operating between 2026 and 2028.

Citi shares were down 3% in Thursday afternoon trading while banks stocks in the S&P 500 were down 0.5%.
On Wednesday, new Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser led the bank's first investor day in five years and spelled out details of its biggest restructuring since the financial crisis.
Fraser, citing a key profitability measure, said Citi would deliver a return on tangible common equity of 11% to 12% in three to five years, which would be better than recent levels of around 10% but less than big bank peers producing upwards of 15%.
The target is ""underwhelming"" and the presentation left unclear why Citi expected ""such tepid"" results from its strategy when the bank assumed a favorable economy, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Vivek Juneja said in a note to clients. 
""This raises the question of whether Citi's business mix needs more significant changes,"" Juneja wrote.
Fraser had said she plans no additions to Citigroup's new strategy which includes fixing long-neglected risk and control systems and exiting 14 consumer banking businesses outside of the United States.
The bank could have to write off nearly half of its $9.8 billion Russian exposure under the worst-case scenario, Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason warned Wednesday.

Citing ""the prolonged outlook for sub-par returns"" and ""near-term risks"" to buy-backs, analyst David Konrad of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods downgraded the stock to ""market perform"" even though it is cheap because it trades for only three-fourths of its book value.
Fraser said she was ""very positive about the response"" to the conference in a CNBC interview Thursday.

Analysts had predicted $154.7 million in revenue for the cloud-native platform provider. Instead, the company exceeded expectations, reporting revenue of $162.7 million. 
The number represented revenue growth of 32.8% year over year in the fourth quarter, aided by an increase in subscription revenue. Subscription revenue made up the majority of the revenue number, coming in at $148 million, increasing 31.5% year-over-year.
In contrast, the bottom line fell short of expectations, with an 11 cent loss per share. Analysts polled by Investing.com forecasted a 10 cent loss per share.
The company reported full-year revenue of $592.2 million, up 32.3% year over year, and earnings per share of $0.35 per share.
""I am proud that Anaplan delivered a very strong fourth quarter and finished the year with over 1,900 customers,"" said Frank Calderoni, Chief Executive Officer of Anaplan. ""As we start the new fiscal year, we are well positioned with our growth strategy and the next level of innovation to take advantage of the opportunities ahead.""
First-quarter revenue is estimated to be between $164.5 and $165.5 million.
Following the report,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Michael Turrin increased the firm's price target on Anaplan to $55 from $49, telling investors in a note that the company's results showed better than expected billings. However, Turrin warned that macro volatility concerns persist."

LONDON (Reuters) - A one-time Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker has written an open letter to David Solomon calling on the Wall Street investment bank's chief executive to exit Russia and re-locate staff from Moscow to stay ""on the right side of history"".
Georgy Egorov, a former equity capital markets director who left Goldman Sachs for Swiss rival UBS in 2010, also criticised a message posted earlier this week by Solomon on social media for not condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
""I was so proud, as a Goldman banker in Russia, to have worked on some of the largest transactions globally at the time - the largest bridge loan (Gazprom (MCX:GAZP)), the largest syndicated loan (Rosneft), one of the largest IPOs (VTB),"" Egorov's letter said.
Goldman Sachs on Thursday declined to comment on the letter, but a spokesman confirmed Egorov had worked at the bank.
Russian-born Egorov, who told Reuters he had lived in Britain for the past 23 years, said that Goldman should stop all operations in Russia ""as a sign of protest"" and join in sanctions against what he called a ""criminal regime"".
Russia says it actions in Ukraine are a ""special operation"".
In a message posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Tuesday, Solomon called the invasion of Ukraine ""tragic"", adding that the bravery and resilience of the Ukrainian people were an inspiration.
""Goldman Sachs will continue to take care of our colleagues, support our non-profit partners' humanitarian efforts, and add our voices to all those calling for peace,"" Solomon added.
Egorov's post on the professional networking site, which included a call for Goldman Sachs to relocate staff to London, Frankfurt or Warsaw, has notched up more than 1,200 likes.
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) warned on Thursday of the possibility that Russia could strip the French bank of its local operations, in one of the starkest warnings yet from a Western company about the potential impact of the war in Ukraine.

The bank, whose $20 billion exposure to Russia is one of the largest among foreign lenders, said it was working to cut risks in the country, as European banks review business there amid escalating tit-for-tat sanctions with the West.
Companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Ford and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) are among those to have already cut or pause business in Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, joining a growing list from shippers and carmakers to energy companies.

The U.S. sportswear maker had made merchandise purchases on its website and app unavailable in Russia earlier this week and directed its customers in the country to brick-and-mortar stores instead.
The latest decision covers both Nike-owned and -operated stores.

The company also said its foundation would be donating $1 million to the United Nations Children's Fund and the International Rescue Committee to support relief efforts.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. life sciences company Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN)'s offer to cut prices and allow rivals continued access to its technologies has ""yet to convince"" EU antitrust regulators scrutinising its $8 billion cash-and-stock bid for Grail Inc, people familiar with the matter said.
Such doubts could mean that Illumina may have to sweeten its package of proposed remedies if it wants to win EU approval for the acquisition of the cancer detection test maker which it completed last August but is keeping as a separate company prior to regulatory approval.
The European Commission declined to comment, saying its investigation was ongoing. 
Illumina said it was working constructively with the EU competition enforcer.
""The submitted remedies underscore our commitment to our oncology customers, to whom we have guaranteed continued supply of our products, equal access to technology, and a significant decrease in prices,"" the company said in a statement.
""Illumina will accelerate the adoption of GRAIL's test in Europe years faster than GRAIL could on its own, saving tens of thousands of lives in the EEA (European Economic Area) and billions of euros in healthcare costs."" 
The Commission opened a full-scale investigation into the deal in July last year and warned that it may hurt innovation and competition in the market for cancer detection tests based on sequencing technologies. 
Illumina in January this year sought to address the concerns with its offer of remedies.

Last month, the EU antitrust enforcer temporarily halted its investigation while waiting for Illumina to provide requested information.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is suing to stop the deal. Illumina spun off Grail in 2016 and kept a 12% stake.

MILAN (Reuters) - A Russia-exposed ETF rose by more than 100% in London on Thursday in a sign that some investors see current distressed levels as a potentially cheap entry point for Russian assets, even as the Ukraine crisis intensifies.
Exchange traded funds (ETFs) remain one of the few ways left to gain exposure to Russia in the wake of Western sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, as they continue trading even if liquidity in the underlying asset dries up, although this makes it difficult to estimate the correct value.
The Moscow bourse has been closed for four days in a row and Russian stocks and bonds are now ""in the realms of utterly uninvestable"", said Peter Harrison, CEO of  Schroders  (LON:SDR).
Like other asset managers, Schroders has pending sell orders on Russian stocks. 
Despite many investors not touching Russian securities, shares in BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s iShares MSCI Russia ADR/GDR ETF, which tracks depositary receipts of Russian firms like Sberbank and Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) rallied by as much as 106% after hitting a record low on Wednesday.
Nevertheless, the ETF's price is still down by more than 80% this year and volatility is set to remain high until signs of a possible solution to the crisis, with reports of a further round of peace talks on Thursday raising hopes for some.
""The bounce reflects both bargain hunting and also potential belief that some resolution may be in sight,"" Jawaid Afsar, sales trader at Securequity, said.
Like other exchange-traded funds exposed to Russia, the iShares ETF has temporarily suspended the creation of new shares, while the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) have frozen trading in several depositary receipts. 
DON'T TOUCH
Trading in U.S.-listed Van Eck Russia ETF, meanwhile, has drawn comparisons to last year's frenzied buying of meme stocks. Analysts said its sharp fall had stoked interest, much of it driven by retail investors.
A number of social trading platforms in Europe had already halted trading in Russian stocks this week before they were suspended by the LSE, sparking outrage among retail investors seeking to buy what they viewed as bargains.
Social trading brokerage eToro, which froze buy orders on some Russian stocks earlier this week, said on Thursday it could close positions in certain instruments and would do so at the end of business on Friday for Russian retailer Magnit.
Before the suspension, eToro saw interest in Russian exposed stocks rise among its users.

But mainstream investors are staying on the sidelines.
""No brokerage is trading these names anymore as there is no upside ... We are under strict rules to not touch Russian equities or bonds,"" said Sebastian Marland, equity analyst at Dutch institutional brokerage AFS Group.

Investing.com -- A few days after announcing price increases,  Rivian Automotive  Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) has backtracked, stating they ""broke the trust we have worked to build with you.""
Whether this will help calm the backlash is yet to be determined. However, Rivian shares have continued to fall Thursday, down 3%, adding to Wednesday's 13% decline. 
On Tuesday, the electric vehicle company angered customers by revealing it has increased the selling prices of its vehicles by about 20% due to inflationary pressures and higher component costs. The price increases affected most customers who had already placed preorders for the vehicles.
However, just two days later, Rivian has backtracked. In a letter to customers, the Amazon-backed firm's CEO RJ Scaringe apologized.
Scaringe explained that the costs of the components and materials that go into building their vehicles have risen considerably.
""As we worked to update pricing to reflect these cost increases, we wrongly decided to make these changes apply to all future deliveries, including pre-existing configured preorders,"" he explained.
Scaringe continued: ""As we demonstrated earlier this week, trust is hard to build and easy to break. In speaking with many of you over the last two days, I fully realize and acknowledge how upset many of you felt. I have made a lot of mistakes since starting Rivian more than 12 years ago, but this one has been the most painful. I am truly sorry and committed to rebuilding your trust.""
""...For anyone with a Rivian preorder as of the March 1 pricing announcement, your original configured price will be honored. If you canceled your preorder on or after March 1 and would like to reinstate it, we will restore your original configuration, pricing and delivery timing. Our team will be sending an email in the next few days with more details.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A divided U.S. Senate Commerce Committee voted Thursday to send President Joe Biden's nominees to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to the Senate floor for confirmation votes.
U.S. Senator Ben Ray Lujan, a Democrat who suffered a stroke earlier this winter, appeared at the hearing to provide key votes. 
The committee vote on the nominees was 14-14, which means that the full U.S. Senate would need to hold a ""discharge"" vote on the nominations in addition to a final confirmation vote.
Chris Lewis, the head of advocacy group Public Knowledge, said the votes ""are extremely important for getting stalled parts of the technology policy agenda moving with a sense of urgency."" 
Since both the FCC and FTC are split between Republicans and Democrats, confirmation of Gigi Sohn to the FCC and privacy expert Alvaro Bedoya to the FTC would allow Democrats on the commissions to push initiatives that Republicans do not support.
The FCC's plan to reinstate landmark internet neutrality rules that were reversed under President Donald Trump have been stymied by the 2-2 deadlock. The agency also pursues robocallers, assesses telecom mergers to ensure they are legal, and is auctioning spectrum to boost 5G networks and working to expand internet access to unserved areas.
The FTC has filed a major antitrust lawsuit against Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and is investigating Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s proposed acquisition of MGM. It has also proposed a study of how pharmacy benefit managers affect smaller pharmacies and consumers, but Republicans refused to back the effort.

Biden waited more than nine months to designate FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel as the agency’s permanent chair and to nominate Sohn.

The company, which gets about 1% of its sales from Russia and has about 80 employees in the country, said on an earnings call it had initially planned to hire more workers for its own distribution business there, which was set to be operational in July. 
Currently, Brown-Forman sells its spirits and wine through third-party sellers in Russia. The company did not comment on whether it would stop sales in the country.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine entered its second week and more than one million refugees have now fled Ukraine. Many U.S. companies have been withdrawing sales and pausing operations in both countries since the start of the invasion.
Earlier today, Brown-Forman's European peer  Diageo  (LON:DGE) paused exports to both the countries and said its priority is the safety of its people in Ukraine and the wider region.

(Reuters) - Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co forecast annual same-store sales and profit above market expectations, encouraged by strong demand for its pick-up and delivery services as well as sustained home-cooking trends, sending its shares to a record high on Thursday. 
The Ohio-based grocery chain, which also topped estimates for quarterly results, has benefited from Americans increasingly leaning on home delivery services rather than venturing out to stores, with its digital sales in the quarter more than doubling from pre-pandemic levels. 
Kroger has ramped up its online business, from loyalty programs to memberships for unlimited home deliveries, while also opening automated fulfillment centers across the United States to support online orders through its partnership with British online supermarket Ocado (LON:OCDO) Group.
""We are actively encouraging customers to engage with us on our digital platforms, even when shopping in store. That's because when a customer engages with us digitally, they spend more with Kroger,"" said Chief Executive Officer Rodney McMullen.
The company's reliance on automation and robotics has also helped shave costs at a time when margins across the retail industry are being hammered by inflation. Kroger's adjusted gross margin rate rose by 3 basis points in the quarter from last year.
""Kroger is striking the right balance of margin pass through and pricing as it uses its scale advantage to attract and retain new consumers while preserving gross margin rate,"" Evercore analysts said in a note.
The company said it expects full-year adjusted same-store sales to rise in the range of 2% to 3%, compared with estimates for a 2.1% increase, according to Refinitiv IBES. 

Kroger, which operates nearly 2,800 U.S. stores, said it expects adjusted earnings per share of between $3.75 and $3.85 for the year, above estimates of $3.45.
Same-store sales, excluding fuel, climbed 4% in the quarter, topping expectations for a 2.84% rise.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - IKEA, the world's biggest furniture brand, is closing its stores in Russia and pausing all sourcing in the country and ally Belarus, joining the wave of Western firms curbing business with Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. 
The news, announced on Thursday, came as IKEA store owner Ingka Group's retail manager told Reuters the budget furniture maker now expected to raise prices by an average of 12% this fiscal year, up from 9% flagged previously amid soaring raw material costs and supply chain disruptions.
""The devastating war in Ukraine is a human tragedy, and our deepest empathy and concerns are with the millions of people impacted,"" brand owner Inter IKEA and Ingka Group said in a joint statement. 
""The war has both a huge human impact and is resulting in serious disruptions to supply chain and trading conditions, which is why the company groups have decided to temporarily pause IKEA operations in Russia,"" they said.
Ingka Group, which is also one of the world's biggest shopping centre owners, said its 14 malls in Russia, branded ""Mega"", remain open. 
While a raft of international companies have already halted operations in Russia due to the war and consequent sanctions against the country, IKEA is one of the first to also halt business with Belarus.
""We couldn't offer safety and security of people working in our supply chain - passing the border et cetera was simply too risky. Then, on top of that, the consequences of different sanctions altogether made it simply not possible to operate any longer,"" Inter IKEA Core Business Supply Manager Henrik Elm told Reuters regarding Belarus. 
Inter IKEA is in charge of supply while Ingka Group is the main global retailer with 17 stores in Russia and one distribution centre. In the year through last August, Russia was IKEA's 10th-biggest market with retail sales of 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion), or 4% of total retail sales. 
The decision to pause operations in Russia affects 15,000 employees and Ingka Group Retail Operations Manager Tolga Oncu said in a joint interview with Elm that all staff would get paid, in roubles, for at least the coming three months. 
""The company groups will secure employment and income stability and provide support to them and their families in the region,"" IKEA said. 
IKEA produces chipboards and wood based products at three sites in Russia, and has around 50 direct suppliers in the country that produce a wide range of goods. The bulk of products made in Russia are sold in Russia. 
Goods produced in Russia and exported to other markets make up less than 0.5% of IKEA's products. Most goods produced in Belarus, which is purely a sourcing market for IKEA, are sold in Russia and consist primarily of wood-based products and mattresses and sofas. 
Elm said the decisions were made before the European Union on Wednesday approved new sanctions against Belarus for its supporting role in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Elm said it was too early to say whether Inter IKEA would raise prices further to store owners as a result of the Ukraine crisis. 

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""

Peng's well-being became a matter of concern after she posted a message on social media in November accusing China's former Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli of forcing her into sex. The post was promptly removed and she was absent from public view for nearly three weeks.
In December, the WTA said it would suspend events in China, a decision which could cost the women's tour hundreds of millions of dollars in broadcasting and sponsorship.
The Hologic deal is the first for the WTA since their previous title sponsorship with cellphone manufacturer  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) ended in 2010.
Hologic chairman, president and CEO Steve MacMillan said they were ""proud to stand with the WTA in its commitment to the highest integrity and values"".
WTA President Micky Lawler declined to disclose the terms of the deal but said Hologic had joined the WTA family at a ""pivotal time"".
""I would consider it more a catalyst to the conversation than the deciding factor,"" Lisa Hellmann, a senior vice president at Hologic, was quoted as saying by the New York Times.
""We've been watching very closely some of the brave and really high-integrity moves that the WTA has made almost by themselves.
""And that brought to our attention both the potential need they may have for title sponsorship, as well as really wanting to stand with and support the stance they are taking despite really negative impact on their business.""
Peng last month denied she ever accused anyone of sexual assault, adding that she herself had deleted her social media post that had appeared to make such a claim.

But the WTA stuck to its demand for a formal investigation into Peng's allegations and an opportunity to meet with her privately to discuss her situation.
""For us it's the most important sponsorship of the WTA's history and probably the biggest in women's sports,"" said Lawler.

The stock fell to a low of $47.62 in the session underway today, not far from its 52-week low of $43.63.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Joseph Moore also downgraded the stock to underweight from equalweight while BofA’s Vivek Arya maintained his underperform rating.
According to Moore, the stock should move sideways for the next couple of years. He said there are more actionable opportunities elsewhere and “We do not see a clear positive event path for Intel at this time.""
CEO Pat Gelsinger has been pushing to restore his company’s dominance of the industry. He plans to turn the company into a contract manufacturer, much like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the world’s largest chipmaker. With that aim in mind, Intel has committed at least $120 billion in setting up new capacities to make chips for rivals as well as usual clients like automakers and manufacturers of laptops, mobiles and other gadgets.
While Moore believes in the longer-term turnaround capability in Intel’s core business, he said “. . .The reality is that ramp of fixed costs creates a more ""all-or-nothing"" situation where the company is going to need to succeed in these new businesses - and still turn around their core business - or be looking at long term gross margin and cash flow degradation.""

Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) subsidiary Nord Stream 2 AG had to set up the German division to comply with European energy rules that require pipeline owners to be different from suppliers of gas flowing in them to ensure fair competition.

As of Thursday, a statement on the Nord Stream 2 AG website said it could not confirm that it had filed for bankruptcy.

Veeva reported earnings per share of $0.90, above analyst estimates of $0.87, while revenue came in at $485.5 million, again above the consensus estimate of $480.42 million.
The company sees revenue for the first quarter between $494 million and $496 million, with adjusted earnings per share between $0.91 and $0.92.

Icy temperatures in December and early this year hit mining operations in western Canadian oil sands, the largest source of crude in the country, hurting production at companies such as Imperial Oil (NYSE:IMO) Ltd and Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU) Inc.
Yet Alberta-based Canadian Natural's output jumped 9% to 1.31 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter, allowing it to take advantage of a more than 50% rise in crude prices last year.
Oil prices have continued the rally this year, with global benchmark Brent crude rising above $110 a barrel in recent weeks after Russia's invasion of Ukraine stoked fresh supply concerns.
Canadian Natural's average realized price for oil soared 79.5% to C$72.81 in the quarter to Dec. 31. Brent crude averaged $80 a barrel during the period.
That pushed up adjusted profit to C$2.63 billion ($2.08 billion), from C$176 million a year earlier. Per-share profit of $2.21 was higher than analysts' expectations of C$2.14, according to Refinitiv data.
The company, one of the country's largest oil and gas producers in the country, raised its quarterly dividend by 28% to C$0.75 per share. 
While a smaller hit from winter helped Canadian Natural, its earnings also benefited from the absence of operational problems that have hurt rivals Imperial Oil and Suncor Energy, Eight Capital analyst Phil Skolnick said.

Both Imperial Oil and Suncor Energy missed quarterly profit expectations last month due to weaker production.

Investing.com – American Eagle (NYSE:AEO) stock plunged 13% Thursday after the retailer forecast a decline in earnings for the first half of 2022, hobbled by surging freight costs and the fading impact of federal stimulus.
The retailer faced multiple headwinds in the quarter ended January 29 as the closure of supplier factories in Vietnam stretched delivery times. The apparel chain used pricier air freight to ensure shelves were stocked in the holidays. Notwithstanding those efforts, inventory flow remained uneven, including in its high-margin Aerie leggings business and its namesake American Eagle brand. The high-priced flights cost the company around $60 million out of the $80 million in elevated freight costs.
The company said it is pleased with the early performance of its spring collections but still taking a cautious view of 2022. It expects operating profit for the year to be higher at $555 million at the midpoint of its guidance range with no plans to use costly air freight, according to Reuters.
The company also plans to discount more in the spring season after historically low levels last year when stimulus-loaded customers enthusiastically spent at its stores.
Adjusted profit per share in the fourth quarter was 35 cents on total net revenue of $1.51 billion which rose 17%. Both profit and sales were short of estimates.
Revenue at American Eagle's namesake division posted an 11% rise to $1 billion. Its Aerie line, which makes capes and sarongs, swimsuits and sunglasses, recorded a 27% jump to $428 million.  "

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google from April 4 will require employees back about three days a week in some of its U.S., U.K. and Asia Pacific offices, its first step to end policies that allowed remote work because of COVID-19 concerns.
An internal email on Wednesday seen by Reuters told employees in the San Francisco Bay Area that ""advances in prevention and treatment, the steady decline in cases we continue to see and the improved safety measures we have implemented ... now mean we can officially begin the transition to the hybrid work week.""
Google joins a wave of technology and finance companies that have begun mandating a return to office. While some big employers have embraced voluntary work-from-home policies permanently, others including Google are betting that it is best to push in-person interactions among colleagues.
Google expects most employees will be in offices about three days a week, with some variance by team and role.
Everyone coming to the office must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or have an approved exemption, according to the email from John Casey, Google's vice president of global benefits. Unvaccinated workers without an exemption will be given an option to seek one or apply for permanent remote work.
Fully vaccinated workers will not have to wear masks in Bay Area offices, Casey said.
Google declined to specify the other locations returning to normal on April 4, pending formal announcements to workers at those sites.
Employees not prepared to return April 4 also can seek a remote-work extension, Google said.

Since last June, Google has approved nearly 14,000 employees globally to transfer to a new location or go fully remote, Casey said. About 15% of applications have been denied, he added.
Google largely has restored office perks such as free meals, massages and transit. But while business visitors and meetings are permitted, employees cannot yet bring back families or children to dine or visit with them.

Shares of the company, a big beneficiary from pandemic-era remote-working, jumped 12%, even as holiday quarter sales tumbled more than market estimates on product shortages.
Best Buy expects its $200-a-year Totaltech membership to add $1.5 billion in revenue by fiscal 2025 through fees and enticing customers to make more frequent purchases. 
The program, which offers perks such as access to hard-to-find products, extended warranties and discounts, has added 4.6 million subscribers since its launch in October, and the company expects that to double by the start of 2025. 
""We do not, for 1 minute, believe we hit our peak revenue,"" Chief Executive Corie Barry said on an investor call.
The company forecast revenue of $53.5 billion to $56.5 billion for its year ending January 2025, largely above estimates of $53.51 billion. It reported fiscal 2021 revenue of $51.76 billion.
Evercore ISI analysts said the fiscal 2025 sales outlook is ""much stronger than expected"", while operating margin outlook of 6.6% was also a positive surprise, levels last seen in 1986. 
SHORT-TERM CHALLENGES 
However, company executives said investments in the membership programs would take a toll on profits in the current year.
Demand for laptops, webcams and other computer accessories for home offices - which powered record surges in annual revenue - is also expected to drop drastically this year with the reopening of offices. 

Best Buy estimated fiscal 2023 revenue of $49.3 billion to $50.8 billion and earnings per share of $8.85 to $9.15.

Some Russian banks are being excluded from the SWIFTinternational payments system and, other sanctionstarget the country's central bank to stop it from using itsforeign reserves.
The moves aim to undermine Moscow's ability to weather thewider economic sanctions but they also impact Western bankswhich are exposed to Russia's economy.
In Europe, Italian and French banks have the largest Russianexposure, representing just over $25 billion each at the end ofSeptember, followed by Austrian banks with $17.5 billion, datafrom the Bank of International Settlements show.
The exposure of U.S. banks totals $14.7 billion, accordingto BIS data.
Following are some of the banks with significant Russianexposure.
EUROPEAN BANKS
RAIFFEISEN BANK INTERNATIONAL (RBI) 
RBI has operated in Russia since the collapse of the SovietUnion and its business there contributed almost a third to thegroup's net profit of 1.5 billion euros last year and represents 18% of consolidated equity.
The Austrian lender's Russian bank is the country's 10th-largest by assets, employing around 8,700 staff.
RBI's overall Russian exposure totalled 22.85 billion euros ,more than half relating to the corporate private sector, it saidin its 2021 results presentation.
Russia's central bank accounts for 8% of RBI's exposure tothe country, sovereign entities 4% and Russian banks 2%,based on the presentation. 
The overall figure comprises 11.6 billion euros in customerloans (or 11.5% of group), more than 80% of which are in Russianroubles.
Cross-border exposure to Russia is only 1.6 billion euroswith no parent funding from Vienna. Raiffeisen also holds 2.2billion euros in loans to Ukrainian customers.
Provisions against losses cover 64.3% of RBI's impairedexposures in Russia.
RBI Chief Executive Johann Strobl told Reuters last weekthat the group's Russian subsidiary ""had a very strong liquidityposition and (was) recording inflows.""
SOCIETE GENERALE
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), which controls Russian bank Rosbank, had18.6 billion euros of overall exposure to Russia at the end of last year - or 1.7% of the group total.
More than 80%, or 15.4 billion euros is held locally by Rosbank while cross-border exposure amounts to 3.2 billion euros, including 600 million euros in off-balance sheet items.
Societe Generale started doing business in Russia in 1872, left the country in 1917 and returned in 1973.
The French group's Russian activities in 2021 represented 2.7% of group net income.
The bank said on Thursday it could withstand an extreme scenario where its Russian business is confiscated, which would shave only half a percentage point off its core capital.
Of SocGen's Russian exposure, 41% is to the retail sector, and 31% to the corporate one. Exposure to Russian sovereign entities stands at 3.7 billion euros.
UNICREDIT
UniCredit's overall exposure to Russia totalled 14.2 billion euros as of mid-2021. That includes 8 billion euros in loans extended by its Russian arm.
The rest are off-balance sheet items and cross-borderloans mainly granted by UniCredit SpA towards large corporatesoutside of Russia.
The Italian bank's Russian subsidiary, AO UniCredit Bank, ranks as the country's 14th largest bank. Its 2.3 billion euros in equity accounts for 3.7% of the group's total. 
A complete write-off of the Russian business would cost UniCredit around 1 billion euros, knocking 35 basis points off its core capital ratio.
UniCredit said last week its Russian franchise accounted foronly around 3% of group revenues and provisions covered 84% ofits non-performing exposures.
INTESA SANPAOLO
Italy's biggest bank has financed major investment projectsin Russia, such as the Blue Stream gas pipeline and the sale ofa stake in oil producer Rosneft. It handles more thanhalf of all commercial transactions between Italy and Russia. 
Intesa's loan exposure to Russia was 5.57 billion euros atthe end of 2021, or 1.1% of the total. 
Its subsidiaries in Russia and Ukraine have assets,respectively, of 1 billion euros and 300 million euros, whichtogether represent just 0.1% of the group's total assets. 
Intesa said on Thursday it was conducting a strategic review of its Russian presence.
ING 
The Dutch bank has around 4.5 billion euros in outstandingloans with Russian clients and around 600 million euros withclients in Ukraine, out of a total loan book worth more than 600billion euros.
U.S. BANKS
CITIGROUP INC
The U.S. bank said this week its total exposure to Russiaamounted to nearly $10 billion and it was working to bring it down.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) listed Russia as 21st among its top 25 countryexposures with $5.4 billion of loans, securities and fundingcommitments at end-2021 - 0.3% of overall exposures based on aregulatory filing.

PARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) on Thursday warned of the possibility that Russia could strip the bank of its local operations, in one of the starkest warnings yet from a Western company about the potential impact of the war in Ukraine. 
The French bank, whose $20 billion exposure to Russia is one of the largest among foreign lenders, said it was working to reduce risks in the country, as European banks review business there amid escalating tit-for-tat sanctions with the West.
""The group has more than enough buffer to absorb the consequences of a potential extreme scenario, in which the group would be stripped of property rights to its banking assets in Russia,"" Societe Generale said.
Italy's biggest bank Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY), meanwhile, is conducting a strategic review of its presence in Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, a spokesperson said.  Citigroup  has also warned of losses. 
Bank shares have been battered in recent days amid fears of possible writedowns, lower revenue, weaker economies and sanctions fallout. Their stocks traded mostly lower on Thursday.
Regulators are also preparing for a possible closure of the European arm of Russia's second-largest bank, VTB Bank, amid growing concerns about the impact of Western sanctions on the bank, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
Should regulators decide to close VTB in Europe, it would mark the second failure of a major Russian bank in the region as sanctions squeeze the country's lenders. Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, said earlier this week it was closing most of its European operations.
Many investors in recent days have been trying to sell their Russian investments.
The Russian assets of Norway's $1.3 trillion wealth fund, the world's largest, have become worthless and selling them as instructed by the government will take time, the fund's CEO said on Thursday.
Ratings agencies Fitch and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) have downgraded Russia by six notches to ""junk"" status, saying Western sanctions threw into doubt its ability to service debt and would weaken its economy.
An index of leading European bank stocks was down 0.2% in afternoon trade, after small gains on Wednesday that made only a small dent in steep losses earlier in the week.
Thursday's trading took place as the Ukraine invasion entered its second week, and a day after Moscow claimed to have captured the Black Sea port of Kherson. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""
Societe Generale, which earns nearly 3% of its profit in Russia, has been one of the banks under pressure as the conflict escalates. Its shares traded 1.7% higher, but are down around 20% since the start of the year.
""The group is conducting its business in Russia with the utmost caution and selectivity, while supporting its historical clients,"" it said.
Priorities are ""to reduce its risks and preserve the liquidity of its subsidiary by maintaining a diversified collection of deposits,"" it added.
Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) could face billions of dollars of losses at its Russian business and is helping some of its 200 staff in Ukraine leave the country following Russia's invasion, executives said on Wednesday.
The bank's total exposure to Russia amounted to nearly $10 billion at the end of last year, it said on Monday, far higher than previously communicated.
The  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG) said that applying financial sanctions on Russia would have only a minor impact on its business as it suspended more Russian listings.

LSEG CEO David Schwimmer said the exchange had suspended trading in 28 Russian company listings on Thursday, including energy giants Rosneft and Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) as well as the country's biggest lender Sberbank. 
German bank Helaba said on Thursday it would refrain from making a concrete profit forecast for the year given the uncertainty posed by the Russia situation.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will ban Russian companies from the multi-billion dollar aviation and space insurance market in London, the world's largest commercial and speciality insurance centre, the finance ministry said on Thursday.
Russian companies in the aviation or space industry will be blocked from accessing British-based insurance or reinsurance services directly or indirectly, the ministry said. 
""The UK Government will bring in legislation to prohibit UK-based insurance and reinsurance providers from undertaking financial transactions connected with a Russian entity or for use in Russia,"" the Treasury department said.
""Further details of the legislation will be available in due course.""
The sanctions only apply to aviation and space insurance but the British government has said it is constantly looking at new ways to isolate Russia.
The move on aviation insurance will leave Russian commercial airlines scrabbling to get cover elsewhere. Industry sources say this could include from Chinese reinsurers, while other Western insurers are likely to hold back from the business, fearful of other countries imposing similar restrictions.
The ban could lead to a sharp rise in aviation premiums because of the loss to the insurance sector, an aviation industry executive said.
Russian airline Aeroflot is insured in the London market by a consortium led by underwriter Global Aerospace, two sources told Reuters.
Global Aerospace, which is backed by Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) and Munich Re, did not respond to a request for comment.
Companies from around the world use Lloyd's of London and other businesses operating in London for aviation insurance and reinsurance. 
""We are in regular communications with the UK government and international regulators, and are working closely with the Lloyd’s market to uphold the implementation, at pace, of sanctions applied by governments around the world,"" said Patrick Tiernan, Lloyd’s Chief of Markets.
Aviation is one of the largest sectors at Lloyd's, along with marine and energy insurance.
Marine, aviation and transport at Lloyd's reported gross written premium of three billion pounds ($4.01 billion) in insurance and 1.5 billion pounds in reinsurance in 2020. 

The International Underwriting Association, which represents London commercial insurers outside Lloyd's, was awaiting more detail on the legislation, it said in a statement.

Investing.com – Kroger (NYSE:KR) stock soared 10% Thursday after the food retailer’s fourth quarter sales and earnings comfortably beat estimates, benefiting from its focus on delivering orders right at the doorstep of the consumers.
Sales at the retailer have stayed elevated as the pandemic-induced change in food habits has lasted. More people are choosing to cook at home and keeping stocks of food and other groceries higher than usual. They also prefer to order online, a trend Kroger has caught and is responding to.
In the fourth quarter ended January 29, Kroger teamed up with DoorDash in the Houston and Dallas divisions for fresh floral delivery to customers in less than an hour.
It opened a fulfillment center at Forest Park in Georgia in the latest quarter and plans to open one in Cleveland and another in North Carolina.
Its heft in negotiations with suppliers and increasing automation helped it expand margins at a time when most retailers have struggled with surging costs. Kroger operates nearly 2,800 stores in U.S.
The company said it expects adjusted same-store sales to rise 2% to 3% in the current financial year. Total company sales in 2021 were $138 billion, with identical sales without fuel up 0.2% in 2021.
Total company sales were $33 billion in the fourth quarter while identical sales rose 4%. Adjusted profit per share rose 10 cents to 91 cents to beat estimates. "

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Thursday, supported by hopes that the impacts of sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine will cause the Federal Reserve to be more cautious about withdrawing stimulus from the economy.
The market was helped by unverified reports from Iranian sources suggesting that the U.S. and its allies could sign a deal to lift sanctions on Iran within 72 hours. That turned the crude oil market around on a dime, leading U.S. crude futures to swing from a gain of over 3% to a decline of 1.3% by early in New York trading.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 209 points, or 0.6% at 34,101 points, extending the gains it made on Wednesday in response to Fed Chair Jerome Powell apparently ruling out a 50 basis point increase in the fed funds rate later this month. The S&P 500 was up 0.5% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 0.1%. All three had posted gains of over 1.5% on Wednesday. 
Powell continues with a second day of Congressional testimony in the Senate Thursday. Elsewhere, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester was quoted by newswires as saying that a series of 25 basis point hikes ""puts us in a good place"" to bring down inflation, adding that the situation in Ukraine had increased uncertainty over the economic outlook.
Earlier, the Labor Department had said initial jobless claims fell back toward the 200,000 level last week, reinforcing the belief that disruption to the labor market from the wave of Omicron-variant Covid-19 has largely run its course. At the same time, there was further - albeit older - evidence of inflationary pressures continuing to build in the economy. Unit labor cost growth was revised up to 0.9% in the fourth quarter from an initial estimate of 0.3% while nonfarm productivity growth was left at 6.6%.
Sentiment continues to be dominated by the war in Ukraine, which continued with heavy rocket artillery attacks on cities Thursday. Russia also reportedly completed the conquest of Kherson, a port city on the Black Sea that controls the Dnepr, Ukraine's main waterway. Peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations resumed but appeared unlikely to make material progress, with Russian President Vladimir Putin telling his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron that trying to win time with talks would serve no purpose, and that the invasion (or 'special military operation') would continue ""to the end.""
Among early movers, Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) stock fell 15% after the cloud data warehousing company released disappointing guidance after the bell on Wednesday, while fellow Cloud-company Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) rose 7.6% after posting more upbeat growth numbers. Retailers  Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY) and Kroger (NYSE:KR) both rose over 11% after their quarterly numbers pointed to successful ongoing recoveries from the pandemic.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 1.0% after news that the company and its CEO Elon Musk will stand trial for alleged breach of fiduciary duty over Musk's $2.5 billion pay award in 2018.  That outweighed German reports that Tesla's factory outside Berlin is set to get its final key permits from regulators in the near future. 
Electric vehicle rival Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock meanwhile fell 4.8% to touch a new record low after the company rolled back a price increase it had announced earlier.

By Francesco Guarascio, Michael Erman and Stine Jacobsen
(Reuters) - Western drugmakers and medical device companies warn their plans to keep selling products to Russia may be complicated by economic sanctions targeting the country and its major banks in punishment over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Sanctions levied by the United States, Britain, Europe and Canada against Russia do not apply to medicine and medical equipment, and the industry has a responsibility under international humanitarian law to continue supplying these products, industry trade groups, policy experts and company officials said. International aid groups are pushing to keep critical medicines flowing into Ukraine, where Russian troops are seeking to wrest control of major cities, prompting more than 870,000 Ukrainians to flee their country and millions to seek shelter from air strikes. Already, pharmacies are reporting shortages of medical supplies.. Many Western companies said they will stop selling everything from cars to movies in Russia. Transactions related to medicine and medical devices, as well as food, have been authorized despite U.S. and EU sanctions.
But sanctions that have cut off Russian banks from the international financial system, as well as decisions by major shipping companies to suspend service to the country, could hinder the delivery of medical supplies as well.
The removal of seven Russian banks from the SWIFT international payment system - as well as the ongoing assault on Ukraine - could cause interruptions, MedTechEurope, the European lobby group for medical device companies, said. Without access to that payment system, it becomes more difficult to transact with Russia. ""The freezing of bank transfers could indeed have an impact on the export of medical devices from the EU to Russia, and we are actively looking into the extent of this and will see how the situation evolves,"" the MedTechEurope spokesperson said.
The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations in a statement called for safe passage of medicines and vaccines to people in need in Ukraine, neighboring EU member states and Russia.
The U.S. drug industry group PhRMA said it supports the continued exemption from all sanctions of medicines and the materials needed to manufacture them. 
Under international humanitarian law, everyone has a right to access essential medical services and supplies, including drugs and vaccines, Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University said. ""During times of conflict, this right of uninterrupted access to essential medical supplies has often been violated,"" Gostin said. ""Governments that impose sanctions are also supposed to make an exception for medical supplies. Yet sanctions often disrupt medical services and supply chains."" 
The United States in a general license issued last week authorized transactions related to the export or re-exportation of medicine and medical devices with Russia. It has also issued carve outs for energy-related payments and international organizations, among others.
The U.S. Treasury Department declined to comment on the issue. 
The EU supplied Russia with 6.5 billion euros ($7.23 billion) of pharmaceutical products in 2020, about 8.4% of the region's total exports to Russia, according to Eurostat data. It sent about 1.6 billion euros of medical equipment to the country in the 12 months ended September 2021, according to MedTech Europe.
U.S. government data shows that in 2021, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment represented about 8% of all U.S. goods exported to Russia. It sent $355 million worth of medicines and $157 million worth of medical equipment to the country.
Top shipping group A.P. Moller-Maersk on Wednesday warned that shipments to Russia, including medical supplies, risk being damaged or spoiled due to significant delays at ports and customs. 
Drugmakers including Switzerland’s Novartis, Denmark’s Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) and Lundbeck, Britain's GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) and U.S.-based Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) said they are working to ensure patients have continued access to their medicines.
Novo Nordisk, the world's largest maker of diabetes medicines, said it would do ""all we can to maintain supply in Ukraine and Russia"" but it anticipates sanctions will make that more difficult. It has been sufficiently supplied with medicine in Ukraine over the past week, but has faced issues delivering inside the country due to shortage of truck drivers.
""The supply of medicines may be indirectly affected by sanctions in other areas, and we will do whatever we can to ensure the citizens of Russia receive their life-saving medication,"" Novo Nordisk said in an emailed statement.
Lundbeck, which specializes in treatments for depression, said it will continue to serve patients who need medicine in Russia.

""As long as we can supply medicine to patients in Russia within the current sanctions, we will do so,"" chief commercial officer Jacob Tolstrup said in a written comment.
(This story corrects 18th paragraph to say that Novo has had supply issues in Ukraine, not to Ukraine)

Many senior executives have long relied on smartphone messaging services to communicate with each other, clients and other stakeholders, people familiar with the matter said. Those exchanges are part of an internal investigation that the German lender has kicked off to see if staff communications were in compliance with company policies and banking regulation, the people said asking not to be identified discussing private information.
A Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) spokesman declined to comment. 
Deutsche Bank and the industry as a whole has been on high alert after U.S. financial supervisors in December imposed a fine of $200 million on Wall Street rival JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) for failing to comply with rules requiring lenders to keep records of staff messages for regulatory scrutiny. Since then,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). have also said they’re included in the industry-wide investigation.
Read More: Citi Is Latest to Be Probed Over Unapproved Messaging Services
Banks have been required for decades to closely monitor and save their employees’ business communications but the proliferation of mobile technology and messaging apps has complicated the task.
Deutsche Bank’s internal probe comes amid mounting signs that the lender has been clamping down on employees’ use of private communications. In January, Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing announced a probe into reliance on private email accounts, and issued an internal memo shortly after that warned staff not to delete business messages sent through private channels, Bloomberg has reported. The bank is also working on a new solution to improve storage of WhatsApp messages on company phones. 
The bank already offers software that allows staff to use messaging apps in a compliant way, so the use of such platforms isn’t on its own evidence of a rule breach.

The communications issue adds to a list of legal and regulatory headaches still facing Sewing despite a years-long effort to fix the lender’s controls and improve relations with bank supervisors in Europe and the U.S. Among other things, Deutsche Bank has been rapped by the Federal Reserve and the German financial watchdog BaFin over insufficient anti-money laundering procedures, its asset management unit DWS is facing claims it overstated its sustainability efforts, and the investment banking division is fighting a lawsuit that it mis-sold foreign-exchange derivatives.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto-Dominion Bank beat analysts' estimates for quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by strong trading revenues, although higher variable expenses and weaker growth in interest income than peers left some analysts underwhelmed. 
Net income excluding one-off items rose to C$2.08 per share in the three months ended Jan. 31 from C$1.83 a year earlier and versus analysts' estimates of C$2.04 a share.
While TD's capital markets earnings fell from a year ago due to higher expenses, trading revenues beat expectations -- but to a lesser degree than its competitors. 
TD's ""net interest income growth was weaker than the peer average,"" analysts at CIBC Capital Markets wrote in a note. ""Capital Markets (were) better than expected, but not as good as peers."" 
The results of Canada's second-largest lender round out a strong quarter for the country's Big Six banks, with many reporting loan growth, higher fees and continued strength in trading and investment banking all helping to soften the impact of higher expenses and margin pressures.
Canadian banks' capital markets businesses have been a boon during the pandemic, and continued to flout expectations for more muted results during the quarter, despite outsized earnings a year earlier. 
""I've been wondering, how long does this gift keep on giving? They've been coining (strong) profits for four to six quarters in a row now,"" said Brian Madden, chief investment officer at First Avenue Investment Counsel.
""Prudence would suggest tempering enthusiasm for capital markets,"" he said.
While continued improvement elsewhere, most notably domestic business lending, could offset a smaller contribution from capital markets, rising interest rates may crimp loan volumes, particularly mortgages.
The Bank of Canada raised its benchmark rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday, and flagged more hikes as soon as next month. 
TD reported 14% growth in Canadian business loans from a year earlier and an 8% rise in personal loans, although net interest margins shrank by 12 basis points.
The impact of higher rates on loan volumes would depend on several factors, including the number and pace of hikes, TD's Chief Financial Officer Kelvin Tran said in an interview. 
Even so, ""the fundamentals of the economy are strong and there's a lot of pent-up demand,"" he said. 
TD's U.S. banking unit reported earnings growth of 27% from a year earlier, helped by increased revenues and lower provisions for loan losses.

Earlier this week, TD said it had agreed to buy First Horizon (NYSE:FHN) Corp for $13.4 billion to expand its U.S. presence.

(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) is expanding its crowdsourced fact-checking program by making notes on potentially misleading tweets visible to more people on Twitter, the company said in a blog post on Thursday.
The social networking site launched the project called Birdwatch last year as a novel experiment that asked Twitter users to identify misleading tweets and write notes to provide information debunking the content, which would then be appended to the original tweet. 
Like other social media platforms, Twitter has long been under pressure to do more to prevent false content from spreading among its 217 million daily users.
The notes written by the 10,000 contributors in the Birdwatch pilot program have been kept on a separate website https://twitter.com/i/birdwatch. 
Now, a small group of randomized users on Twitter in the United States will be able to see Birdwatch notes directly on tweets and can rate the helpfulness of the information, Twitter said. 
Over time, Twitter said it aims to expand Birdwatch to additional users in more countries.
Some Birdwatch notes on Thursday addressed misleading content related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine last week. 
A tweet on Feb. 26, which had been retweeted more than 17,000 times, showed an image of British rockstar Paul McCartney waiving a Ukrainian flag while on stage in front of a crowd.

A note appended to the tweet on the Birdwatch site said the photo was taken in 2008 when McCartney performed at an ""Independence Concert"" in Kyiv. 
Twitter said that in a survey, people were 20% to 40% less likely to agree with the content of a potentially misleading tweet after reading a Birdwatch note about it, versus those who saw the content without the note. `

The deal gives HEXO more favourable debt repayment terms, potentially rescuing the company from years-long financial turmoil. 
U.S-listed shares in HEXO were about 17% higher in pre-market trading.
""HEXO has endured a crippling overhang for the past twelve months, due to punitive redemptions and discounted dilutive financings, and we needed to solve this issue in order to make positive progress,"" said Mark Attanasio, chair of the HEXO's board. 
Last year, HEXO disclosed its ongoing concern with its senior secured convertible notes issued on May 27 and noted it may not have enough cash coming in to help pay off the debt.
The latest deal provides Tilray with about C$20 million in interest payments in the first year, adding about 4 cents per share to future earnings, and C$50 million of cost savings, to be shared equally with HEXO, within two years of the completion of the deal.

The notes, which would be purchased by Tilray from current debt holder HT Investments MA LLC, would be amended to permit Tilray to exercise conversion rights at a price of C$0.90 per HEXO share and acquire a significant equity ownership position in HEXO in the future.
Last month, HEXO said it would refresh its board, effective immediately, as part of a deal with activist shareholder Adam Arviv and his fund, Kaos Capital, over concerns over its sliding share price.

The electronics retailer expects revenue in 2025 to be $55 billion at midpoint of its guidance range, higher than estimates. Revenue in financial year 2022 was about $52 billion.
Hopes of growth returning after December 2023 helped overshadow the gloom over the company’s projection of around $50 billion in revenue this year, $2 billion less. At best, revenue will touch $50.8 billion, according to the company’s range.

A quarterly dividend of 88 cents per share, 26% higher, and a new $5 billion share repurchase program are also boosting the stock. The new buyback replaces the previous exercise, which had $1.6 billion remaining in it.
Revenue for the fourth quarter ended January 29 slipped 3.3% to $16.4 billion as several items were missing from the shelves due to global supply chain issues. This impacted supply of high-demand holiday items as well. Omicron-induced staffing challenges in January meant many stores were open for fewer hours, leading to loss of sales.

MILAN (Reuters) - The new boss of  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) set out the virtues of his standalone plan as an alternative to a takeover approach from KKR but shares in the company plunged on Thursday after a record loss and a gloomy forecast for this year.
Newly-appointed CEO Pietro Labriola, who took the helm only in January after a string of profit warnings, said he would pursue a strategy to revamp Italy's telecoms firm centred on a separation of its prized network operations.
An annual loss of 8.7 billion euros ($9.7 billion) forced TIM to suspend dividend payments and rattled investors, underscoring the challenges the debt-laden company faces.
TIM shares tumbled 16% to around 0.29 euros by 1225 GMT, moving back to levels seen just before KKR made its 0.505 euro per share approach in November. That approach valued TIM at 10.8 billion euros.
Based on the current group structure, TIM said it expected EBITDA to be stable over the 2022-24 period after a low-teens decrease in 2022, marking this one out as another tough year.
""We think that the size of FY21 losses leading to no dividends as well as the cautious 2022-24 targets came as a surprise,"" Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) analysts wrote in a research note.
INVESTOR BACKING
Backed by TIM's leading investors Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) and state lender CDP, Labriola pointed out his plans for TIM mirrored those outlined by KKR. Vivendi has indicated it thinks the KKR bid is too low.
""Once KKR expresses interest at that price, you realise that the real value of the company is higher,"" Labriola, a former head of the Brazilian operation, told reporters.
""If we do it internally the value generated can probably be redistributed among all shareholders, majority and minority,"" he added.
The former phone monopoly said late on Wednesday that an assessment by its advisers on KKR's approach would be finalised shortly and the board would then decide on it. A verdict is expected by mid-March, a source familiar with the matter said. 
Separating Telecom Italia's main businesses could ease a deal to merge its fixed network with that of rival state backed fibre optic firm Open Fiber, a move advocated by CDP.
CDP, which controls a 10% stake in TIM to oversee network assets deemed as strategic by the government, owns a 60% stake in Open Fiber.
KKR is already involved in TIM's network asset after paying 1.8 billion euros last year for a 37.5% stake in its secondary network, known as FiberCop.

There has been speculation that KKR could ditch its takeover approach and settle for a strengthened role in the new TIM network business but Labriola said there had been no talks on that with the U.S. fund.

188,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2022 07:52AM ET</span>","Explainer-Russian banks isolated, UK cuts insurance ties with Moscow","By Huw Jones and Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will ban Russian companies from London's multi-billion dollar aviation and space insurance market, the latest restrictions Western allies are imposing to isolate Russia from international financial markets.
Here is a rundown of how Western sanctions already announced impact banks and investors: 
WHAT HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED SO FAR?
Britain's finance ministry will legislate to prohibit UK-based insurance and reinsurance providers, such as those who use the Lloyd's of London market, from undertaking transactions linked to a Russian entity or for use in Russia.
Separately, the London Stock Exchange said it had suspended nearly 30 listings in Russian companies as sanctions begin to bite.
The United States, Britain, Europe and Canada have agreed to remove some Russian banks from the SWIFT global payments messaging system, potentially damaging Russia as well as its trading partners.
The EU has named the seven banks it will excluding from SWIFT on March 12: Russia's second-largest bank VTB, along with Bank Otkritie, Novikombank, Promsvyazbank, Bank Rossiya, Sovcombank and VEB.
Sberbank, Russia's largest lender, and Gazprombankhave not been included in the list because they are the mainchannels for payments for Russian oil and gas, which EUcountries are still buying. The two banks are subject to othermeasures, an EU official said.
EU leaders previously agreed sanctions on Moscow thatthey said targeted 70% of the Russian banking market. 
The bloc also imposed a ban on issuing bonds, shares orloans in the EU for refinancing Alfa Bank and Bank Otkritie,after freezing assets at Rossiya Bank, Promsvyazbank and VEBearlier last week. 
Sberbank, VTB and Gazprombank do not face the EU assetfreeze. 
Refinancing in the EU of Russian state-owned enterprises isalso forbidden, with the exception of some utilities. Securitiessettlement houses in the EU are barred from serving Russiancounterparties, with Euroclear and Clearstream saying they willnot accept transactions in roubles.
The U.S. Treasury Department last week said it was targetingthe ""core infrastructure"" of Russia's financial system andsanctioning Sberbank and VTB. Also on the U.S. sanctions listare Otkritie, Sovcombank and Novikombank and some seniorexecutives at state-owned banks.
U.S. banks must sever their correspondent banking ties withRussia's largest lender, Sberbank, within 30 days. These linksallow banks to make payments between one another and move moneyaround the world. 
Washington officials also wielded the government's mostpowerful sanctioning tool, adding VTB, Otkritie, Novikombank andSovcombank to the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. Themove effectively kicks the banks out of the U.S. financialsystem, bans their trade with Americans and freezes their U.S.assets. 
The U.S. sanctions also target two Belarusian state-ownedbanks - Belinvestbank and Bank Dabrabyt - over the country'ssupport for Moscow's attack.
Britain last week said it would impose anasset freeze on all major Russian banks, including VTB, and stopmajor Russian companies from raising finance in the country.
WHAT NEXT?
Russia's large banks are deeply integrated into the globalfinancial system, and sanctions on the biggest institutions arealready being felt far beyond its borders -- the European arm ofSberbank has been forced to close after a run on the bank.
The U.S. Treasury said its sanctions would disrupt billionsof dollars worth of daily foreign exchange transactionsconducted by Russian financial institutions. Overall, theseinstitutions conduct about $46 billion worth of forextransactions, 80% of which are in dollars.
These sanctions target nearly 80% of all banking assets inRussia.
For the EU, the next shoe to drop would be extending its bans to all Russian banks, including those that are heavily involved in energy-related transactions.
The consequences of that are complex, however, especiallyfor Russia's trading partners. There are concerns about howpayments for Russian energy imports would be made and whetherforeign creditors would get paid. 
Analysts have said that while Russian institutions arebetter able to cope with sanctions than eight years earlierafter Russia annexed Crimea, their scale and thecoordination of current measures will hit hard. 
Shares in Sberbank and VTB tumbled in Moscow before Russianauthorities halted trading to prevent capital outflows.Sberbank's depositary receipts in London fell morethan 90% on Wednesday.
Sberbank has closed most of its European operations and Reuters reported that regulators were preparing for the possible closure of VTB's European arm.
Sberbank has previously said that it was prepared for anydevelopments. VTB said last week it had prepared for the mostsevere scenario.
The Russian embassy in the United States has not replied torequests for comment.
WHICH FOREIGN BANKS ARE MOST EXPOSED?
Many foreign banks have significantly reduced their exposureto Russia since 2014 but several Western lenders have beeninvolved in deals and have other relationships.
Shares of banks with significant operations in Russia suchas Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International andFrance's Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) have fallen sharply.
SocGen, which has a $20 billion exposure to Russia, warned of the possibility that Russia could strip the bank of its local operations.
Raiffeisen is looking into leaving Russia, two people withknowledge of the matter told Reuters this week. An RBIspokesperson said it had no plans to leave Russia.
Italian and French banks each had outstanding claims of some$25 billion on Russia in the third quarter of 2021, based onBank of International Settlement figures.

Austrian banks had $17.5 billion. That compares with $14.7billion for the United States.

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock traded 0.4% lower in premarket Thursday after CEO Elon Musk said he is open to the United Auto Workers union holding a vote about organizing labor at the company, a move he has long resisted.
“I’d like hereby to invite UAW to hold a union vote at their convenience. Tesla will do nothing to stop them,” Musk tweeted late Wednesday.
He has taken aim at the UAW on several occasions earlier.
“Tesla factory worker compensation is the highest in the auto industry,” The Wall Street Journal quoted Musk as saying earlier.
Workers at Tesla, America’s largest car company by market cap, aren’t currently unionized, and the EV-maker has rarely found mention in President Joe Biden’s statements, who otherwise refers to General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F) whenever the need arises. Notably, EVs contribute a fraction to the revenue of the two legacy automakers.
Tesla stock is also under pressure today due to another reason. The company and the CEO face trial on charges that Musk's 2018 pay package was excessive and that the board’s authorization was a breach of its fiduciary duty. The trial will commence at the Delaware Court of Chancery on April 18.
In another development, a positive one, the German state of Brandenburg has called a news conference for Friday at which it will announce its approval to the planned Tesla gigafactory near Berlin.
Earlier, Handelsblatt said the company has secured the approval for the gigafactory.
The decision does not mean Tesla can start car production immediately, the business daily said, pointing to a recent statement by the state environment ministry that the developer needs to fulfill more requirements before the plant can start."

Meta said on Monday it would restrict access to Russian media outlets RT and Sputnik on its platforms across the European Union.
Britain's media regulator Ofcom said on Wednesday it was considering whether RT should retain its licence in the country, after it stepped up investigations into a channel the government has accused of being a tool of a Kremlin disinformation campaign.
""I was very glad to see yesterday that the channel is now officially off air on British televisions after it was shut down on Sky, Freeview and Freesat ... I've written to Meta and Tik Tok asking them to do everything that they can do to prevent access to RT in the UK, as they've done in Europe,"" Nadine Dorries told parliament on Thursday.
""We will not stop until we have persuaded every organisation, based in the UK or not, that is the wrong thing to do to stream Russian propaganda into British homes."" 
In response, RT said it had long stopped expecting any legitimacy or reason in Britain's attempts to curtail media freedoms.

""Now it seems it has forgotten Brexit and is seeking to force influence over the rest of Europe too,"" Anna Belkina, RT's deputy editor in chief, told Reuters.
Britain's government has said an outright ban could lead to reciprocal action by Moscow against the BBC and other British media organisations.

192,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2022 07:36AM ET</span>",Investors warn of unintended consequences as companies cut Russian ties,"By Ross Kerber
(Reuters) - A responsible-investing group representing $10 trillion of assets under management and advisement said companies could be right to cut Russian business ties to protest Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, but urged executives to take care to avoid causing unintended harm to employees, political dissidents or consumers. 
In a statement to be released on Thursday, the New York-based Investor Alliance for Human Rights said companies must consider ending Russian business deals if they cannot avoid contributing to human rights harms. 
However, divestment decisions ""must be scrutinized for any unintended human rights consequences"" said the statement, issued on behalf of more than 200 global members.
Alliance officials said Western companies should do a deep analysis as they decide whether to stay or go, and take steps like protecting workers from retaliation if they join demonstrations against the invasion.
Some businesses like state-owned banks and energy firms might be obvious partners to drop, said Rebecca DeWinter-Schmitt, associate director for the alliance. But, she said, ""It's another thing if you're a company that's primarily producing milk for the domestic market and you decide its too messy and pull out, that could cut food supplies."" 
The statement shows the tensions facing many U.S. and European corporations and investors as companies including Boeing (NYSE:BA), BP (NYSE:BP) and Norway's sovereign wealth fund end business relationships.
Western sanctions against Russia have increased since last week including new export curbs announced on Wednesday.
Russia, which characterizes its action in Ukraine as a ""special operation,"" has responded by raising interest rates and limiting asset sales by foreigners. Some western companies have noted concerns for workers as they pull back.

In a statement announcing its exit from managing oil and gas facilities on Sakhalin Island on Tuesday, for instance, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) said it would careful manage the process and that it had ""an obligation to ensure the safety of people, protection of the environment and integrity of operations.""

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Disruptions to automotive supply chains in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine could impact demand for platinum group metals (PGMs), the chief executive of South African miner Sibanye-Stillwater said on Thursday.
CEO Neal Froneman said supply chain disruptions were his biggest concern as carmakers - key consumers of PGMs - warned they were struggling to obtain crucial wire harnesses normally produced in western Ukraine.
""In my mind the supply disruptions and the impact on demand have got more downside than supply reorganisation,"" Froneman said. 
Fears of a palladium shortage due to sanctions on Russia sent prices of the metal to a seven-month high, but Froneman expected the price volatility to ease as Russian metals find different markets.
""I think their (Russia's) supply will move to friendly countries and the Western world will take up the slack that goes elsewhere,"" he said. 
More of Sibanye's PGM production may be sold into Europe as countries there switch away from Russian metals, he added. 
Sibanye reported a record annual profit as commodity prices surged. Profit rose by 13% in 2021 to 33.1 billion rand ($2.16 billion) but inflation was a key concern. Sibanye's Johannesburg-listed shares were down 1.9% at 1100 GMT.
Sibanye's PGM operations in the United States saw all-in sustaining costs jump by 15% to $1,004 per ounce, as a skills shortage in Montana and high employee attrition rates drove the miner to rely more on higher-cost contract labour.
""We have to change our approach to our expansion plans at Stillwater in the U.S. with a view to making our operations work with the labour that we've got,"" Froneman said in an interview.
He said the company would produce revised plans within a few months.
Asked if that might mean slowing down the expansion, he said: ""Absolutely - if there's a shortage of capacity to fill those positions there's no point in driving up your cost and extracting the resource in a sub-optimal way.""
In its South Africa operations, costs at Sibanye's gold operations climbed by 7%, which the company attributed to above-inflation increases in the cost of electricity and some consumables.
Production at Sibanye's South African PGM operations jumped to 1.9 million ounces, while all-in sustaining costs fell by 5% thanks to synergies from mines being near one another, the company said.
""The higher production has offset the strong inflationary pressures that have impacted the mining sector in general in the SA operations,"" Investec analyst Nkateko Mathonsi said in a note.
Sibanye said its South African PGM mines would produce between 1.75 million and 1.85 million ounces in 2022, while its South African gold mines would produce between 813,000 and 873,000 ounces.
Sibanye, which faces a compensation claim after walking away from a $1.2 billion acquisition of two mines in Brazil, has not raised a provision in relation to the claim, chief financial officer Charl Suyter said.
Froneman expressed confidence regarding Sibanye's position in the legal dispute. After a ballot report showed members of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and UASA unions overall backed a strike at Sibanye's South African gold operations, Froneman said the company would continue to try and avoid a strike, but would not revise its wage offer.
The total vote tally was 8,224 - just over a quarter of Sibanye's 31,000 employees in its gold division.
Froneman said the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) also voted for a strike, though the CCMA ballot did not mention AMCU. 
AMCU head Joseph Mathunjwa did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

The Solidarity union split from the other three unions on Wednesday by saying it had accepted Sibanye's final wage offer of a 5% annual pay increase.

OSLO (Reuters) - The Russian assets of Norway's $1.3 trillion wealth fund, the world's largest, have become worthless following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and selling them as instructed by the government will take time, the fund's CEO said on Thursday.
The fund held investments in Russia worth some 27 billion crowns ($3.0 billion) at the end of 2021, equivalent to 0.2% of its total value, and down from 30 billion crowns a year earlier.
As of March 2, they were likely worth 2.5 billion crowns, CEO Nicolai Tangen told a news conference on Thursday, noting their exact value was ""highly uncertain"" given the Moscow bourse has been shut since Monday.
""They are pretty much written off,"" Tangen later told Reuters.
The fund's Russian assets consisted of shares in 51 companies at the end of 2021. The most valuable stakes were in gas producer Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), bank Sberbank and oil firm Lukoil, which together accounted for two-thirds of the total.
All the investments were in equities, with 80% of them listed on the Moscow stock exchange, 18% in London and 0.6% in New York, a fund spokesperson told Reuters.
On the morning of the invasion, on Feb. 24, the fund's leadership had an investment meeting and ""decided to do very little"".
""We did not freeze the activity but the net activity was very little,"" Tangen said. 
MUST SELL
On Sunday the Norwegian government ordered the fund to first freeze, and then divest its Russian assets. The ban also includes Russian stocks listed in London and New York, Tangen said. 
The fund said divesting would take time as it was unclear when the Moscow bourse would reopen and how trading would work. The fund also needs to ensure it does not sell to individuals under international sanctions.
""So we don't know what the plan will look like,"" said Tangen.
More broadly, the war in Ukraine was ""amplifying"" the risk on financial markets, he said.
""It has an inflationary effect and we see that through energy, food, other raw materials coming from that part of the world and we are seeing it in economic growth. All things being equal, (we see) lower economic growth,"" said Tangen. 
""For companies, the risk is more on the supply chain, with problems ... that could have an effect. We are seeing some car production closed down as a result of this, but that is relatively small (so far).
""(Overall) this is all negative for globalisation."" 
Investing the state's revenues from oil and gas production and managed by a unit of Norway's central bank, the fund is one of the world's largest investors, investing its cash in equities, bonds, real estate and renewable energy projects.

The fund's value stood at 12.3 trillion crowns at the end of 2021, equivalent to $257,000 for every Norwegian man, woman and child.

(Reuters) - Entain will use excess cash on acquisitions this year rather than shareholder payouts, the British gambling firm said on Thursday, as it reported higher annual earnings boosted by the popularity of online betting during lockdowns.
Entain, which owns  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) and Coral betting shops as well as online brands bwin and partypoker, did not declare a dividend for the second straight year after pandemic uncertainties led it to withhold a payout last year.
""The board decided that right now, we want to keep our balance sheet strong and keep our flexibility to continue acquiring,"" Chief Financial Officer Rob Wood said in an interview.
Entain has made seven acquisitions in the last 14 months, compared with roughly one deal per year previously, Wood noted, as it aims to triple the size of its business by expanding into more regulated betting markets and in areas like e-sports and sports betting.
""But, that said, we are absolutely going to resume dividends,"" Wood said, adding Entain would review doing that at a later stage.
Shares in FTSE 100-listed Entain climbed as much as 4.6% on Thursday. They were up 3% at 1,606 pence at 1130 GMT.
The company's core earnings climbed 4.6% to 881.7 million pounds ($1.18 billion) in 2021, topping analysts' average estimate of 874.4 million pounds, according to Refinitiv. Revenue from online net gaming jumped 12% year-on-year.
""As we start 2022 we see retail heading towards pre-COVID levels and online performing in line with expectations against tough prior year comparables,"" Entain said in a statement.
Its results follow a year in which both U.S. rival DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) and casino operator MGM made takeover approaches for Entain, though neither resulted in a deal.

In light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Entain noted it had no operations in either country, although it makes a ""very small amount of revenue"" from Ukraine.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Airlines Co Ltd and ANA Holdings Inc cancelled all flights to and from Europe on Thursday and cancelled or rerouted flights on Friday as well, citing safety concerns following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
ANA also started to cancel some flights due to run on Saturday. 
The airlines, which normally use Russian airspace for their Europe flights, join a growing number of carriers that have cancelled or rerouted flights between Europe and north Asia in the wake of the crisis.
""We are continuously monitoring the situation, but given the present situation in Ukraine and the different risks, we have decided to cancel flights,"" a JAL spokesperson told Reuters.
ANA Cargo's website said the suspension of flights was due to the ""high possibility of its operations not being able to overfly Russia due to the current Ukraine situation.""
Airlines from the European Union and Canada have been banned from Russian airspace in response to their curbs on Russian airlines, but Japan has not made a similar announcement to date.
ANA and JAL operate about 60 flights per week through Russian airspace between Tokyo and London, Paris, Frankfurt, and Helsinki, according to a spokesperson for flight tracking website FlightRadar24.
Finnair, which had initially cancelled its Tokyo flights after losing access to Russian airspace, said on Wednesday it would resume four weekly Helsinki-Tokyo flights with a new route and a flight time of 13 hours, up from around 9.5 hours previously. 
Longer routes by airlines will add to fuel costs and reduce the amount of cargo that can be carried in a tight market for air freight that is exacerbating pandemic-related disruptions in global supply chains.
Korean Air Lines was still flying over Russian airspace on Thursday, according to Reuters monitoring of FlightRadar24, but Taiwanese carriers are now avoiding Russian airspace and are flying over China and central Asia.
Both JAL and ANA cancelled eight flights each carrier had scheduled for Friday. The impacted routes included those to London, Paris, Frankfurt, and Helsinki.
A Tokyo-Brussels flight due to carry vaccines on the return leg will be routed over central Asia, ANA said.

Japan Airlines said it planned to reroute one of its London flights on Friday heading eastward over Alaska, Greenland and Iceland rather than flying the usual westbound route over Russia. The flight will not require a fuel stop.
It cancelled flights to and from Helsinki, Frankfurt, Paris on Friday as well as a second London flight.

LONDON (Reuters) - Russian stocks and bonds are now ""in the realms of utterly uninvestable,"" the chief executive of  Schroders  (LON:SDR) Peter Harrison told Reuters on Thursday, as Western sanctions squeeze Russia's economy after its invasion of Ukraine.
Russia's Ukraine invasion has roiled markets worldwide, sending oil prices rocketing, boosting commodity stocks and triggering a crash in the Russian rouble and share markets as sanctions bite. 
The invasion will ""fundamentally change the nature of Europe for a very long time to come,"" Harrison said, adding that the British money manger's combined holdings of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus-exposed securities amount to less than 0.1% of Schroders' total assets.
Schroders in common with other asset managers has pending sell orders on Russian stocks, Harrison said, with investors currently unable to complete such sales because the Moscow exchange is suspended.
Harrison said the situation for foreign investors is likely to deteriorate further in the coming days.
""My anticipation would be that sanctions get stronger, and the cumulative impact of running down reserves will be felt ever more acutely, so things that are seemingly difficult now will feel impossible in a week's time,"" he said, referring to Russia's currency reserves.

Harrison's remarks came as Schroders separately reported a 19% jump in annual profit before tax and exceptional items on Thursday, helped by stronger performance fees and growing client demand at its mutual funds division.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally lower Thursday, as the conflict in Ukraine intensifies and investors await the release of weekly jobless data.
Fed chief Jerome Powell will also testify for a second day on Capitol Hill after telling a House finance panel on Wednesday that he supported a 25 basis-point rate hike later this month. That soothed investors who had feared an even larger rate increase to combat inflation as the Ukraine conflict sends commodity prices soaring.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 50 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.2%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 45 points, or 0.3%.
The main Wall Street indices closed higher Wednesday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining almost 600 points, or 1.8%, the broad-based S&P 500 rising 1.9% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ending up 1.6%.
However, despite Wednesday’s advance, all three major averages are down more than 4% over the last month, with the bulk of losses concentrated over the last week and the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The conflict has intensified, with Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, suffering heavy artillery and rocket bombardment, while a miles-long military convoy of troops nears Kyiv, the capital. Russian forces have also captured the Black Sea port of Kherson.
Also on the agenda Thursday is the weekly jobless claims report, due at 8:30 AM ET. This comes a day after the ADP private payroll report for February showed companies hired more workers than expected, an indication the economy is on good footing. 
In corporate news, Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) will be in the spotlight after the cloud data warehousing company reported its slowest revenue growth since 2019 in the fourth quarter.
Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) will also be in focus after the software company surprised with an adjusted profit as well as a forecast for stronger revenue growth than last year. It also named Proofpoint (NASDAQ:PFPT) founder Gary Steele as its new CEO.
Earnings are due from the likes of retail store Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and semiconductor Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) after the close.
Oil prices soared to new multi-year highs after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, known as OPEC+, decided to stick with a planned increase in output of 400,000 barrels per day in March, largely ignoring the Ukraine crisis and the associated surge in prices during their talks.
Wednesday's crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed a reduction of just over 2.5 million barrels last week, with stocks at the key Cushing, Oklahoma crude hub at their lowest since 2018.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.8% higher at $112.64 a barrel, after earlier hitting $116.50, an 11-year high, while the Brent contract rose 1.6% to $114.73, having earlier traded above $118, a level last seen in February 2013.

Investing.com –  Thales  SA (PA:TCFP) stock traded 5.5% higher in Paris Thursday after its aerospace business returned to profitability in 2021.
A higher dividend and a buyback announcement are also adding to the gains in the stock. 
The company booked earnings before interest and taxes of 202 million euros ($224 million) in 2021 against a negative EBIT of 76 million euros a year ago. Order intake grew the most in Thales’ aerospace business, by 47% in the year. Aerospace contributes around 28% to the company’s sales, second to defense and security’s 51%.  
The company booked record orders of almost 20 billion euros in the year, closing with a backlog of 34.7 billion euros.
While the company will take a hit of 100 million euros in 2022 sales to Russia and Ukraine, the company’s stock has been bouncing in the wake of the conflict between the two countries on prospects of new orders as more countries raise their defense spending.
The French company said its 2021 operating profit rose to 1.7 billion euros on sales of 16.2 billion, up 5.3%.
Assuming no major disruptions to supply chains in the year and in the backdrop of sanctions on Russia, Thales is expecting its 2022 revenue to be 16.9 billion euro at the center of its guidance range, up 4.3%. Margins are seen higher too.
In addition to December's 0.60 euro per share payout, the company said it will pay a dividend of 1.96 euro and buy back around 7.5 million shares, equivalent to 3.5% of its capital. At its current price of 109 euro, the exercise, to be carried through March 2024, will mean a payout of around 818 million euros. The company did not indicate the price it will repurchase at."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian tax investigation into China's Huawei Technologies has found the telecoms equipment maker manipulated account books to reduce its taxable income in the country, an Indian government source told Reuters on Thursday.
Without naming the company, India's Ministry of Finance said a major telecoms group did not account for income of 4 billion rupees ($52 million) in its books, and showed expenses of 4.8 billion rupees that the firm failed to justify.
A Huawei spokesperson in India did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The government allegations follow raids by its income tax authorities last month at Huawei's office premises in New Delhi, neighbouring Gurugram and tech hub Bengaluru. The residences of senior executives were raided too.
The finance ministry said more investigations were in process. 
The move comes amid escalating tensions between India and China following a border clash in 2020 between the neighbouring nations. In February, India blocked access to 54 mobile apps mostly of Chinese origin, citing security concerns.
Globally, Huawei has been at the centre of a campaign by the United States, which has asked allies to exclude the company from their 5G networks over spying concerns. The company has denied it is a security risk.
In India, the government overlooked Huawei when it named foreign network equipment suppliers allowed to carry out 5G trials in what is one of the world's biggest markets by number of mobile phone users. 

Huawei has also been hobbled by trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. administration on the sale of chips and other components used in its network gear and smartphones businesses.

The Arkansas Teacher Retirement System was the first lawsuit lodged against Allianz in 2020 after the downfall of the $15 billion Structured Alpha funds, a saga that has dogged the German insurer and asset manager for two years.
The pension fund is among a number of big investors that have in recent days filed to confirm that they have settled and withdrawn their suits.
Allianz, which declined to comment, is still bracing for the outcome of U.S. regulatory investigations by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Allianz said last month that it had settled with a number of fund investors, but it didn't provide details about who. At the time, it said that it set aside 3.7 billion euros to deal with the lawsuits and investigations.
Arkansas teachers, which had $1.6 billion in three Structured Alpha funds at the end of 2019, said in its July 2020 lawsuit that it had lost at least $774 million due to ""negligent mismanagement"" of the funds.
The filing, dated March 2, disclosed ""a settlement disposing of all claims"" but didn't announce financial details. 
The settlement was for $643 million, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, which got the figure through the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act.
The Allianz funds used complex options strategies to generate returns but when the coronavirus pandemic sent stock markets into a tailspin in February and March 2020, they plummeted in value, in some cases by 80% or more.

Investors in the funds, which were predominantly U.S. public pension funds, then sued Allianz for a total of $6 billion in damages.
In their lawsuits, investors alleged Allianz had strayed from its stated investment strategy of hedging to limit potential losses.

""Some long-haul planes are now up to 15 hours in the air to reach countries like China, Japan, South Korea,"" said Spohr during a call with journalists on Thursday. 

He said higher fuel costs would be partly offset by ceased royalties to Russia for overflights and that some passenger flights to Asia were worth operating due to cargo capacity. 
Passenger flights in Asia made up less than 2% of available seat kilometers due to ongoing travel restrictions in China and other Asian countries, a steep drop from the 20% they made up before the coronavirus pandemic hit the industry, Spohr said, who described the impact as small.

204,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2022 06:06AM ET</span>","U.S. activist investors, Icahn cry foul over proposed stock disclosure rule","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Katanga Johnson
(Reuters) - Activist investors including Carl Icahn say a U.S. proposal that would require them to disclose 5% stakes in companies days sooner than current rules could make it unprofitable for them to build the large positions they need for successful campaigns. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed the new rule last month in a push to reduce the information advantages that the $18 trillion private funds industry has over retail investors. 
The rule would halve to five days the time investors have to disclose when they have bought at least 5% of a public company. That news often causes the stock to jump as activists like Icahn, Starboard Value and Elliott Management announce they will leverage the stake to push for changes, like selling businesses or adding board members.
Because activists spend millions of dollars on research and legal fees, they say they often need 7% to 9% of a target's stock to make campaigns viable. With the shorter reporting window, accumulating that many shares could be too costly to be profitable. 
The long-term impact of the SEC proposal, activists said, would be to reduce the number of such campaigns, weakening an important force for holding companies accountable to shareholders and making the best use of their capital, which benefits all investors. 
""This is a sad day for many American businesses, which need to replace incompetent chief executives rather than entrench them,"" said Icahn, one of the industry's most successful activist investors with a net worth of more than $16 billion. 
Icahn, 86, has waged battles at corporate giants from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and has recently taken on McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) over how it sources pork and the treatment of pigs. Since 2011, he has invested his own personal fortune.
While Icahn said the rule won't hurt him much because he doesn't need outside money, its potential to dampen returns will be painful for activists who must court outside investors.
The rule is subject to consultation and could come into effect later in the year if finalized by SEC commissioners. 
""This is a step backwards for shareholder governance without any discernible benefit to the market,"" said one prominent activist hedge fund manager.
SEC chair Gary Gensler, though, said activists currently have too long to benefit from material non-public information. 
Other investors should know sooner when an activist has targeted a company, especially since the evidence on whether activists create long-term value is inconclusive, critics said. 
Ty Gellasch, head of Washington-based group Healthy Markets, said activists do play a ""critical"" role in pushing for change but was skeptical the rule would seriously harm them. 
Likewise, Jim Rossman who defends corporations against activists as co-head of capital markets advisory at Lazard (NYSE:LAZ), said the 5% hurdle is not ""magic."" ""Good ideas are valuable in themselves even if an activist owns a smaller stake,"" he said. 
WRONG MESSAGE? 
Still, other investors said the proposal sends the wrong message. As passive index-tracking has allowed most investors to disengage from corporate boards, the market needs more investors willing to spend the time and money ferreting out information and identifying undervalued companies. 
With just $195 billion in assets, according to research firm Insightia, activists are already a tiny fraction of the market. 

""Fewer investors than ever are actually doing the work of analyzing companies and holding underperforming boards and CEOs accountable,"" said Rob Collins, executive director of the Council for Investor Rights and Corporate Accountability. 
""The SEC should be encouraging engaged shareholders to use their rights and their voices to push for value-creative change, not making their jobs more difficult.""

The British government, which owns a stake in OneWeb, said it supported the decision.
""In light of Russia's illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, we are reviewing our participation in all further projects involving Russian collaboration,"" the government said.
A Soyuz rocket carrying 36 OneWeb satellites was lifted onto a launchpad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome on Wednesday, according to pictures issued by Russia's space agency Roscosmos. 
Roscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin said on Wednesday that his agency wanted OneWeb to provide guarantees that its satellites are not going to be used against Russia, according to an Interfax report. 
Without these, Rogozin said Russia would cancel Friday's planned launch from the Baikonur cosmodrome, which Russia rents from Kazakhstan, without compensating OneWeb, the Russian news agency reported.
OneWeb, which will offer broadband via a constellation of 650 satellites, was rescued from bankruptcy by Britain and Bharti Global in 2020. Eutelsat and SoftBank have also invested.

Elon Musk, the billionaire chief executive of SpaceX, has donated Starlink satellite internet terminals to Ukraine, where internet connections have been disrupted due to the Russian invasion.

Investing.com – Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) stock traded 2.5% higher in premarket Thursday after the company surprised the Street with an adjusted profit and followed that up with a forecast for revenue growth, higher than last year.
Total revenue in 2021 grew 20% to $2.7 billion. The company expects this to rise to at least $3.25 billion as demand for security software continues to be elevated in a world still acclimatizing to a hybrid work model. Heightened geopolitical risks is only accentuating demand for such solutions from corporates and institutions.  
On the higher side, annual revenue could even touch $3.3 billion, almost 25% up, according to the company.
“Our team delivered across our platform, observability and security businesses as organizations around the world turned to Splunk to monitor and secure their business-critical infrastructure and applications,” Interim CEO and Chair Graham Smith said in a statement.
Total revenue in the fourth quarter jumped 21% to $901 million with the company counting CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Papa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA) among clients who either boarded for the first time or enhanced their orders. Some of them were renewals.
The company expects a further shift toward a higher margin cloud model to drive its subscription revenue this year. It substantially grew its cloud gross margin in the fourth quarter though total gross margin fell 1.1 percentage point.
The company today named Gary Steele as its new CEO. Steele was the CEO of Portera before he founded his own firm Proofpoint (NASDAQ:PFPT). He has also held various leadership roles at Sybase, Sun Microsystems, and Hewlett-Packard, Splunk said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG) said on Thursday that applying financial sanctions on Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine would have only a minor impact on its business as it suspended more Russian listings.
The exchange reported preliminary 2021 results which signalled it was keeping a lid on costs, helping its shares to leap 13% at the open. They were 5% higher by 0950 GMT.
Britain, the European Union and the United States are rolling out financial sanctions on Russia to prevent its companies from using Western markets to raise funds, prompting exchanges and settlement houses to cut ties with Moscow.
LSEG Chief Executive David Schwimmer said the exchange suspended trading in 28 Russian company listings on Thursday, including energy giants Rosneft and Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) as well as the country's biggest lender Sberbank. 
Russian listings in equity indexes compiled by LSEG's FTSE Russell arm will also be removed, he said.
About eight Russian listings were still trading and their suspension would depend on further sanctions or an inability to maintain an orderly market in them, Schwimmer said.
""The level of sanctions is unprecedented and very dynamic,"" Schwimmer told a media call.
LSEG has 150 staff in Moscow and nine in Ukraine and operations in the two countries account for less than 1% of its 2021 total income of 6.8 billion pounds ($9.1 billion), the exchange said.
'AHEAD OF TARGET'
The exchange, which bought data and analytics company Refinitiv for $27 billion in January last year, said in its results statement that savings from the deal were running significantly ahead of target, with a 151-million-pound run rate in 2021 compared with a goal of 88 million pounds.
LSEG said its costs outlook for 2022 and 2023 remained unchanged, with ""low single-digit"" growth in costs.
""We have produced a strong financial performance, have met or are ahead of all targets and have good momentum into 2022,"" Schwimmer said.
Analysts have worried that integrating Refinitiv would cost more than expected, but Quilter Cheviot equity research analyst Will Howlett said Thursday's results provided much reassurance to investors on costs after disappointment last year.
Adjusted profit for 2021 was 1.82 billion pounds, up 44.6%, with a proposed final dividend of 70 pence per share.
The European Union has said that clearing houses, such as LSEG's LCH unit, will no longer be able to serve customers in the bloc from June 2025 as it builds up clearing capacity.
""In terms of the 2025 deadline, it is our understanding that the European Commission is helping to make the EU a more competitive environment over this time period, and that they do not intend to cut us off in 2025, but are hoping for more competition in the EU,"" Schwimmer said.

 Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), parent of Reuters News, holds a minority stake in LSEG and Refinitiv pays Thomson Reuters for news it distributes.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and India's second-largest retailer Future Group have agreed to talks proposed by the U.S. e-commerce giant, seeking to resolve legal wrangles at the heart of a battle for supremacy in the country's vast retail sector.
The unexpected olive branch extended by Amazon comes days after rival Reliance, the country's biggest conglomerate, began a de facto takeover of Future's assets, seizing control of some 500 stores.
""Amazon which has been in combative mode is now in conciliatory mode,"" said a lawyer involved in the dispute, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Gopal Subramanium, a lawyer for the U.S. company, suggested at a Supreme Court hearing on Thursday that the two sides negotiate, saying the ""whirlpool"" of disputes fought on multiple fronts had been dragging on for too long.
""All that I'm saying is let us at least have a conversation. We cannot allow the spinners' wheel to continue like this. Please consider this,"" Subramanium said. ""We must agree, discuss ... come face-to-face and discuss the best possibilities.""
Future Group lawyer Harish Salve agreed to negotiations, saying ""nobody is winning in this battle."" The judges said the two sides could take 10 days to reach a possible solution.
Legally, Amazon has successfully stalled Future's $3.4 billion asset sale to Reliance since 2020, accusing its business partner of violating certain contracts. Future denies any wrongdoing, but the U.S. firm's position has been backed by a Singapore arbitrator and Indian courts. 
Despite the dispute being before the courts, Reliance has pressed ahead with rebranding the stores and last month began to take possession of the prized real estate after Future failed to make rental payments to it, sources say.
Currently, operations at hundreds of Future Retail stores remain suspended across India due to the takeover by Reliance.
Sources told Reuters on Wednesday that Amazon was planning to file a criminal case against Future for allowing the transfer of assets to Reliance.
After agreeing to the talks, Future's lawyer Salve cited the Reuters article at the Supreme Court hearing and sought assurances that Amazon would not initiate criminal action during negotiations. 

In response, Subramanium said he would advise Amazon ""not to do anything to exacerbate the situation.""
Reliance did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Investing.com – Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) stock plunged 22% in premarket trading Thursday after its projection of a 65-67% growth in annual product revenue left the Street unimpressed.
The outlook means a rapid deceleration for a company that has doubled its product revenue year-on-year for six consecutive quarters. The company recognizes revenue based on the usage of its software platform compared to the usual industry practice of charging a fixed subscription fee, the former being less predictable. 
Demand for Cloud has been booming, though the outlook numbers suggest rising competition from the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).
Product revenue, contributing almost 94% of the company’s sales, climbed 102% year-on-year to $360 million in the fourth quarter and is seen at no more than $1.9 billion in 2022.
The forecast “could be due to saturation of new customer additions at large companies,” Bloomberg quoted Mandeep Singh, an analyst at its Intelligence unit, as saying. Snowflake is likely to move toward finding ways to sell to midsized companies, he said.
Snowflake again delivered a high net revenue retention rate in the fourth quarter, much bigger than the industry average. It was 178% in the quarter ended January 31, and the company attributed this to “continued growth from our largest customers”.
Remaining performance obligations, an indicator of future revenue streams, grew 99% year-over-year to $2.6 billion by end-January.
The company also announced the acquisition of Streamlit, a company that helps developers build and share data applications, in a stock-and-cash deal for $800 million.
Adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter were 12 cents on revenue of $383.77 million.
In the current quarter, product revenue is seen up 79-81%."

(Reuters) - Top Chinese banks are rushing to ensure they can maintain business ties with Russian clients without running afoul of a barrage of Western sanctions, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Western nations are tightening an economic noose around Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, shutting its banks from the SWIFT global financial network and pushing global firms to dump billions in investment.
While the Chinese banking regulator said this week the country would not join the West's sanctions on Russia, some of its banks have stopped issuing dollar-denominated letters of credit for purchases of physical commodities, sources have said.
And now, executives at some leading Chinese banks are exploring alternative payment systems as well as the possibility of passing some of their business to small domestically focused peers to avoid getting caught in secondary sanctions, said two bankers with knowledge of the matter.
Secondary sanctions are restrictions that apply to entities that conduct U.S. dollar business with the underlying sanctioned entity. An entity seen to be violating such sanctions faces the risk of being cut off from sources of U.S. dollar liquidity.
""The sanctions don't apply directly to us and we can loan to Russian entities – but is it wise? Do we approve that loan to that one entity? It's not the best thing to do at the moment, is it?"" said an executive at a Chinese-led development bank.
""The internal perception is that if the sanctions get worse regarding SWIFT, we can find ways around it,"" said the executive, who did not want to be identified.
A potential ""workaround"" is for smaller local Chinese banks to work on transactions that larger peers with overseas business interest have to steer clear of, said a banker at one of the top four state-owned Chinese lender, who also declined to be named.
The executive said his bank had stopped issuing dollar-denominated credit letters for purchases of Russian commodities, but also that he had not seen any impact on yuan-denominated transactions between China and Russia yet.
Big Chinese banks that have business and branches overseas might become very cautious, as Washington and its allies can sanction operations in the Western markets in the event of violations, said Wang Yongli, a former board member of SWIFT.
""Smaller (Chinese) banks that don't have much presence overseas might dare do so as you cannot come to China to sanction them,"" Wang, who is also a former executive director of Bank of China, said on a call with investors on Wednesday.
All bank sources Reuters spoke to for this story declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.
NAVIGATING SANCTIONS
China is Russia's biggest trade partner, buying a third of Russia's crude oil exports in 2020 and supplying it with manufactured products from cell phones and computers to toys and clothing.
However, analysts say the exposure of China's big four state-owned banks to Russia is limited.
Among them, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd is one of the biggest Chinese banks in Russia and the first to provide yuan clearing services there. But even its local business accounted for less than 1% of its total assets as of end-June 2021, according to its semi-annual report.
Amid the sanctions, some Russian firms are scrambling to open accounts with Chinese banks as they look to make greater use of the yuan for trade, sources say.
So far, China does not appear to be helping Russia evade Western financial sanctions on Moscow, but doing so would ""do profound damage"" to China's reputation, a senior Biden Administration official said on Saturday.
Investment bank Natixis said Western economies were less likely to continue to ""engage wholeheartedly"" in China's financial sector if Russia looks at it as a solution to its sanctions.
Some branches of overseas Chinese lenders took immediate action to adhere to sanctions -- Bank of China's Singapore operation has stopped financing deals involving Russian oil and companies.
At others, where sanctions have a less direct impact, internal meetings are being held on the new risks and finding an alternative to SWIFT, though some bankers admit there is currently no feasible replacement.

While there was work in progress to develop an alternative messaging system to SWIFT, it was not yet fully operational, Natixis' Alicia Garcia Herrero and Junyu Tan wrote in the report.
On the issue of whether Russia could effectively use China's own Cross-Border Interbank Payment System to bypass sanctions, Natixis said the Chinese system was illiquid and the number of foreign institutions linked to it remained limited.

214,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2022 04:41AM ET</span>",SocGen warns it could be stripped of Russian business,"By Tassilo Hummel and Lawrence White
PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) warned it could be stripped of its business in Russia, where it has more than 18 billion euros ($19.97 billion) of exposure, in one of the starkest indications yet by a global bank of the potential impact of fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Western banks.
Russia's Ukraine invasion has triggered a barrage of financial sanctions from the United States, Europe and Britain aimed at squeezing its economy, and Western companies have moved to sell off assets in Russia.
""The group has more than enough buffer to absorb the consequences of a potential extreme scenario, in which the Group would be stripped of property rights to its banking assets in Russia,"" the bank said on Thursday.
The comments from France's third-largest listed bank show how banks and other financial companies risk retaliation for these moves, including the possibility Russia could simply seize their assets in the country.
""The group's relatively high exposure to Russia casts a shadow over its outlook for 2022,"" analysts at DBRS Morningstar said on Thursday.
Even without the extreme threat of its assets being seized the French bank is likely to suffer from the economic impact of sanctions and rising defaults as Russian borrowers struggle.
A write-off in Russia could result in a 30 basis point hit to the lender's 13.7% core capital ratio, the DBRS Morningstar analysts said, manageable but likely to put pressure on it to restructure or cut costs elsewhere, as it did after reporting a loss in 2020.
The French bank said its exposure consisted of 15.4 billion euros within its Russian business SG Russia, and 3.2 billion euros outside Russia.
The bank ""continues a detailed monitoring of the situation in Ukraine and Russia"", it said. 
""Societe Generale complies rigorously with legislation in force and diligently applies all necessary measures to strictly observe international sanctions"", the bank added. 
Most of that exposure comes via its 99.97% stake in Rosbank, which has around 13,000 staff and 5 million customers.
Asked whether SocGen intended to exit the Russian market or sell its Russian unit Rosbank, a spokesperson said the group had no comment on the matter.

215,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2022 04:31AM ET</span>",Exclusive - Russian firms rush to open Chinese bank accounts as sanctions bite - sources,"By Samuel Shen and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The Moscow branch of a Chinese state bank has seen a surge in enquiries from Russian firms wanting to open new accounts, a person familiar with the matter said, as the country's businesses struggle with international sanctions after its invasion of Ukraine.
""Over the past few days, 200-300 companies have approached us, wanting to open new accounts,"" the person, who works at the Moscow branch of a Chinese state bank and has direct knowledge of its operations, told Reuters.
He declined to be named or have his bank identified as he is not authorised to speak with media.
It was not clear how widespread Russian demand for new accounts at Chinese banks was, but the banker source told Reuters many of the companies seeking new accounts do business with China and that he expected yuan transactions by such firms to increase.
Western governments are shutting off Russia's economy from the global financial system, pushing international companies to halt sales, cut ties and dump tens of billions of dollars' worth of investments.
China has repeatedly voiced opposition to the sanctions, calling them ineffective and insisting it will maintain normal economic and trade exchanges with Russia.
A handful of Chinese state banks operate in Moscow, including Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (OTC:IDCBY), Agricultural Bank of China (OTC:ACGBF), Bank of China and China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF).
China Construction Bank declined to comment. The other three Chinese state banks did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.
A Chinese businessman with long-term ties with Russia, who also did not want to be identified, said several Russian companies he works with are now planning to open yuan accounts.
""It's pretty simple logic. If you cannot use U.S. dollars, or euros, and U.S. and Europe stop selling you many products, you have no other options but to turn to China. The trend is inevitable,"" the source told Reuters.
As a growing number of Western companies abandon Russia, the willingness of emerging market giants such as China to sustain business relations with Moscow highlights a deep rift over Europe's biggest crisis since the World War Two. That trend could threaten to chip away the dominance of the U.S. dollar in global trade.
FESCO Transportation Group, a major Russian transport and logistics company, said this week it will accept Chinese yuan from customers, after some Russian banks were kicked out of the global financial messaging system SWIFT.
""It's natural for Russian companies to be willing to accept yuan,"" said Shen Muhui, head of a trade body that promotes links between Russia and China.
But small Chinese exporters are suffering from a tumble in the rouble and many are suspending deliveries to avoid potential losses, he said.
The Russian currency dived to a record low of more than 17 rouble to the yuan on Wednesday, having lost nearly 40% of its value against the Chinese unit over the past week.

""Companies will be switching to yuan-rouble business but in any case things will become two, three or four times more expensive for Russians because the exchange rate between the yuan and rouble is also changing,"" said Konstantin Popov, a Russian entrepreneur in Shanghai.
Shen said Russian demand for Chinese goods will nevertheless grow in the long term. ""The key is to solve trade settlement issues"" in the face of sanctions, he said.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Thursday, as the conflict in Ukraine continued and investors digested the potential economic ramifications of surging commodity prices.
By 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.7% lower and the CAC 40 in France dropped 0.1% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 fell 0.1%.
European equity markets recovered to a degree on Thursday, but the overall tone is one of caution after the sharp sell-off that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The conflict has intensified in the last three days, with Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, suffering heavy artillery and rocket bombardment, while a miles-long military convoy of troops nears Kyiv, the capital. Russian forces have also captured the Black Sea port of Kherson.
The conflict in Ukraine could reduce the level of global gross domestic product by about 1 percentage point by 2023 and add 3% to global inflation this year, the U.K.’s National Institute for Economic and Social Research estimated Wednesday, with Europe more exposed than any other region.
European Central Bank Governing Council member Mario Centeno also voiced his concerns, warning that the conflict could lead to a period of stagflation - low growth combined with high inflation - in Europe.
In the corporate sector,  Thales  (PA:TCFP) stock rose 5.6% after Europe’s largest defense electronics company posted a 32% rise in operating income and record cashflow.
 London Stock Exchange  (LON:LSEG) stock soared 9.6% after the exchange lifted its full-year dividend and issued an upbeat outlook for 2022, adding that applying financial sanctions on Russia would have only a minor impact on its business.
On the flip side, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) stock fell 5.6% after the German airline said it could not provide a detailed outlook for 2022 due to the war in Ukraine and the pandemic.
Oil prices soared to new multi-year highs, as a group of top producers did little to alleviate the supply concerns caused by the Russian sanctions at Wednesday’s meeting.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies including Russia, known as OPEC+, decided to maintain an increase in output by 400,000 barrels per day in March, largely ignoring the Ukraine crisis and the associated surge in prices during their talks.
So far, the West has stopped short of targeting Russia's oil and gas exports directly, but the U.S. on Wednesday announced sanctions on Moscow's oil refining sector, further raising fears of supply disruptions, and international buyers remain wary of contracting for Russian oil. Surgutneftegaz, one of Russia's biggest producers, failed to attract a single buyer for its April exports at a tender on Wednesday.
Wednesday's crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed a reduction of just over 2.5 million barrels last week, with stocks at the key Cushing, Oklahoma crude hub at their lowest since 2018.
By 3:50 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 3.8% higher at $114.82 a barrel, after earlier hitting $114.70, an 11-year high, while the Brent contract rose 4% to $117.47, having earlier traded above $118, a level last seen in February 2013.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,934.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1090."
218,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2022 03:11AM ET</span>",Marketmind: It gets real,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Sujata Rao
Minutes from the European Central Bank's February meeting are due later on Thursday but last month's shock hawkish pivot seems like distant history now. 
With Brent crude up some $30 a barrel since mid-February and European gas prices more than doubling in this period, the ECB will be looking with alarm at spiralling inflation expectations; Ten-year German 'breakevens', which reflect future inflation, have jumped 40 basis points since that February ECB meeting. 
Shorter-dated breakevens are above 4%. 
And while estimates vary widely of how the war will impact euro zone GDP, a growth hit is certain and that's dampening the likelihood of near-term policy tightening. 
With markets paring expectations of an ECB rate rise this year, swathes of the regional bond market are back into negative-yield territory. Moves are more pronounced in ""real"" yields - borrowing costs after stripping out inflation -- German 10-year real yields are at record lows below -2%.
U.S. Treasury real yields recovered a touch on Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell clearly signalled a quarter-point rate rise was on the cards at the Fed's March 15-16 meeting. (Though ten-year real yields around -0.9% are still half where they were earlier this month).
Stock markets are reflecting this transatlantic divide, and Citi advise clients to add exposure to U.S. stocks, in particular the tech sector which benefits from falling real yields. But they also remain positive on commodity-heavy UK stocks.
European stocks are opening weaker, despite a strong Wall Street close following Powell's clear signal that a 50 bps rate rise is unlikely. 

The bad news continues to pour in on the Russia front. Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) acknowledged an 18.6 billion-euro exposure to the country. It's further bad news for European banking stocks, already down more than 20% since mid-February.

The airline said it expected significant improvement in operating results for the rest of the year after a challenging first quarter of 2022. 
""We are very sure that air traffic will experience a strong upswing this year,"" said Chief Executive Carsten Spohr. ""Now we are leaving the crisis behind us mentally and - in view of the strong booking figures this year - also in business terms.""
But major uncertainties regarding developments in Ukraine and the economic and political fallout, as well as uncertainties regarding the course of the pandemic, did not allow the company to provide a detailed financial outlook, Lufthansa said.
Moscow has closed its airspace to European and U.S. aircraft after European states and the United States banned Russian flights. 
Airlines are bracing for potentially lengthy blockages of key east-west flight corridors and preparing for further disruptions to its passenger and freight businesses. 
Lufthansa Group, which includes Eurowings, Austrian Airlines and Swiss, plans to offer more than 70% of its pre-crisis capacity this year, rising to 85% for the summer.
The company reported a 2021 operating loss of 2.3 billion euros ($2.55 billion), in line with analyst forecasts. Shares traded 1.4% lower in early Frankfurt trade.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Germany's Merck KGaA expects strong earnings growth this year as its laboratory gear division benefits from drugmakers' efforts to explore new biotechnologies, even as demand related to COVID-19 has probably reached its peak.
In a statement on Thursday, the diversified group predicted strong growth, excluding the effect of currency swings and any acquisitions, for sales and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA). 
""Life Science will remain the strongest growth engine for Merck,"" said the company, which also makes pharmaceuticals and speciality chemicals for semiconductor manufacturers.
Fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA rose 17.6% to 1.46 billion euros ($1.62 billion), slightly below an analyst consensus of 1.48 billion euros posted on Merck's website. 
The Life Science division, mostly comprising businesses previously known as Millipore and Sigma Aldrich, achieved a more than 28% jump in quarterly adjusted earnings on buoyant demand for bioreactor equipment.
The group's strong outlook comes despite a levelling off in demand related to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. 
COVID-related sales accounted for 1.15 billion euros of sales of 9 billion at the Life Science division in 2021, but that contribution will be about 900 million at most this year, according to a presentation posted on its website.

The group is helping biopharmaceutical companies to develop and produce new substances such as messenger RNA, targeted cancer treatments known as antibody-drug conjugates and viral vectors for gene therapies.

GIG, which Macquarie acquired from the British government in 2017, currently has green energy projects under development to generate 35 gigawatts of power.
A number of companies have vowed in recent times to promote the use of clean, renewable energy amid investor pressure to disclose, track and meet emission targets.
Macquarie derives a significant portion of its earnings from its commodities trading arm, and posted record quarterly profits last month due to strong commodity markets.

Corio will be led by Jonathan Cole, who will helm the business as chief executive officer after more than a decade as the head of Spanish electric utility firm Iberdola's offshore wind business. 
Corio will be headquartered in the United Kingdom with offices in London and Edinburgh, and will be active in several European markets as well as Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Australia. It will also explore opportunities to enter the Americas, Macquarie said.

229,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2022 01:26AM ET</span>","Almost all climate-related corporate disclosures are inadequate, CDP says","By Simon Jessop, Tommy Wilkes and Elizabeth Howcroft
LONDON (Reuters) - Just 1% of companies who submit climate change-related data to nonprofit environmental disclosure platform CDP provide investors with the information they need to assess whether they have a credible plan for the transition to a low-carbon economy.
The new data, provided to Reuters, underscores the wide gap between companies announcing ambitious plans to help tackle climate change, and their limited follow-up with a detailed plan that is needed for them to have any chance of meeting their targets. 
CDP has emerged as the world's biggest repository of environmental data submitted on a voluntary basis by companies, which are under pressure from their shareholders to disclose how they plan to navigate the transition to a lower-carbon future. The companies' climate plans and CDP's assessment of them are kept private, unless companies choose to publish them.
CDP analysed submissions from 13,120 companies, representing 64% of the world's market capitalisation, and found that just 135 companies met the grade of disclosing information for all 24 key indicators CDP has judged as vital for a credible plan.
CDP chief impact officer Nicolette Bartlett said in an interview this was ""insane"" in light of the pressure on the business world to help cap global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial norms by mid-century to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change.
CDP's analysis also showed only 4,002 companies -- or 30% of the total -- claimed to have a low-carbon transition plan, not many more than the 3,521 companies with a plan -- or 37% of those analysed -- in the prior year.
""You've got a third of all the reporting companies saying they've got a climate transition plan, and then you've got 1% of companies who've actually disclosed... that are telling the world the right amount of information, to judge whether or not it's a good plan,"" she told Reuters.
CDP's 24 indicators include everything from whether the company board had oversight of a climate plan to whether that plan was linked to chief executive pay and capital expenditure plans. 
Lack of disclosure - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/akvezxezdpr/Lack%20of%20disclosure.png 
Among the G20 group of industrialised nations, responsible for 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions, 4% of companies reported data against all 24 indicators, CDP said.

The worst performing sectors for disclosure globally were transport and apparel, both of which had less than 0.3% of companies disclosing against all the indicators.

230,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2022 01:01AM ET</span>",Third time lucky? Why Banco BPM appeals to UniCredit CEO,"By Valentina Za and Andrea Mandala
MILAN (Reuters) -Italy's third-largest bank Banco BPM has occupied a special place on the wish list of Andrea Orcel since the veteran dealmaker took the reins at UniCredit last April, several sources have said.
Fruitless negotiations with Italy's government over a possible rescue deal for state-owned Monte dei Paschi stopped Orcel from making a move for Banco BPM last year.
The chief executive was about to launch a takeover bid in February when a leak sent Banco BPM shares flying and a few days later Russia invaded Ukraine, derailing his plans for now, sources told Reuters.
A 14 billion euro credit exposure to Russia puts UniCredit in the eye of the storm, keeping Orcel busy.
Yet Banco BPM ultimately remains the perfect domestic target for UniCredit. Here is why.
MARKET SHARE 
Purchasing Banco BPM would help UniCredit catch up with rival heavyweight Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) which has secured more than a fifth of the Italian market with its 2020 surprise takeover of UBI, Italy's healthiest mid-tier bank.
Intesa's 22% market share is twice that of UniCredit, a gap between Italy's top two banks which bankers and analysts consider too wide.
NORTHERN ROOTS
With around 4 million clients, Banco BPM commands a market share of 6.7% nationwide. Its strongest selling-point, however, is that 77% of its 1,500 branches are in Italy's richer north.
Born from the merger of Milan-based BPM with Verona based Banco Popolare, Banco BPM controls 12% of the banking market in Lombardy, Italy's industrial heartland which accounts of a fifth of the country's economic output.
By contrast, UniCredit's Lombardy market share of 6% is widely seen as too small for the country's No.2 bank.
INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY
The prospects of higher interest rates before the Ukraine crisis broke meant Orcel wanted to move on Banco BPM before expected rate hikes got factored into the target's share price.
Analysts say Banco BPM stands to benefit proportionally more than rivals from a tightening in the European Central Bank's monetary policy, but rate increases had not yet been priced in.
Banco BPM calculates that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would generate additional income from its lending business of 430 million euros based on its fourth-quarter data.
PURCHASING POWER
Up until Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Orcel's $18 billion payout promise had helped UniCredit shares gain more than a fifth in value since Dec. 9 when he outlined the bank's new strategy to 2024.
Orcel was keen to capitalise on UniCredit's share price rise which gave him a stronger currency to pay in an all-share deal, sources have said. 

The rally in UniCredit shares and the fact that Banco BPM did not yet benefit from the tightening rate cycle gave Orcel a window of opportunity which has closed for the time being.
UniCredit shares have lost more than 20% over the past week due to the war. ($1 = 0.8815 euros)

231,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 11:46PM ET</span>",Reliance to invest $220 million in Sanmina JV in electronics manufacturing push,"BENGALURU (Reuters) -Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries said on Thursday it would invest 16.7 billion rupees ($220.70 million) to create a joint venture (JV) with U.S.-listed Sanmina Corp for making electronic products in the Asian country.
The JV aims to make hardware for 5G communications, cloud infrastructure, healthcare systems, clean technology, and defense and aerospace, Reliance said in a regulatory filing https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/2ee9f47c-b58e-4741-bf12-e7988ab0a44b.pdf.
The deal comes as India pushes for more investment in the manufacturing sector in a bid to establish the country as a global electronics production hub. India has offered about $30 billion in incentives to woo electronics manufacturers to set up shop in India.
Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance will hold a 50.1% stake in the JV after the investment in Sanmina's existing Indian entity through a Reliance unit. Sanmina will contribute its existing contract manufacturing business to the JV.
The JV will service both domestic and export markets, Sanmina Chief Executive Officer Jure Sola said in a statement.
All manufacturing will initially take place at Sanmina's campus in the south Indian city of Chennai, with an option for expansion in other manufacturing sites within the country.
Sanmina, whose Indian entity Sanmina SCI India Private Ltd raked in revenue of about 12.3 billion rupees for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, looks to scale up its existing footprint in India with the deal. 
Reliance has in recent years diversified away from its mainstay oil business, building its presence in the retail and telecom industries. It last year unveiled an aggressive plan to foray into green energy.

Reliance shares rose as much as 0.7% after the deal on Thursday, before paring gains to trade marginally lower by 0416 GMT.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG joined creditors of Greensill Capital by filing lawsuits in Australia seeking compensation from the country's biggest insurer over the supply chain financier's collapse, court filings showed.
Local media put the total claims at A$300 million ($219 million).
Insurance Australia Group Ltd (IAG (LON:ICAG)) was previously named as potentially exposed to the 2021 failure of Greensill since its former unit BCC Trade Credit sold policies to Greensill, but said at the time it had no liability because it sold its share of the unit two years earlier.
But lawsuits have been mounting against the Australian company, which is best known at home for selling property and car insurance.
Greensill's administrator and U.S. private lender White Oak Global Advisors, which is working with Greensill client GFG Alliance, each filed suit against IAG in late 2021, court filings show.
Credit Suisse then filed two lawsuits against IAG last month, filings show. All four lawsuits were joined together and had their first administrative hearing in the Federal Court on Thursday, court filings showed.
The Australian Financial Review reported that the total claimed by the companies was nearly A$300 million, about half of which was by White Oak. White Oak did not respond to Reuters emails seeking comment.
Credit Suisse was not immediately available for comment. Switzerland's second-largest bank played a pivotal role in Greensill's collapse by suspending $10 billion of supply chain funds soon before Greensill filed for insolvency.

An IAG spokesperson said the company continued to believe it was not liable for BCC policies, that it ""anticipated potential litigation by the administrators of Greensill or other claimants"" and would defend the lawsuits.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) workers at a Staten Island sortation center have been given the greenlight to hold a vote on whether to unionize, according to a labor advocate, in what would be a second potential union election for the retailer in New York.
The Amazon Labor Union has been notified by the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) that it had a sufficient showing of interest to hold a vote, said Christian Smalls, the group's leader and a former Amazon employee.
Smalls said at least 30% of about 1,500 people at the facility had signed cards delivered to the NLRB.
No Amazon worksite in the United States has voted in favor of unionizing during the company's 28-year history. As the second largest U.S. private employer, Amazon has long been a focus for labor advocates who hope that a single union victory will spark organizing efforts across the country.
Amazon said in a statement: ""We look forward to having our employees’ voices heard. Our focus remains on working directly with our team to make Amazon a great place to work.""
The company declined to answer a Reuters query as to whether it would dispute the cards' validity, which could delay or stop an election at the worksite, which is called LDJ5.

Smalls is also leading efforts to organize a bigger Amazon warehouse nearby, JFK8, whose workers will vote on whether to unionize starting March 25. Voting in a third contest - a rerun of last year's failed union organizing campaign at Amazon's warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama - is currently underway.
The series of elections ""shows the power of workers when they come together,"" Smalls said in an interview.

Since July 2021, Russian legislation signed by President Vladimir Putin has obliged foreign social media companies with more than 500,000 daily users to open local offices or be subject to restrictions as severe as outright bans.
Ahead of the March deadline, only a few companies, including Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), had complied.
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last week, which Moscow calls a “special operation,” Western governments have urged companies to push back on Putin in any way possible.
""Our first priority over the past week has been the safety of our employees and to ensure that Spotify continues to serve as an important source of global and regional news at a time when access to information is more important than ever,"" Spotify said in a statement.
Spotify said it has reviewed thousands of pieces of content since the start of the war, and restricted the discoverability of shows owned and operated by Russian state-affiliated media. 
Earlier this week, it also removed all content from state media RT and Sputnik from Spotify in the European Union, the United States and other markets around the world, except for Russia, following similar steps by Meta Platforms Inc's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Sputnik on Wednesday said by email that ""any restrictions on members of the press are blatant censorship and the dirtiest example of freedom of speech violations.""

RT said earlier this week that tech companies removing it had failed to cite any issues with its coverage.
Spotify said it would match employee donations, two-to-one, to support local humanitarian efforts.

Taking on familiar rivals in the highly competitive world of streamed content, CNN will offer the promotional price to those who sign up within the first four weeks. Once the deal ends, the service will revert to a $5.99 monthly fee - the same price as the Fox Nation, the streaming service operated by Fox Corp's Fox News.
The unit of AT&T (NYSE:T)'s WarnerMedia division has invested a reported $120 million and recruited top talent for the new service, including Fox News veteran Chris Wallace, former NPR ""All Things Considered"" co-host Audie Cornish and Alison Roman, an Instagram personality and author of a popular cooking newsletter.
CNN+ will feature live daily news programming, original series, true crime shows and food and travel, CNN said.
The service is poised to launch following recent period of tumult at the cable news network, whose high profile leader, Jeff Zucker, was forced to leave on Feb. 2 after failing to disclose a romantic relationship with a colleague, Allison Gollust. 

The Los Angeles Times was the first to report the pricing and the timing of the debut, which is expected in the last week of March. CNN declined to provide a date beyond previous remarks saying the service is expected to launch in the first quarter.
A veteran television executive, Chris Licht, has been named the new CNN Global chairman and will assume those responsibilities when Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) completes its $43 billion acquisition of WarnerMedia. The deal is expected to close this spring.

237,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 09:33PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Up, Powell Hints at Interest Rate Hikes","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Wednesday morning while bonds fell after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled an interest rate hike liftoff, vigilance on inflation, and economic resilience.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.27% by 9:24 PM ET (2:24 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.58%. The country released its Caixin services purchasing managers index (PMI) earlier in the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.57%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.73%, with the country’s services PMI at 44.2 for February.
South Korea’s KOSPI jumped 1.37% and in Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.69%.
The safe-have demand sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 has eased somewhat. Bonds in Australia and New Zealand fell, while U.S. Treasuries held much of their sharp losses from Wednesday. However, the benchmark U.S. 10-year yield remains below the 2% levels seen before the invasion.
Powell backed a quarter-point Fed rate hike later in the month in his testimony before Congress. However, he added that the central bank could take tougher action if inflation levels do not come down.
The Fed chair managed to “appease risk-markets by ruling out a 50 basis-points hike in March, while simultaneously promising inflation vigilance at following meetings,” Citigroup Inc. strategists William O’Donnell and Edward Acton said in a note.
The Fed is one of several key central banks looking to hike interest rates while monitoring the conflict in Ukraine and the potential economic consequences. The Bank of Canada hiked its interest rate to 0.5% on Wednesday, while the European Central Bank will also release the minutes from its February 2022 meeting later in the day.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard called for a “rapid withdrawal of policy accommodation.” His colleague, Chicago Fed Bank President Charles Evans said monetary policy is currently “wrong-footed” and needs to be upwardly adjusted toward neutrality.
“It’s really time for investors to be prepared for more volatility, especially in the bond markets” as the Fed has yet to commence with balance-sheet reduction, Quadratic Capital Management LLC chief investment officer Nancy Davis told Bloomberg.
Russia’s isolation on the international market continues. MSCI Inc. is eliminating Russian equities from its emerging-markets index, and Russia will be deleted from all FTSE Russell equity indexes. Fitch Ratings slashed the country’s credit rating by six levels to junk, saying that the severity of international sanctions could undermine Russia’s capability and willingness to service debt.

238,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 09:31PM ET</span>",Amazon to shut its bookstores and other shops as its grocery chain expands,"By Jeffrey Dastin
(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc said on Wednesday it plans to close all 68 of its brick-and-mortar bookstores, pop-ups and shops carrying toys and home goods in the United States and United Kingdom, ending some of its longest-running retail experiments.
The news, which Reuters was first to report, marks a turning point for a company that began as an online bookseller and helped drive established rivals such as Borders to bankruptcy. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) said it would focus more on its grocery markets and a department store concept going forward.
After opening its first book shop in Seattle in 2015, Amazon has tried out an array of ideas in retail: convenience stores without cashiers, supermarkets, and a format called ""4-star"" in which it sells toys, household items and other goods with high customer ratings.
Amazon had aimed to reach shoppers in more places and bring its online touch into the real world. Its bookstores would pull from its vast data trove and showcase what people were reading, even the reviews they left on Amazon's website.
But the company's innovations were not enough to counter the march toward online shopping that Amazon itself had set off. Its ""physical stores"" revenue - a mere 3% of Amazon's $137 billion in sales last quarter, largely reflective of consumer spending at its Whole Foods subsidiary - has often failed to keep pace with growth in the retailer's other businesses.
Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said internet-savvy Amazon was right to forgo the niche market of brick-and-mortar book shoppers, as bad a match as electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc opening gas stations.
Pachter said Andy Jassy, Amazon's new chief executive, likely made this call as he reviewed the retailer's myriad businesses since taking the top job in July. ""Retail is hard, and they're discovering that,"" he said.
The company's vice president of physical retail, Cameron Janes, departed Amazon after 14 years in November, he said in a LinkedIn post. Now chief commercial officer at retailer REI, he did not immediately return a request for comment.

Amazon will close its 4-star, pop-up and bookstore locations on various dates and notify customers via signage. Workers will receive severance or can receive help finding jobs at any company stores nearby, such as more than a dozen Amazon Fresh grocery locations it has announced, the retailer said.
Amazon declined to specify how many jobs would be cut.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) -Ukrainians working at Western tech companies are banding together to help their besieged homeland, aiming to knock down disinformation websites, encourage Russians to turn against their government, and speed delivery of medical supplies.
They are seeking, through email campaigns and online petitions, to persuade firms such as internet security company Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) Inc, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) to do more to counter Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""Companies should try to isolate Russia as much as possible, as soon as possible,"" said Olexiy Oryeshko, a staff software engineer at Google and a Ukrainian American. ""Sanctions are not enough.""
He was one of nine tech activists interviewed by Reuters who are of Ukrainian heritage or are Ukrainian immigrants and are responding to a call by Kyiv to form a volunteer ""IT army.""
Many companies have severed Russian ties due to new government trade curbs, but the activists are demanding more.
They are appealing to cybersecurity companies in particular, asking them to drop Russian clients, especially publishers of what they say is disinformation. If that happens, the publishers would be more vulnerable to online attacks.
Igor Seletskiy, chief executive of Palo Alto-based software maker CloudLinux, has pleaded for Cloudflare to drop several Russian news websites.
""Given that even Switzerland took sides, I think it would be an important statement if Cloudflare would do the same,"" he wrote in an email to top executives, which he shared with Reuters.
Cloudflare said it terminated some clients because of sanctions and has begun reviewing accounts flagged in Seletskiy's email, adding that it was proceeding cautiously because cutting ties would jeopardize customer security.
Spurred on by bombs exploding outside his parents' home last week and concerned for the safety of a few of his Ukrainian colleagues who had not recently checked in, Vlad Goloshuk has appealed to a swathe of companies to help pressure Russia.
More than a dozen, among them security and web hosting providers, said they would do what they can. Some have dropped Russian customers or were considering doing so, according to replies shown to Reuters by Goloshuk, CEO of BrightestMinds, a company that helps businesses generate sales leads.
Philipp Lypniakov, who works for Spanish delivery app Glovo and has supported efforts to take down Russian websites, said he hopes the ""IT war"" will protect Ukraine.
Disruptions will send ""a message, starting from average citizens to the high officials that, 'Hey, this is unacceptable,'"" he said.
Ukraine's deputy minister of digital transformation told Reuters Wednesday that the online forces now numbered more than 250,000 people, carrying out their own ideas. This ""IT army"" has already reached over 50 million in Russia, in part through 100,000 phone calls using an automated recording demanding Moscow's retreat, said the official, Alexander Bornyakov.
SUSPENSION OF SERVICES URGED 
At Google, workers including hundreds of Ukrainian heritage have signed an internal letter addressed to CEO Sundar Pichai calling on the search giant to deliver more aid to Ukraine and modify its services such as Maps and advertising tools, according to a company software engineer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Google declined to comment. In recent days, it has barred Russian state media from advertising and distribution tools and increased safety measures for users in Ukraine.
Activists also are looking at ways to disrupt the lives of Russian civilians, aiming to weaken support for the war within Russia. 
An online petition organized by Stas Matviyenko, CEO of restaurant order-ahead company Allset in Los Angeles, has called on U.S. developers of entertainment, payment, dating and other apps to block access in Russia.
Big Tech's financial and supply chain muscle could help, too.

Amazon declined to comment. This week it said it would donate up to $10 million to organizations providing support in Ukraine.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The battered shares of Van Eck’s Russia ETF have attracted a surge of trader interest and drawn comparisons to last year’s so-called meme stock frenzy, as investors seek ways to capitalize on market gyrations caused by the Ukraine crisis.
Designed to track the performance of the MVIS Russia Index, the ETF has tumbled nearly 70% over the last two weeks as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Western sanctions stir massive swings in assets linked to the country.
Van Eck said in an SEC filing on Wednesday the ETF would temporarily suspend the creation of new shares until further notice, citing ""significant declines"" in the value of Russian securities and the rouble.
The ETF's tumble has been a boon for bearish investors. RSX shorts are up $299 million in year-to-date mark-to-market profits, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. 
At the same time, recent volatility has ramped up trading in the ETF's shares and options, much of it driven by retail investors, analysts said.
With the ETF’s price swinging wildly -- it fell as much as 15% before recovering to trade up as high as 6% on the day -- trading volume in the ETF shares jumped to 27 million by 2:30 p.m. (1930 GMT), or about twice the average daily amount, according to Trade Alert data. The ETF closed down nearly 13% on Wednesday.
Options on the ETF were even busier, with 211,000 contracts traded, or four times the expected volume.
Garrett DeSimone, head quant at OptionMetrics, said some of the volume seemed spurred by traders trying to profit from the extremely elevated volatility in the stock.
""These high levels of volatility are extraordinary, causing the VanEck Russia ETF to behave similarly to a meme stock,"" he said.
""It looks as though retail definitely has its fingerprints on RSX options trades today,"" DeSimone said.
Sentiment was mixed, with some traders betting on a quick rebound while others were hoping for a continued slump in the shares, based on the choice of options contracts traded. 
Short interest in RSX stood at just under 18% of the float and totaled $137.8 million, according to S3 data. Shares shorted have increased by 14% in the last 30 days, the firm said. 
""Long RSX shareholders may be looking for long-term appreciation of Russian stocks that are down from 60% to 90% recently, short sellers are getting immediate gratification from their trades,"" said S3's Ihor Dusaniwsky in emailed comments to Reuters.

Russian markets being closed for the third straight day posed another challenge to valuing the ETF correctly, causing the trading price to stray far from its net asset value (NAV) - or the value of each share of the ETF based on its portion of the fund's underlying assets, analysts said.
On Monday, the ETF's shares finished the day at a 178% premium to its NAV, according to VanEck data. ""That makes the trading in the shares that much more speculative,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research.

244,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 07:27PM ET</span>",Environmental groups sue TotalEnergies over climate marketing claims,"By Simon Jessop, Gloria Dickie and Benjamin Mallet
LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - A group of environmental organisations has filed a lawsuit in France against the country's largest energy company TotalEnergies, accusing it of misleading consumers about its efforts to fight climate change.
The claim, which has been served on TotalEnergies and was to be filed before the Paris Judicial Court, concerns the company's ""reinvention"" marketing campaign. Claimants say the campaign broke European consumer law by suggesting TotalEnergies can reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 whilst still producing more fossil fuels. 
Environmentalists have long complained about corporate ""greenwashing"" which they define as marketing or public relations campaigns that attempt to hide pollution or make a company's operations appear more environmentally friendly than they are.
TotalEnergies told Reuters it was implementing its strategy in a ""concrete way"", including through investments and reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, and was acting ""in line with the objectives that the company has set itself... It is therefore wrong to claim that our strategy is 'greenwashing'.""
Launched globally in May 2021, the adverts said TotalEnergies was committed to being ""a major player in the energy transition"" and was aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050.
The campaigners allege the company's plan to continue increasing production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas - key contributors to man-made global warming - was at odds with this.
A report from the International Energy Agency last year said no more new oil and gas fields should be developed from this year if the world is to have a chance of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average by 2050.
Claimants allege TotalEnergies was in breach of the European Unfair Consumer Practices Directive (UCPD), which bans misleading practices that can include promoting false or leaving out relevant information that impacts consumer decision-making.
The case, part of a growing field of legal challenges to corporate climate efforts, was brought by Greenpeace France, Friends of the Earth France and Notre Affaire à Tous and supported by environmental lawyers ClientEarth.
""We need to protect consumers from disinformation PR strategies that leave them trying to tell fact from fiction and delay the urgent climate action we need,"" Clara Gonzales, legal counsel at Greenpeace France, said in a statement.
TotalEnergies has previously said it expects its oil production to peak in the decade before declining, with an increase of around 3% per year by 2026 driven by the growth of liquefied natural gas (LNG), expected at 6% per year.
It plans to spend $13-15 billion a year between 2022-25 and will allocate half to developing new energies, mainly renewables and electricity, and the other 50% to natural gas.
More companies have been making climate pledges to appeal to consumers, and investors and climate activists are increasingly probing their actions to determine whether they can help meet the world's climate goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.
In the case of TotalEnergies, a leading investor group engaging with companies over climate transition plans has also flagged concern over its efforts https://www.climateaction100.org/company/total, including lack of a target to reduce emissions from the use of its products by consumers.

""We've seen a huge rush to adopt this language...even oil and gas companies which have a real challenge to get to net-zero,"" said Thomas Hale, a global public policy researcher at the University of Oxford and co-lead of the Net Zero Tracker Project. 
""Companies who take on these targets are under additional scrutiny to see that they're really walking the walk.""

Steve Burns sold nearly 5.3 million shares, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed. On Tuesday, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said it had sold 7.5 million Lordstown shares in the fourth quarter.
On Monday Lordstown estimated rolling out only 500 vehicles this year, far below its original sales forecast of about 32,000 in the first full year of production.
Burns, who was CEO from Lordstown's founding in 2018 until he resigned in June 2021, remains its largest shareholder with nearly 38 million shares worth roughly $93 million on Wednesday.
He had sold 3.2 million shares in November, at the time worth around $18.8 million. The lockup period for common shareholders ended in October.
Lordstown declined to comment. Two lawyers for Burns did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Burns could not be reached for comment.
Burns resigned following an internal investigation into claims by short-seller Hindenburg Research that Lordstown had misled investors about demand for its vehicles and production capabilities.

Lordstown acknowledged overstating pre-orders for electric trucks, but rejected Hindenburg's accusations it had overstated the viability of its technology and misled investors about production plans.
Lordstown shares have dropped more than 80% since the Hindenburg report in last March.

The apparel chain said it used pricier air freight in the latter half of 2021 to circumvent factory closures in Vietnam, but still faced an uneven flow of inventory in its high-margin Aerie leggings business.
The U.S. retail industry has been wrestling with soaring freight prices for several months, and major logistics operators are expecting congestion, tight capacity and high freight rates to persist well into 2022.
Rival Abercrombie & Fitch Co has also warned of weaker margins in 2022.
Still, American Eagle (NYSE:AEO) expects earnings to improve in the second half of this year as it does not plan to use elevated air freight.
""It's definitely going to be a tale of two halves,"" Chief Financial Officer Michael Mathias said during an earnings call.
The company also plans to discount more in the spring season after historically low levels last year, when the roll-out of federal stimulus checks enabled customers to spend more on its clothes and accessories. 
In the fourth quarter ended Jan. 29, total net revenue increased 17% to $1.51 billion, in line with expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
American Eagle's namesake division posted a 11% rise. Its Aerie line, which makes activewear, swimsuits and bralettes, recorded a 27% jump, marking its 29th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. 

The company also said it was pleased with the early performance of its spring collections thanks to faster shipment deliveries.
Adjusted earnings per share came in at 35 cents, also meeting expectations.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc plans to initiate criminal court proceedings this week against its Indian partner Future Retail for allowing the transfer of assets to a major rival despite a legal prohibition, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
For more than a year, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Future Group have been in a legal stand-off that has stalled Future's $3.4 billion sale of assets to Reliance Industries.
Amazon successfully halted Future's asset sale to rival Reliance since 2020 by citing violation of certain contracts.
Future, India's second largest retailer, denies any wrongdoing. Amazon's position has been backed by a Singapore arbitrator and Indian courts.
Reuters reported this week that Reliance had started to take over around 500 of Future's stores, rebranding them as its own outlets.
Reliance had previously transferred leases of some of Future's flagship supermarkets to its name, but allowed Future to continue to operate them. Reliance has now begun to take possession of them after Future failed to make rental payments to it, sources have said.
Amazon plans to initiate criminal proceedings against Future in a New Delhi court, and to urge the court to order an investigation into the matter, one of the sources, who has direct knowledge of the plans, said.
Two other sources said the lawsuit could be filed as early as this week.
Future, Amazon and Reliance did not immediately respond to Reuters' emails seeking comment.
Amazon will allege that Future concealed information during legal proceedings and allegedly transferred leases of its stores to rival Reliance, even though a Singapore arbitrator had halted any transfer or disposal of assets in the ongoing dispute, the first source added.
""This is going to be Amazon's last attempt (to stop the deal),"" said this source. 
The plan to start criminal court proceedings would mark a significant escalation in the legal battle between Amazon and its Indian retail rivals - Future Retail and Reliance, which is led by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani.
The protracted fight over Future's assets is seen as a battle for retail supremacy between Reliance and Amazon in India's booming retail market. 

In blocking the Future-Reliance transaction, Amazon has long argued that Future violated the terms of a 2019 deal in which the U.S. company invested $200 million in part of the Indian company. 
Debt-laden Future has previously said Amazon is incorrectly interfering in its retail business.

By Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union said on Wednesday it was excluding seven Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system, but stopped short of including those handling energy payments, in the latest sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
Russia's second-largest bank VTB, Bank Otkritie, Novikombank, Promsvyazbank, Bank Rossiya, Sovcombank and VEB will each be given 10 days to wind-down their SWIFT operations, the EU said in its official journal.
SWIFT is the dominant messaging system underpinning global financial transactions and the EU, the United States, Britain and Canada moved on Saturday to block certain Russian banks from it, but had not said which would be hit.
The United States and Britain had been pushing for the SWIFT ban, but some in the euro zone had taken some persuading given the region's reliance on Russian energy exports. 
Removing Russian banks from SWIFT, a measure seen as drastic and unlikely only a week ago, is one of the most powerful tools Western authorities have used to punish Russia for what Moscow describes as a ""special operation"" in Ukraine.
A senior EU official said the banks were chosen based on their connections to the Russian state, with public banks already sanctioned after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.
""All these banks that we have listed under SWIFT... they are all based on their connection to the state and the implicit connection to the war effort. We have not gone for a blanket ban across the whole banking system,"" the official said.
Sberbank, Russia's largest lender, and Gazprombank were not included because they are the main channels for payments for Russian oil and gas, which EU countries are still buying despite the conflict in Ukraine.
The EU official added that these two Russian banks were nevertheless subject to other measures. 
Officials have been concerned about disrupting energy flows to Europe and the official said it was not possible simply to allow energy-related transactions and exclude others as SWIFT was unable to differentiate between types of payments. 
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said the decision to exclude Sberbank and Gazprombank from sanctions due to ""transactions related to energy supplies to the EU"" was unacceptable. 
""As Poland, we demand that all Russian entities, thanks to which Russia finances the war in Ukraine, be effectively and fully covered by sanctions,"" he wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte told a news briefing that more Russian banks could be excluded from SWIFT, which has 11,000 members and no clear global rival.
Although China has set up a system, it remains small, EU officials said, and despite the existence of a Russian system, SWIFT was still used for some 70% of transfers there.
Banks could still carry out transfers through work-arounds such as faxes or bilateral messaging systems, if they existed.
VEB said it was largely focused on domestic projects which were unaffected. For overseas-related businesses it would use SPFS, a messaging system developed by Russia's central bank.
Sovcombank said SWIFT would not impact it because other sanctions had already blocked its ability to make overseas payments. Promsvyazbank said it was prepared for the disconnection from SWIFT and it would not have a significant impact on the bank's operations.

VTB and Otkritie said they would not be impacted.
Novikombank and Bank Rossiya did not respond to requests for comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Capital Group Companies Inc, one of the world's largest investment management companies, known for its American Funds mutual funds, had billions in exposure to Russian companies that have been either sanctioned or curbed by the United States over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to the latest data on the fund's website.
The Los Angeles-based firm https://www.capitalgroup.com, which has over $2.4 trillion in assets under management, according to its website, had $4.55 billion in exposure across its American Funds franchise to Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), Sberbank, Alrosa and Sovkomflot as of Dec 31.
The United States, the European Union, Britain and others have hit Russia with a wide range of sanctions after its invasion of Ukraine. They have also imposed asset freezes, travel bans and other restrictions on numerous Russian individuals including President Vladimir Putin himself.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""
Sberbank’s connection to the U.S. financial system was severed, restricting the access of Russia's largest financial institution to transactions made in the dollar, the White House said https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/24/fact-sheet-joined-by-allies-and-partners-the-united-states-imposes-devastating-costs-on-russia on Feb. 24. The White House's press release said it imposed correspondent and payable-through account sanctions on Sberbank, including 25 subsidiaries. 
Separately, Sberbank, along with Gazprom, Alrosa and Sovkomflot, are prevented from issuing new debt and equity in the U.S. market, which is a key source of capital and revenue generation, limiting the Kremlin's ability to raise money, the White House said.
Funds that hold securities of the sanctioned and curbed Russian companies may find it very difficult to get out of the positions, with few buyers willing to take them on. Sberbank's depository receipts in London are worth barely a cent after a plunge of 99.9% so far in 2022, reflecting concerns over the future of Russia's biggest bank.
Representatives for Capital Group, a closely held company that offers a range of services for institutions and consultants, financial advisors and intermediaries, individual investor and high net worth investors, did not respond to requests for comment.
Separate data from research firm Morningstar, analyzed by Reuters, showed that Capital Group had at least $8.19 billion in exposure to Russia in its equity and fixed income funds according to latest available data. The data was on the top 100 open-end funds and ETFs worldwide.

Among global fund groups, American Funds had the largest exposure to Russia in that list which was ranked in estimated dollar exposure to Russian equities and fixed income. Other significant holders are Vanguard and PIMCO, according to the Reuters analysis of the Morningstar data.
Morningstar data covered American Funds' disclosures at the end of last year and it is unclear if Capital Group exited any of its positions ahead of Russia's invasion.

FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) -European bank shares halted their slide on Wednesday after dropping to their lowest level in nearly 11 months on fallout from the Ukraine crisis, which has forced the European arm of Russia's Sberbank to close.
Russia has shown no intention of stopping its Ukraine attack, which has triggered heavy sanctions against Moscow and led to an exodus of big companies from the Russian market.
U.S. President Joe Biden has warned Vladimir Putin that the Russian leader ""has no idea what's coming"". Russia calls its Ukraine actions a ""special operation"". 
On Wednesday, the European Union said it was excluding seven Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system, but stopped short of including those handling energy payments.
Meanwhile, Sberbank, which reported record profits in 2021, said it was leaving the European market as its subsidiaries faced large cash outflows and threats to the safety of employees and property.
The move by Russia's biggest lender seemed inevitable after its European arm was closed by order of the European Central Bank.
Sberbank operated in Austria, Croatia, Germany and Hungary, among other countries, and had European assets worth 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) on Dec. 31, 2020. Its London depository receipts have plunged 99.9% so far in 2022. ""All sellers, no buyers,"" said one London trader on Wednesday.
Regulators are also preparing for a possible closure of the European arm of Russia's second-largest bank, VTB Bank, amid growing concerns about the impact of sanctions, Reuters reported on Wednesday. 
Credit rating agency Fitch said western European banks' asset quality will be pressured by the sanctions fallout and that they also face ""materially increased operational risk.""
An index of leading European bank stocks was up 1.39% on Wednesday, erasing early losses that came on top of a 5.6% drop on Tuesday and 4.5% on Monday. Earlier on Wednesday, the index hit its lowest level since April 2021, down 27% from last month's highs.
Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International, which has operated in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union thirty years ago, has been one of the biggest fallers so far this week.
The bank is exploring leaving Russia, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, a move that would make it the first European bank to do so since Moscow's Ukraine invasion.
Raiffeisen shares, which are half the value of a month ago, pared some earlier losses on Wednesday to close down 2.66%.
Some finance officials are trying to reassure markets.
The capital position of Hungary's OTP Bank, central Europe's largest independent lender, is excellent and the bank can withstand further possible market shocks in Russia and Ukraine, Hungary's central bank said in an emailed reply to Reuters. 
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), which has $10 billion in exposure to Russia, could face billions of dollars of losses under the worst case scenario, although it expects its actual losses to be less than that, Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said on Wednesday.
SHEDDING ASSETS
Germany's market regulator BaFin said it was closely monitoring the European arm of VTB Bank, which was no longer accepting new clients.
The bank, headquartered in Frankfurt, had 8.1 billion euros of assets at the end of 2020. 
On Tuesday, Russia said it was placing temporary restrictions on foreigners seeking to exit Russia assets, as it tried to stem an investor exodus.
But investors are continuing to shed assets.  Aviva  (LON:AV)'s fund management business will divest its small exposure to Russia ""as soon as we practically can,"" chief executive Amanda Blanc said on Wednesday.
Financial companies are scrambling to keep up with the situation. 
Dubai's Mashreqbank has stopped lending to Russian banks and is reviewing its existing exposure to the country, Reuters reported.
The move is one of the first reported instances of a bank in the Middle East halting ties to Russia and underscores growing global nervousness about falling foul of Western sanctions.
France's BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) said it was working to maintain its activities as much as possible at its Ukraine arm Ukrsibbank, which has close to 5,000 employees. 

A task force at Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), which has a subsidiary in Russia, is meeting multiple times a day, a board member has said.

252,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 05:56PM ET</span>",U.S. says Ericsson breached 2019 deal by failing to properly disclose Iraq misconduct,"By Supantha Mukherjee, Johan Ahlander and Chris Prentice
STOCKHOLM/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sweden's Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) on Wednesday said the U.S. Justice Department accused it of breaking terms of a 2019 deal with prosecutors by failing to properly disclose misconduct and compliance failures in Iraq.
Ericsson, which has been at the center of a scandal over possible payments to Islamic State, said U.S. authorities determined it failed to make sufficient disclosures about its activities in Iraq before entering a deferred prosecution agreement in 2019 with the Justice Department to resolve a probe into years of alleged corruption in China, Vietnam and Djibouti.
The Justice Department also said the firm failed to make proper disclosures after the deal was signed, Ericsson said in a statement. 
Under the terms of the 2019 deal, the Justice Department agreed to hold off prosecuting Ericsson for three years if it paid over $1 billion in penalties and other fees, implemented ""rigorous internal controls"", complied with U.S. laws and cooperated fully on any ongoing investigations. 
Ericsson Chief Executive Officer Borje Ekholm acknowledged the ""systemic internal control failures"" previously detailed by U.S. prosecutors. 
""We had a culture that didn't allow us to capture wrongdoings,"" he told Reuters, noting the firm has been focused on boosting compliance in recent years.
Details emerged last month about the company's separate issues in Iraq, which have caused Ericsson shares to lose more than a third of their value. Ericsson disclosed that a 2019 internal probe had identified payments designed to circumvent Iraqi customs at a time when militant organizations, including Islamic State, controlled some routes.
Ericsson, which saw shares sink nearly 10% on Wednesday, said it was cooperating with the Justice Department and that it was too early to predict the outcome of the breach, including potential fines. 
""We need to understand what that means in detail. We received a communication last night that there was insufficient disclosure,"" Ekholm said.
A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. 
Ericsson in October disclosed receiving notice of a breach, but did not provide further details.
Ericsson's internal investigation into the Iraq payments ""could not identify that any Ericsson employee was directly involved in financing terrorist organizations,"" the company said on Wednesday.
Though such agreement breaches have been historically rare, the Justice Department has issued such notices in recent months as it seeks to root out corporate misconduct. Ericsson's notice underscores the growing legal risks for corporate actors accused of repeat offenses. 
In October, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco laid out policies that included heightened scrutiny of repeat corporate offenders. The agency has been questioning how broadly to continue deferring prosecutions in exchange for penalties and promises of compliance.

Some applauded the tougher stance from U.S. authorities.
""It's a welcome change, though even more welcome would be for the DOJ to cast aside its failed experiment in routinely granting corporate wrongdoers leniency agreements,"" said Rick Claypool of the watchdog group Public Citizen.

253,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 05:56PM ET</span>",Citigroup sets new targets; analysts remain skeptical,"By David Henry and Noor Zainab Hussain
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Citigroup Inc unveiled a raft of new targets as it laid out its strategy for the next three to five years on Wednesday, but analysts remained skeptical about whether it can successfully execute the plan.
The bank set new profitability targets and gave detail on the revenue and loan growth that will be required to achieve them, but also warned of rising expenses.
The targets were posted as Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser hosted the bank's first investor day in five years, just over a year since she took the helm at the fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets. 
Fraser has been tasked with transforming a business whose share price lagged rivals like JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) during her predecessor Michael Corbat's eight years in charge. 
""We have an urgent need to address the issues that have kept our firm from living up to its full potential,"" Fraser told investors. ""Our business mix is somewhat disadvantaged and that needs to change to drive higher return fees and growth.""
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) also has the largest Russian exposure of any U.S. bank, presenting Fraser with another headache.
The bank could lose billions of dollars on nearly $10 billion of exposure to Russia but expects actual losses to be less than that, Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said.
Turning around the bank's performance would ""take time,"" Fraser said.
Citigroup is aiming for a return on tangible common equity (RoTCE) of 11% to 12% in the next three to five years. That still trails rivals but would be an improvement from its recent performance, and in line with what most analysts were expecting. 
The metric measures how well a bank uses shareholder money to produce profit.
Fraser and other Citigroup executives laid out the bank's plan for growth.
It hopes to be the leading bank servicing companies doing business across borders and a global leader in wealth management, as well as gain market share in investment banking, trading and at its U.S. consumer business, Fraser said.
""All good aspirations and would result in a better and more profitable bank – just easier said than done,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr.
Fraser said her tenure had begun with ""tough feedback"" from regulators, directors and employees about Citigroup's shortcomings.
After Citigroup had spent much of a decade cleaning up from losses in the financial crisis, Fraser said, ""we simply did not invest enough in elements of our operating model in technology and in the associated risk and controls.""
The bank has spent more in the past few quarters to fix issues regulators identified in its controls systems.
Citigroup warned that expenses will rise between 5% and 6% this year, excluding the impact of divestitures, reflecting that ongoing investment and the cost of retaining and attracting staff in a highly competitive environment. 
The new targets ""might be modestly disappointing to the market,"" said Keefe, Bruyette & Wood analyst David Konrad.
Citigroup shares were down 2.4% in the morning after it posted the targets while most other large U.S. bank stocks rose. Later the shares gained as executives took questions and closed up 1.7%, though still less than some rivals.
Citigroup said its expense efficiency ratio will improve to 60% to 63% in the near-term, compared to 65% in 2021. For the medium-term, that metric is expected to be less than 60%, the bank added. A lower efficiency ratio means a company is better at managing costs relative to revenue.
The short-term revenue outlook was also bleak.
For the current quarter, the bank expects a mid-single digit decline in revenue, excluding divestiture impacts.
Citigroup, which said its priority was to return capital, expects to pay dividends of nearly $1 billion in the first quarter of 2022. 
The bank said its outlook for the medium-term includes having revenue growth at a 4-5% compounded annual rate, led by gains in its corporate payments business, as well as global wealth management. 

Citigroup said its targets assume a healthy economic environment, overnight interest rates rising to 2%, loan growth of 6-7% annually, and revenue and deposit growth of 4-5%.
Since Fraser became the CEO, Citi's shares had fallen 11% through Tuesday while the index of S&P 500 bank stocks has gained 7%.

(Reuters) - Online payments company  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) stopped accepting new users in Russia on Wednesday given current circumstances, a company spokesperson told Reuters.
PayPal, which only allows cross-border transactions by users in Russia, had already blocked some users and some of the country's biggest banks following sanctions by the United States and other countries in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia has called the move a ""special operation.""
In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Ukraine's deputy minister for digital transformation Alexander Bornyakov called on PayPal to take more sweeping action and shut down entirely in Russia.
""If PayPal supports democratic values, it should go out from Russia,"" he said.
The PayPal spokesperson said the company, like many of its peers, is still actively navigating the implications of sanctions. 
U.S.-based payment card firms  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V), Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) and  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) along with mobile payment proivders Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Pay, have blocked multiple Russian financial institutions due to government sanctions. It could not be immediately learned whether any have blocked new Russian accounts.
Moscow has responded to sanctions by blocking foreign investors, who hold tens of billions of dollars worth of Russian stocks and bonds, from exiting.
Ukraine's Bornyakov and his colleagues also have sought PayPal's help in soliciting donations. 
But Ukraine's emailed request to PayPal, seen by Reuters, focused on raising funds for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. PayPal bars uses tied to ammunition and firearms.

PayPal is supporting users in Ukraine through cross-border transactions and its Xoom service for international money transfers, the spokesperson said.
""Since this crisis began, PayPal has actively worked to enable donations to non-profit fundraising efforts in support of Ukrainian humanitarian relief efforts,"" the company said in a statement.

255,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 05:48PM ET</span>",BoE's Cunliffe says Russia crisis will add to risks from rates shift,"By William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) -Bank of England Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said the crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine would add to risks in financial markets which have already been made volatile by a shift to higher interest rates.
""The heightened perception of geopolitical risks, and the potential impacts on growth and inflation, can only increase risks around the adjustment away from riskier assets that is already underway,"" Cunliffe said.
""And this comes during a period of relatively low market liquidity,"" he said in a speech at Oxford Union debating society on Wednesday.
Cunliffe said the longer-term financial and economic impact of the invasion is unclear but the sanctions taken so far against Russia did not threaten the stability of the financial system even if they would severely damage the Russian economy.
The BoE has raised interest rates twice since December, the first hikes by a major central bank since the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. Federal Reserve has signalled it will also raise borrowing costs this month.
The shift by central banks to tackle a jump in inflation, caused by economic reopening, has caused sharp falls in the value of riskier assets such as shares which have been aggravated by Russia's attack on its neighbour.
Cunliffe said any sudden jump in bets on future interest rate moves could trigger ""sharp moves out of risky assets,"" while a drop in expectations about the economic outlook could amplify the shift.
""I am not saying that markets will be unable to manage the necessary adjustments. Nor that we will experience another 'dash for cash',"" he said, referring to a panicked flight into safe assets by investors at the start of the pandemic.
""But all of this, in my view, underlines my first lesson: that securing financial stability means ensuring the financial system has the resilience to withstand severe and unanticipated shocks, however generated.""
In a question-and-answer session after the speech, Cunliffe said inflation at 5.5% - its highest in 30 years - made it difficult for people in Britain but they should not worry about a return to a 1970s kind of price-wage spiral.
""The Bank of England will do whatever is necessary to keep inflation under control,"" he said.

Another BoE rate-setter, Silvana Tenreyro, said the surge in energy prices caused by Russia's invasion will hurt British economic growth and raise short-term inflation pressures.
Tenreyro said it was too soon to know how the trade-off for policymakers would play out.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Top U.S. health officials on Wednesday laid out a national blueprint to manage COVID-19 going forward, vowing to prepare for any new variant outbreaks without shutting down schools and businesses and calling for additional funding from Congress.
The plan will help ""move America from crisis to a time when COVID-19 does not disrupt our daily lives,"" the White House said, one day after President Joe Biden acknowledged the nation's fight against the coronavirus had entered a new phase.
""We must be prepared to respond to a new variant quickly and keep our schools and businesses open,"" the updated National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan said, citing a need to maintain vaccines and booster shots, treatments, tests and masks.
The White House called for more funding to pay for COVID treatment and tests, among other efforts, but stopping short of requesting a specific dollar amount.
White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients told reporters in a news briefing that Biden's administration would work with U.S. lawmakers in the weeks ahead to finalize a figure. Sources familiar with the matter last month said the Biden administration was seeking another $30 billion from Congress.
Zients also called on Congress to reauthorize tax credits to pay for sick and family leave when people contract COVID.
The additional funding would help rebuild the nation's stockpile of tests, antiviral pills and masks for Americans; strengthen the nation's data collection and monitoring capabilities to detect emerging variants; and boost vaccine manufacturing, it said. 
But Republican Senator Mitt Romney, in a tweet, said ""a full accounting"" of the trillions of dollars already approved was needed before lawmakers ""could even consider supporting this request.""
""Questions are mounting about where exactly the additional money has gone,"" said a letter to Biden signed by 36 Republican senators including Romney on Wednesday, citing the $1.9 trillion authorized in March 2021 on top of previously-approved COVID relief funds before the president took office.
Biden, in his State of the Union speech to Congress on Tuesday, announced the U.S. Department of Justice would name a chief prosecutor to examine pandemic fraud.
He noted America must shift with infections declining and various precautions easing two years after COVID shut down large swaths of the country, but also cautioned against complacency against the disease, which experts have said could still surge again with new variants.
""We never will just accept living with COVID-19, we'll continue to combat the virus, as we do other diseases,"" Biden told lawmakers.
He also announced a new plan to allow Americans to get tested for COVID at a pharmacy and get free antiviral pills if they test positive.
More than 955,000 people have died from COVID in the United States since early 2020 with a total of 79,114,386 reported U.S. cases, according to a Reuters analysis https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/USA-TRENDS/dgkvlgkrkpb of state and county data. 

U.S. officials said with vaccines and more widely available treatments and with cases trending downward, workers - including federal employees - can safely return to offices in coming days and weeks.
""We are clearly going in the right direction,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official. But, he added: ""We know that we will have to contend with COVID at some level for some time to come.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Citigroup Inc could face billions of dollars of losses at its Russian business and is helping some of its 200 staff in Ukraine leave the country following Russia's invasion, executives said on Wednesday.
The bank's total exposure to Russia amounted to nearly $10 billion at the end of last year, it said on Monday, far higher than previously communicated.
Asked at the bank's investor day about potential losses in Russia, Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said it had run health checks to determine how much of that exposure could be lost under different potential outcomes. 
""We've been working very closely with our risk management to run various scenarios as to what that exposure could mean under different stress scenarios,"" he said. ""Looking at a severe stress scenario that number, on the high end, could be a little less than half of that exposure but it could also be a lot less than that depending on how the situation evolves."" 
The bank is looking to reduce its exposure to Russian assets using hedging and other strategies, Mason said.
""We've been managing that exposure very proactively to bring that number down,"" Mason said. 
The bank is attempting to sell its Russian consumer business. Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser said it was ""too early to tell"" how that sale process will be affected. The only publicly named buyer had been Russian state bank VTB Bank, which is the subject of U.S. sanctions. 
The bank also said it had been helping those among its 200 staff in Ukraine who want to leave that country to do so, sending pay in advance and providing other assistance.
""We've been helping those that want to get across the border into Poland, giving them safe accommodation there, we've given them advances on their payroll, emergency supplies, medical availability and as much support as we possibly can,"" she said.

The bank is also supporting staff that want to stick it out in Ukraine, Fraser said. She commended them for continuing to serve the bank's clients, including multi-national companies.
""Every single day through this war they have been operating our bank and making sure that we are operating on the ground so that we are able to serve our clients there, the multi-nationals,"" she said. ""They are quite exceptional in their drive, what they are wanting to do for the country, for the bank and for our clients.""

261,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 05:08PM ET</span>",Factbox-Russia hit with sanctions from around the world after Ukraine invasion,"LONDON (Reuters) -The European Union, the United States, Britain and others have hit Russia with a wide range of sanctions after its invasion of Ukraine.
They have also imposed asset freezes, travel bans and other restrictions on numerous Russian individuals including President Vladimir Putin himself.
Following is a roundup of some of the broadest sanctions imposed by major economies around the world.
EUROPEAN UNION
The European Union is excluding seven Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system that underpins global transactions, it said on Wednesday.
The banks are Russia's second-largest lender VTB, along with Bank Otkritie, Novikombank, Promsvyazbank, Bank Rossiya, Sovcombank and VEB.
Sberbank, Russia's largest lender, and Gazprombank have not been included as they are the main channels for payments for Russian oil and gas, which EU countries are still buying. But Sberbank said on Wednesday it was exiting almost all European markets.
The EU has also frozen part of what it calls ""Putin's war chest"" by banning its transactions and freezing all its assets in the 27-nation bloc. This is meant to make it impossible for the Russian central bank to liquidate its assets. It will also ban EU investors from trading in Russian state bonds.
The EU is introducing measures to crimp Russia's technological position in key areas from high-tech components to cutting-edge software.
Nord Stream 2, a recently completed pipeline from Russia to Germany, was awaiting regulatory approval by EU and German authorities before Berlin put its certification on ice following Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.
The EU has shut down its airspace for Russia, banning all Russian aircraft from taking off, landing or overflying the EU.
It has banned the export, sale, supply or transfer of all aircraft, aircraft parts and equipment to Russia. 
The EU has toughened existing sanctions on goods that can be used for civilian or military purposes, targeting the military-industrial complex of Russia and Belarus and limiting their access to advanced technology such as drones and software for drones, software for encryption devices, semiconductors and advanced electronics.
The bloc has also blacklisted prominent Russian individuals including Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, although the two are exempt from an EU travel ban - this is meant to enable negotiations with them should the opportunity arise.
Still, Putin is now one of only three world leaders blacklisted by the EU, along with Syria's Bashar al-Assad and Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus. The blacklist currently includes 654 individuals and 52 entities.
UNITED STATES
The United States has imposed sanctions on Russia's central bank and other key sources of wealth, blocking Americans from engaging in any transactions involving the bank, finance ministry and national wealth fund.
Together with Britain it has also announced restrictions that in effect kick most Russian banking assets out of both countries. Their targets include Sberbank and VTB Bank, Russia's two largest lenders. 
Washington is implementing export controls that will restrict Russian access to semiconductors, computers, telecommunications, information security equipment, lasers, and sensors needed to sustain its military capabilities.
The United States and EU already have sanctions in place on Russia's energy and defence sectors, with state-owned gas company Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), its oil arm Gazpromneft and oil producers Lukoil, Rosneft and Surgutneftegaz facing various types of curbs on exports/imports and debt-raising. 
Last week, Washington imposed sanctions on the company in charge of building Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
The United States has closed its airspace to Russian planes.
BRITAIN
Together with the United States and EU, Britain has barred British entities from transactions with Russia's central bank, finance ministry and sovereign wealth fund.
It has imposed measures to prevent Russian companies from issuing transferable securities and money market instruments in the UK, and Russia cannot sell sovereign debt in the UK either.
Britain has barred a number of Russian banks from accessing sterling and clearing payments through the UK. 
London has further implemented measures to significantly strengthen its trade restrictions against Russia. This will include a prohibition against the export of a range of high-end and critical technical equipment and components in sectors including electronics, telecommunications and aerospace.
Britain will also introduce legislation to limit deposits that Russian nationals can hold in UK bank accounts. The limit will be 50,000 pounds ($66,860) at British banks.
Britain has banned Russian planes from its airspace.
JAPAN
Japan is joining the international sanctions on Russia's central bank by limiting transactions with it, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Monday.
Tokyo has imposed export controls on semiconductors and other high-tech products, and has suspended visa issuance for a list of Russian individuals and entities.
CANADA
Canada shut its ports to Russian-owned ships on Tuesday and said the holdings of all Russian oligarchs and companies in the country are under review.
It had previously announced measures to isolate Russia including imposing sanctions on President Putin, closing Canadian airspace to Russian planes, banning oil imports and forbidding Canadian financial institutions from dealing with the Russian central bank.

AUSTRALIA
Australia has imposed sanctions on Russia targeting several of its elite citizens and lawmakers.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Investment firm Saddle Point privately nominated four directors to the board of Curtiss-Wright (NYSE:CW) Corp, arguing the company's stock is undervalued because it lacks a strategic focus and its earnings power is obscured by its noncore industrials business, some of which ought to be divested.
The company disclosed the nominations in a regulatory filing on Wednesday.
The New York-based firm, which owns approximately 0.3% of the Davidson, North Carolina-headquartered maker of defense and intelligence programs, has been engaged with the company since 2020 and in discussions with the board for months. It signaled to the company, valued at $5.8 billion, it was not seeking to replace the 10 incumbent directors but has experts on hand who could help guide the company better, people familiar with the discussions said.
A representative for Saddle Point, run by former Pershing Square Capital Management partner Roy Katzovicz, declined to comment.
Saddle Point's slate includes national defense industry and financial industry experts.
Ellen Lord, who had been CEO at  Textron Inc  (NYSE:TXT) subsidiary Textron Systems, also served as the first U.S. undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment.
Christine Fox was acting deputy secretary of defense and the department's director, cost assessment and program evaluation, from 2009 to 2013, after decades at the Center for Naval Analyses where she rose to president.
Rajender Kumar Chandhok was chief investment officer of  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC)'s pension system while Peter Carlin worked at investment firm Blue Harbor Group, LP, which helped catalyze the separation of BWXT Technologies from Babcock & Wilcox in 2015.
Curtiss-Wright said neither Fox nor Lord would ""bring strengths to the Board that would enhance the expertise and qualifications already represented."" But it also urged Saddle Point to ""withdraw its nominees and return to a constructive dialogue.""
Saddle Point's nominations come as other activists are also engaged in the defense sector, including Starboard Value and Jana Partners at defense technology firm Mercury Systems (NASDAQ:MRCY). Defense industry stocks gained ground recently as investors rotated out of fast-growing tech names and as war in Ukraine added to demand.

LONDON (Reuters) - UniCredit has paused efforts to buy Banco BPM after losing more than a fifth of its value since Russia invaded Ukraine, two sources close to the matter told Reuters.
Stock in UniCredit, Italy's second-largest bank, has dropped by more than 20% since Feb. 24, when Ukraine came under attack, with investors worrying about its 14.2 billion euro ($15.7 billion) credit exposure to Russia as of last summer.
Only a fortnight ago the Milan-listed lender and boss Andrea Orcel were working on a plan to take control of Banco BPM in an all-share deal worth about 7 billion euros, the sources said on condition of anonymity because the matter is confidential.
A strong share price was critical to pulling off the deal to combine the second and third-largest Italian banks, with Banco BPM commanding a premium of at least 40%, one of the sources said. 
While Banco BPM stock has also been knocked by the conflict in Ukraine, losing almost 15% since the invasion started, the bank has no exposure to Russia.
""The deal is on hold. UniCredit needs to wait for its stock to recover and for the geopolitical environment to stabilise.""
(Graphic: UniCredit share price, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/mypmnxazxvr/UniCredit.png) 
For UniCredit, a combination with Banco BPM is key to boosting its market share in Italy, where Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) ranks as the biggest bank with deep market penetration in Italy's wealthy northern regions. 
Both UniCredit and Banco BPM declined to comment.
UniCredit has been actively working on a possible takeover of Banco BPM since Orcel came on board last April, with plans to return cash to shareholders aimed at propping up the bank's share price and gaining a stronger acquisition currency, one of the sources said
It came close to launching an offer in late February after first sounding out both European Central Bank regulators and Italian authorities in an effort to garner their support, two separate sources said. 
However, discussions to finalise the plan ground to a halt on Feb. 24 owing to the market turmoil that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Western sanctions, the sources said.
A full write-off of UniCredit's Russian business would cost the Italian bank more than 1 billion euros and shave 35 basis points off its best-quality capital ratio, two more sources said. Such an extreme move would still leave UniCredit with 6 billion euros in cross-border exposure.

In an attempt to reassure investors, UniCredit said on Feb. 24 that provisions against losses covered 84% of its Russian arm's non-performing exposures and that Russia accounted for only 3% of group revenue.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -U.S. and European stocks rebounded on Wednesday and crude prices surged past $110 a barrel as fighting raged in Ukraine for a seventh day, posing a challenge for central banks hoping to curb rising inflation. 
Gold prices slipped on improving sentiment and U.S. Treasury yields rose from eight-week lows as investors weighed how aggressively the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates in coming months with the outlook on growth a major concern.
The Fed will move forward with plans to raise rates this month to try to tame high inflation, but the war in Ukraine has made the outlook ""highly uncertain"" for U.S. policymakers as they plan ahead, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said.
Powell told a congressional committee that he was ""inclined to propose and support a 25 basis-point rate hike"" when policymakers meet in two weeks. The remarks eased widely held expectations before the invasion of a 50 basis-point hike.
""There was a broad belief they were going to create a big splash to get everybody’s attention,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management.
""The fact the Fed was not expected to tighten that much, and then Powell confirmed that suspicion this morning, has led to this enthusiasm,"" he said.
Markets are struggling with what happens to growth in Europe and the U.S. because of the Ukraine conflict, said Marvin Loh, global macro strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT).
""This increase in energy prices makes it a challenge for the Fed because on the one end, it increases inflation,"" Loh said.
""But, generally speaking, when you get these surges in energy prices there's a deflationary component associated with that, because it saps growth elsewhere,"" he said. 
After a week at war, Russia has yet to achieve its aim of overthrowing Ukraine's government. Ukrainians said a battle ensued in the port of Kherson, the first sizeable city Moscow claimed to have seized. 
All 11 S&P sectors advanced, led by financials, and the major European indices finished the day in a sea of green too, with commodity-linked stocks making big gains.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.90%, rebounding from an earlier decline, and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe closed up 0.93%.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.79%, the S&P 500 advanced 1.86%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.62%.
Euro zone bond yields rose after dramatic declines a day earlier, with Germany's real yield hitting a record low as traders assessed the economic fallout of the Ukrainian invasion. 
Repricing saw Germany's 10-year yield, the benchmark for the euro zone, recorded its biggest daily fall since 2011 on Tuesday. Markets unwound part of those moves, Germany's 10-year yield up 8.1 basis points to 0.009%. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes climbed 18.3 basis points to 1.894%.
Euro zone inflation soared to another record high last month, intensifying a policy dilemma for the European Central Bank, which needs to convey a sense of calm amid war-related market turmoil and also respond to mounting price pressures.
Crude surged again on a wave of divestments from Russian oil assets by major companies and expectations that the market will remain short of supply for months to come. [O/R]
U.S. crude futures rose $7.19 to settle at $110.60 a barrel, its highest close since 2011, while Brent settled up $7.96 at $112.93.
Aluminium prices bolted to a fresh record peak as investors fretted that logistics difficulties would block metals supplies due to tough sanctions on major producer Russia.
Three-month aluminium on the London Metal Exchange surged to a record of $3,580 a tonne. 
U.S. gold futures settled down 1.1% at $1,922.30 an ounce. 
David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures, said there was a lesser need for safe havens. 
""We've seen equity markets stabilize,"" he said.
The ruble plunged to a record low in Moscow trade and the stock market remained closed as Russia's financial system staggered under the weight of Western sanctions.
The ruble fell 4.7% to 106.02 against the dollar after earlier hitting 110.0, a record low. It has lost about a third of its value this year.
Shares of Van Eck's battered Russia ETF, which are attracting interest from traders in a comparison to last year’s frenzy in so-called meme stocks, tumbled 13%.
Foreign investors are effectively stuck with their holdings of ruble-denominated bonds after the Russian central bank put a temporary halt on coupon payments and a major overseas' settlement system stopped accepting Russian assets.
JP Morgan analysts said in a note the sanctions on Russia have ""significantly increased the likelihood of a Russia government hard currency bond default.""

The dollar index rose 0.026%, with the euro down 0.04% to $1.1122.
The Japanese yen weakened 0.53% at 115.52 per dollar.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A judge on Wednesday rejected the effort by New York's attorney general to put the National Rifle Association out of business for alleged corruption, but she can still seek the ouster of the gun rights group's longtime Chief Executive Wayne LaPierre.
Attorney General Letitia James had sued the NRA in August 2020, accusing it of diverting millions of dollars to fund luxuries for officials like LaPierre, with no-show contracts for associates and other questionable expenses.
Justice Joel Cohen of a New York state court in Manhattan said that while James offered ""a grim story of greed, self-dealing, and lax financial oversight,"" she did not show that the NRA, which is incorporated in New York, benefited from financial misconduct or could not legitimately serve its members.
""The complaint does not allege the type of public harm that is the legal linchpin for imposing the 'corporate death penalty,"" the judge wrote in a 42-page decision.
Cohen said James could instead seek ""less intrusive"" remedies against NRA officials, including LaPierre, rather than a dissolution that could infringe members' free speech rights.
He said that could include LaPierre's ouster under state laws governing nonprofits, after James described in ""meticulous detail"" his alleged exploitation of the NRA, abuse of power and ""general disregard for corporate governance.""
In a statement, James said she was disappointed that the dissolution claims were dismissed, but pleased she could try to show how ""fraud, abuse, and greed permeate through the NRA and its senior leadership."" She will review her legal options.
Lawyers for the NRA had no immediate comment.
Founded in 1871 in New York, the NRA had responded to James' lawsuit by filing for bankruptcy in January 2021 and trying using Chapter 11 to reincorporate in more gun-friendly Texas.
The NRA called the bankruptcy a means to escape New York's corrupt political and regulatory environment, and accused James of violating its free speech rights because she disliked its politics. James has denied those claims.
Last May, a Dallas bankruptcy judge dismissed the Chapter 11 case, calling it an improper effort to gain an ""unfair litigation advantage"" over James, and describing some details about the NRA that emerged at trial ""cringeworthy.""
LaPierre has long faced allegations he exploited his three decades at the NRA's helm for his personal benefit.
During the bankruptcy trial, LaPierre testified about gifts he received, including yacht trips from a Hollywood producer, but denied wrongdoing.

James is seeking re-election. She is also known for her civil probe into former President Donald Trump's business practices, and an investigation that substantiated sexual harassment claims against former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.
The case is New York v. The National Rifle Association of America Inc et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451625/2020.

(Reuters) -Netflix, fashion outlet H&M, tech company Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and many others cut or paused business in Russia on Wednesday because of the attack on Ukraine, while the United States laid out new sanctions and a Ukrainian official outlined to Reuters plans for fanning corporate support.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has paused new projects in Russia, Variety reported, while H&M has paused all sales there and Oracle said it had suspended all operations. 
Oracle's announcement on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) came about three hours after Ukraine's minister of digital transformation tweeted to the company for support. Deputy Minister Alexander Bornyakov told Reuters that Ukraine has sought help from 50 different companies, part of a strategy to isolate Russia and get citizens to turn against their government. ""More sanctions imposed, faster peace restored,"" Borynakov said.
The United States on Wednesday expanded such sanctions, imposing export controls on Belarus, a base for some of the Russian attacks on Ukraine. 
The new sanctions also ban the export of specific refining technologies, making it more expensive for Russia to modernize refineries.
""The United States will take actions to hold Belarus accountable for enabling (Russian President Vladimir) Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, weaken the Russian defense sector and its military power for years to come, target Russia’s most important sources of wealth, and ban Russian airlines from U.S. airspace,"" the White House said.
The European Union also expanded its own ban to 70% of Belarus exports to the bloc.
In recent days, global brands including Shell (LON:RDSa), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) have cut ties or stopped sales in Russia, often with unstinting condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Moscow, which has called Russia's actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"", has responded to the growing exodus of Western investors by temporarily restricting Russian asset sales by foreigners.
Still, the list of goods, consumer and industrial, that will no longer be sold in Russia is growing longer every day.
Winter clothing maker Canada Goose Holdings (NYSE:GOOS) said on Wednesday it would suspend all wholesale and e-commerce sales to Russia, while video game maker  Electronic Arts Inc  (NASDAQ:EA) is removing Russian teams from its ""FIFA 22"" soccer game and ""NHL 22"" hockey game.
The measures by the West have sent the rouble plunging and forced the central bank to jack up interest rates. They have also made it impossible for many companies do business in the country.
Mercedes-Benz Group on Wednesday said it would suspend exports of passenger cars and vans to Russia as well as local manufacturing, following similar measures but global automakers including Ford and BMW.
NO LET-UP
Since the fall of Communism, Russia, and in particular the younger generation, has embraced global brands, foreign travel and social media. Its deepening economic isolation risks putting some of those changes into reverse, and cutting off an important market for international companies.
Signaling there would be no let-up from the West, U.S. President Joe Biden said in his State of the Union address on Tuesday that Putin ""has no idea what's coming"" as he joined European states and Canada in closing U.S. airspace to Russian planes.
Within the aviation sector,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co on Wednesday said it had paused support of airlines in Russia. Boeing the day before had suspended maintenance and technical support for Russian airlines, while rival Airbus stopped spare part deliveries, hobbling the industry in Russia.
On the sourcing side of the market, carmakers such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW and Porsche are struggling to obtain crucial wire harnesses as suppliers in western Ukraine have been shuttered by the Russian invasion, forcing them to curtail production.
""Due to supply bottlenecks, interruptions to our production will occur,"" BMW said in a statement. ""We are in intensive discussions with our suppliers.""
And videogame maker Motorsport Games Inc said the sanctions against Russia could delay the release of the racing game developer's future titles, since a significant part of its development staff is based in Russia.

Russian firms meanwhile have felt increasingly squeezed. Sberbank, Russia's largest lender, said on Wednesday it was leaving the European market because its subsidiaries faced large cash outflows, adding that the safety of its employees and property was threatened.
Regulators, meanwhile are preparing for a possible closure of the European arm of Russia's second-largest bank, VTB Bank, due to the impact of Western sanctions on the bank, sources told Reuters.

269,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 04:22PM ET</span>","Exclusive-Ukraine to seek action against Russia from about 50 gaming, cloud and other tech firms","By Paresh Dave, Elizabeth Culliford and Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - Ukraine plans to urge about 50 additional tech companies, including in gaming, esports and internet infrastructure, to take action against Russia following a slew of earlier requests, a top Ukrainian government tech official told Reuters on Wednesday.
Software giant  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) responded within three hours on Wednesday to a tweet from Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation calling on it to stop doing business in Russia amid the country's invasion of Ukraine. 
Deputy digital minister Alexander Bornyakov showed Oracle's just-posted tweet on his phone during the video interview, which said the company had ""already suspended all operations in the Russian Federation"". EA Games also on Wednesday said it was removing Russian teams from FIFA soccer games.
""More sanction imposed, faster peace restored,"" Bornyakov said of his ministry's campaign, wearing a hoodie and sitting in front of Ukrainian flags. He said a couple of times a day, sirens alerted them of air strikes and they moved to bunkers.
Oracle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Ukraine has already sought support from about 50 companies since Russia's invasion began last week, Bornyakov said. The outreach, which has included tweets from Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov calling on Silicon Valley CEOs to take action, has helped bring Ukraine Starlink internet satellites from entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX and new restrictions on Russian state media by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube and other social media services.
Bornyakov said among the companies he wants to see take action are  Akamai Technologies Inc  (NASDAQ:AKAM), which provides cybersecurity and content delivery tools to websites.
Akamai said on Tuesday it will stop serving any sanctioned customers but that none of its clients, which it said included Russian airline Aeroflot, were subject to U.S. sanctions imposed on Feb. 22.
The ministry has also called on Google and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to shutter their mobile app stores in Russia, but Bornyakov said the companies were more likely to block downloads of select apps.
The appeals to tech firms are part of a broader strategy by Ukraine to isolate Russia and get people to protest the Russian action, which Moscow calls a ""special operation.""
An ""IT army"" of volunteers at home and abroad, partly organized by the digital ministry through the messaging app Telegram, has disrupted access to Russian government websites and contacted about 50 million Russian civilians through social media, phone, and texts with information about the invasion, Bornyakov said.
He said these online forces now numbered more than 250,000 people, who were carrying out their own ideas. 
""Its like crypto, it's decentralized,"" he said.
Bornyakov expressed little concern about cyber attacks from Russia, saying their infrastructure was weak.
In recent days, Facebook-owner Meta, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and YouTube said they had taken down influence operations and hacking efforts targeting Ukraine.
NFT EFFORTS
Ukraine also plans to sell NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, a type of digital asset, to help with funds for the army, Bornyakov said.
""We're going to prepare a lot of cool Ukrainian-style images and 3D models. If you buy this NFT, all the donations are going to go to support the Ukrainian army and citizens,"" he said. 
The government has already raised millions in cryptocurrency donations.
Before Russia's invasion, Bornyakov said the tech ministry had been focused on moving all government services online. He said these efforts meant it was already working with tech companies like Apple and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on projects such as digital passports.

The ministry was also in communication with venture funds to invest in Ukrainian startups and wanted major tech firms to open artificial intelligence and virtual reality research and development centers in Ukraine, he added.
That has changed with the invasion. ""Now, we have to switch to a completely different focus. And that's actually very sad,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House of Representatives oversight panel has postponed its hearing on oil companies' climate change disinformation due to the crisis in Ukraine but has asked the board members it had invited to testify to turn in documents by the end of next week, a committee staffer told Reuters on Wednesday.
The congressional committee in January invited board members from  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc,  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and BP (NYSE:BP) Plc to testify on Feb. 8 about the industry's role in climate change and spreading ""disinformation"" about that role and their proposed solutions. 
The committee postponed that hearing to March 8 after none of the board members had been available to testify on the first proposed date but said they were available on other dates. The panel will reschedule the hearing ""as soon as possible"" as it focuses on oversight of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
A committee spokesperson said it will hold the board members to the March 8 deadline to turn in relevant documents related to subpoenas issued to the companies' chief executives after they were grilled in the first of the panel's hearings on climate disinformation.
""We made clear to the companies last night that the March 8 deadline for producing long-overdue documents in response to our subpoenas remains unchanged,"" the spokesperson said by e-mail.   

Exxon, Shell and BP announced earlier this week that they were ceasing their operations in Russia as a result of its invasion of Ukraine, upending oil supply in the months ahead and driving up oil prices beyond $110 a barrel.
The committee spokesperson said it plans to continue to ""aggressively investigate Big Oil’s"" role in fueling the climate crisis, especially in light of a report released on Monday by U.N. climate scientists who called for drastic action to respond to worsening climate impacts.

WestJet said it would also buy travel booking website Sunwing Vacations, as part of the deal, which is expected to close in late 2022, pending regulatory approval.
Canada's travel industry, including carriers such as Air Canada, were hit hard during the pandemic with earlier restrictions like mandatory quarantine periods dealing a blow to demand.
Traffic is expected to rebound as restrictions relax and travellers have the option to use either a rapid antigen test or a molecular PCR test to meet pre-entry requirements for vaccinated travellers. 
ATB Financial analyst Chris Murray said he did not expect the deal would create much new capacity. He sees it as an opportunistic move by WestJet to broaden its exposure to leisure destinations, one of the earliest markets to recover. 

The union representing Sunwing flight attendants said it would fight to defend the jobs of its 800 members in the wake of the deal's announcement. 
""The pandemic has been very tough on our sector, and on our airline in particular,” said Rena Kisfalvi, President of Local 4055 of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE). ""We'll be keeping a close eye on this proposal, and our sole focus will remain on defending our members' jobs and their livelihoods as this process moves forward.""

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 closed higher Wednesday, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the Fed would tread carefully in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, easing investor fears about aggressive Fed monetary policy tightening ahead. 
The S&P 500 rose 1.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.8%, or 595 points, the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.6%.
Powell said it was still “appropriate to raise interest rates by 25 basis points in March. The Fed chief, however, didn’t rule out the possibility of a 50 basis hike at subsequent meetings if inflation continued to run hot.
The United States 2-Year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to Fed rate changes, jumped more than 16%.
The backdrop of rising U.S. Treasury yields helped bank stocks pare some of their recent losses.
 Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY), Comerica (NYSE:CMA), SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB) jumped more than 6%.
Energy also racked up gains as U.S. oil prices jumped to their highest level since 2011 after OPEC and its allies showed little incentive to curb the surge in oil prices, sticking with plans to increase production by 400,000 barrels per day in April despite supply fears.
“The market appears to be increasingly pricing in an outage of Russian oil shipments. More and more Western oil companies are announcing their withdrawal from Russia,” Commerzbank said in a note.
The Russia invasion of Ukraine will remain in focus as both sides are set to discuss ceasefire at upcoming talks on Thursday.
The move from major oil producers to keep production steady comes just as U.S. oil inventories fell by a more than expected 2.6 million barrels for the week ended Feb. 25.
Tech stocks held firm even as U.S. Treasury yields climbed, with big tech and chip stocks leading to the upside.
Big tech including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) were in the green.
The earnings front also offered investors some solace, with Nordstrom and Salesforce posting strong-than-expected results.  
Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) reported quarterly results that topped expectations and raised its full-year guidance pointing to healthy demand for digital transformation. Its shares closed less than 1% higher.
""[W]e believe further margin expansion into 2023 and the continued integration of Slack for Salesforce will ultimately be key for the Street looking forward,"" Wedbush said as it raised its price target on the stock to $315 to $275.
Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) rallied more than 37% after reporting fourth-quarter results that beat analysts' expectations and the department store retailer painted an upbeat picture about the year ahead.
In other news, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) outlined plans to split its auto business into an electric vehicle unit and legacy gas and diesel unit, with the latter expected to serve as a cash engine to find the automaker's EV expansion. Its shares rose more than 8%.
On the economic front, labor market data showed that private payrolls in February grew by 475,000, beating estimates for 378,000. "

There are also potential payment difficulties after some Russian banks were barred from the SWIFT international payments system.
Its announcement came hours after Boeing (NYSE:BA) said it had suspended parts, maintenance and technical support for Russian airlines. Airbus has also halted supply of parts and services to Russian airlines.

Investing.com – Stocks roared right back on Wednesday, rallying 2% as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress he was inclined to raise interest rates at a steady pace.
The Fed is expected to start raising rates when it meets this month as it tries to battle inflation. Powell’s testimony to the House Financial Services Committee seems to have been the balm investors needed after being rattled by the war in Ukraine and fears of big rate increases. 
Instead, Powell told Congress he was looking at a quarter-point increase. In recent weeks some have anticipated a half-point hike.
The remarks come a day after President Joe Biden delivered his first official State of the Union address, condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin for Russia’s aggression in Ukraine while at the same time vowing to press ahead with measures intended to fight inflation.
Biden wants Congress to embrace many of the same proposals that were part of his Build Back Better social spending and climate change initiative. He urged Congress to go after lowering prescription drug prices and making child care more affordable.
He also championed his infrastructure spending on roads, bridges and other transportation. Biden was in Wisconsin on Wednesday to highlight that part of his agenda, which was enacted last year.
Oil prices spiked again, with the price of U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate rising to levels it hasn’t reached since 2011.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Jobless claims
The weekly jobless claims report is due out at 8:30 AM ET. It comes a day after the ADP private payroll report for February showed companies hired more workers than expected, an indication the economy is on good footing. Private payrolls increased by 475,000 jobs last month. Economists polled by Reuters forecast an increase of 388,000 jobs.
2. Costco earnings
Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST), the membership-only big-box retail store company, is set to announce its earnings after the bell Thursday. Analysts polled by Investing.com have forecast earnings per share at $2.75 on revenue of $51.35 billion.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -German carmakers association VDA said that the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine was disrupting transport routes as well as financial transactions and that it was bracing for shortages in a range of raw materials.
""It is difficult to provide a reliable outlook due to the highly dynamic situation. But one thing is clear: There will be further disruption of vehicle production in Germany,"" VDA said in a statement on Wednesday. 
It said the impact from the conflict on shipping, rail and air freight was compounding problems in the supply chain at a time when inventory levels were already low.
""In the long term, the car industry is facing shortages and higher prices of raw materials,"" VDA said.
In a separate statement, German luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz said on Wednesday it would suspend the export of passenger cars and vans to Russia as well as local manufacturing in the country.
VDA in particular highlighted neon gas, which is needed to produce already scarce automotive microchips and where Ukraine is a key exporting nation.
The supply of palladium, which goes into catalytic converters, is also thrown in doubt as Germany relies on Russia for about one fifth of imports.
VDA also cautioned that Russia is an important supplier of nickel ore, which is refined to go into lithium-ion car batteries. 
German chemicals giant BASF in 2018 secured access to nickel, which it refines in Finland for use in battery materials, through a partnership with Russia’s Norilsk Nickel. 
VDA echoed member companies including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW and Porsche AG, who have said they are struggling to obtain crucial wire harnesses as suppliers in western Ukraine have been shuttered.
Affected suppliers of the component, needed for organizing miles of vehicle cables, include Leoni, Fujikura and Nexans.
""The manufacturers and suppliers are working under pressure to compensate for the outages and disruptions in the supply chain and to ramp-up alternative solutions,"" VDA said. 
It added it was too early to estimate the effect of trade sanctions.
VDA condemned the Russian attack as a breach of international law.

According to VDA, Germany exported 4,100 cars to Ukraine and 35,600 cars to Russia last year, accounting for 1.7% of German car exports between them.
In addition, German manufacturers produced 170,000 cars in Russia in 2021, primarily for the domestic market.

Some of the biggest Western brands have suspended operations in Russia in an unprecedented wave of corporate action against Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German oil and gas firm Wintershall Dea said on Wednesday it would stop payments to Russia and write off its 1 billion euro ($1.1 billion) financing in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which was suspended last week.
The group, one of the five co-funders of Nord Stream 2, said Russia's invasion of Ukraine had ""shaken the foundations of the company's work in Russia to the core"".
French utility Engie, another backer of the pipeline, said it had a credit risk exposure of up to 987 million euros to Nord Stream.
The remaining financiers of the Gazprom-led pipeline include German utility Uniper, Austria's OMV as well as Shell (LON:RDSa), which has already announced a writedown of its contribution.
Germany last week halted certification of the pipeline, which bypasses Ukraine to transport gas to Europe from Russia.
Wintershall Dea, which is co-owned by BASF and Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman's investor group LetterOne, said it would still remain involved in its existing Russian joint ventures.
These include the Yuzhno-Russkoye gas field, in which it owns 35%, with Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) and OMV owning 40% and 25%, respectively.
LetterOne's Fridman is among 26 prominent people under sanctions by the European Union for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with measures including travel restrictions, an asset freeze and a ban on making funds available to the listed individuals.
Wintershall Dea will also keep its holdings in the Achimov natural gas production projects in Siberia, which include Achimgaz - a 50-50 joint venture with Gazprom - and Achim Development, in which Wintershall Dea holds 25%.
Wintershall Dea said it will also remain active in network operator Gascade, a joint venture with Gazprom that operates a 3,200-kilometre (1,988-mile) gas pipeline network in Germany.
Uniper, too, said it would continue to run its Russian business, which includes a 83.7% stake in local utility Unipro, in a responsible way, adding this was key to meeting existing gas and power supply deals in Europe.

Shares in the company closed 4% lower.

TORONTO (Reuters) -Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Bank of Montreal said on Wednesday they will raise their prime lending rates for the first time since October 2018, after the Bank of Canada hiked its benchmark rate by 25 basis points.
The higher prime rate, which variable-rate mortgages are tied to, will rise to 2.7% from 2.45% and come into effect on Thursday, the three lenders said.
The Bank of Canada on Wednesday increased interest rates to 0.50% from a record-low 0.25%, and said they would need to rise further despite increased uncertainty following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Demand for variable-rate mortgages has grown, thanks to the widest gap https://www.ratehub.ca/historical-mortgage-rates-widget between them and fixed rates - which have been climbing alongside bond yields that have risen in anticipation of tighter central bank policies - in 3-1/2 years. 
Floating-rate loans have accounted for over half of new mortgages since July, according to Bank of Canada data.
""We can expect more Canadians’ rates to go up and for their mortgage payment to be affected than in a typical rising rate environment,"" said James Laird, co-founder of mortgage rate comparison website Ratehub.ca. 
Still, the 25-basis-point increase in prime rates is unlikely to have a significant impact on housing demand, and are more likely to bite when they rise 1 to 1.25 percentage points, Laird said. 
Higher mortgage rates are expected to boost banks' lending margins, which have been under pressure due to low interest rates.

Canadian banks cut their prime rates to the lowest in a decade in March 2020 in response to the coronavirus pandemic, fueling a housing boom, with the average price surging 21% in January from a year earlier to a record.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 jumped Wednesday, as Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell confirmed investor expectations for a 25-basis points rate hike in March, and said the Fed would tread carefully in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
The S&P 500 rose 2.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 2%, or 675 points, the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.8%.
Powell said it was still “appropriate to raise interest rates by 25 basis points in March. The Fed chief, however, didn’t rule out the possibility of a 50 basis hike at subsequent meetings if inflation continued to run hot.
The United States 2-Year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to Fed rate changes, jumped more than 15%.
The backdrop of rising U.S. Treasury yields helped bank stocks pare some of their recent losses.
 Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY), Comerica (NYSE:CMA), SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB) jumped more than 6%.
Energy also racked up gains as U.S. oil prices jumped to their highest level since 2011 after OPEC and its allies showed little incentive to curb the surge in oil prices, sticking with plans to increase production by 400,000 barrels per day in the April despite supply fears.
“The market appears to be increasingly pricing in an outage of Russian oil shipments. More and more Western oil companies are announcing their withdrawal from Russia,” Commerzbank said in a note.
The Russia invasion of Ukraine will remain in focus as both sides are set to discuss ceasefire at upcoming talks on Thursday.
The move from major oil producers to keep production steady comes just as U.S. oil inventories fell by a more than expected 2.6 million barrels for the week ended Feb. 25.
Tech stocks held firm even as U.S. Treasury yields climbed, with big tech and chip stocks leading to the upside.
Big tech including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) were in the green.
The earnings front also offered investors some solace with Nordstrom and Salesforce posting strong-than-expected results.  
Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) reported quarterly results that topped expectations and raised its full-year guidance pointing to healthy demand for digital transformation. Its shares were up more than 1%.
""[W]e believe further margin expansion into 2023 and the continued integration of Slack for Salesforce will ultimately be key for the Street looking forward,"" Wedbush said as it raised its price target on the stock to $315 to $275.
Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) rallied more than 36% after reporting fourth-quarter results that beat analysts' expectations and the department store retailer painted an upbeat picture about the year ahead.
In other news, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) outlined plans to split its auto business into an electric vehicle unit and legacy gas and diesel unit, with latter expected to serve as a cash engine to find the automaker's EV expansion. "

Investing.com -- Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak lowered the price target on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:FB) to $325 from $360, saying in a note to clients that the company's share ""outperformance may take time.""

282,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 02:46PM ET</span>","Elevated Inflation, Tight Labor Market to Persist, but Outlook Optimistic: Fed","By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com -- The trend of elevated inflation and a tight labor market was expected to persist, but the overall economic picture over the next six months remains generally optimistic, according to the Federal Reserve's Beige Book released Wednesday.
Economic activity has expanded at a modest to moderate pace since mid-January, but there was little sign that either wage or price pressures were abating amid a tight labor market and rising input costs, the Fed said in its Beige Book economic report, based on anecdotal information collected by the Fed’s 12 reserve banks through Feb. 18.
“Contacts reported they expect the tight labor market and consequent strong wage growth to continue, though a few Districts reported signs of wage growth moderating,” the Beige Book showed.
The outlook on the labor market comes just as data showed that private payrolls in February grew by a more than expected 475,000.
The rise in prices, meanwhile, continued to be passed onto the consumer, and had increased at a robust pace to offset rising input costs that were pushed higher by “elevated transport costs.”
“Firms reported they expect additional price increases over the next several months as they continue to pass on input cost increases,” according to the report.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues, however, have reiterated expectations for inflation pressures to ease in the second half of this year.
“Those of us on the committee have an expectation that inflation will peak and begin to come down this year. And to the extent that inflation comes in higher or is more persistently high than that, then we would be prepared move more aggressively,” Powell said.
The fed chief also confirmed market expectations that the U.S. central bank will raise interest rates by 25 basis points at its meeting next month, but didn’t rule out a larger hike at subsequent meetings if inflation remained elevated.
""I’m inclined to propose and support a 25 basis point rate hike,"" Powell said in testimony before Congress on Wednesday.
But if inflation continues to run hot, the Fed is ""prepared to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points"" at one or more meetings later this year, Powell added."

The world's most valuable company, Apple was able to overcome supply chain issues that crippled other industries and companies that led to product shortages during the holiday season to post record sales, thanks to the popularity of its iPhones.

285,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 01:55PM ET</span>",Seaborne Russian gas supplies to Europe disrupted by looming port bans,"By Nora Buli, Jonathan Saul and Marwa Rashad
OSLO/LONDON (Reuters) - Supplies of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe have been disrupted by uncertainty over whether ships can discharge cargoes at European ports due to sanctions imposed on Moscow, according to ship tracking data and trade sources on Wednesday.
The disruptions come at a time when Europe is contending with record prices for natural gas due to tight supplies that have ramped up energy bills and led governments to pay billions of dollars in subsidies to consumers struggling to stay warm.
Four tankers that loaded LNG at the Russian gas terminal in Yamal and initially said they were sailing to British and French ports have changed their destination status to ""For Orders"", Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking data showed. That means the vessels are awaiting new orders from their owners. 
The change in destinations came after Britain said on Monday it was denying entry to British ports to ships that are Russian owned, operated, controlled, chartered, registered or flagged as it ratcheted up pressure on Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine.
The British move has added to the widespread disruption to energy markets caused by punitive measures the West has taken against Moscow, with traders steering clear of Russian fuel even though many of the restrictions, including Britain's port ban, exempts Russian oil and gas in itself.
""The UK's decision to turn away Russian-flagged, operated or chartered vessels may materially tighten the market if this move is followed by other countries,"" said Rystad Energy's senior gas and LNG analyst Kaushal Ramesh. 
The diversion of the tanker closest to Britain, the Fedor Litke, helped propel British gas prices higher on Wednesday, Refinitiv analysts said.
The British front-month gas price rose more than 40% on Wednesday to 410 pence per therm but was still short of a record high of 453 hit on Dec. 21. The British day-ahead gas price rose 37% to 405 pence per therm.
EU CONSIDERS BAN
Russia has supplied 7.5% of Britain's LNG imports so far this year and accounted for 19% of its imports in 2021, Ramesh said.
European Union states are also considering a ban on Russian ships entering the bloc's ports to tighten sea restrictions after a halt in air traffic, European officials say, a step that would further hamper Russia's commercial shipments. 
The European Parliament on Tuesday approved a non-binding resolution calling for broader sanctions on Russia as well as for EU ports to be closed to Russian ships, and ships coming to or from Russia, except for ""justified humanitarian reasons"". 
Trade sources said the new destination status for the four LNG vessels reflected caution over what will happen next with European ports.
The Dutch front-month gas contract, a European benchmark, ended trading 42% higher at 174 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) after setting a new record high of 185 euros/MWh.
Canada said on Tuesday that it too would shut its ports to Russian-owned ships later this week.
The Fedor Litke LNG tanker changed course late on Tuesday from its previous destination of Britain's Isle of Grain gas import terminal.
That followed the diversion of the NS Champion, an oil tanker operated by Russian shipping company Sovcomflot, which diverted away from Britain on Monday and sailed towards Denmark instead.
A spokesperson for  National Grid  (LON:NG), which operates Isle of Grain, said: ""We are fully supportive of government action to order UK ports to block all Russian-linked ships, and are in urgent discussions with government and customers to ensure this can be applied at LNG terminals.""
EXPORTS QUESTIONED 
The other three vessels - the Boris Davydov, the Christophe de Margerie and the Boris Vilkitsky - were headed to the Isle of Grain and French gas terminals at Montoir and Dunkirk before changing their destination status, the tracking data showed.
The controlling shareholder in Yamal LNG, Novatek, did not respond to requests for comment on the changes. The Christophe de Margerie is operated by Yamal LNG.
Greece-based Dynagas, which operates the Fedor Litke, Boris Davydov and Boris Vilkitsky according to shipping records, did not respond to a request for comment. 
The Montoir terminal was still expecting the Christophe de Margerie, said a spokesperson for the terminal operator Elegny, which is owned by Engie.
Another LNG vessel operated by Russian shipping company Sovcomflot, the La Perouse, was also expected at the terminal although it had no arrival date, the spokesperson said.
Sovcomflot has declined to comment this week. 

""The market seems to realise that Russia is not just a major pipeline exporter but also the world's fourth largest LNG exporter,"" analysts at Engie EnergyScan said in a note.
""With companies active in the LNG sector like Shell (LON:RDSa), BP (NYSE:BP) and now  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) deciding to exit the country and withdraw from their partnerships with Russian companies, the sustainability of Russia LNG exports is questioned,"" they wrote.

SPAR said 95% of its stores located in western Ukraine continued to operate, albeit with restricted hours, while Metro said 21 of its 26 Ukraine stores were open.
A SPAR spokesperson could not provide details about stores in east Ukraine that has felt the brunt of Russia's invasion, but said they were facing supply chain challenges. 
SPAR said it operates a combination of company-owned and independently operated stores in Ukraine numbering 68 in total. 
""The primary concern of SPAR Ukraine is of the safety of both their employees and customers,"" the company said, echoing similar sentiments from Metro, which employs 3,400 people in Ukraine. 
The German wholesaler added that none of its employees had been injured in the conflict and that it had evacuated employees and their families from its store in Mariupol on the border with Russia, which was closed due to security reasons.
In Russia, SPAR and Metro said they continued to operate business as usual, with the latter paying salaries and suppliers via international banks not affected by sanctions imposed since the invasion of Ukraine. 
The company said it feels responsible for its more than 10,000 employees in Russia, a Metro spokesperson said, adding: ""These people have no personal responsibility for the aggression against Ukraine.""
Metro, which has 93 stores in the country, did not go into more detail but said the move to pay employees through international banks was not new.

The Swiss-based group, which has three factories and around 5,000 employees in Ukraine, temporarily closed its operations last Thursday after Russian forces invaded in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two.
""We are trying to reopen parts of the supply chain and distribute to retailers where it is safe to do so. The latest information is this was partially possible,"" a Nestle spokesperson told Reuters.
Ukraine closed its ports last Thursday after the Russian invasion, sparking fears the country will eventually face food shortages due to an inability to import goods.

Nestle, maker of iconic products like Nescafe and Kit Kat, said while most the food products it sells in Ukraine are produced locally, some raw materials used to make the goods, like coffee and cocoa, are imported.
A trader at one of the world's largest commodity trade houses told Reuters he is having to redirect all the coffee he had headed to Ukraine as no shipping lines are prepared to transport goods there.

(Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Wednesday it will boost spending on electric vehicles to $50 billion, up from the previous $30 billion, through 2026 and run its EV unit separately from its legacy combustion engine business, in a move aimed at catching industry leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
The reorganization and additional investment comes as Chief Executive Jim Farley bets aggressively on the company's electrification strategy.
Farley said Ford plans to build more than 2 million EVs in 2026, about one-third of its annual global production, with EVs rising to 50% of its total volume by 2030.
Ford shares were up 7.2% at $17.90 at midday on Wednesday.
The company does not expect to make a profit on its EV business until the next-generation models begin production in 2025, according to Chief Financial Officer John Lawler.
Reuters on Tuesday was first to report that Ford planned to separate its main vehicle efforts into two separate businesses in order to accelerate its electric-vehicle efforts.
Although the EV business, named Ford Model e, will be separated from the company's internal-combustion engine (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) unit, Ford Blue, the two divisions will share technology and ""best practices,"" the automaker said. 
The two businesses, along with commercial-vehicle unit Ford Pro, will report separate financial results by 2023, it added. 
""We view the news positively as it has strong industrial logic, and it will enable investors to separately value the money-losing EV business,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Colin Langan said in a note.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) auto analyst Brian Johnson said in a note titled ""Reorganization not restructuring"" that Ford's announcement suggests it is ""likely to accelerate its progress towards a BEV future - but not to a near-term spin.""
Doug Field will lead Ford Model e's product development as chief EV and digital systems officer, and Lisa Drake will head EV industrialization for the unit.
Farley's move stops short of addressing calls from some investors who have pushed Ford and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) to spin off their EV operations as a way to extract the full value of those businesses.
Industry analysts, however, said that with Wednesday's announcement, Ford would be setting the table for a possible spinoff of its EV unit down the road.
Ford said it hoped to cut structural costs of up to $3 billion in its ICE business, but did not say if that effort would involve reducing head count. Farley also said the EV unit will need to spend ""billions"" to secure critical raw materials for batteries as EV volume ramps up.
""We need the ICE business to generate cash and the EV business to focus on innovation,"" Farley said.

He had previously said that his management team believed the automaker's EV and ICE businesses are underperforming on an earnings basis.
Ford said it expects to spend $5 billion on EVs this year, a two-fold rise over 2021. It is also targeting an adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin of 10% by 2026 versus 8% it hopes to achieve this year.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp will halt production at its Russian factory from Friday while vehicle imports into the country have also stopped indefinitely due to supply chain disruptions, the automaker said.
Toyota joins other Japanese automakers that have taken or flagged similar moves, also citing difficulty in procuring parts and other logistical hurdles. 
Western companies have spurned Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, with some saying they would exit investments there, but the response of many Japanese firms has been more muted so far. 
""Like everyone around the world, Toyota is watching the ongoing developments in Ukraine with great concern for the safety of people of Ukraine and hopes for a safe return to peace as soon as possible,"" Toyota said in a statement.
Toyota is Russia's top Japanese brand, producing about 80,000 vehicles at its St. Petersburg plant which employs 2,000 staff. 
Among other Japanese brands, Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY) Corp, which sold 30,000 cars in Russia last year, said exports of parts to its joint venture plant in Vladivostok would end soon. 
Mitsubishi Motor Corp may suspend production and sales in Russia, it said, citing potential supply chain disruptions as a result of sanctions on Russia.
Honda Motor Co said difficulty in shipping vehicles and making payments led it to suspend exports of cars and motorcycles to Russia, although sales totalled just 1,406 cars in the 2020 financial year.

Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co, which sold 53,000 vehicles in 2021, said it was continuing operations in Russia for now while monitoring the situation there.
Autos and auto parts made up more than half of Japan's exports to Russia in 2020, according to the finance ministry.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A mediator in Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy case on Wednesday indicated an agreement was being drafted between the company's owners and U.S. states pressing for more money to resolve allegations that the OxyContin maker fueled the opioid epidemic. 
Members of the wealthy Sackler family, who own Purdue Pharma, have been trying to reach an agreement with eight states and the District of Columbia, after they had blocked a previous settlement that included a $4.3 billion cash payment. 
The Sacklers had proposed a settlement worth up to $6 billion in mediation, and most of the states had agreed to settle on those terms, according to a report filed in February by mediator Shelley Chapman.
Chapman reported on Wednesday that she was unilaterally extending talks, which U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain had allowed if she is actively involved in drafting terms. 
While neither Purdue nor the mediator offered any details during a Wednesday court hearing, Drain said he believed the mediation was proceeding as hoped after ""reading between the lines"" of the latest report.
To allow the mediation to progress, Drain extended a litigation shield that protects the Sacklers from being sued for their alleged role in the opioid crisis until March 23. The shield would have expired on March 3 if it was not extended.
In her report, Chapman said she will file another mediation update ""at the appropriate time"" and did not request an extension with an end-date, as she has in previous reports. 
While the mediation continues, Purdue is also trying to revive its prior bankruptcy plan that was based on the $4.3 billion settlement.
The company is appealing a December ruling by a U.S. District judge that blocked the plan, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York has said it will hold oral arguments during the last week in April.

Purdue filed for Chapter 11 protection in September 2019 after being hit with thousands of lawsuits claiming that the company and members of the Sackler family used deceptive marketing to fuel a nationwide opioid epidemic.
The company pleaded guilty to misbranding and fraud charges related to its marketing of OxyContin in 2007 and 2020. Members of the Sackler family have denied wrongdoing.

LONDON (Reuters) -British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) has experienced surface degradation on Airbus A350 jets but not to the same extent as Qatar Airways and it will not affect planned deliveries, its CEO said. 
Qatar and Airbus have been at loggerheads for months, with both sides turning to the courts to settle a very public dispute after Qatar grounded 22 A350 jets over erosion to their painted surface and lightning protection. 
Airbus says the issues are no reason to ground the planes.
IAG Chief Executive Luis Gallego told Reuters that operators were having some surface degradation issues but that Europe's safety aviation regulator (EASA) had said they did not impact the airworthiness of IAG's aircraft. 
""We can see the problem in daily checks but mainly when you stop the aircraft for the first C-check,"" he said in an interview, adding that ""we have very young aircraft, so the level of defects that we see maybe is not comparable to others"". 
A C-check is a lengthy inspection carried out after a certain amount of time or usage, generally around three years. 
""We have informed in our case EASA, and EASA told us that the level of degradation that we are experiencing doesn't impact the airworthiness of the aircraft,"" he said, outlining for the first time the defects seen by the group. 
""We have a young fleet of 350s and usually you can see the defect when you have the opportunity to stop the aircraft for a check,"" he added. 
EASA has said it has not identified any airworthiness problems with the A350 in general. Qatar Airways says it needs more analysis.
Gallego said that IAG was still accepting A350s and if the situation continues as it is, the company will continue to accept the aircraft. 
His comments come as IAG also holds advanced talks with planemakers on a shake up of its medium-haul fleet that could see it opt for Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus jets.
IAG stunned the industry nearly three years ago when it unveiled a tentative order for 200 Boeing 737 MAX jets at a time when the model was grounded after two fatal crashes.

COVID-19 caused that deal to lapse and the airline group later started a formal contest between Boeing and Airbus.
""We are analysing what options we have for the narrowbody; the MAX is a very good aircraft and it's an option that we are considering,"" he said.

UBS, Baird, Cowen, Susquehanna and Wolfe Research were quick to cut their targets for the stock, according to reports. Wolfe sees the stock at $65 while UBS lowered it to $76. The stock is currently just short of $68.
October-December net sales rose 50% to $0.9 billion but were still short of estimates. Full-year sales were $2.9 billion, and the company is now projecting that to fall to at least $2.6 billion in the current year. Sales could be even lower at $2.4 billion, according to the company’s guidance.
The company closed December with a contracted backlog of 26.2 GW.
CEO Mark Widmar said the company “will continue to navigate near-term headwinds with a focus on the future”.
The company issued a wide range for its 2022 projected operating income, implying a significant fall to $55 million to $155 million in 2022 from $587 million. The company blamed this on production start-up expenses and underutilization of losses related to factory upgrades.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Investment firm Donerail Group has abandoned plans to buy gaming equipment company Turtle Beach (NASDAQ:HEAR) Corp and is instead seeking to oust all of its six board members including its CEO, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Donerail, which owns a 7.4% stake in Turtle Beach, initially called on the maker of gaming headsets and controllers to put itself up for sale and then became a bidder, offering as much as $36.50 a share.
""We have withdrawn our most recent offer and are now 100% committed to turning around the Company in the public market and for the benefit of all shareholders,"" the letter said.
Donerail, which is run by two former Starboard Value executives, said it wants to improve Turtle Beach's operations, capital allocation and corporate governance.
""Turtle Beach is currently plagued by governance, financial and strategic issues that need to be addressed by a more focused, open-minded and self-aware leadership team,"" William Wyatt, one of Donerail's founders, wrote in the letter to fellow shareholders.
A Turtle Beach representative was not immediately available for comment. 
Although Turtle Beach is a leader in the global gaming headset market, Wyatt said the company's shares have tumbled more than 60% since CEO Juergen Stark took the helm nearly 10 years ago.
Wyatt and Wes Calvert founded Donerail in 2018 after spending years at Starboard, one of the industry's most successful activist investment firms. Calvert worked on the Starboard team that replaced the entire 12-person board at Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI).
Donerail said in the letter it expects to release a detailed operating plan to show other Turtle Beach investors how it expects to ""produce long-term sustainable value.""
Over the last 12 months, Turtle Beach's stock price has dropped roughly 30%, shrinking the company's market value to roughly $340 million. The shares last closed at $21.07 on Tuesday, sliding 11% on the day.

302,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 11:53AM ET</span>",Russian airlines face outcast status as jetmakers freeze parts,"By Jamie Freed and Tim Hepher
(Reuters) -Russian aviation veered towards isolation on Wednesday as Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus halted the supply of components and analysts predicted carriers may strip parked planes for parts or be tempted to explore alternative sources to continue flying.
Flagship Aeroflot and other carriers faced the Western crackdown as the effects of sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine ripple across the global aviation sector.
The United States said late on Tuesday that it would follow the European Union and Canada in banning Russian flights in a move that is likely to trigger Russian retaliation.
Boeing said it had ""suspended major operations"" in Russia, where it also has research and engineering centres.
Airbus said it is halting supply of parts and services to Russian airlines but is also analysing whether its Moscow engineering centre could continue providing services to local customers. It did not say what kind of work this might involve. 
The bans come just as major powers discuss reviving a deal that lifted similar sanctions against Iran, until Washington withdrew in 2018.
Sanctions against Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"", will have greater consequences than those on Iran or North Korea, given the size of its market.
""With Western lessors also looking to repossess jets that are operated by Russian carriers, the Russian aviation sector is now on a footing that is similar to North Korea and Iran – and similar to where it was under Soviet rule,"" wrote Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard.
Russia accounted for 6% of airline capacity in 2021, according to consultants IBA. 
Its airlines have a total of 332 Boeing and 304 Airbus jets, or about two thirds of Russia's fleet, Cirium Fleets data shows.
How quickly those are starved of parts will depend on how many critical items airlines hold.
Jetliners are subject to constant oversight ranging from daily checks to heavy maintenance every six years.
While routine problems might not require immediate repairs provided the issue is addressed in a certain number of days, some parts remain essential for a plane to depart.
Planes owned by Russian airlines can be flown domestically while they have sufficient parts in stock, but carriers may have trouble getting jets serviced in the shrinking areas of the world still accepting Russian planes, maintenance experts said.
Even where parts can be found outside the country, airlines face potential payment difficulties after some Russian banks were barred from the SWIFT international payments system. 
CANNIBALISATION
Unlike Iran's decaying jetliners inherited from decades of U.S. sanctions, Russia has an advanced fleet.
""It will have to create a full-fledged maintenance system for some types of aircraft. But before that... it will need to cannibalise some aircraft for use as spare parts,"" said Oleg Panteleev, head of Russian AviaPort analytical agency.
""Cannibalisation will be possible because the need for the planes will fall,"" Panteleev said.
Many airlines re-use parts from their own planes, but there have been complaints in the past that struggling airlines elsewhere have taken parts off leased planes, which are off-limits.
Lessors have until March 28 to wind up contracts under EU sanctions, but industry executives have expressed concern over whether Russian airlines and courts would comply.
Some 515 planes in Russia are leased from foreign companies, according to Cirium. There is no suggestion so far that Russian airlines have removed parts from leased jets without approval.
ALTERNATIVE SUPPLIES
Depending on the length of the crisis, some experts predict airlines may seek alternatives. Chinese parts are already used in some markets on older planes not serving the West, while Iran perfected a system of under-the-table supplies https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-sanctions-aviation-idINKCN0V90A1 over decades.
""Of course, it would be good for Russia to find suppliers and partners in third countries who would be ready to ensure stable shipments of all necessary components,"" Panteleev said.
""But if these countries say they are afraid of sanctions, Russia would need to search for foreign specialists and create a maintenance system at Russian factories.""
However, using unofficial parts would put valuable jets in a grey zone and make them difficult to finance once the war ends. That is something industry experts say Russia's international carriers, with a young average fleet, would battle to avoid.
Maintenance agreements are also at risk.
Aeroflot last year signed a long-term agreement with Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company (HAECO), which did not respond to a request for comment.
Lufthansa Technik said it had stopped serving Russian customers involving hundreds of planes.
Russian difficulties in sourcing spare parts could affect international airlines that still fly to Russia and sometimes require replacement parts at the destination.

Russian airlines will also be barred from taking new Western jets. They have 62 planes on order with Airbus or Boeing.
Russia's Sukhoi meanwhile aims to fit its home-grown regional Superjet with Russian engines by 2024.

303,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 11:45AM ET</span>",Rich Russians Spend Big on Luxury to Stop Savings Melting Away,"(Bloomberg) -- With sanctions on Russia sending the ruble plunging and keeping stock markets shuttered, the country’s wealthy are turning to luxury jewelery and watches in a bid to preserve the value of their savings.
Sales in Bulgari SpA’s Russian stores have risen in the last few days, the Italian jeweler’s chief executive officer said, after the international response to its invasion of Ukraine severely restricted the movement of cash.
“In the short term it has probably boosted the business,” Jean-Christophe Babin said in an interview with Bloomberg, describing Bulgari’s jewelery as a “safe investment.” 
“How long it will last it is difficult to say, because indeed with the SWIFT measures, fully implemented, it might make it difficult if not impossible to export to Russia,” he said, referring to restrictions on Russian access to the SWIFT financial-messaging system.
Even as consumer brands from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) and energy giants BP (NYSE:BP) Plc, Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). pull out of Russia, Europe’s biggest luxury brands are, so far, trying to continue operating in the country.
Talks May Resume, Belarus Faces More Sanctions: Ukraine Update
Bulgari, owned by LVMH SE, is far from alone. Richemont’s Cartier is still selling jewelery and watches, Swatch Group’s Omega timepieces are still available, as are Rolexes. All are continuing to make sales and trying to strike an apolitical stance.
“We are there for the Russian people and not for the political world,” Babin said. “We operate in many different countries that have periods of uncertainty and tensions.”
Much like gold, which can serve as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, luxury watches and jewelery can hold or even increase in price amid economic turmoil caused by war and conflict. 
Popular watches can change hands on the secondary market for three or four times their retail price. Yet the impact of the invasion on the value of luxury items is creating a potential public relations issue.
“It is true that luxury brands could decide not to serve the Russian market. Rationally, this would be a cost to them, possibly outweighed by the positive communication image they get in other markets,” Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said by email.
Sales in Russia and to Russians abroad account for less than 2% of overall revenue at LVMH and Swatch Group (SIX:UHR) and less than 3% at Richemont, a “relatively immaterial” level, according to a report this week by Edouard Aubin and fellow analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
That’s due, in part, to Russian income and wealth disparities, with a small number of billionaire oligarchs living way beyond the means of ordinary people. The average monthly wage in Moscow is about 113,000 rubles ($1,350 at pre-invasion exchange rates), and much lower in rural regions.
A spokesperson for Swatch Group said the company was monitoring the situation in Russia and Ukraine very closely and declined to comment further. Spokespeople for Richemont, Rolex, Hermes, LVMH and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) declined to comment.
Pressure on the major brands is growing. Trade publication Business of Fashion, backed by LVMH, urged retailers to shut down Russian stores and not to ship products online. In a widely shared editorial, Editor-in-chief Imran Amed said the move would be “largely symbolic” but that it would show “commitment to a strong moral position.”
Reaction has been minimal, so far. Balenciaga, a Kering SA brand whose creative director Demna Gvasalia is Georgian, scrapped all fashion content from its Instagram page days before its its autumn/winter show in Paris. In its place is the Ukrainian flag and a call to donate to the World Food Program.
Bulgari, established in 1884 by Sotirio Bulgari and bought in 2011 by LVMH, is likely to raise prices in Russia at some point, according to the CEO.
“If the ruble loses half of its value, our costs remain euro costs, we cannot lose money on what we sell, so will have to adapt the prices,” he said.
Whatever sales bump they experience, luxury watch and jewelery-makers may soon have difficulty restocking stores. Moscow closed its airspace to European Union countries, and the continent’s biggest logistics firms have halted shipments to Russia.
Bulgari plans to keep its stores open and forge ahead with the development of a new hotel in Moscow despite the war. Nevertheless, if the crisis lasts for months “it would be difficult to supply the country,” Babin said.

(Reuters) - Kellogg (NYSE:K) Co has won the dismissal of a proposed class-action lawsuit claiming its Strawberry Pop-Tarts do not contain enough strawberries.
U.S. District Judge Marvin Aspen in Chicago said no reasonable consumer could believe from Kellogg's packaging that the breakfast staple contained only strawberries, or more strawberries than other ingredients such as pears and apples.
""The word 'Strawberry,' combined with a picture of half of a strawberry and a Pop-Tart oozing red filling, does not guarantee that there will be a certain amount of strawberries in the product's filling,"" Aspen wrote in his decision on Tuesday.
Stacy Chiappetta, the plaintiff, said Kellogg defrauded shoppers with deceptive packaging for its Unfrosted Strawberry Pop-Tarts, which contain red food dye that she said makes the filling ""brighter and more appealing"" on grocery store shelves.
She accused the Battle Creek, Michigan-based company of violating federal and state consumer protection laws.
""I expect that many of these types of cases may be dismissed,"" her lawyer Spencer Sheehan said in an email on Wednesday. ""That does not mean the labeling is not misleading.""
Sheehan, who works in Great Neck, New York, has filed at least three similar lawsuits against Kellogg in Illinois and New York over its Frosted Strawberry, Whole Grain Frosted Strawberry and Frosted Chocolate Fudge Pop-Tarts.
He said different courts could reach opposite conclusions based on ""almost identical"" facts.
Kellogg and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.
Lawsuits over false labeling are common.

The law firm Perkins Coie, which defends companies against such claims, said 325 proposed class actions were filed in 2021 against the food and beverage industry, up from 221 a year earlier, marking the fourth straight annual increase.
The case is Chiappetta v Kellogg Sales Co, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 21-03545.

Investing.com –  Exxon Mobil  Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stock traded 2% higher Wednesday after the energy major set a target of $9 billion in reduction of structural costs by the end of 2023, $3 billion more than its previous plan envisaged.
Record-high crude prices are also adding to the gains in the stock.
Exxon's new savings will be enough to pay for 60% of the company’s dividend, the third highest in the S&P 500 Index, according to Bloomberg data. The savings will help to double earnings and cash flow “potential” by 2027 while boosting returns, Exxon said.
Under CEO Darren Woods, Exxon has followed an aggressive strategy to cut costs. It recently announced plans to relocate its Irving, Texas headquarters to its main campus in Houston. For the first time since the 1980s, the company has laid off staff, Bloomberg said.
The cost-cutting plan is expected to cheer investors as it means less production of polluting fuels. Exxon is pursuing a policy of eliminating emissions at its own operations on a net basis. This does not include pollution from its fossil fuels burnt at customer-end.
Exxon has allocated $15 billion over six years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in company operations and for investments in lower emission business opportunities.
The company also has plans for a hydrogen and carbon capture plant at its Baytown Refinery in Texas."

LONDON (Reuters) - With much of Moscow's $640 billion reserves under lock and key in the West and sanctions crippling cross-border capital flows, investors fear Russia may be heading for its first ever default on sovereign hard currency debt.
On Wednesday, foreign investors were effectively stuck with their holdings of rouble-denominated bonds -- known as OFZs -- after the central bank temporarily halted coupon payments and settlement system Euroclear stopped accepting Russian assets.
A rouble debt default has precedent -- Moscow reneged on OFZs during its 1998 financial crisis, but even then it kept up dollar bond payments. Before the latest devastating Western sanctions which froze central bank assets, such a Russian default was on no one's radar.
That is partly because Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"", has just $40 billion in international bonds outstanding across 15 dollar- or euro-denominated issues -- tiny relative to peers and its own gross domestic product. 
The bonds mostly traded well above par until mid-February, as investors shrugged off Moscow's troop build-up on Ukraine's border and U.S. warnings an invasion was imminent.
Fast forward two weeks and bond investors have come around to the view that default is no longer a distant prospect. Russia's risk premium has soared and credit default swaps - derivatives used to insure exposure - are at record highs.
And some dollar bonds now are priced below 30 cents in the dollar, with trading volumes abysmal.
Foreigners, who hold around half Russia's hard currency debt, are focusing on March 16 when it must pay $107 million in coupons across two bonds. 
""Will Russia pay or not? There's very significant uncertainty at this point, after the sanctions applied to the Russian central bank and the ministry of finance,"" said Marcelo Assalin, head of emerging market debt at investment manager and financial services firm William Blair in London, which holds some Russian debt.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and the global banking lobby group, the Institute of International Finance (IIF), have both warned there is a significant rise in risk that Russia could be headed for its first external debt default. 
March 16 is the first of several payments, with another $359 million due on a 2030 bond due on March 31. The first principal payment is due on April 4 when a $2 billion bond matures. 
SWIFT ACTION
In theory, Russia has ample reserves to cover debt. In practice, the asset freeze has shrunk what the central bank has available to make payments. 
Second, executing payments will be trickier after sanctions limited Moscow's access to the SWIFT global payment systems. And finally, asset freezes undermine Russia's ability to defend its currency, raising the cost of servicing foreign debt. 
""Freezing FX reserves could significantly weaken the rouble and raise default fears for sovereign and corporates,"" said Dirk Willer, head of macro, asset allocation and emerging markets strategy at Citi in New York.
The central bank and the finance ministry did not reply to a Reuters request for comment on the possibility of defaults.
Russia might be able to pay nonetheless, using available cash and even without SWIFT. But many argue it has little incentive to do so, given the West's targeting of savings it had held offshore.
""Western governments' resolve to cut off Russia from the international financial system, combined with a potentially weaker willingness on the part of the Russian government to service its debt on time and in full, raise the probability of more severe credit outcomes for foreign holders of Russian debt securities,"" rating agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said. 
Moscow has already banned foreign investors from selling domestic Russian assets and ordered a temporary suspension of payments on securities to foreign entities. 
For Moody's, the move reflects ""an increasing lack of predictability of policy decisions""
Moody's put its Baa3 Russia credit rating on a downgrade review on Friday. Hours later S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) cut its equivalent investment grade Russian rating to 'junk' and immediately put it on another downgrade warning. 
The bonds themselves have been issued with a mix of terms and indentures, notes JPMorgan. Notably, bonds sold after Russia was sanctioned over its 2014 annexation of Crimea contain a provision for alternative currency payments. 
If ""for reasons beyond its control"" Russia was unable to make payments or interest in the currencies the bonds were issued in, dollar and euro, payments can be made in dollars, euros, British pounds or Swiss franc, the documentation shows. 
Crucially, the rouble is listed as an alternative currency option for bonds issued since 2018, JPMorgan notes.

Because most of the eurobonds have a grace period of 30 days on both principal and coupon payments,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) calculates the earliest possible default could be April 15, when the grace period expires on the 2023 bond coupon. 
Meanwhile default fears have also crept into the $35 billion market of Russian corporate debt. State-controlled Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) must repay a $1.3 billion dollar bond on March 7 -- a litmus test of Moscow's attitude towards foreign creditors.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sanctions imposed on Russia have significantly increased the chance of the country defaulting on its dollar- and other international market government debt, analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and elsewhere warned on Wednesday.
Russia has over $700 million worth of government bond payments due this month. While in theory it has ample reserves to cover debt, in practice a freeze on some assets and other measures could affect its ability to make payments.
""The sanctioning of Russian government entities by the United States, counter-measures within Russia to restrict foreign payments, and disruptions of payment chains present high hurdles for Russia to make a bond payment abroad,"" JPMorgan said in a note to clients.
""Sanctions ... have significantly increased the likelihood of a Russia government hard currency bond default.""
The central bank and the finance ministry did not reply to a Reuters request for comment on the possibility of defaults.
The first crunch date, JP Morgan analysts said, is March 16 when two bond coupon payments are due, although like much of Russia's debt these have 30-day ""grace periods"" built into them, which would push back any formal moment of default to April 15.
Russia has just under $40 billion worth of international market or ""hard currency"" debt as it is known. While it is a small amount for an economy of Russia's importance, any missed payment will trigger a chain of events.
Major credit rating agencies like S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and Fitch, which all had investment grade scores for Russia until last week, would downgrade it en masse.
JPMorgan estimated that some $6 billion worth of Credit Default Swaps (CDS) that bondholders have bought as insurance policies would also need to payout, although the process could be complicated in the case of further debt sanctions.
The default concerns follow a warning from the Institute of International Finance (IIF) this week, which flagged how roughly half of Russia's $640 billion of foreign exchange reserves had effectively been frozen by international sanctions.
Capital Economics also warned on Wednesday of the growing default risks. It said it would primarily hit international investors - foreigners held $20 billion of Russia’s dollar- and rouble-denominated government debt at the end of last year, according to Russia's central bank - though it also would further scar Moscow's reputation in international markets.

""The likelihood that the government and companies are unable or unwilling to make external debt repayments has risen significantly,"" Jackson said.

(Reuters) -Carmakers including Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW and Porsche are struggling to obtain crucial wire harnesses as suppliers in western Ukraine have been shuttered by the Russian invasion, forcing them to curtail production.
Production of the part, needed for organizing miles of vehicle cables, has affected suppliers like Leoni, Fujikura and Nexans, and rippled through to major carmakers. 
Delivery bottlenecks have already hit some assembly plants of world No. 2 automaker Volkwagen, while Porsche's luxury unit has suspended production at its Leipzig plant. 
Rival BMW has also been affected.
""Due to supply bottlenecks, interruptions to our production will occur,"" BMW said in a statement. ""We are in intensive discussions with our suppliers.""
A wire harness is a vital set of parts which neatly bundle up to 5 kilometres (3.1 miles) of cables in the average car. Unique to each car model, vehicles cannot be built without them.
Suppliers like Leoni, which has two wire harness factories in western Ukraine, are scrambling to ""compensate for production losses"" and ""interruptions in our two plants in Stryi and Kolomyja, triggered by the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine,"" Leoni said in a statement.
Leoni said it had formed a task force to evaluate developments.
Suppliers including Germany's Forschner, Kromberg & Schubert, Prettl, SEBN and Japan's Yazaki have built up a hefty wire harness production sector in Ukraine, which has a lower-cost, skilled work force. 
According to an analysis of 2020 Comtrade data by consultancy AlixPartners, wire harnesses were Ukraine's most critical automotive component exported to the European Union, accounting for nearly 7% of all imports of this product. 
Ukrainian government figures show 22 automotive companies have invested more than $600 million in 38 plants - many, though not all producing wire harnesses - employing over 60,000 Ukrainians.
Those plants are close to car factories in Germany and the low-cost manufacturing hubs that German carmakers in particular have built in central Europe. 
Sweden's Volco Cars  ""In cases like this where the issue is not likely to go away quickly, automakers will need to seek out alternative solutions for the short- and mid-terms,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. 
It could take months for suppliers to increase capacity at other locations - requiring factory space, machinery and tools, workers and financing. Prior to the invasion, auto parts maker Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) Plc spent months doing just that - shifting high-volume production of parts for vehicles out of its two plants in Ukraine ahead of possible hostilities, the company's chief executive said last week.

(Reuters) -Clothes retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co warned of weaker margins in 2022 after missing holiday-quarter sales and profit estimates due to product shortages and COVID-19 curbs, sending shares down more than 17% in early trading on Wednesday. 
The Ohio-based retailer took a hit from factory closures in Vietnam and shipping delays, leading to shortages during the peak Christmas and New Year shopping period. The company's teen-focused Hollister brand was the most heavily impacted. 
""We had significant unexpected inventory receipt delays from late November into December leaving us unable to fulfill peak holiday demand,"" Chief Executive Fran Horowitz said on an earnings call.
Sales in the Asia Pacific region fell 21% in the quarter as renewed restrictions in some parts of the world due to a surge in the Omicron coronavirus variant forced the company to cut down on operating hours at its outlets. 
However, Horowitz said sales had started to improve as products arrived and COVID-19 cases fell, giving the firm momentum in the current quarter.
Abercrombie projected net sales for fiscal 2022 to rise 2% to 4%, above estimates of a 2.7% rise at midpoint.
The retailer offered fewer and smaller discounts to protect its margins but they were offset by higher-than-expected freight costs in the fourth quarter, with profit per share of $1.14 falling short of estimates of $1.27. 
The company said it expects gross margins to decline 200 basis points this year. 

Abercrombie's net sales rose to $1.16 billion in the fourth quarter from $1.12 billion a year earlier, but missed analysts' estimates of $1.18 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Teen apparel peer Urban Outfitters Inc (NASDAQ:URBN) also saw a fall in store traffic before Christmas, while  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO) Inc has signaled a hit to holiday sales due to the same factors of supply chain snarls and Omicron.

(Reuters) -Dollar Tree Inc on Wednesday missed Wall Street expectations for quarterly sales and flagged insipid annual sales, in another sign of rising inflation and declining stimulus hitting shoppers' pockets. 
Like other retailers, discount stores, traditionally known for their wide array of $1 products, have been raising prices and focusing on more expensive products such as clothes and home decor to deal with shrinking margins.
""As we look at the year, we do not see things getting better in the supply chain world,"" Chief Financial Officer Kevin Wampler said on a call with analysts.
""It's not just the rates to pay for the goods, it's also the rates you pay ... once it gets into the port, it's costing more to move the product."" 
Chesapeake, Virginia-based Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) said a headline-grabbing decision to start selling most products for $1.25 was implemented in its U.S. stores two months ahead of schedule.
Though this enabled the company to forecast strong annual profits, demand is expected to slow in an economic backdrop of decades-high inflation and a slowing of massive state cash stimulus during the COVID-19 crisis.
Evercore ISI analyst Michael Montani said rival Dollar General (NYSE:DG) should benefit from ""customer leakage"" after Dollar Tree's price regime change. 
Dollar General, which has cut annual forecast for both sales and profit, will report its fourth-quarter earnings on March 17.
Dollar Tree forecast full-year sales between $27.22 billion and $27.85 billion, below analysts' average estimate of $28.04 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

For the fourth-quarter that ended Jan. 29, sales came in at $7.08 billion, compared with the average analyst estimate of $7.12 billion. The company's earnings of $2.01 per share, excluding items, topped estimates of $1.77.
Shares of Dollar Tree were down about 4% at $134.04 in early trade on Wednesday.

(Reuters) -Exxon Mobil Corp on Wednesday said it will further slash expenses and its oil and gas production portfolio to boost returns, but offered no updates on shareholder returns.
The company began its annual update to investors a day after disclosing it would exit its last Russia operations in response to the invasion of Ukraine that sent oil prices to their highest level in eight years.
Exxon (NYSE:XOM) said it expects to cut annual costs by $9 billion in by 2023, $3 billion more than a previous target, in a drive to quickly pay down debt taken on during the pandemic and double earnings by 2027, over 2019 levels. 
Analysts said they were hoping to hear more on allocations of cash from high prices to shareholder returns and details on the financial fallout from its Russia exit. 
""The lack of changes in buybacks may be taken negatively today,"" said Jefferies equity analyst Giacomo Romeo. 
The company has been on a major cost-cutting drive after suffering a historic loss in 2020. In January, Exxon disclosed one of the most sweeping restructuring of its global operations.
“We’ve built a portfolio with flexibility to adjust investments between our traditional oil, gas and products business and new lower-emissions opportunities,"" Chief Executive Darren Woods said in a statement. 
The business outline was consistent with Exxon previous goals and if the targets are achieved, give the company a way to stand apart from peers, said Biraj Borkhataria, co-head of European energy research at RBC Capital Markets.
""The company has a mixed track record on its medium-term guidance, which may leave some investors more cautious,"" Borkhataria said.
Exxon's free cash flow suggests there could be $15 billion available for higher distributions to investors, he said. 
Exxon, which reported some of its best financial results in the fourth quarter of last year on surging oil and gas prices, said it was upgrading its portfolio with ""low-cost-of-supply"" opportunities to further improve future earnings.
It highlighted the Permian basin of Texas and New Mexico, the top U.S. shale field where Exxon plans to grow production by 25% this year, as part of those low-cost opportunities. Guyana and Brazil are its other focus areas.
The company also reaffirmed plans to invest between $21 billion and $24 billion this year and between $20 billion and $25 billion per year through 2027, directing a large portion of that money to low-carbon projects.

Spending plans include more than $15 billion over the next six years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the company's operations and for investments in lower-emission business opportunities, Exxon said.
The company's shares were up 2% at $80.86 in early trading as U.S. crude oil prices crossed $110 per barrel, near an eight-year high.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Exxon Mobil on Tuesday said it would exit Russia oil and gas operations that it has valued at more than $4 billion and halt new investment as a result of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
The decision will see Exxon (NYSE:XOM) pull out of managing large oil and gas production facilities on Sakhalin Island in Russia's Far East, and puts the fate of a proposed multi-billion dollar liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility there in doubt. 
""We deplore Russia's military action that violates the territorial integrity of Ukraine and endangers its people,"" the company said in a statement critical of the intensifying military attacks.
Its planned exit follows dozens of other Western companies ranging from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) to BP (NYSE:BP) PLC, Shell (LON:RDSa) and Norway's Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) that have halted business or announced plans to abandon their Russia operations.
Exxon, which is scheduled to meet with Wall Street analysts on Wednesday, did not provide a timetable for its exit, nor comment on potential asset writedowns. Its Russia assets were valued at $4.055 billion in its latest annual report, filed in February. 
Earlier, Exxon began removing U.S. employees from Russia, two people familiar with the matter said. The number of staff being evacuated was unclear. The company sent a plane to Sakhalin Island to retrieve staff, one of the people said. 
Exxon operates three large offshore oil and gas fields with operations based on Sakhalin Island on behalf of a consortium of Japanese, Indian and Russian companies that included Russia's Rosneft. The group had been advancing plans to add a LNG export terminal at the site. 
""Exxon's Russian business is relatively small in the context of its wider enterprise, so it does not have the same significance as it has to BP or TotalEnergies, if it were to abandon its Russian assets,"" said Anish Kapadia, a director at energy and mining researcher Pallissy Advisors. 
The company, which has been developing its Russian oil and gas fields since 1995, had come under pressure to cut its ties with Russia over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"". 
The Sakhalin facilities, which Exxon has operated since production began in 2005, represents one of the largest single direct investments in Russia, according to a project description on Exxon's website. The operation recently has pumped about 220,000 barrels per day of oil.
India's ONGC Videsh, which owns a 20% stake in the Sakhalin-1 project, said the partners will decide over the next few weeks on how to keep operating the project after exit, the Indian company told Reuters in an emailed statemnt.
Rosneft holds a 20% stake in the project.
The overseas investment arm of India's top explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp also said it did not see ""any immediate impact"" on the operation of the project due to Exxon's decision. 

Japan's Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development (SODECO), which owns a 30% stake in the Sakhalin-1 project, is trying to confirm details of Exxon's announcement, a spokesperson said, adding that it will keep an eye on the Russia-Ukraine situation and decide what to do in the future. 
State-backed oil producer Japan Petroleum Exploration Co (Japex), which owns 15.285% in SODECO, is also checking details of the Exxon's announcement and will talk to its partners to decide a future plan, a Japex spokesperson said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened with a modest bounce on Wednesday, recouping around one third of what they lost on Tuesday as the war in Ukraine intensified. 
A more vigorous rebound was prevented by surges in prices for oil, gas and agricultural commodities due to fears over the availability of Russian exports. That risks stoking an already-worring inflationary trend in global markets, not least in the U.S.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell repeated in prepared remarks to Congress that inflation is too high and is expected to remain above target for longer than first thought. As such, he repeated previous guidance that a first rate hike in four years is likely this month, to be followed by the start of sales from the Fed's bond portfolio. Powell said it was too early to judge the medium-term impact on the U.S. economy from Russia's invasion and the West's response to it.
His colleague on the Fed's policy-making committee, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, was more forthright, saying that the effect on the U.S. economy will be smaller than that on Europe's, and that the Fed still needs to tighten policy rapidly.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 210 points, or 0.6%, at 33,505 points, while the S&P 500 was up 0.8% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 0.4%.
Earlier, there was fresh evidence that the U.S. labor market is riding out the winter wave of Covid-19, with payrolls processor ADP reporting that 475,000 people were hired by the private sector in the month through mid-February. That was 100,000 more than expected. More eye-catching was ADP's revision to the previous month's figure, which swung from an initial assessment of -301,000 to +509,000. The scale of the revision is likely to further erode the credibility of an indicator that was once seen as an accurate real-time guide to employment trends.
Early movers to stand out included Ford Motor (NYSE:F), after it announced that it will split its legacy automotive business from its new electric vehicle operations in an effort to unlock value. Ford also said it will boost EV spending by $20 billion over the next five years - to $50 billion from $20 billion - in an effort to recapture market share from earlier movers such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Ford stock, which has lost a quarter of its value since early January, rose 6.7%. 
Elsewhere, troubled department store chain Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) soared 34% after it said it expects to be able to return cash to shareholders in the current quarter. SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) stock rose 15% after the personal finance company said revenue grew 54% on the year in the fourth quarter, leading to a sharp reduction in its net loss.
Going in the other direction, Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock fell 4.2%, hitting a new 52-week low as the market took the messages coming from the bank's investor day negatively. The bank, perceived as having a larger direct exposure to Russia than its peers, issued underwhelming targets for returns on capital over the next three years as CEO Jane Fraser said restoring its competitiveness would be a ""multiyear journey."""

The Dow Jones Russia GDR Index, which tracks London-traded Russian companies, has plunged 98% in two weeks. The slump has wiped $572 billion from the market value of 23 stocks, including  Gazprom  (MCX:GAZP) PJSC (LON:GAZPq), Sberbank of Russia PJSC (LON:SBNCyq) and  Rosneft  PJSC (LON:ROSNq), according to Bloomberg calculations. 
Wednesday’s continuing selloff triggered a wave of volatility halts. Within the first four hours of trading, dealing was briefly paused at least 15 times for lender Sberbank, state-run gas giant Gazprom (LON:GAZPq) and retailer Magnit PJSC  (LON:MGNTq). Trading in VTB Bank PJSC (LON:VTBRq) was suspended last week following sanctions.
The Dow Jones Russia GDR (LON:RUSL) gauge, which tracks 11 of the largest Russian companies listed in London, fell as much as 81% Wednesday, taking a decline since Feb. 16 to 98%. 
Depositary receipts for Sberbank have slumped 98% this month, while Gazprom fell 98% and steel producer Severstal PJSC (LON:SVSTq) lost almost 100%. Rosneft Oil Co. (LON:ROSNq) tumbled 65% and Lukoil PJSC (LON:LKOHyq) sank 98%.
Europe is carving up Sberbank’s business in the region after sanctions sparked by President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine prompted a run on its local deposits. Meanwhile, European energy companies are distancing themselves from Gazprom, with Shell Plc (LON:RDSa) and Italy’s Eni SpA (LON:0N9S) ending joint ventures.
With the Russian central bank taking the unusual step of closing stock trading on the Moscow exchange, the movement in shares of Russian firms listed elsewhere is an indication of how local equities may react to the sanctions once it eventually resumes. The three-day shuttering of stock trading is the longest closure for extraordinary circumstances since October 1998, according to the bourse.

Investing.com – Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) stock soared 27% while Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) shares lost almost a tenth of their value in Wednesday’s premarket trading, reflecting the companies’ respective delivery on analysts’ expectations of them.
Nordstrom said it expects to be in a position to return cash to shareholders in the ongoing quarter. For the fourth quarter ended January 29, net sales jumped 23% to $4.49 billion as the retailer made sure that Americans returning to work after two years of the pandemic found its upscale apparel and footwear on the shelves.
Inventory levels at the end of the quarter were higher than planned, but the company said it aims to reduce the levels relative to sales in the current quarter.
The retailer has earlier attracted flak for the underwhelming performance of its off-price Rack division and its inability to ensure its stores were sufficiently stocked. For the Nordstrom Rack banner, net sales jumped 23%.
Margins expanded at the company due to narrower discounts and tighter cost control. Nordstrom forecast 2022 revenue to rise 5-7%.
That compares favorably with the 2-4% growth forecast at Abercrombie which had $3.7 billion in revenue in 2021. Abercrombie is also guiding for a hit to margins due to inflation after its struggles with product shortages in the recent quarter, an outcome many retailers face due to pandemic-induced capacity curbs at key supply centers in China, Vietnam, and elsewhere in Asia.
Net sales in the fourth quarter rose 4% to $1.2 billion but remained below the pre-pandemic levels. Adjusted profit per share fell 36 cents to $1.14.

327,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 09:06AM ET</span>","Exclusive-BA-owner IAG looking at options, but not a rights issue","By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) -British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) is examining all options to cope with a volatile business environment, but does not need a rights issue for now because it can see bookings recover, its boss said.
Chief Executive Luis Gallego told Reuters the airline group was recovering from the turmoil of the pandemic but that in an uncertain environment it would be negligent not to look at different scenarios and how best to address them. 
""We don't have a plan right now to do a rights issue because in the current circumstances that we have, we see the recovery of the business, we see the high level of bookings,"" he said in an interview. 
Gallego replaced Willie Walsh in September 2020 to run one of the biggest airline groups in the world, seeking to steer a company that also owns Aer Lingus, Iberia and Vueling through the biggest crisis in modern aviation. 
Since the pandemic hit, IAG has had to scrap thousands of jobs, raise billions of euros and navigate frequently changing COVID restrictions, before the outbreak of war in Ukraine shut vast swathes of airspace and pushed the price of oil higher.
He said in an unpredictable environment IAG was analysing scenarios for the business - ""and always we have in mind that what we want is to maximise shareholders' value."" 
Asked if the group, with 11.7 billion euros ($13 billion) of net debt, would consider asset sales or partnerships with other airlines, Gallego said: ""We would be negligent if we don't analyse all of these scenarios because the world is very uncertain now and we need to analyse all of them."" 
Bernstein analysts said on Monday IAG did not need an equity fundraising because it had enough liquidity, but that it could pursue one to gain flexibility, though not at a steep discount. 
RECOVERY IN SIGHT
IAG said on Friday it expected to return to profitability in the second quarter, with passenger capacity expected to reach 85% of pre-pandemic levels this year. It should also benefit from the collapse or retrenchment of rivals on key routes, and is hedged against volatile crude prices.
Gallego said IAG had not seen any impact on bookings from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the rerouting of flights to places like Singapore, Pakistan and India to avoid Russian airspace was manageable. 
Airline analysts have said the closure of Russian airspace could delay the reopening of routes between Asia and Europe after the pandemic, but Gallego said he did not expect flights to the likes of China or Hong Kong to be restarting soon anyway. 
On Friday, hours after delivering a more upbeat set of results, the CEO faced another challenge when British Airways was hit by an IT failure that echoed a lengthy computer outage in 2017 that damaged its reputation. 
Gallego said the latest problem, which was resolved by Saturday, was sparked by a hardware issue and that the group had constantly increased IT investment, with non-fleet capital spending - the majority of it IT-related - set to be around 600 million euros this year. 
Further out, he said the industry was still working to fully understand how people would want to travel after the pandemic. Currently, demand for premium leisure destinations is strong due to pent up demand and the fact many people can now live and work anywhere. 

""I am sure that we are going to adapt our business to these new requirements,"" he said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures trimmed their overnight gains on Wednesday after prepared remarks to Congress by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank is still likely to raise interest rates within weeks.
""With inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, we expect it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at our meeting later this month,"" Powell's prepared remarks to the House Financial Services Committee said. 
Dow Jones futures ticked down by some 80 points to 33,400 within 10 minutes of the news, while S&P 500 futures fell some 10 points. Both remained above their Tuesday closing levels, but the move means that both contracts have managed only a minimal bounce after suffering heavy losses again on Tuesday.
Surging oil prices and increasing fears about the availability of Russian energy and agricultural commodities have reinforced concerns about inflation overnight. 
""Demand is strong, and bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond,"" Powell said in his prepared remarks. ""These supply disruptions have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus, and price increases are now spreading to a broader range of goods and services.""
He added that the immediate effects on the U.S. economy from the invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing Western reaction ""remain highly uncertain.""
""Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the economy evolves in unexpected ways. We will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook,"" Powell said."

Investing.com – Dollar Tree stock (NASDAQ:DLTR) traded 1.22% lower in premarket Wednesday on missing fourth quarter revenue estimates while all its U.S. stores transitioned to a new price point of $1.25 by February-end, two months ahead of schedule.
The company’s outlook was disappointing too. Consolidated net sales for 2022 are expected between $27.22 billion and $27.85 billion, compared to $26.31 billion in 2021.
After being loyal to the founders’ principle of selling most items at $1 or less for 35 years, Dollar Tree junked the original brand identity in November as inflation weighed and the company found it difficult to sell many products at that price point. It had to continuously keep pulling more and more products out of that price level until it just lost its relevance.
Higher freight costs and recall-related markdowns weighed on the margins that fell in the fourth quarter.
Net profit in the fourth quarter fell 10% to $454 million. The company took a hit of $34 million in the period after discovery of more than 1,000 dead rodents at a distribution facility in West Memphis, Arkansas led to the shutting of 404 Family Dollar stores in six states and the recall of several products.
Selling, general and administrative expenses rose due to higher store payroll, card transaction fees, legal fees, and costs associated with the $1.25 price point conversions at all U.S. Dollar Tree stores.
Consolidated net sales rose 4.6% to $7.08 billion. Enterprise same-store sales were up 2.5%. Same-store sales at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar increased 3.1% and 1.7%, respectively.
Net sales in the current quarter are seen between $6.63 billion and $6.78 billion at a consolidated level.
The company currently has $2.5 billion remaining under a share repurchase program."

The company wrestled with severe shortages of women's apparel and shoes at Rack stores for most of last year, with management blaming the underperformance to faulty internal inventory decisions as much as wider supply-chain issues.
Fourth-quarter sales at Rack improved 320 basis points sequentially, with Chief Executive Officer Erik Nordstrom saying the business was well on its way to recovery as the department store boosts inventory and pushes for higher-priced products to bolster margins.
""We have a lot of effort going on in our Rack business... we like our plans and believe there's opportunity for continued improvement there,"" Nordstrom said on an analyst call.
Wall Street was also impressed with how the business was bouncing back, given that its issues were in part responsible for a string of disappointing quarterly results from Nordstrom in 2021 and the company sliding further behind chief rivals Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) and Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS).
Nordstrom's shares have lost nearly half their value in the last 12 months, while those of Macy's have gained roughly 60%.

""We do not confirm the media reports that Nord Stream 2 has filed for bankruptcy. 
""The company only informed the local authorities that the company had to terminate contracts with employees following the imposition of U.S. sanctions on the company,"" Nord Stream 2 AG said in emailed comments.
The firm, based in Zug, Switzerland, was considering filing for insolvency, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters earlier this week, as it attempts to settle claims ahead of a U.S. sanction deadline for entities to stop dealings with it.
Separately, Zug's cantonal economy director, Silvia Thalmann, said that process had not been activated.
""We know that Nord Stream 2 is facing enormous payment difficulties. The company has not until now filed for bankruptcy with the Zug Commercial Registry Office,"" she said.
The 1,230 km (767 mile) Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany had not begun commercial operations as it awaited German certification. That approval process was put on hold last week as a result of the escalating Ukraine crisis.

Investing.com – Ford Motor stock (NYSE:F) traded 4.4% higher in premarket Wednesday on a Reuters report the company plans to operate its electric vehicle (EV) and internal combustion engine (ICE) units as separate businesses.
The move is aimed at fast tracking growth in the EV business, a focus area for most automakers today.
The EV and ICE businesses will have separate names but will remain under the Ford corporate umbrella, in the same way the company operates its Ford Pro commercial business for corporate customers, the news agency said.
The company plans to have separate executives leading the businesses to eventually have separate financial results being reported at the two units.
The reported exercise is still far from the spinoff most analysts and investors have long called for at American legacy automakers, struggling with their legacy businesses while pure EV players like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and China’s Nio (NYSE:NIO) and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) take away much of the share of the new market.
A spinoff will attract better valuations for the EV business and redirect resources to the faster-growing segment. At $893 billion, Tesla is valued at more than the combined market cap of most major automakers in the world.

LONDON (Reuters) -Russia's invasion of Ukraine will not have a dramatic impact on bookings in eastern Europe so long as the war doesn't escalate, Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said on Wednesday, adding the airline was well-placed to deal with surging oil prices.
Ryanair, like others, suspended all of its flights to and from Ukraine last week as Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour.
O'Leary said bookings were down 20% last Thursday and Friday compared to the previous week and around 10% over the weekend, but believed the short-term hit to demand would recover.
""I think you will not have a dramatic impact on bookings as long as the period of war doesn't escalate and spread elsewhere,"" O'Leary told reporters.
""If nothing untoward happens, I expect (bookings) would be back to normal by next week.""
Airlines, trying to recover from two years of the coronavirus pandemic, also face a potential hit to their earnings from surging oil prices that have risen to over $100 a barrel since the invasion.
O'Leary predicted bigger problems for his rivals, saying that Ryanair's strong recovery from two COVID-hit summers would be driven by our ""somewhat fortuitous fuel-hedging strategy, which means we can pass on the benefit of oil at $65 a barrel for almost all of the next 12 months"".
Ryanair is 80% hedged on fuel out to 2023, but rising prices will still cost the airline group around 50 million euros ($55.5 million) over the next 12 months, O'Leary said, adding Ryanair would not introduce fuel charges for the summer. 
O'Leary vowed Ryanair would be the first airline back into Ukraine when it reopened, which could be this year, depending on the extent of damage to its airport infrastructure. 
He also pointed to a huge increase in demand for flights to and from Polish cities as many Ukrainians attempt to reunite with their families, and predicted people in Britain and Ireland who had chosen domestic holidays over the last two years would be desperate to go abroad.

""I think you're going to see families returning to the beaches of Europe this year,"" he said. ""They went to the beaches of the west of Ireland and Cornwall last year, and I think they never want to go back there again.""

The main Wall Street indices have seen volatile trading since the end of last week when Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized the invasion of Ukraine. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down almost 600 points, or 1.8%, on Tuesday, after ceasefire talks failed and Russia pressed forward with its invasion into Ukraine.
Investors could take advantage of the recent slump in the main averages by snapping up some bargains at the open on Wednesday, but attention is likely to be on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell as he starts his two-day testimony before Congress later Wednesday.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to start raising interest rates at its next policy-setting meeting later this month to combat soaring inflation. Investors will be listening closely to what Powell says given the new economic and financial tests the Russian invasion of Ukraine poses.
U.S. President Joe Biden used his first State of the Union address late Tuesday to put forward several proposals to help keep prices in check. He also addressed the conflict in Ukraine, saying Russian President Vladimir Putin would pay a high price for his move.

Oil prices soared to seven-year highs, climbing above $110 a barrel, as traders sought out alternate sources of crude in an already tight market, avoiding Russian supply following the sanctions on Russian banks.
These gains come despite Tuesday’s announcement of a coordinated release of 60 million barrels of oil by International Energy Agency member countries.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, including Russia, together known as OPEC+, meets later Wednesday and is widely expected to stick to its previously announced plans to add 400,000 barrels per day of supply each month despite the elevated prices. 
Also due later in the session is the weekly U.S. crude inventory from the Energy Information Administration, following on from the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute reporting late Tuesday that U.S. crude inventories fell by 6.1 million barrels last week.

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto dealers, flush with cash, are buying each other at a record pace, but they are not closing stores in the process. 
Defying predictions that the internet and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's direct-to-consumer sales strategy would kill traditional auto dealerships, acquisitions in the sector hit a record $8 billion in value last year, according to data from Kerrigan Advisors, a company that tracks transactions among largely private auto dealer groups. That is more than triple the $2.5 billion for 2020. 
Most of the buyers were large public or private auto retail chains, such as Asbury (NYSE:ABG) Automotive Group Inc and Lithia Motors (NYSE:LAD) Inc. Many of the sellers were smaller, family-controlled operations, said Erin Kerrigan, founder of Kerrigan Advisors.
""We had 338 unique transactions in the industry,"" Kerrigan said. ""The prior peak was 288 in 2020."" Publicly traded dealer groups bought over 250 dealerships last year, she said.
Despite the deal activity, the number of stores that car buyers could visit has remained stable for the past decade, according to a survey by Urban Science, a consultancy. 
As of July 1, 2021, Urban Science counted 18,157 dealerships, or ""rooftops,"" in the United States, up 46 stores from six months earlier. In 98% of local markets in the United States, Urban Science found no net change in the number of auto dealerships. 
In short, ownership has consolidated, but the U.S. auto retail infrastructure has not.
""As far as the public goes, it looks like the same number of dealers are out there,"" said Urban Science Global Director of Data Mitch Phillips.
For consumers, the consolidation of auto dealer ownership could be largely invisible in the short term. But longer term, industry executives say larger dealer groups will be better equipped to deploy technology to enable faster online shopping and financing, allow customers to select from a wider array of vehicles at multiple stores and get repairs done more conveniently.
Car dealers from across the United States will gather in Las Vegas starting on March 10 for the annual convention of the National Auto Dealers Association. Those who hit the Strip will do so after one of the most profitable years ever for the auto retailing sector.
Auto dealers have thrived during the pandemic, despite 
challenges from technology-driven disruptors such as online used car retailer  Carvana  Co (NYSE:CVNA). Unlike department stores battered by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), new-vehicle dealers enjoy unusually strong protection from state franchise laws that block auto manufacturers from selling around them, directly to consumers. 
However, more customers are doing at least some shopping online, and dealers stand to lose revenue generated by recall and warranty repairs as more fixes are done with software updates. 
DIFFERENT BETS
Buyers and sellers are making different bets about the future for brick-and-mortar dealerships.
Sellers tend to be family-run businesses faced with making substantial investments in new equipment and technology to sell and service electric vehicles. They are concerned that automakers want to squeeze dealer profit margins to recover the enormous investments they have made in electrification, said George Karolis, president of the Presidio Group LLC, a dealership transaction adviser. 
""They face large investments to keep up with the digitization of the business,"" Karolis said. With profits high and valuations for dealerships strong, smaller owners are deciding now is the right time to exit, he said.
Buyers - especially public chains such as AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN) or Sonic Automotive (NYSE:SAH) Inc - are using cheap capital and cash generated during the pandemic to get bigger, banking on economies of scale to overcome the challenges that drove sellers to the table.
With its size, Lithia can borrow money at lower interest cost and get products and services from vendors at 20% to 30% lower cost than smaller dealers, Chief Executive Bryan DeBoer said.
Lithia also can as much as double an acquired store's used car business by reconditioning and selling vehicles more than five years old, and use its own brand of replacement parts to keep customers from going elsewhere for service, he said. 
Whether the franchise model survives depends on how dealers adapt, said Asbury Automotive Chief Executive David Hult. Asbury launched two of the biggest deals in the current M&A boom, acquiring Park Place Dealerships for $735 million and spending $3.2 billion last year for the Larry H. Miller Group, then the eighth-largest U.S. auto retail group.
Asbury needs larger scale as it invests in online sales technology, develops systems that will allow service customers to track their vehicle through the repair process and considers revamping sales and service facilities, Hult said.
""If you know the world is going to be electric ... you don’t need stores to be as big as they are. Maybe a small showroom ... and smaller service centers"" in more locations, he said. ""You’ll have fewer owners, owning more stores.""
Lithia's DeBoer said he would welcome a move to an ""agency model"" where dealers are paid set amounts for handling a vehicle sale, haggling over price is eliminated and dealers are not expected to stock large numbers of vehicles. 
""A lot of our SG&A costs are negotiation costs,"" he said. ""We could be a lot more productive.""
Auto retail executives say consumers shopping online still want places to see vehicles and get them repaired.
""If you have a footprint in a market, you don’t have a plan of closing"" stores, said AutoNation Executive Vice President Marc Cannon. ""Our plan is to develop them out and maximize them.""

AutoNation on Feb. 23 said it had raised $700 million through a debt sale that could be used for acquisitions, among other purposes. 
""We have an active interest in M&A,"" said AutoNation Chief Executive Mike Manley.

The move seemed inevitable after the European Central Bank (ECB) ordered the closure of the bank's European arm, having warned it faced failure because of a run on deposits sparked by the invasion, which Moscow calls a ""special operation.""
The news came on Wednesday as state-controlled Sberbank reported record annual profits for 2021. 
The bank said it was no longer able to supply liquidity to European subsidiaries following an order from Russia's central bank, which is seeking to preserve foreign currency. But it said capital and assets were sufficient to pay all depositors. 
The move highlights the pressure some Russian businesses are facing from unprecedented steps by the West to isolate Moscow, including sanctions on its central bank and the exclusion of some of its banks from global payments system SWIFT.
Russian central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Wednesday the country's economy faced an extreme situation, and she was doing everything possible to ensure the financial system could cope with any shock.
""In the current situation, Sberbank has decided to leave the European market,"" it said in a statement. ""The group's subsidiary banks have faced abnormal cash outflows and threats to the safety of its employees and branches.""
Sberbank had European assets worth 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) as of Dec. 31, 2020, and operations in countries including Austria, Croatia, Germany and Hungary among others. 
It said European subsidiaries experienced a liquidity crisis after sanctions were imposed, resulting in the bank losing control of those units in the first quarter of the year. 
Sberbank had said in November it planned to finalise the sale of operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia and Slovenia in 2021 in a deal worth around 500 million euros.
Slovenian bank NLB said it was acquiring the Slovenian business.
Sberbank did not give any update on the other potential deals. 
The exit does not affect Sberbank's business in Switzerland, which it said was continuing to operate as usual. 
PROFIT LEAP
Sberbank's net profit for 2021 jumped 64% year on year to 1.25 trillion roubles ($12.38 billion). Return on equity for the year was 24.2% and its net interest income stood at 1.8 trillion roubles.
CEO German Gref, who has been quiet since the crisis unfolded, described the results as ""outstanding,"" but said the focus was now on ""the new challenges that the Russian economy and the financial sector is facing.""
The bank cancelled its investor call to discuss the results. 
The Moscow Exchange has halted trading on stocks and sought to prevent capital outflows from Russian assets, but Sberbank's depositary receipts in London fell more than 90% on Wednesday to 1.7 cents.

Investing.com – Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) stock will be under watch when trading starts Wednesday after the company boosted the long-term targets for rolling out its off-price apparel and home fashion stores.
Sales and profitability are also seen higher this year despite tough comparisons and Omicron hurting operations in early January.
A new two-year program to repurchase up to $1.9 billion of stock through the next financial year could also drive the stock. A 9% higher quarterly dividend of 31 cents per share will also influence the stock.
CEO Barbara Rentler said customers are increasingly focusing on value and convenience, a trend reflected at its stores. Also, given that many stores shut last few years, the company has room to add more outlets, according to Rentler.  
“. . .We now believe that Ross Dress for Less can expand to about 2,900 locations, up from our prior target of 2,400, and that dd’s Discounts can eventually become a chain of approximately 700 stores, versus our previous projection of 600. . .,” she said in a company statement.
The new forecast for store additions will take the total count to 3,600 stores from 1,923 locations as of January 29.
According to Rentler, comparable sales could rise by up to 3% in the year ending January 28, 2023. At worst, they will be flat. Earnings per share are seen between $4.71 and $5.12 compared to $4.87 in 2021.
Total sales for 2021 grew 18% to $19 billion. Sales for the fourth quarter were $5 billion, with comparable store sales up 9% versus the same period in 2019.
Fourth quarter operating margin suffered due to higher freight, wages, and Covid-related costs.

347,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 04:21AM ET</span>",Global banks eschew risk as they navigate Russia sanctions quagmire,"By Michelle Price and Sumeet Chatterjee
WASHINGTON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Faced with an unprecedented level of sanctions on Russia, global banks are taking a dim view of business with all Russian entities and dropping clients if there is even a slight doubt on their ties to that country, said bankers and lawyers.
Over the past week, the United States, Canada, Britain and European allies have imposed a raft of sanctions on Russia in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine, with Australia, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea also introducing restrictions.
The sanctions target multiple wealthy Russian elites, several major Russian banks, state entities and dozens of their subsidiaries, and some Russian banks' access to the international SWIFT messaging service, among other curbs. 
While global banks have extensive experience with sanctions and have invested billions of dollars in compliance programs in recent years, the curbs on Russia are unmatched in their scale, speed and complexity and may yet grow, said executives.
To avoid falling foul of the rules and having assets and capital ensnared by new curbs, banks are adopting extreme caution in all of their dealings with Russian entities, actions that will likely exacerbate global trade disruptions, said bankers and lawyers.
A senior Hong Kong-based Asia trade finance banker with a global lender said his compliance colleagues are asking more questions even if a financing deal involves a non-sanctioned Russian entity, directly or indirectly. 
In India, for example, which has not imposed sanctions on Russia with which it has strong trade ties, the banker said his firm had become ""very, very cautious"" about deals involving Russian firms, fearing Indian institutions getting caught in so-called secondary sanctions.
Another senior banker at a large Asian bank said his firm was looking into whether they have enough compliance staff and technology to run checks on various sanctions imposed on Russia and whether they will be able to flag potentially risky deals. 
""It's not just managing risk from the existing sanctions, but also thinking about what more could possibly happen on that front,"" said the banker. ""No one would like to sign a billion dollar trade finance deal only to be told a week later that the entity in Russia has also been added to the sanction list."" 
Both the bankers and their peers declined to be named due to sensitivity of the matter.
""Banks generally, and certainly the global banks, often tend to be very cautious and conservative with respect to sanctions, especially U.S. sanctions,"" said Charlie Steele, partner at Washington-based consultancy Forensic Risk Alliance and a former U.S. Treasury Department sanctions attorney.
""There will be a high level of de-risking in this situation, given the very high priority that governments – including but not only the U.S. – are putting on these sanctions.""
'SELF-SANCTION'
Banks have already begun to act.
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG have stopped financing commodities trading from Russia, Bloomberg reported on Sunday.
State Bank of India, the country's top lender, will not process any transactions involving Russian entities subject to international sanctions imposed on Russia, Reuters reported on Monday.
And even before Western allies unveiled their most severe sanctions over the weekend, major buyers of Russian oil were struggling to secure letters of credit from Western banks due to the market uncertainty, Reuters reported last week.
""In time, other banks may well 'self-sanction' given the risks involved,"" Simon MacAdam, senior global economist, at Capital Economics wrote in a research note on Tuesday.
The exposure to Russia so far disclosed by Western banks appears to be fairly modest. 
U.S. banks have an exposure of $14.7 billion, and Italian, French and Austrian banks' combined have an exposure of over $42.5 billion.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) said this week its total exposure was nearly $10 billion.
It is the speed at which sanctions could be widened, however, that is the top concern for banks. 
Executives fear Western curbs on Russia may follow those on Iran, which was eventually subject to ""secondary sanctions"" - restrictions on any entity that does U.S. dollar business with the underlying sanctioned entity.
That would dramatically expand the number of restricted entities. And for bankers based in countries that have yet to jump on the sanctions bandwagon, the risk they might pose is another worry. 
Under U.S. sanctions, an entity that is 50% owned or more, directly or indirectly, by one or more blocked persons is itself also considered blocked, whether or not it is on the sanctions list.

And with so many jurisdictions issuing sanctions, some of which differ, compliance teams are having to screen for exposure to sanctioned entities at multiple layers of the group, including the bank holding company, regional subsidiaries, local branches and other corporate vehicles, said bankers and lawyers.
""This multifactor murkiness creates uncertainty in the system which is frankly an impediment to ordinary commerce taking place,"" said Jeff Cottle, partner at law firm Brown Rudnick specializing in compliance and white collar crime.

The war in Ukraine continues to rage Wednesday, with Russian troops now appearing to target Ukrainian cities as they advance on the capital Kyiv.
Russia is aiming to erase Ukraine, its history, and people, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video earlier Wednesday, calling for more international support.
Most of the European equity markets weakened Wednesday, following on from Tuesday’s sharp losses, but the FTSE 100 in the U.K. has outperformed, helped by the number of resource stocks in the index, with commodity prices soaring as the sanctions on Russia disrupt global supplies.
The stocks of oil giants BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa) both rose over 3%, miners Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), BHP Billiton (NYSE:BBL) and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) climbed between 2% and 4%, while commodity trader Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) stock rose 2.9%.
Two Russia-focused miners,  Evraz  (LON:EVRE) and  Polymetal  International PLC (LON:POLYP) are set to be removed from the benchmark index later Wednesday, after sharp selloffs in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. Evraz has slumped 60% since the start of last week, while Polymetal shares have plunged almost 80%. Both miners combined account for less than 0.1% of the total index.
Elsewhere, European banks have been hard hit as they attempt to cope with links to Russia and the impact of the severe sanctions imposed on the country’s lenders.
Russia's largest bank, Sberbank, is leaving the European market, with the lender stating it’s no longer able to supply liquidity to its European subsidiary banks which were facing large cash outflows.
Additionally, Raiffeisen Bank International (VIE:RBIV) stock fell 5.6%, with Reuters reporting the Austrian bank is looking into leaving Russia, while ING (AS:INGA) stock fell 4.8% and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) dropped 2.4%.
 Nokian Renkaat  (HE:TYRES) stock slumped 15% as investors expressed concerns about the tire manufacturer’s exposure to Russia. 
Back in Europe, the German unemployment rate fell to 5.0% in February, from 5.1% the previous month, while the number of unemployed fell by 33,000.
The economic main focus of the day will be on the Eurozone CPI release for February, which is expected to continue to rise, to 5.3% year-on-year, from 5.1% in January.
Oil prices soared to seven-year highs, climbing above $110 a barrel, as traders sought out alternate sources of crude in an already tight market, avoiding Russian supply, following the sanctions on Russian banks.
These gains come despite Tuesday’s announcement of a coordinated release of 60 million barrels of oil by International Energy Agency member countries.
The market will look later Wednesday to the meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, including Russia, together known as OPEC+, for news of future output levels. The group is widely expected to stick to its previously announced plans to add 400,000 barrels per day of supply each month. 
Also due later in the session is the weekly U.S. crude inventory from the Energy Information Administration. This follows the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute reporting late Tuesday that U.S. crude inventories fell by 6.1 million barrels last week, a vivid illustration of the tightness of the overall market.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co said on Wednesday it planned to invest about 95.5 trillion won ($79.21 billion) through 2030, including about 19.4 trillion won ($16.10 billion) towards electric vehicle (EV) related businesses. 
Hyundai Motor, which together with affiliate Kia Corp is among the world's top 10 biggest automakers by sales, targets to achieve a 7% market share in the global EV market by 2030, with an annual sales target of 1.87 million vehicles, the automaker said during a virtual investor day. 
The Seoul-based automaker said it aimed to achieve an operating profit margin of 10% or higher in EV business by 2030.
""Hyundai is successfully accelerating its transition to electrification and becoming a global leader in EVs despite a challenging business environment caused by the global chip shortage and ongoing pandemic,"" Hyundai Motor Chief Executive Officer Jaehoon Chang said. 
Analysts, however said Hyundai's $16 billion investment in EV business would not be considered an ""aggressive"" approach compared to its rivals, adding, the investment is easily dwarfed by bigger rivals including  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, which plans to invest 8 trillion yen ($69.43 billion) for electrification by 2030.
""Hyundai is allocating about 20% of its 95.5 trillion won investment to EV related businesses, which includes building new plants, EV charging stations and strategic alliances with battery manufacturers and the investment amount for EV does not seem too surprising or aggressive,"" said Eugene Investment & Securities analyst Lee Jae-il. 
Chang said Hyundai was considering building new dedicated EV production plants without proving details of new factories, including locations and timeline. 
Analysts said Hyundai would be eying on building dedicated EV factories in the United States, as it considers that as its key EV market. 
Shares in Hyundai Motor closed down 2.6%, compared to the benchmark KOSPI's 0.2% gain.

Initial plans announced last year by the scandal-ridden conglomerate to split into three had been much criticised by foreign hedge fund shareholders - many of which favour a sale to a private equity firm. But a revised plan last month that called for a breakup into two companies and the sale of other businesses also met with internal dissent, according to two sources familiar with the matter. 
There were fears within Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) that its planned sale of units such as its elevator business would leave the company only with low-margin businesses, said the sources who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.
Asked about internal opposition, Toshiba said it firmly believes its announced reorganization plan is the best option for the company but declined to comment further.
For some observers, the departure of Tsunakawa as well as that of Mamoru Hatazawa, a board member who had pushed to split up the company, add to doubts about whether Toshiba will be able to press ahead with the plans to break up.
""The split plan will be reviewed - we think there is a chance it is scrapped,"" said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at investment advisor United First Partners in Singapore.
NEW GUARD
The appointment of Shimada, a former Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) executive who only joined in 2018, represents a significant changing of the guard at Toshiba, helping the company's shares end 2% higher.
Toshiba also said Goro Yanase, the head of Toshiba's elevator business, will be appointed interim chief operating officer.
The board will monitor the performance of the new appointees and the status of business execution and ""where appropriate, the board will continue its deliberations, toward appointing external candidates,"" it said in a statement.
While Tsunakawa had stepped back into the CEO role on an interim basis and had said he did not expect to be in the position long-term, the timing of the announcement was a surprise.
Raymond Zage, head of Toshiba's nomination committee, said the new appointments had been made at this time after some shareholders had voiced concerns that management had not appeared able to proceed with the firm's restructuring plans in a timely manner.

An extraordinary general meeting that will seek initial shareholder approval for the revised breakup plan has been set for March 24. Shareholders will also vote on a major shareholder's proposal that Toshiba explore other options and solicit buyout offers from private equity firms.
The original break-up plan was announced last November after a five-month strategic review following years of accounting scandals and governance issues that undermined investor confidence and saw Toshiba's market value more than halve, to around $18 billion, from an early 2000s peak.

353,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 03:05AM ET</span>",Marketmind: A turning point for markets,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Dhara Ranasinghe.
When the yield on Germany's benchmark Bund, considered one of thea safest assets in the world, posts its biggest one-day fall since 2011 (as it did on Tuesday), something has changed.
The slide in borrowing costs in Germany, with 10-year yields back in negative territory where they remain this morning, echoes similar moves in other major bond markets and is symptomatic of a big shift in investor thinking. 
German Bund yield, absolute change in bps https://tmsnrt.rs/3HEolUS 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine almost a week ago changes the landscape for investors, stick with safety (read sovereign debt, U.S. dollar), stay away from risk assets. 
Perhaps more notable is growing doubt over that overriding theme that central banks would step up their exit from post-pandemic stimulus. This is more complicated since inflation is high but the renewed surge in oil prices will likely slow growth and hurt consumption. 
So yes, the Bank of Canada will likely hike rates later on Wednesday, with the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of England still tipped to follow later in March. But markets increasingly price a more cautious path ahead - especially in the euro area where market pricing took a dramatic turn on Tuesday. 
Money markets now price in just 14 basis points worth of ECB rate hikes by year-end, down from 50 bps last month.
Flash euro zone inflation data due out later in the session therefore will unlikely change this view, even if it does show the headline inflation rate rising to new record highs -- as analysts forecast.
And with Russia bombarding Ukrainian cities and the United States banning Russian flights from its airspace, the mood in world markets remain sombre.
Japan's Nikkei closed almost 1.7% lower, U.S. and European stock futures are in the red, and oil prices have surged to a fresh 7-year higher above $110. A meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and allies, together known as OPEC+, later on could prove interesting.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Wednesday: 
- OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial meeting via video conference.
German employment
- Euro zone flash HICP
- Bank of Canada policy meeting
- Fed speakers: Chicago President Charles Evans
- Fed issues Beige Book of economic conditions

- European earnings: Telekom Italia, Just Eat, Polymetal, Entain,  Aviva  (LON:AV),  Persimmon  (LON:PSN),

LONDON (Reuters) - The corporate world remains far from being aligned with global climate goals, and in some countries has gone backwards since a landmark agreement to cap global warming was signed in 2015, data shows.
Limiting the world's temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average by mid-century was crucial in order to avoid irreversible damage to the planet, U.N. climate scientists warned on Monday. 
The corporate world was not moving fast enough towards this target by reducing their greenhouse gas emissions, warned Arabesque, a corporate sustainability data firm and asset manager, in an annual analysis of the world's main markets.
To reach that target, emissions need to drop by around 45% by 2030; yet, across the globe, they continue to rise.
On average, only about a fifth to a quarter of companies across the markets was on course to hit the global target, Arabesque Chief Executive Daniel Klier said, even as more boards pledge to do so amid growing regulatory and investor pressure to act.
In two markets, Germany's DAX 40 and India's BSE 30, the percentage of companies on course with their emissions reductions toward meeting that 1.5-degree target has actually regressed in the six years since the Paris Agreement was signed, data shared exclusively with Reuters showed.
In 2015, 29% of German companies were aligned with the 2050 climate target, dropping only slightly to 28% in 2021. In India, alignment dropped from 25% to 24%, whilst in Britain, the figure remained the same, at 21%. 
S&P 500 https://tmsnrt.rs/35ipHYc
FTSE 100 https://tmsnrt.rs/3MoLSNp
DAX 40 https://tmsnrt.rs/3HvIdcU
BSE 30 https://tmsnrt.rs/3vrZt02
Nikkei 225 https://tmsnrt.rs/3K67AUh
SSE (LON:SSE) 50 https://tmsnrt.rs/3hvvjkm 
There were signs of progress in the United States, where alignment in companies on the benchmark S&P 500 index rose to 22% from 14%. Japan's Nikkei rose to 30% from 24%; and China's SSE 50 edged higher to 4% from 0%.
""Broadly across the world, there's not a lot of progress,"" said Klier. ""If we want to maintain a world that is liveable, we need to deliver a 1.5 degree pathway. At the moment there are only really 20-25% of companies that fulfil the criteria.""
""It's increasingly important that capital shifts to those companies which are really delivering, versus companies that have the right ambition but which don't show the right progress.""
Despite the sobering performance of the world's biggest listed companies - responsible for the lion's share of global emissions - there were signs of improvement in corporate disclosures.
In 2021 in China, for example, 44% of companies did not disclose any climate impact to investors, down considerably from 95% in 2015.

The figures for the analysis were created by scientifically modelling corporate climate data collated in the 'ESG Book', a digital source of sustainability data backed by some of the world's top investors, regulators and companies, including HSBC and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
Companies that did not disclose their climate impact were scored as contributing a default 3-degrees-Celsius temperature rise.

357,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 02:11AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Lower; Mood Hit by Oil Surge as Ukraine Conflict Deepens,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open lower on Wednesday, continuing the previous session’s sharp losses with sentiment remaining fragile as the conflict in Ukraine intensifies.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.5% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%.
European equity markets slumped on Tuesday, with the DAX and the CAC 40 both dropping nearly 4%, as ceasefire talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials ended without success while Russian troops bombed a TV tower in Ukraine's capital Kyiv and rained rockets on Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city.
Investors could use that sharp selloff to try and pick up bargains Wednesday, but further losses still look likely with a miles-long Russian military convoy north of Kyiv preparing to advance on the capital.
Still, the impact of the severe sanctions imposed on Russian banks by the Western powers was illustrated by Wednesday’s news that Russia's largest lender, Sberbank, is leaving the European market. The lender said it was no longer able to supply liquidity to its European subsidiary banks which were facing large cash outflows.
Ukraine raised 8.1 billion hryvnia ($277 million) in a sale of war bonds, raising funds to support its fight against Russia’s invasion.
In his annual State of the Union speech late Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden said Russia's Vladimir Putin will pay dearly over the long run for his invasion of Ukraine, even if his military campaign succeeds in the short term.
Back in Europe, German unemployment figures for February are due later in the session, but the main focus will be on the Eurozone CPI release for February. This is expected to continue to rise, to 5.3% year-on-year, from 5.1% in January.
Oil prices soared to seven-year highs, climbing above $110 a barrel, as traders sought out alternate sources of crude in an already tight market, avoiding Russian supply following the sanctions on Russian banks.
These gains come despite Tuesday’s announcement of a coordinated release of 60 million barrels of oil by International Energy Agency member countries.
The market will look later Wednesday to the meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, including Russia, together known as OPEC+, for news of future output levels. The group is widely expected to stick to its previously announced plans to add 400,000 barrels per day of supply each month. 
Also due later in the session is the weekly U.S. crude inventory from the Energy Information Administration. This follows the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute reporting late Tuesday that U.S. crude inventories fell by 6.1 million barrels last week, a vivid illustration of the tightness of the overall market.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 5.8% higher at $109.36 a barrel, after earlier hitting the highest since September 2013, while the Brent contract rose 5.8% to $111.02, trading above $110 for the first time since July 2014.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,942.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1101.

(Reuters) - Asian equities suffered a second successive month of outflows in February as investors jettisoned riskier assets due to rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine and on fears of aggressive monetary tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve this year.
    According to Refinitiv data, cross-border investors sold Asian equities worth a net $6.9 billion in South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and India in the last month, after disposing $8.4 billion in January.
 
Title: Monthly foreign investment flows: Asian equities, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/znpnenkyevl/Monthly%20foreign%20investment%20flows%20Asian%20equities.jpg
 
""The theme driving sentiments in February largely revolve around geopolitical tensions, where it adds greater risks for inflationary pressures and global growth outlook,"" said Jun Rong Yeap, market strategist at IG.
Taiwanese equities led the outflows with net sales of $5.8 billion, the biggest since March 2020.
""In light of the jitters around geopolitical tensions, Taiwan may find itself on high alert, too, considering its sensitive relationship with China."" IG's Yeap added.
Indian equities faced its fifth consecutive outflow in February, as foreigners dumped $4.74 billion worth of the country's stocks last month. Analysts said rising crude oil prices remain a big threat to the country's economic recovery, as India is one of the biggest oil importers in the world.
Vietnamese equities also posted some meagre foreign outflows last month.
Meanwhile, Thai, and Indonesian equities attracted $1.88 billion and $1.22 billion, respectively in foreign money. South Korea and Philippines also saw cross-border purchases last month.
""In the near future, geopolitical risks remain on top of investors mind, which may strengthen the dollar and weigh on EM assets,"" said Margaret Yang, a strategist at DailyFX.
""Yet, investors may also take this opportunity to buy the dips as Asia-Pacific markets are largely insulated from the Ukraine war.""
Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist at investment manager Natixis, said outflows are going to continue from all Asian markets as the dollar is now king.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -U.S. electric vehicle startup Rivian Automotive Inc said on Tuesday it has increased selling prices of its vehicles by about 20% due to inflationary pressures and higher component costs, angering some customers.
The price increase also invited caustic comments from Elon Musk, chief executive of rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, who tweeted that Rivian's ""negative gross margin will be staggering"" and it is ""near impossible"" for other firms to make affordable electric pickup trucks. 
Rivian, in which Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) holds a 20% stake, said the starting price of its R1T electric pickup trucks has gone up by about 17% and its R1S sport utility vehicles by about 20%. It said the price increases would affect most of the customers who have already placed pre-orders for the vehicles. 
""Well, it's a sad day for me. Cancelled the Rivian order. So bummed out,"" ""Zach Jump-Start Marino"", who said he lives in Georgia and holds Rivian shares, said on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posting. 
""Price increase was astronomical and unfair to pre-order holders and early supporters. I'm not paying 94k+ for a ""mid-size"" truck,"" he said, adding he could buy gasoline pickup trucks such as Ford Motor (NYSE:F)'s F-150 at much lower prices. 
He told Reuters his R1T price has gone up by $15,000, including options.
Tesla Inc and legacy car makers have also raised U.S. vehicle prices to offset high costs related to logistics and supply chain disruption, and dealers often mark-up prices because of vehicle shortages.
“Like most manufacturers, Rivian is being confronted with inflationary pressure, increasing component costs, and unprecedented supply chain shortages and delays for parts (including semiconductor chips),"" Jiten Behl, Rivian's chief growth officer, said in a statement. 
The California-based startup fell short of its production target last year due to supply-chain constraints. 
Rivian said the cost of certain options including paint and wheels and upgrades like reinforced underbody shield have also increased. 
The base price of the Rivian R1T is rising to approximately $79,500 from $67,500, while the R1S is starting at $84,500, up from $70,000. 
AFFORDABILITY
Rivian said it will introduce an R1T model with a lower-range battery pack and dual motors in 2024, pricing it at the original $67,500. 
Rivian's former head of sales and marketing, Laura Schwab, said in a lawsuit against the company in November over alleged ""gender discrimination and retaliation"" that Rivian has acknowledged a need to raise the vehicle prices ""after the IPO"". 
""The vehicles were underpriced, and each sale would result in a loss for the company,"" she said in the lawsuit. Rivian, which went public in November, declined to comment on the lawsuit. 
Musk, who tweeted his comments late on Tuesday in response to a story on Rivian's price increase, was asked about the pricing of Tesla's upcoming electric pickup truck, the Cybertruck.

""Our primary challenge is affordability. Creating an expensive truck is relatively easy. If it is extremely hard to do so for Tesla, despite our much greater economies of scale & better technology, then it is damn near impossible for others,"" he said.
Musk said in January that Tesla is delaying the launch of the Cybertruck to next year, prioritizing production of its existing models due to parts constraints.

The move, which comes amid efforts by Haidilao to slash store numbers, has seen Yang Lijuan, 43, formerly deputy CEO and chief operating officer, take the helm as of March 1.
Li Yu, 36, was named COO of its mainland China operations while Wang Jinping, 38, was appointed COO of its operations in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and overseas.
Citi analysts said in a research note the appointments underlined the company's commitment to overhauling management ""via bringing forward its senior management transition to accommodate its aggressive store restructuring plan.""
Haidilao expanded store numbers aggressively in early 2020 but has since seen declines in table turnover rates and earnings. In November, it announced it would close 300 stores.
The company warned last week it expects to report a 2021 net loss of 3.8 billion yuan to 4.5 billion yuan ($600 million to $710 million), most of which is due to one-off losses from the closure of restaurants.
Zhang, 52, who was born in China's Sichuan province but is now a Singapore citizen, will retain the title of chairman.

362,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 10:47PM ET</span>",Tokyo court to rule whether deputy helped former Nissan chief Ghosn hide $80 million,"By Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese court will on Thursday deliver its verdict on former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor director Greg Kelly who is accused of helping the automaker's ousted chairman, Carlos Ghosn, hide $80 million of income from financial regulators.
The judgement, which comes after an 18-month trial and more than three years since Kelly's arrest alongside Ghosn, may be the closest a Japanese court gets to ruling on the culpability of Nissan's ex-chairman in alleged financial crimes. 
Kelly has taken centre stage in the Tokyo District Court because Ghosn is beyond the reach of Japanese prosecutors after fleeing to Lebanon in 2019 hidden in a box on a private jet.
Kelly has sat through months of testimony from ex-Nissan colleagues including former CEO Hiroto Saikawa, and senior legal affairs executive Hari Nada, with prosecutors submitting emails and stacks of documents they say show Kelly illegally devised ways to defer payments to his boss.
The charges spring from a financial regulation change in 2010 that required executives earning more than 1 billion yen ($8.71 million) to disclose their pay.
Kelly has denied breaking the law and testified that his only intent was to give Ghosn, who was also the chief executive at  Renault  (PA:RENA), a compensation package that would dissuade him from defecting to a rival automaker.
Both Kelly and Ghosn also allege they are victims of a boardroom coup by former colleagues worried that Ghosn wanted to merge Nissan with alliance partner and largest shareholder Renault SA (OTC:RNLSY).
The Nissan company, which was charged alongside Kelly and Ghosn, pleaded guilty at the start of the trial to allowing Ghosn to hide earnings from Japanese authorities. It is awaiting a court ruling. Prosecutors are seeking a 200 million yen ($1.74 million) fine for the carmaker.
WATCHING
Released on Christmas day in 2018 after a month in jail, Kelly has had to remain in Japan under conditions set in his $600,000 bail. He wife Dee joined him and has attended most court sessions 
The case has captivated a country astonished by Ghosn's transformation from feted auto executive to international fugitive. It is also being watched closely by the new U.S. ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, amid concern about the American's treatment by a justice system that some western observers view as overly harsh.
Suspects in Japan are not allowed to have a lawyer present during interrogations and can be detained for up to three weeks without charge. And 99% of cases that go to trial end with a conviction. 
""Mr Kelly is a citizen of the United States and this comes with an obligation as ambassador of the United States to advocate on his behalf,"" Emanuel said during a press briefing in Tokyo last week. 
The former mayor of Chicago and one-time chief of staff to U.S. President Barack Obama said he had called Kelly and his wife soon after arriving in Japan in January. 
Prosecutors have asked the three judges to convict Kelly and send him to jail for two years. That would make him the third American connected to Ghosn to be locked up. 
A Japanese court in July sentenced U.S. Army Special Forces veteran Michael Taylor to two years in prison and his son Peter to one year and eight months for their part in helping him escape Japan. 
For now the once globe-trotting Ghosn is stuck in Lebanon, unable to travel overseas without risking arrest and a return to Japan. 

In addition to the charge of hiding $80 million of earnings over eight years, Ghosn is also accused of enriching himself at his employer's expense through $5 million of payments to a Middle East car dealership, and for temporarily transferring personal investment losses to his former employer's books. 
Ghosn has denied all the accusations against him.

363,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 10:27PM ET</span>","BofA, Goldman Stick to Fed Forecasts Even as Traders Trim Bets","(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s biggest banks are sticking by their calls for as many as seven Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes this year even as traders and some of their peers ratchet back expectations.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). still predict the U.S. central bank will raise its benchmark to 2% by year-end from the current range of zero to 0.25%, while JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) sees the rate reaching 2% in early 2023. Their main argument: surging inflation will compel the Fed to act.
Sure the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions weighing on the country may curb global growth, but they will also fuel further consumer-prices gains by pushing up raw material prices even more.
“The underlying rationale for normalization hasn’t yet changed,” said Praveen Korapathy, a strategist at Goldman Sachs in New York. “If all we get is a small hit to growth and still elevated inflation, it makes the Fed’s trade-off worse, but I don’t think it would get them to sit on their hands.”
Rates traders see things differently. They have slashed the odds of Fed tightening in recent days as the sanctions on Russia have weighed on the global-growth outlook. Money markets have pared pricing for a rate hike in March to a quarter point from a half-point prior to the invasion, and they now predict the central bank’s key rate will peak at 1.7%, well below the Fed’s long-term estimate of 2.5%.
TD Securities Inc. is among those revising its view. The company now sees a smaller Fed hike this month than it earlier envisaged, and it’s shifting some of its anticipated rate increases to next year. 
Lowering Bets
The latest rally in Treasuries, which saw five-year yields slide by 27 basis points over the past two days, has upended some hefty bearish bets from rates to credit markets. NatWest Markets Plc said Wednesday it was stopped out of “core strategic investment stances,” and exited money-market positions that were betting on a steeper path of hikes.
“Given the Fed’s twin-mandate of goals of maximum employment and price stability -- most market participants have lowered their expectations of the cumulative number of interest rate hikes -- not just for year 2022, but beyond,” John Herrmann and Jan Nevruzi wrote in a research note published Tuesday.

(Reuters) -American big brands including Apple, Google, Ford and Harley-Davidson on Tuesday stopped sales and distanced themselves from Russia because of the invasion of Ukraine, joining a growing list of companies from shippers to car makers to energy companies shunning the country. 
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said it had stopped sales of iPhones and other products in Russia, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google dropped Russian state publishers from its news, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) told its Russian manufacturing partner it was suspending operations in the country, and Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) suspended its business and shipments of its bikes.
Early in the day, the world's biggest shipping lines, MSC and Maersk, suspended container shipping to and from Russia, deepening the country's isolation.
The West has imposed heavy restrictions on Russia to close off its economy from the global financial system, pushing companies to halt sales, cut ties and dump tens of billions of dollars' worth of investments.
""We are deeply concerned about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and stand with all of the people who are suffering as a result of the violence,"" Apple said in a statement announcing a pause in sales in Russia and other measures including limiting Apple Pay and dropping the ability to download RT News outside of Russia.
The steady drum beat of companies taking a stance increased later in the day as rockets struck major cities in Ukraine.
""Ford is deeply concerned about the invasion of Ukraine and the resultant threats to peace and stability. The situation has compelled us to reassess our operations in Russia,"" Ford said, adding to several days of announcements by global car companies.
 Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) has made merchandise purchases on its website and app unavailable in Russia as it cannot guarantee delivery of goods to customers in the country, an update on the sportswear maker's website showed on Tuesday.
The MSC and Maersk moves mean that Russia - the world's eleventh-largest economy and supplier of one-sixth of all commodities - is now effectively cut off from a large chunk of the globe's shipping capacity.
To stem the stampede, Moscow said on Tuesday it would temporarily curb foreign investors from selling Russian assets but energy firms BP (NYSE:BP) Plc and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc have already decided to abandon their Russian businesses, while leading banks, airlines, automakers and more have cut shipments and ended partnerships.
Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) is looking in to leaving Russia, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, a move that would make it the first European bank to do so since the invasion.
Mining and commodities group Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) Plc said it is reviewing all business activities in Russia, including equity stakes in EN+ and Rosneft.
""The corporate world is building up a fortress to isolate Russia from the international community,""  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) senior investment and markets analyst Susannah Streeter said.

Paramount Pictures became the latest Hollywood studio to halt theatrical film distribution in Russia, announcing on Tuesday that it would pause the release of upcoming films ""The Lost City"" and ""Sonic the Hedgehog 2.""
FINANCIAL PARIAH
In a matter of weeks, Russia has turned from a lucrative bet on surging oil prices to a financial pariah with a central bank hamstrung by sanctions, major banks shut out of the international payments system and capital controls choking off money flows.
U.S. payment card firms  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) have blocked multiple Russian financial institutions from their network. 
Major auto and truck makers, including Volvo Cars, AB Volvo, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Harley-Davidson and Jaguar Land Rover, have also cut off exports to Russia. BMW said it was discontinuing local production and car exports to Russia.
Finnish telecoms equipment firm Nokia (NYSE:NOK) joined rival Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) in saying it will stop deliveries to Russia to comply with sanctions.
The Swiss-based company that built the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany is considering filing for insolvency, two sources familiar with the situation said, as it attempts to settle claims ahead of a U.S. sanction deadline.
The company, Nord Stream 2 AG, did not comment on possible insolvency.
The United States has restricted exports of tech hardware, including computers, sensors, lasers, navigation tools, telecoms, aerospace and marine equipment, prompting many tech companies, such as Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) Inc, to suspend Russia sales. 
The big U.S. tech companies are juggling calls to shut services in Russia with what they see as a mission to give voice to dissent and protest. 
'CLEAR AND UNEQUIVOCAL'
Some U.S. state-linked investors have been vocal in setting expectations for corporations, with Connecticut Treasurer Shawn Wooden saying he would direct state pension funds to sell Russian assets. 
""We need to send a very clear and unequivocal response that California will not stand for Russia's aggression,"" California Treasurer Fiona Ma said on Monday, declaring support for divesting Russian assets from the state's pension funds.

"
366,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 09:44PM ET</span>","U.S. follows Canada, Europe on Russian aircraft ban","By David Shepardson, Jamie Freed and Foo Yun Chee
(Reuters) -The United States will follow the European Union and Canada in banning Russian flights from its airspace, President Joe Biden said on Tuesday evening, in a move likely to trigger Russian retaliation.
United Airlines and  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) said on Tuesday they had suspended flying over Russian airspace, joining other major U.S. carriers Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL).
""I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American airspace to all Russian flights, further isolating Russia and adding an additional squeeze on their economy,"" Biden said in his State of the Union address.
The White House had held extensive talks with U.S. airlines about the issue in recent days. 
The ban will take effect by the end of Wednesday.
Russian flights were already effectively barred from U.S. destinations for the most part in recent days because of bans on the use of Canadian and European airspace. 
Some foreign governments had privately questioned why the United States did not move faster to ban Russian planes, as had some U.S. lawmakers.
The European Union had said on Tuesday that it was speaking to U.S. counterparts about extending the ban as it gave more details of the EU's closure of airspace to Russian aircraft imposed after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Airlines already face potentially lengthy blockages of key east-west flight corridors after the EU and Moscow issued tit-for-tat airspace bans. 
A senior EU official said Russian oligarchs, even those with dual nationalities, would not be able to get around the EU airspace ban.
""It doesn't matter whether they are EU residents, if they are Russian nationals, they will be covered,"" the official said.
""Russian nationals or a Russian company cannot charter, own or control a plane that will be flying into the EU, out of the EU or overflying the EU. So that's the rule.""
SUPPLY-CHAIN PAIN
Global supply chains, already hit hard by the pandemic, will face increasing disruption and cost pressure from the closure of the skies which will affect over a fifth of air freight.
Hardest hit are likely to be Russian carriers, which make up approximately 70% of the flights between Russia and the EU.
Transport between Europe and North Asian destinations like Japan, South Korea and China is in the front line of disruption after reciprocal bans barred European carriers from flying over Siberia and prevented Russian airlines from flying to Europe.
Airlines responsible for moving around 20% of the world's air cargo are affected by those bans, Frederic Horst, managing director of Cargo Facts Consulting, told Reuters on Tuesday.
Germany's Lufthansa, Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY), Finnair and Virgin Atlantic have already cancelled North Asian cargo flights over closed access to airspace.
Scandinavian airline SAS said it would re-route its once-weekly Copenhagen-Shanghai service to avoid Russian airspace, and had also paused its Copenhagen-Tokyo service.
Major Asian carriers like Korean Air Lines and Japan's ANA Holdings are still using Russian airspace, however, as are Middle Eastern airlines.
RUSSIAN CARRIERS
Russian airlines are also feeling the pinch with airline Pobeda, state airline Aeroflot's low-cost carrier, facing requests from a number of leasing companies to return their planes, the Interfax news agency reported.
Pure cargo carriers like Russia's AirBridgeCargo Airlines and Luxembourg's Cargolux are subject to the bans in a move that could send air freight rates - already elevated due to a lack of passenger capacity during the pandemic - soaring further.
""The flights become more expensive due to the longer routes,"" said Stefan Maichl, analyst at Germany's Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg.""
In December, air cargo rates were 150% above 2019 levels, according to the International Air Transport Association.
Sanctions imposed on Russia in the wake of its Ukraine invasion are expected to further disrupt global supply chains.
Russia's AirBridgeCargo alone moves just under 4% of global international air cargo, with most of that between Europe and Asia, Horst said.
""All up you could be looking at perhaps a quarter of air cargo between Asia and Europe needing to find alternate means of transportation,"" Horst said. 
""Yields are high enough that flying a longer route via Southeast Asia, South Asia or the Middle East is an option, but it will still pull capacity out of the market.""
AIR CARGO SURGE
Shipping container shortages and port bottlenecks mean more products are being flown by air. Demand for air cargo last year was 6.9% above 2019 levels, according to IATA. 
Taiwan's EVA Airways said on Tuesday its cargo flights to and from Europe were operating normally and it would consider adding more services to meet market demand. 

Asia-North America cargo routes are expected to be less affected than European routes, analysts say, because many carriers already use Anchorage, Alaska, as a cargo hub and stopover point.
UPS and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) had earlier stopped deliveries to Russia. Deutsche Post (OTC:DPSGY) said its DHL unit was halting inbound shipments to Russia.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. government on Tuesday announced a ban on Russian flights from American airspace following similar moves by the European Union and Canada after Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine.
""I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American airspace to all Russian flights, further isolating Russia and adding an additional squeeze on their economy,"" Biden said in his State of the Union address.
The U.S. Transportation Department Federal Aviation Administration orders will take effect by the end of the day Wednesday and will suspend operations of all aircraft owned, certified, operated, registered, chartered, leased, or controlled by, for, or for the benefit of, a person who is a Russian citizen.
This includes passenger and cargo flights, and scheduled as well as charter flights ""effectively closing U.S. air space to all Russian commercial air carriers and other Russian civil aircraft,"" the Transportation Department said.
Late on Tuesday, United Airlines said it had temporarily suspended flying over Russian airspace, joining other major U.S. carriers who have taken the step after Russian troops last week poured into Ukraine.
United had been continuing to fly over Russian airspace to operate some flights to and from India in recent days. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) all confirmed this week they had halted flights over Russia.
FedEx (NYSE:FDX) on Tuesday did not respond to emails asking if it has stopped flying over Russia.
United is canceling two flights to India for Tuesday and Wednesday as it evaluates how it could continue to operate via a different route that does not use Russian airspace.
White House officials had privately asked if the move would harm U.S. supply chains or have other negative impacts, sources told Reuters.

Russian flights have been effectively barred from U.S. destinations for the most part in recent days because of bans on the use of Canadian and European airspace. Some foreign governments have privately questioned why the United States did not move faster to ban Russian planes as have some U.S. lawmakers.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has asserted Ukraine committed ""genocide"" in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, without presenting evidence, and said the invasion, called a ""special operation"" by Russian officials, was therefore justified to end it.

368,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 09:16PM ET</span>",Exclusive - U.S. utilities push White House not to sanction Russian uranium,"By Ernest Scheyder and Trevor Hunnicutt
(Reuters) - The U.S. nuclear power industry is lobbying the White House to allow uranium imports from Russia to continue despite the escalating conflict in Ukraine, with cheap supplies of the fuel seen as key to keeping American electricity prices low, according to two sources familiar with the matter. 
The United States relies on Russia and its allies Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan for roughly half of the uranium powering its nuclear plants - about 22.8 million pounds (10.3 million kg) in 2020 - which in turn produce about 20% of U.S. electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the World Nuclear Association. 
Washington and its allies have imposed a series of sanctions on Moscow in the past week as Russian forces pushed deeper into neighboring Ukraine, though the sanctions exempt uranium sales and related financial transactions. 
The National Energy Institute (NEI), a trade group of U.S. nuclear power generation companies including  Duke Energy  Corp (NYSE:DUK) and  Exelon Corp  (NASDAQ:EXC), is lobbying the White House to keep the exemption on uranium imports from Russia, the sources said.
The NEI lobbying aims to ensure that uranium is not caught up in any future energy-related sanctions, especially as calls intensify to sanction Russian crude oil sales, the sources said. 
""The (U.S. nuclear power) industry is just addicted to cheap Russian uranium,"" said one of the sources, who declined to be named, citing the sensitivity of the situation.
Duke and Exelon, two of the largest U.S. utilities, could not immediately be reached for comment.
Washington-based NEI said that it supports a diversity of uranium supply, including the development of U.S. facilities to produce and process the fuel.
""While Russia is a significant global supplier of commercial nuclear fuel, U.S. utilities contract with a worldwide network of companies and countries for their fuel requirements to mitigate the risks of potential disruption,"" said Nima Ashkeboussi, NEI's senior director of fuel and radiation safety.
The Biden administration has said it is working to keep American energy costs low.
""We are listening to all inquiries from industry and will continue to do so as we take measures to hold Russia accountable,"" a White House official said when asked about the uranium lobbying. 
Uranium is used as a fuel inside reactors to achieve nuclear fission to boil water and generate steam that spins turbines to generate electricity. 
There is no uranium production or processing in the United States currently, though several companies have said they would like to resume domestic production if they can sign long-term supply contracts with nuclear power producers. Texas and Wyoming have large uranium reserves.
Australia and Canada also have large reserves of uranium and there is ample processing capability there and in Europe. But Russia and its satellites are the cheapest producers.
The U.S. nuclear power industry's use of Russian uranium is likely to spark further questions about where and how the United States procures the materials needed to supply high-tech and renewable-energy products, a dependency that President Joe Biden singled out last week as a national security threat. 
Russia's uranium production is controlled by Rosatom, a state-run company formed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2007. The company is an important source of revenue for the country.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump in 2020 proposed spending $150 million to create a strategic uranium reserve, and Biden administration officials have expressed support for the idea. 
Other utilities around the globe have already begun looking beyond Russia for supply. Swedish power company Vattenfall AB said last week it would stop buying Russian uranium for its nuclear reactors until further notice, citing the Ukrainian conflict.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investment firm Starboard Value LP is arguing that  Huntsman  (NYSE:HUN) Corp investors should elect its director candidates to the board to ensure the chemical maker delivers on promises to shareholders.
Starboard, which owns an 8.6% stake in Huntsman, launched a proxy contest in January when it nominated four people to the company's board. 
This week the hedge fund and the company presented their arguments to proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services which will make a recommendation to shareholders before the vote on March 25.
Starboard says the company has repeatedly failed to deliver on its promises to shareholders and that Huntsman will disappoint shareholders again unless the four new directors help bring independence and accountability to the board. 
The company said the hedge fund has ""ignored our record results in 2021 and stronger outlook for 2022 which are reflected in our all-time high share price. These results speak for themselves and confirm that this refreshed board is holding management accountable for the company’s performance.""
Huntsman last year promised to improve margins, return $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases, not to spend more than $500 million on a single acquisition and to run a sales process for the non-core Textile Effects unit.
Starboard believes the company can improve its margin by 600 basis points. While Starboard largely supports Huntsman's initiatives, the hedge fund worries some board incumbents won't press management to meet these goals. 
Citing governance concerns, the hedge fund wants to replace Cynthia Egan, the lead independent director, and Jose Munoz, who joined the board this year in a Huntsman revamp.
The fund is also targeting Mary Beckerle and Daniele Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), two directors Starboard says are conflicted. It wants to replace them with chemical industry veterans including former  LyondellBasell Industries  (NYSE:LYB) CEO James Gallogly and Starboard's managing member, Jeffrey Smith.
Starboard also noted in its presentation that Huntsman has not made disclosures recommended by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures even though investors requested them two years ago.

(Reuters) -Ford Motor Co on Wednesday will announce a reorganization under which its electric vehicle (EV) and internal-combustion engine (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) units will be run as separate businesses in a move to fast track growth in EVs, three people familiar with the plan said.
The EV and ICE businesses will have separate names but will remain under the Ford corporate umbrella, in the same way the company operates its Ford Pro commercial business for corporate customers, said the people, who asked not to be identified.
The U.S. automaker will name executives to lead each business and Ford will also outline updated profit margin targets for the company overall, the sources said. The idea is for Ford to eventually report separate financial results for the EV and ICE businesses, one of the sources said.
Ford spokesman T.R. Reid declined to comment on the report. ""We're focused on carrying out our Ford+ plan to transform the company and thrive in this new era of electric and connected vehicles,"" he said.
In response to reports Ford was weighing a full spinoff of its EV business, Chief Executive Jim Farley last week said the company had no plans to spin off either its EV or ICE businesses.
""We know our competition is Nio (NYSE:NIO) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and we have to beat them, not match them,"" he said last Wednesday at a Wolfe Research conference. ""And we also have to beat the best of the ICE players.""
However, by separating the EV business into a separate unit, Ford would be setting the table for a possible spinoff down the road, industry officials said.
The growing preference among investment managers for companies focused on low-carbon technology has helped Tesla Inc become the world's highest-valued automaker, and led some investors and analysts to urge other carmakers to consider separating their combustion engine and electric businesses as a way to better tap into their full values.
Companies such as General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) have resisted those calls, arguing that ICE profits will fund the transition to EVs.
Ford's expected move echoes one outlined earlier this month by French automaker  Renault  (PA:RENA), which said it was looking at creating separate divisions for its EV and ICE businesses. It said the EV business could be focused on France, while the ICE operations could be focused outside France.
Farley also said last week that Ford's EV and ICE businesses were underperforming on an earnings basis, adding that costs could still be cut from the ICE business.
""We have too many people, we have too much investment, we have too much complexity and we don't have expertise in transitioning our assets,"" he said of the ICE business. ""That's the simple answer. There's waste.""

He also said Ford needed to add more people to improve profit margins for its EV busines, including in such areas as electrical components, advanced electrical architectures and the digital customer experience.
Candidates to run the businesses could include Ford's chief advanced technology officer Doug Field, who was hired from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL); Hau Thai-Tang, chief product platform and operations officer; Lisa Drake, chief operating officer of North America; and Kumar Galhotra, president of the Americas and International Markets, industry officials said.

(Reuters) -AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc beat estimates for fourth-quarter revenue on Tuesday as box-office hits such as ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" brought people back to the movies.
Long-awaited releases including the James Bond film ""No Time To Die"" and Marvel's ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" also helped the theater chain recover from pandemic restrictions that had brought movie-going to a standstill.
Pressures from inflation, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions as well as the crisis in Europe after Russia invaded Ukraine could pose challenges for the company, Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron said on a post-earnings call.
Earlier this year, worries over the Omicron variant pushed producers to postpone movie releases.
""The box office pacing and our results in 2022 are expected to be heavily weighted towards the second half of the year,"" Aron said.
AMC, which saw a footfall of nearly 60 million during the quarter, said bookings are very strong for ""The Batman"" film opening this weekend. It also expects to benefit from releases like ""Top Gun: Maverick"" and ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" later this year.
AMC's CEO stressed on initiatives like variable pricing of tickets in the United States, focus on NFTs or non-fungible tokens, potentially issuing its own cryptocurrency and selling its own branded popcorn to grow business in a post-COVID environment.
Currently, AMC is charging patrons higher for ""The Batman"" movie than other films at its U.S. locations, something it has been doing for years in Europe.
""In 2022, 2023 and beyond, we also expect to transform our company into becoming something much greater than solely a movie theater operator,"" Aron added.

The company's revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 31 was $1.17 billion, above expectations of $1.10 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net loss narrowed to $134.4 million, or 26 cents per share, from $946.1 million, or $6.21 per share, a year earlier.

LONDON (Reuters) -Russia said on Tuesday it was placing temporary restrictions on foreigners seeking to exit Russia assets, as it tried to stem an investor retreat driven by crippling Western sanctions imposed over the invasion of Ukraine. 
Russian assets went into freefall on Tuesday with London-listed ishares MSCI Russia ETF plunging 33% to hit a fresh record low and Russia's biggest lender, Sberbank falling to 21 cents on the dollar from just under $9 before the invasion.
Major money managers, including hedge fund Man Group and British asset manager abrdn, have been cutting their positions in Russia even as the rouble slumped to a record low and trading froze on its bonds.
Top asset manager BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) said on Tuesday it was consulting with regulators, index providers and other market participants ""to help ensure our clients can exit their positions in Russian securities"" where allowed.
""There is certainly a willingness from asset managers and benchmark providers to get rid of Russia exposure in their portfolios and indexes,"" said Kaspar Hense, a senior portfolio manager at Bluebay Asset Management in London.
""The big question is where do buyers turn up?"" 
Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) is also looking into leaving Russia, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, a move that would make it the first European bank to do so since the invasion of Ukraine - which Moscow calls a ""special operation."" RBI said it had no plans to leave Russia.
Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin announced the country will temporarily stop foreign investors from selling Russian assets to ensure they take a considered decision, but did not give details.
Moscow's move to impose capital controls means that billions of dollars worth of securities held by foreigners in Russia are at risk of being trapped.
“It has been a hell of a rollercoaster,” said a London-based hedge fund manager invested in European financial firms who declined to be named, adding the fund had cut some indirect exposure to Russia.
British asset manager Liontrust has suspended dealing in its Russia fund, while the prices of some of the most popular Russia-focused exchange traded funds were trading at a discount to their net asset values.
Ratings agency Fitch has identified 11 Russia-focused funds which have been suspended, with total assets under management of 4.4 billion euros ($4.9 billion) at end-January, a spokesperson said by email.
U.S.-listed exchange traded funds tracking Russian stocks have come under intense selling pressure in recent days, with the Vaneck Russia ETF sliding 24% on Tuesday. 
One fund, Direxion's Russia 2x ETF, drew a rush of options trading after its issuer said it would cease trading on March 11 due to heightened volatility and restrictions on Russian securities. 
WILL NOT INVEST
In a matter of weeks, Russia has turned from a lucrative bet on surging oil prices to an uninvestable market with a central bank hamstrung by sanctions, major banks shut out of global payments system SWIFT and capital controls choking off money flows. 
SWIFT said on Tuesday it was waiting to see which banks authorities want disconnected from its financial messaging system as sanctions are rolled out.
 Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) have blocked multiple Russian financial institutions from their networks and Germany's market regulator BaFin said it was closely monitoring the European arm of Russia's VTB Bank, which was no longer accepting new clients.
Shares in some European banks remained under pressure after heavy declines on Monday because of lenders' exposure to Russia and the European banking sector was down 3% on Tuesday. 
Asset manager abrdn has around two billion pounds of client money invested in Russia and Belarus and has been cutting its positions, Chief Executive Stephen Bird said.
""We will not invest in Russia and Belarus for the foreseeable future,"" Bird said.
Man Group cut its investments in Russia in recent weeks and now has negligible exposure to Russia and Ukraine across its portfolio, its Chief Financial Officer Antoine Forterre told Reuters on Tuesday. 
Shares of Raiffeisen were down 11.3% in early afternoon, after sliding 14% on Monday. Shares of Italy's UniCredit fell 2.5%, after Monday's 9.5% fall.
The European Central Bank has put banks with close ties to Russia, such as Raiffeisen and the European arm of VTB, under close observation, two sources told Reuters.
NO QUICK RESOLUTION
Tuesday's share price swings and investor comments came as Russia faced increasing isolation over its actions in Ukraine, with resistance on the ground denying President Vladimir Putin decisive early gains.
In recent days, the United States, Britain, Europe, Canada and other countries have announced a raft of new sanctions.
The London Stock Exchange said on Tuesday it would stop trading in two global depository receipts (GDRs) for VTB Bank after Britain's financial regulator suspended them in response to sanctions.

The German stock exchange operator widened the securities it would no longer trade to bonds issued by Russia.
India's top lender will not process any transactions involving Russian entities subject to international sanctions, according to a letter seen by Reuters and people familiar with the matter.

Companies like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) reaped the benefits of the pandemic, with organizations doubling down on their effort for digitization and switch to remote working and learning. The fresh restrictions from the spread of the Omicron variant also added a boost.
San Francisco, California-based Salesforce's subscription and support revenue for the fourth quarter rose 24.7% to $6.83 billion.
Along with demand for its platforms like Customer 360, the recent addition of Slack's workplace app also helped the cloud-based software maker in adding users.
""Slack continues to exceed our expectations that I think is benefiting not only from the trend towards this new way of working ... It's also benefiting being a part of our Customer 360 portfolio,"" Bret Taylor, Salesforce co-chief executive officer, said on a call.
Rival  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) in January also reported 26% growth in second-quarter revenue for its biggest segment, which offers cloud services and includes its flagship cloud offering, Azure.
For 2023, Salesforce expects revenue of $32 billion to $32.1 billion, above expectation of $31.78 billion.
The company's revenue rose 26% to $7.33 billion in the quarter, beating analysts' estimate of $7.24 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 

On an adjusted basis, Salesforce earned 84 cents per share, topping estimates of 74 cents. However, its current-quarter and full-year adjusted earnings guidance came below expectations.
The company also forecast first-quarter revenue to be between $7.37 billion and $7.38 billion. Analysts on average expect it to be $7.26 billion.

381,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 06:01PM ET</span>",Apollo CEO says Ukraine conflict could weigh on interest rate rises,"By Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) - Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc Chief Executive Marc Rowan said on Tuesday that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could temper interest rate rises by central banks and that he expected inflation to slow down in the long term.
The conflict in Ukraine has roiled global financial markets and fueled a surge in energy prices. While this could exacerbate inflation that was already raging because of supply chain shortages, any ensuing economic slowdown could drag inflation down, which would in turn alleviate the need for higher interest rates, Rowan said in a Reuters Newsmaker interview.
""The path right now should be for higher rates to tamp down inflation. But with Ukraine, the uncertainty is going to modulate that,"" Rowan said.
Apollo, one of the world's biggest investors in alternative assets such as corporate credit and private equity, does not have investment portfolio exposure to Russia or Ukraine, Rowan said. He added that the crisis was having a series of implications across the market and Apollo stood ready to capitalize on investment opportunities by providing liquidity to companies. 
The New York-based firm is experiencing higher labor, shipping and energy costs in the companies it owns, and expects these to remain elevated in the first half of the year, Rowan said. Inflation should abate longer-term as the effect fades of the economic stimulus that governments around the world launched two years ago in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Rowan said.
""The underlying factors that historically have given rise to increasing rates just don't exist,"" Rowan said.
Rowan said he expects Apollo, which has about $500 billion in assets under management, to step up sustainable investments through a platform it unveiled last week. He said Apollo financed fossil fuel companies if they were in the process of transitioning into clean forms of energy.
Rowan succeeded Leon Black last year, who stepped down as Apollo's CEO after an independent review found that he had paid $158 million to late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein for advice on tax and estate planning and related services between 2012 and 2017. The review cleared Black of any wrongdoing.

Black, who remains Apollo's largest shareholder, and Apollo co-founder Josh Harris, who sits on the firm's board, are now ""completely out of the business,"" Rowan said, adding that he did not need their advice at this stage.
""This is a business I know well. I joke with people internally, it's not a hard job, it's just a lot of work,"" Rowan said.

(Reuters) -U.S. payment card firms  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) have blocked multiple Russian financial institutions from their network, complying with government sanctions imposed over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Visa said on Monday it was taking prompt action to ensure compliance with applicable sanctions, adding that it will donate $2 million for humanitarian aid. Mastercard also promised to contribute $2 million. 
""We will continue to work with regulators in the days ahead to abide fully by our compliance obligations as they evolve,"" Mastercard said in a separate statement late on Monday.
In 2021, about 4% of Mastercard's net revenues were derived from business conducted within, into and out of Russia. Meanwhile, business conducted within, into and out of Ukraine accounted for 2% of its net revenues, according to a filing on Tuesday.
The government sanctions require Visa to suspend access to its network for entities listed as Specially Designated Nationals, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. The United States has added various Russian financial firms to the list, including the country's central bank and second-largest lender VTB. 
On Saturday, the U.S., Britain, Europe and Canada announced new sanctions on Russia - including blocking certain lenders' access to the SWIFT international payment system. 
Russians rushed to ATMs and waited in long queues on Sunday and Monday amid concerns that bank cards may cease to function, or that banks would limit cash withdrawals. 

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"".
Many Western banks, airlines and more have cut ties with Russia, calling the country's actions unacceptable. European nations and Canada have shut their airspace to Russian aircraft.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Options on a small, soon-to-be defunct exchange-traded fund tracking Russian stocks drew a rush of trading on Tuesday, as investors placed bets on what the fund's shares will do in its last few days of trading. 
The surge in trading came a day after fund issuer Direxion said its Russia 2x ETF, which seeks to deliver two times the daily performance of the MVIS Russia Index, would cease trading on March 11, due to heightened volatility and restrictions on Russian securities imposed in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
The ETF, which had assets of about $55 million as of Monday, slumped nearly 61% in price to $3.76 on Tuesday. Some 145,000 RUSL options changed hands on Tuesday. By comparison, the ETF's options have traded only about 32,000 over the entire last four years, according to Trade Alert data. 
The slew of options bets into the fund shows how some investors were looking to profit from the chaotic trading of Russia related assets, as investors flee assets linked to the country amid a slew of sanctions by the West and its allies. 
U.S.-listed ETFs on Russian stocks have come under intense selling pressure in recent days, as investors flee assets linked to the country amid a slew of sanctions by the West and its allies. Shares of the Vaneck Russia ETF, for example, are down more than 65% over the last eight sessions, including a slide of about 24% on Tuesday. 
""It's possible traders are taking advantage of the volatility, playing the momentum,"" said Susquehanna International Group’s Chris Murphy. 
Shareholders of the U.S.-listed ETF will receive an as-yet-undetermined amount of cash against any shares they hold, on or about March 18, Direxion said in a news release late on Monday. 
""I think it's a gambling play,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) and a former options market maker. ""You could see this thing bouncing around ... up 100% and then down 50% for the next 10 days,"" he said. 
The ETF's 30-day implied volatility was at 340%, the highest since the pandemic-driven selloff in early 2020. 
Some traders appeared to be betting that the final value for the ETF will be lower by the last day of trading on March 11, said Garrett DeSimone, head quant at OptionMetrics. 
Given the relatively small size of individual trades, it is likely that much of the trading was driven by retail players looking to make a quick profit as the stock gyrates wildly, said Murphy. 
That is in line with a growing trend that in which retail traders, who until recently had been enamored with the so-called meme stocks, increasingly turn their attention to securities that track the broader market, Murphy said.
""As everything goes toward the macro, the geopolitical and the Fed ... we are possibly seeing retail traders move more toward the macro-focused products because that's all that matters right now,"" Murphy said.

384,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 05:26PM ET</span>",U.S. lawmakers seek answers on 'troubling' drug price increases,"By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senators Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar and 11 other U.S. lawmakers pressed the president of the biggest pharmaceutical industry trade group Tuesday about what they said were ""troubling price increases for brand name drugs"" in January.
A letter to Stephen Ubl, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), was signed by 12 Democrats as well as Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent. It asks PhRMA to explain the source of the price increases, and asks for information about research costs and revenue from the medicines.
""The large, across-the-board price increases of popular, brand name prescription drugs appear to be an example of pharmaceutical companies taking advantage of their abusive market power to expand already large profits,"" the lawmakers wrote.
A spokesperson for PhRMA, Brian Newell, said drug prices rose just 1.3% last year and that the letter put a ""myopic focus"" on drugmakers that fails to take into account others involved in high U.S. healthcare costs.
""This letter ignores abusive insurance practices that force patients to pay the full cost of medicines while at the same time middlemen pocket record rebates and discounts from drugmakers,"" Newell said in a statement.
The lawmakers, who included Representative Katie Porter, cited two studies: one by Dr. Stephen Schondelmeyer of the University of Minnesota and another by the Johns Hopkins Drug Access and Affordability Initiative, which focused on 20 prescription medicines that the Medicare Part D program spends the most on.
Schondelmeyer's study found that drugmakers increased prices for 72% of the 100 top-selling drugs in early 2022, with 26% of brand name drugs showing higher prices.
The Johns Hopkins study found higher prices for 16 of the top 20 Medicare Part D drugs in January.

Among the widely used drugs in the Medicare program cited in the letter were Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO)'s Victoza 2-Pak for type 2 diabetes, which had a price increase of 4.8% to $709.74. Novo Nordisk spokesman Michael Bachner in a statement said that the company ""committed in 2016 to keep annual list price increases below 10% and we have kept true to that commitment."" Other drugs cited included AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV)'s big-selling rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira Pen and leukemia drug Imbruvica, which saw their prices go up 7.4%. The price of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s breast cancer drug Ibrance rose 6.9%, while the price of blood clot preventer Eliquis, sold by Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY) Squibb and Pfizer increased 6%, the letter said.
Representatives for other drugmakers did not comment.

The forecast helped quell investor worries that Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), beset by global supply chain disruptions due to shipping logjams, would underperform its rivals after the department store chain's shares fell 28% in 2021.
Wall Street analysts had criticized Nordstrom last year for the underwhelming performance of its off-price Rack division and its inability to ensure its stores were sufficiently stocked.
""Our primary focus is on three areas: improving Nordstrom Rack performance, increasing profitability and optimizing our supply chain and inventory flow,"" said Erik Nordstrom, the company's chief executive officer.
Nordstrom said inventory levels at the end of the fourth quarter were higher than planned, although it expects to reduce its stocks relative to sales during the current quarter.
The department store chain said it expects to be in a position to return cash to shareholders in the first quarter. It had suspended quarterly dividends and share repurchases in 2020 to weather the pandemic's impact.
Nordstrom forecast fiscal 2022 revenue to rise between 5% and 7%, while analysts on average forecast a 3.66% growth, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 
It also estimated full-year earnings per share, excluding the impact of any potential share repurchase activity, to be between $3.15 and $3.50. Analysts on average were expecting $2.01 per share.

Larger rivals Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) and Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) also predicted that their 2022 sales and profits would beat expectations.
Nordstrom's total revenue rose 23% to $4.49 billion in the fourth quarter, beating estimates of $4.35 billion. Net income surged six-fold to $200 million, or $1.23 per share.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Oil shot back above $100 a barrel and U.S. and German government debt rallied on Tuesday as fears increased over the impact of aggressive sanctions against Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, further depressing stocks in Europe and on Wall Street.
Russia's equity markets remained suspended and some bond trading platforms were no longer showing prices, but dealing in the world's major financial centers was orderly, albeit jittery.
The main stock indices in Germany, France, Italy and Spain closed down more than 3% while the pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 2.4%.
The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq equity indexes all closed around 1.5% lower while U.S. and European banking indices were hit hard for a second day, falling about 5.6% each.
MSCI's all-country world index fell 1.35%.
Yields on 10-year German bunds slid back into negative territory for the first time since late January and U.S. Treasuries dropped to five-week lows as prices, which move inversely to a bond's yield, rallied on safe-haven buying.
On the sixth day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the disruption caused by sanctions have raised questions about the toll of the crisis on global growth and inflation.
""If Russia controls more of Ukraine's food and energy production capacity and those types of things, they may end up being more expensive for everyone around the world,"" said Tom Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies in New York. ""The economic consequences of it may be more long-lasting.""
The upending of Russian trade may spur an increase in the pace of inflation in the short-term for many European jurisdictions, Citi researchers said in a note. 
Investors are acting rationally from a market standpoint, driving up oil, gas and commodity prices because they understand there could be supply chain disruptions, said Anthony Saglimbene, global markets strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP). 
""Moving forward, though, there's all these second- and third-derivative impacts that the market is still trying to figure out,"" Saglimbene added. ""When you cut Russia out of the global financial system, what are the ramifications for not only Russia, but stability across Europe right now?""
Russia said it was placing temporary curbs on foreigners seeking to exit Russian assets, braking an accelerating investor exodus driven by crippling Western sanctions. 
RUSSIA ASSETS PLUMMET 
Russian assets went into freefall with London-listed iShares MSCI Russia ETF plunging 33% to a fresh record low and shares of Sberbank, Russia's biggest lender, falling to 21 cents on the dollar from just under $9 before the invasion. 
The dollar gained 8.9% against the ruble and U.S. gold futures settled up 2.3% at $1,943.80 an ounce.
Russia warned Kyiv residents to flee their homes and rained rockets down on Kharkiv, as Russian commanders who have failed to achieve a quick victory shifted their tactics to intensify the bombardment of Ukrainian cities.
Oil prices surged more than 10% at one point as talks about a coordinated global release of crude inventories failed to calm fears about supply disruptions due to the war.
News of the release - less than one day of worldwide oil consumption - underscored the market's fear that supply will be inadequate to cover growing disruptions to the crude market. 
U.S. crude futures surged $7.69 to settle at $103.41 a barrel and Brent settled up at $104.97, while European natural gas prices jumped almost 29%. 
Traders in the largest U.S. oil hubs have put imports from Russian companies on hold, even though the White House has said oil sales are not a target of sanctions. This means sanctions have become more disruptive than expected.
Both oil and gas prices are now up nearly 60% since fears of an invasion of Ukraine began to escalate in November.
The likelihood of a slowing global economy has led to concerns that the Federal Reserve and other central banks will not be as aggressive in hiking interest rates in coming months.
The bond market is much more worried about growth than inflation due to a decline in real interest rates, said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis.

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - ""A major geopolitical realignment is taking place,"" which, like 9/11, ""shapes major governments' foreign and military policies unpredictably for years to come.""
So wrote Citi's market strategy team at the weekend in response to the unprecedented financial sanctions imposed on Moscow by many nations - and some remarkable policy U-turns in European capitals - after Russia invaded Ukraine. 
If a global geopolitical shift of that magnitude is underway, it surely follows that a similarly seismic, multi-year shift in the global investment landscape is also upon us.
The immediate playbook for investors will be to 'de-risk,' and pile into the safest or most liquid assets. This means moving out of stocks, credit, and emerging market assets, and into U.S. Treasuries, top-rated government bonds and the dollar.
But then what? Out of crisis always emerges opportunity.
""We are likely to see military, infrastructure and cyber security spending in the West not only increased but also speeded up,"" Stefan Kreuzkamp, chief investment officer at DWS, wrote on Tuesday.
Defense and aerospace stocks have soared since German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's bombshell on Sunday that Germany will commit about 100 billion euros ($118 billion) to a fund for its military and ramp up defense spending to more than 2% of gross domestic product, finally meeting a NATO target set out 16 years ago. 
If all NATO countries agree to the 2% of GDP target, billions more will flood into defense and related sectors.

Graphic - U.S. Defense & Aerospace Stocks: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/myvmnxaorpr/defence.jpg
Germany's Rheinmetall AG jumped a record 25% on Monday and gained a further 18% on Tuesday to hit a new high of 159 euros a share. Military sensor maker Hensoldt rocketed 42% on Monday and added a further 20% on Tuesday to 25 euros a share.
""That is an area you would expect to see continued growth, especially if this extra spending from Germany and Europe comes through,"" said Crit Thomas, investment strategist at Touchstone Investments, which oversees $34 billion in assets.
If so, it would be a reversal of the 'peace dividend' that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union and end of the Cold War three decades ago. The idea then was less defense spending would help reduce government borrowing, potentially paving the way for tax cuts.
That may flip in the coming years. 
FOCUS ON VALUATIONS
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economists said Berlin's defense pivot is one of a ""number of profound political and policy implications"" resulting from the Russia-Ukraine war that will reverberate for years to come.
Others may prove equally important. Take energy. 
As worries intensify over supply and the impact of sanctions, near-term prices are spiking higher. Brent crude oil has leapt back above $100 a barrel, and some analysts say European natural gas prices for the 2022-23 winter could be even higher than this winter.
Europe, which depends on Russia for about 40% of its natural gas, will reduce that dependency and seek alternative sources. Italy's foreign minister said on Monday that Rome will buy more from Algeria. 
These changes will take a long time to come into effect, but once they do, the upshot may be that greater supply from other countries simply raises aggregate global supply. If so, price pressures may eventually be to the downside, not the upside. 
Not only is Europe seeking to wean itself off Russian energy, it is leading the world's climate-driven shift away from fossil fuels. 
Germany's government is preparing to speed up passage of the Renewable Energy Sources Act through its parliament so that it can come into force by July, according to a document seen by Reuters. 
European offshore wind companies Vestas Wind Systems, Nordex and Orsted (OTC:DOGEF) on Monday jumped more than 15%, 13%, and 10%, respectively. Investor interest in clean and renewable energy is only liable to increase.
On a broader index level, equity strategists at Citi note that investors' response to most geopolitical events of recent decades has been simply to 'buy the dip'. 
But Phil Toews, who oversees $2.2 billion at Toews Asset Management, reckons this approach can no longer be taken for granted because inflation is so high now that borrowing costs are bound to rise. Perhaps significantly.
He argues that the medium-term to long-term outlook boils down to valuation as much as sector. He notes that the S&P 500 index's 12-month trailing valuation is still above 20 times earnings, consistent with a bear market. 
When it is back down to the historical average around 15 times earnings, then it's game on.
""Once valuations are washed out, regardless of the geopolitics, you can approach the markets with a new perspective. There will be potentially very good opportunities out there eventually,"" Toews predicts.

Haugen, a former  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) product manager, revealed her identity as the whistleblower who provided the documents that underpinned a Wall Street Journal investigation and a Senate hearing on Instagram's harm to teen girls. 
She also accused her former employer of repeatedly prioritizing profit over clamping down on hate speech and misinformation and has called for her former boss, Mark Zuckerberg, to step down.
The White House described her as ""an advocate for more humanity and transparency across the tech and social media industry, especially as it relates to teen mental health."" 
Pat Gelsinger, chief executive officer of  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) also plans to attend the annual speech, as the Biden administration seeks to showcase efforts to bolster chip supplies.
Gelsinger unveiled the chip maker's plans for a $20 billion Ohio-based chipmaking facility at the White House earlier in January as a global shortage of semiconductors hammers everything from smartphones to cars. The investment could grow to $100 billion, making it the world's largest chip making complex.
Biden, who has earned praise for his efforts to rally European allies and other nations against Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, will turn to uniting Americans in his State of the Union speech.

According to the White House, he will also highlight efforts to improve supply chains, stressing that companies announced nearly $200 billion investments for semiconductor, electric vehicle, battery and critical mineral production and manufacturing in the United States during his first year in office. 
Biden will specifically mention Intel's bet on Ohio, which is expected to create 7,000 construction jobs and 3,000 permanent positions, the White House added.

Investing.com -- SoFi Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) shares rallied over 15% in extended trading Tuesday after the company reported its fourth-quarter earnings, beating analyst earnings per share and revenue estimates.
The online personal finance company announced a loss per share of 15 cents on revenue of $279.88 million. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated a loss per share of 16 cents on revenue of $279.47 million.
SoFi reported a record 523,000 quarterly new member adds, up 39% sequentially. In addition, it achieved a record 906,000 quarterly new product adds, up 51% sequentially.
“We hit new highs across our key financial and operating metrics in the fourth quarter, finishing 2021 with record annual results,” said Anthony Noto, CEO of SoFi Technologies.
“Adjusted net revenue of $280 million was another quarterly record for us, up 54% year-over-year and up sequentially, even with the unexpected extension of the federal student loan payment moratorium in late December,"" Noto added.
SoFi explained that its guidance for the first quarter of 2022 incorporates the negative impact of the unexpected extension of the federal student loan payment moratorium to May 1. The company estimates the negative impact to be around $30 to $35 million of revenue and $20 to $25 million of contribution profit in the first quarter. As a result, it expects to generate $280 to $285 million of adjusted net revenue in Q1, up 30% to 32% year-over-year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Russian oil trade was in disarray on Tuesday as producers postponed sales, importers rejected Russian ships and buyers worldwide searched elsewhere for needed crude after a raft of sanctions imposed on Moscow over the war in Ukraine.
Numerous nations imposed sweeping sanctions against Russian companies, banks and individuals following Russia's invasion of Ukraine last week and global majors announced plans to leave multi-million-dollar positions in Russia. 
U.S., European and other governments exempted energy trade from sanctions to prevent already tight markets rallying further, but that has failed.
Global benchmark Brent crude settled at nearly $105 a barrel on Tuesday, its highest since August 2014, as refiners, traders and oil majors steer clear of Russia, out of an abundance of caution that they may unwittingly run afoul of sanctions somewhere. 
Russia is the second largest exporter of crude worldwide, trailing only Saudi Arabia, as it ships out 4 million to 5 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, along with 2 million to 3 million bpd of refined products. With demand already surging past pre-pandemic levels and major producers struggling to keep up, market players are increasingly fearful that prices will keep rising.
The knock-on effects of sanctions were felt all across the oil market on Tuesday. Russia's key Urals oil grade was bid at a discount of more than $18 below physical Brent crude, the primary worldwide benchmark, a record in the post-Soviet era. Even at that price, traders have been unable to find willing buyers.
""Nobody wants to buy, ship or store Russian oil,"" a trader of Russian oil said. 
In response to the severity of the disruption, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said it would coordinate a release of 60 million barrels of oil reserves from big consumers, with half coming from the United States.
The market responded by rallying even more, seeing the release - the equivalent to less than a day's worldwide oil consumption - as underscoring the worldwide supply crunch. 
Traders in futures markets aggressively pushed the price of current Brent contracts to more than $15 higher than contracts that will deliver oil six months from now. That was also a record, and indicative of growing worries about tight supply. [nL8N2V47B1]
SHUNNING RUSSIAN BARRELS
Even non-Russian oil has been snagged in the turmoil. 
Five traders who spoke with Reuters said buyers were avoiding oil delivered by the CPC pipeline - which delivers more than 1 million bpd from Kazakhstan, or over 1% of world supply - because it can mix with Russian grades and terminates at a Russian port on the Black Sea, traders said.
""It's an important source of supply - over a million barrels a day - into a world which right now really needs that oil supply,""  Chevron  Chief Executive Mike Wirth said in a Tuesday call with reporters. 
Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX) has a 15% stake in CPC and a 50% stake in Tengizchevroil (TCO), which is developing crude oil fields in western Kazakhstan.
Rival energy firms BP (NYSE:BP), Equinor and Shell (LON:RDSa) have abandoned multibillion-dollar positions in Russia, and BP has already cancelled all of its fuel oil loadings from the Russian Black Sea port of Taman, sources familiar with the matter said. 
 Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) said it was pulling U.S. employees from Russia, even though it has not said it will give up operations there.
Buyers around the world were trying to secure supplies from elsewhere. State-run Indian refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp, which buys roughly 2 million barrels of Russian Urals monthly, is seeking more oil from Middle Eastern producers for April. 
Canada said on Monday it would ban oil imports from Russia.
U.S. traders have started shunning Russian barrels, while Asian buyers were awaiting clarity from banks on whether they can transact with Russian sellers.
The Malaysian government said a Russian-flagged oil tanker targeted by U.S. sanctions will not be allowed to call at Kuala Linggi port.
European Union countries are considering a ban on Russian ships entering ports in the bloc. Britain said on Monday it would deny entry to British ports to all ships that are Russian owned, operated, controlled, chartered, registered or flagged.
RUSSIAN SOLUTIONS

Russia, meanwhile, is expected to boost supplies to China. Oil pipeline monopoly Transneft, which handles more than 80% of total oil produced in Russia, plans to increase supplies to China via the ESPO pipeline this month to 2.48 million tonnes from 2.22 million tonnes in February, according to TASS news agency.
Some Russian oil companies have stopped banking with sanctioned lenders, including VTB and Sberbank , and switched to those that do not face restrictions, including Rosbank, Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and Raiffeisen, five people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 fell Tuesday, paced by a slump in banking stocks on falling Treasury yields and worries about the economic outlook after oil prices rose above $100 a barrel as Russia intensified its assault on Ukraine.
The S&P 500 fell 1.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.8%, or 598 points, the Nasdaq fell 1.6%.
Russia on Tuesday continued to advance on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv after reportedly launching a heavy assault in Kharkiv, the country’s second largest city.
Regional banks including SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB), Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION) and Regions Financial (NYSE:RF) led the selloff in financials as U.S. government yields, which trade inversely to prices, fell in the wake of risk-off sentient amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.
The megacap bank stocks were also hit hard, with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) plunging to 52-week lows.  Wells Fargo  & Company (NYSE:WFC) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) were down sharply.

The odds of a 50 basis point has dropped to about 1% from 34% last week, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
U.S. oil prices rose above $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014 as potential supply disruptions from the ongoing geopolitical tensions offset the International Energy Agency’s release of 60 million barrels of oil from emergency reserves to ease rising prices.
APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA),  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) were among biggest gainers, with the latter up more than 7%.
Big tech also kept the broader market lower as risk-off sentiment overshadowed a slump in U.S. rates, which tends to boost growth corners of the market such as tech.

401,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 03:40PM ET</span>",Judge in Sarah Palin case defends handling of New York Times trial,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) -A federal judge on Tuesday forcefully defended his handling of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin's defamation trial against the New York Times including his decision to dismiss her case while jurors were still deliberating.
""Sarah Palin wholly failed to prove her case even to the minimum standard required by law,"" U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan said in the first sentence of his 68-page decision.
Rakoff's decision came two weeks after a jury found the Times and its former editorial page editor James Bennet not liable to Palin, the 2008 Republican U.S. vice presidential candidate.
Palin, 58, had sued over a June 2017 editorial about gun control that incorrectly linked her to a 2011 mass shooting.
After 1-1/2 days of deliberations without a verdict, Rakoff told lawyers outside jurors' presence that he would dismiss Palin's case because she had not offered clear and convincing evidence that the Times acted with ""actual malice.""
That timing proved problematic because some jurors received ""push"" notifications on their cellphones about Rakoff's plan.
Some later told the judge's clerk it had no effect on their deliberations, which lasted another few hours.
""The court knows of no reason why the highly conscientious citizens who served as jurors in this case would be so firm that they were unaffected by this information unless it were true,"" wrote the judge, who has overseen more than 300 jury trials.
Rakoff said ""no party objected in the slightest"" to letting jurors keep deliberating after he ruled against Palin, and noted how he admonished jurors to ""turn away"" if they learned what he did.
""The more fundamental point,"" he added, ""is that any effect the push notifications may have had is legally irrelevant.""
Kenneth Turkel, a lawyer for Palin, declined to comment.
Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said in an email: ""We remain confident that the judge and jury decided the case fairly and correctly.""
Analysts view Palin's case as a test of New York Times v. Sullivan, a 1964 U.S. Supreme Court decision establishing the ""actual malice"" standard for public figures to prove defamation.
To win, public figures must show that news media knowingly published false information or had reckless disregard for the truth.
On Monday, Palin's lawyers confirmed they would seek to throw out the verdict, get a new trial and disqualify Rakoff from the case.
Their legal arguments are due by March 15, with the Times scheduled to reply by March 29.
The June 14, 2017, Times editorial addressed gun control and lamented the rise of incendiary political rhetoric.
It followed a shooting at a congressional baseball practice in Virginia, where Republican U.S. congressman Steve Scalise was among the wounded.
One of Bennet's colleagues had prepared a draft editorial that referred to the January 2011 shooting in Arizona that killed six and wounded Democratic U.S. congresswoman Gabby Giffords.
Bennet inserted incorrect language that said ""the link to political incitement was clear"" between the Arizona shooting and a map from Palin's political action committee putting Giffords and 19 other Democrats under crosshairs.

The Times corrected the editorial the next morning.
Palin was the late Senator John McCain's running mate in the 2008 presidential election, and was Alaska's governor from 2006 to 2009.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) -Canada’s  Nutrien  (NYSE:NTR) Ltd, the world’s biggest fertilizer producer, said on Tuesday that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could result in prolonged disruptions to the global supply of potash and nitrogen crop nutrients.
Interim Chief Executive Ken Seitz said Nutrien will boost potash production if it sees sustained supply problems in Russia and Belarus, the world’s second- and third-largest potash producing countries after Canada.
The United States, European Union and other countries have imposed economic sanctions against Russia, moves that could hinder its exports of natural gas, potash and nitrogen. Belarus, Russia's ally, is already subject to European and U.S. sanctions that have restricted its potash exports.
Russia's war on Ukraine has also raised concerns about wheat, corn and vegetable oil supply problems in the Black Sea region, driving up world prices.
""We could probably see a prolonged, more prolonged disruption in (potash) supply out of that part of the world,"" Seitz said at a BMO Capital Markets investor conference.
""We're looking very closely at, if this is sustained, how do we deploy miners and open up ground in a very practical, pragmatic way?"" he added.
Nutrien expects to sell up to 14.3 million tonnes of potash this year, its most ever, and has said it is considering further expansion.
Brazilian agricultural exports are especially vulnerable to a scarcity of fertilizer, with Russia a key supplier.

Russia's aggression also has jeopardized its nitrogen fertilizer exports. Prices of European natural gas, a key input in nitrogen production, have jumped in the past week, much higher than North American prices.
""We're going to run our plants, run them flat out,"" Seitz said. ""Could we see interruptions in exports out of Russia? Yes. Can we see plant closures? We could.""

Investing.com – Stocks sold off on Tuesday as Russia intensified its attacks on major Ukrainian cities, including a push toward the capital of Kyiv as hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fled to neighboring countries to escape the violence.
Oil prices surged more than 10% on the eve of a meeting of the international oil cartel to decide on production levels. Major consuming nations said they reached an agreement to release some of their emergency oil reserves to keep prices from spiking further.
International companies continued to cut ties to Russia and thwart business activity there. U.S. stock markets were still down more than 1% with less than a half hour of trading left in the session.
President Joe Biden is scheduled to give his first State of the Union address Tuesday evening, where he could outline additional sanctions against Russia for its incursion into Ukraine. Biden is also expected to outline progress in his first year in office and his goals for this year.
Inflation is bound to be a topic of the speech. Biden has made several proposals to help keep prices in check, including lowering prescription drug prices and offering free community college and universal early education. The Federal Reserve meets this month to decide how much to raise rates.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow
1. Eyes on oil and oil companies
Global oil markets jumped more than 10% on Tuesday after ceasefire negotiations between Russian and Ukraine forces failed, prompting traders to push crude prices higher on worries that international sanctions against Moscow would severely crimp the country’s energy exports. Analysts are keeping an eye on inventory data due out Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, as well as surging stocks of big energy companies.
2. Earnings reports
Discount store  Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR)’s fourth-quarter profit per share is seen at $1.78 on likely revenue of $7.12 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. Meanwhile, software maker  Splunk Inc  (NASDAQ:SPLK)’s fourth-quarter revenue is seen at $774.92 million with loss per share coming in at 21 cents.
3. Private payrolls
ADP will release its month-on-month change in private payrolls for February at 8:15 AM ET. According to estimates, private companies in the U.S. added 350,000 jobs in February, compared to January when private payrolls fell by 301,000, the first time in more than a year.

405,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 03:25PM ET</span>",Malaysian financier said he discussed 1MDB probe with Trump allies -testimony,"By Luc Cohen
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A fugitive Malaysian financier said he won support from allies of former U.S. President Donald Trump for a possible settlement of a probe into the looting of funds from the 1MDB sovereign wealth fund, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker testified on Tuesday.
Tim Leissner offered a glimpse of what he had heard from financier Jho Low about the attempted deal, on the sixth day of his testimony at the trial of Roger Ng, another former Goldman banker. Ng, 49, has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiring to launder money and violate an anti-bribery law. 
Leissner, a former Goldman partner, said he had no independent verification of the information.
Leissner testified that Low, whom he described as the mastermind of the scheme, told him at a 2017 meeting that Low and his lawyers were in talks with the Trump administration about the potential for a multi-billion dollar deal that would spare several people from U.S. charges. 
""Jho was quite comfortable and confident,"" Leissner said.
Low told Leissner he had met with Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, in Beijing and had hired Chris Christie, the former Republican governor of New Jersey, as his lawyer with the promise of a $10 million fee if the settlement was successful, Leissner said.
Christie said he represented Low in civil forfeiture actions in California that resulted in Low surrendering $700 million to the U.S. Department of Justice. He said he never entered into an agreement to receive a fee if charges were dropped in exchange for payment to the U.S. government.
""There were never any discussions between me and any members of the Trump administration that the criminal investigation would be dropped or any charges against Mr. Low or anyone else dismissed in exchange for payment to the government,"" Christie said in a statement. ""Nor was there any agreement for a legal success fee to me to negotiate such a result."" 
Kushner could not be reached for comment.

Low, who was indicted by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn in 2018, has not been arrested by U.S. or Malaysian authorities. Malaysia says Low is in China, which Beijing denies. 
Prosecutors say Goldman helped 1MDB raise $6.5 billion, but that $4.5 billion of those funds were diverted to government officials, bankers and their associates. The bank in 2020 agreed to pay a $3 billion fine and have its Malaysia subsidiary plead guilty in U.S. court.

406,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 03:17PM ET</span>",Analysis-Getting rid of Russian assets a big problem for U.S. fund managers,"By John McCrank and Davide Barbuscia
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. investors holding Russian assets are finding themselves in an increasingly difficult position on working out how to ditch them.
The United States, Britain, Europe and Canada announced new sanctions on Saturday - including blocking certain banks' access to the SWIFT international payment system - following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That has sent a wave of investors announcing they are cutting positions in Russia. 
But investors trying to sell their Russian assets are being left with a problem: How to do it? 
Russia's central bank retaliated by banning Russian brokers from selling securities held by foreigners, although it did not specify assets for which the ban applies. Compounding that, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said on Tuesday the country will temporarily stop foreign investors from selling Russian assets to ensure they make a considered decision.
Moscow's move to impose capital controls means that billions of dollars worth of securities held by foreigners in Russia are at risk of being trapped. 
""It’s a pickle,"" said Brett Johnson, partner at Snell & Wilmer. ""If I was an investor, I would be really concerned by what the Russian government is doing right now. I would be very, very concerned about that investment and how it’s going to play out over the long term."" 
Some U.S. investors had been able to gain access to the Russian market by purchasing American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), which are certificated issues by U.S. banks that represent shares in foreign companies for trading on U.S. stock exchanges, or buying on over-the-counter exchanges. But Nasdaq Inc and Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc's NYSE have temporarily halted trading in the stocks of Russia-based companies listed on their exchanges due to regulatory concerns, people familiar with the matter said.
""It’s a real problem for investors to be able to somehow unwind their exposures,"" said Andrew Karolyi, a professor of finance at Cornell University, who said that Russia in general was a very difficult market to access for global investors, which is why using American depository receipts had been an important vehicle. 
Karolyi said the way to offload those securities ""would be to work through the depository banks that have issued these receipts,"" pointing to intermediaries like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), to cancel the receipts toward owning the ordinary shares that underlie them. JPM did not immediately respond to a request for comment, Citi did not immediately provide a comment, and BNY declined comment. 
""Being able to actually move those immobilized ordinary shares is just really, really difficult,"" Karolyi said.
In the over-the-counter markets, ADRs of Sberbank were still trading, according to OTC Markets Group, which showed that more than 20 million of the sanctioned Russian bank's ADR shares had been traded by 2 p.m. EST, versus a 30-day average of just under 3 million shares.
London-listed shares in Sberbank erased nearly all their value after the London Stock Exchange suspended trading in the global depository receipts (GDRs) of VTB, another sanctioned Russian bank.
The LSE said it cut off trading in VTB after the Bank of New York Mellon resigned as the depositary for the shares. That also affected U.S.-based trading of VTB GDRs.
Foreign investors had nearly $20 billion invested in Russian Eurobonds and $31 billion in OFZ government bonds. Foreign funds held 86% of Russian stock market free float as of end-2021, according to Moscow Exchange data.
A number of funds have said they want to exit their positions - or help clients sell. 
Top asset manager BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) is consulting with regulators, index providers and other market participants ""to help ensure our clients can exit their positions in Russian securities"" where allowed.
JPMorgan Asset Management suspended its JPM Emerging Europe Equity fund on Monday, a source familiar with the matter said.
Pension funds are also trying to work out what to do. 
The difficulty is compounded by a lack of liquidity. 
“There’s a lot of pass the parcel. My sense is a lot of people have been left with what they had when the ‘special operation’ was announced by Russia, because market liquidity has dried up,"" said a London-based hedge fund manager invested in European financial firms, who declined to be named, adding that the fund had cut some indirect exposure to Russia.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation.”
SANCTIONED ENTITIES 
It's an even more pressing dilemma when the fund manager is holding newly sanctioned entities. 
""The real quick question goes to the local shares,"" said one fund manager who holds sanctioned Russian stocks, adding that it was not clear how to exit existing positions.
The fund manager, who requested anonymity when talking about specific holdings, said it could be problematic to transfer ownership of shares as it was up to local custodians to interpret the rules issued by the central bank. 

Investors that lose money could face a lot of wrangling and lawsuits to try to recoup. 
""Certainly there is a long history of foreign investors clashing with local states over ownership of various kinds of assets, and these have been resolved in ways ranging from financial settlements to foreign military invasions,"" said Benjamin A. Coates, associate professor at the Department of History of Wake Forest University.

Month on month deliveries for all three were lower than in January.
Li Auto shares fell by the smallest amount Tuesday, down 0.3%, while XPeng fell 6.4% and NIO dropped over 2%. 
NIO sold 6,131 vehicles in February, increasing by 9.9% year-over-year. The number included 3,309 ES6 models. However, it was below the 9,652 cars delivered in January. NIO added that during the production suspension of the NIO-JAC manufacturing plant in the Spring Festival holiday from January 31 to February 6, the company adjusted the production lines to prepare for the delivery of ET7 in March 2022.
XPeng delivered 6,225 EVs in February, representing a 180% increase year-over-year. Of that, 3,537 P7 sports sedans were delivered, representing a 151% year-over-year rise. However, this was also well below the 12,922 vehicles sold in January. XPeng said the technology upgrade at its Zhaoqing plant during the Chinese New Year holiday has been completed, and production at the plant resumed in mid-February.
Li Auto was the delivery leader in February, but it also experienced a fall from January. The company delivered 8,414 Li ONEs, up 265.8% year over year, but below the 12,268 reported in January.
""The holiday season and an outbreak of the pandemic in Suzhou have resulted in supply shortages and affected our production,"" Li Auto's Co-Founder and President Yanan Shen said.

(Reuters) - U.S. regulators can largely use existing laws to bring digital assets such as cryptocurrencies under their supervision without new congressional legislation, one of Washington's most influential liberal think tanks said on Tuesday. 
Agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) could use the report from the Center for American Progress (CAP) to inform their decisions on how to govern cryptocurrencies. 
Regulators have not yet determined how best to regulate cryptocurrencies, in particular so-called ""stablecoins"" whose creators say they have pegged their values to the dollar and other fiat currencies. The U.S. Treasury Department kicked the issue to Congress in a report last year. 
Progressives, worried about systemic risk and investor protection, want regulators to take a tougher stance on the issue.
The think tank said it would be helpful for Congress to address gaps within the current regulatory framework — such as creating rules for crypto commodities. But it warned that a new and distinct regulatory structure for crypto could inadvertently weaken supervision and create regulatory arbitrage.
“For crypto securities, we already have an existing structure in place, and that structure needs to be enforced. We don't need to recreate the wheel,” said Todd Phillips, director of financial regulation and corporate governance at CAP, who co-authored the paper with Alexandra Thornton, its senior director of tax policy. 

CAP maps out a number of measures agencies can take within their current mandates. For example, the SEC could regulate crypto wallet providers as clearing agencies, or the CFTC could require the disclosure of the assets that back stablecoins.
The report also suggested that the banking regulators could allow banks to issue their own stablecoins without congressional authorization, so long as they would be backed by dollar reserves.

(Reuters) -Harley-Davidson Inc said on Tuesday it had suspended its business and shipments of its bikes to Russia following that country's invasion of Ukraine last week.
The attack marked the biggest conflict in Europe since World War Two. Many Western firms, including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Germany's Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) Truck Holding AG, have idled operations in Russia.
Shares for the motorcycle giant fell 3% in afternoon trading, in line with Wall Street's main indexes as the crisis in Ukraine escalates.
Harley did not respond to a request for additional details on the suspension or the size of its operations in Russia.
Russia's President Vladimir Putin has been photographed riding Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) bikes, and joined a gathering of bikers in Ukraine in 2010. 
Europe is Milwaukee-based Harley's second-largest market for retail sales of bikes after the United States. 
Russia's Harley-Davidson dealerships make up only a sliver of its broader dealer network, with roughly 10 in Russia, said Chris Hodson, senior analyst and partner at Edgewater Research. 
Harley's website says it has 369 dealerships in the European Union, its second-largest market after the United States.
Bikes that were originally scheduled to be delivered to Russia are likely to be rerouted as the company sees strong demand, Hodson said.

""Russia is not that significant of a market to begin with,"" Hodson said. ""Any units that have been earmarked for Russia can be diverted elsewhere.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker Tim Leissner, the prosecution's star witness in a criminal trial tied to Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund, admitted under cross-examination on Tuesday that he had ""lied a lot"" in his life. 
Leissner is testifying in the trial of Roger Ng, 49, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiring to launder money and violate an anti-bribery law. 
Leissner, 52, who was Ng's boss at Goldman, pleaded guilty to similar charges in 2018 and agreed to cooperate with the government. 
A key piece of Ng's defense is attempting to show that Leissner was the true architect of the scheme, and was lying about Ng's involvement in a bid to spare himself prison time.
The charges stem from one of the biggest financial scandals in history. Prosecutors say Goldman from 2009 to 2014 raised $6.5 billion for 1MDB through bond sales and earned $600 million in fees, but that $4.5 billion was diverted to officials, bankers and their associates through bribes and kickbacks.
On Tuesday, Ng's attorney Marc Agnifilo grilled Leissner about his romantic relationships with five different women. The former banker admitted that he had twice been secretly married to two women at the same time, and had on at least one occasion forged a divorce certificate to mislead a woman he wanted to marry.
""I have lied a lot sir, and I have regretted those choices,"" Leissner said.
Leissner testified that he and Ng played a key role in the scheme and that he personally transferred $35 million in kickbacks to Ng, Goldman's top banker for Malaysia. Leissner oversaw the firm's Southeast Asia team.
Ng left Goldman in 2014, Leissner said. 
Leissner testified earlier on Tuesday that after the FBI served him with a subpoena in February 2016, Ng and his wife, Hwee Bin Lim, suggested he consult a feng shui master they trusted to ask whether they ""would be in trouble.""
At the end of the meeting, Leissner said he, Ng and Lim concocted a ""cover story"" involving Lim and Leissner's then-wife, Judy Chan, to justify the $35 million in funds.
The testimony could prove problematic for Ng, who argued that the money prosecutors call ill-gotten gains was actually derived from a legitimate business venture between the two men's wives.

Lawyers for Ng are expected to call Lim to testify in her husband's defense. 
Goldman in 2020 paid a nearly $3 billion fine and arranged for its Malaysian unit to plead guilty in U.S. court.

LONDON (Reuters) -The potential for disruptions to Russian commodity supplies has thrown a spotlight on the metal used in the aerospace, marine and auto industries.
The United States and Europe have imposed financial sanctions on Russian banks, individuals and other entities after Russia invaded Ukraine.
There are as yet no sanctions on Russian commodity exporters such as VSMPO-Avisma, which supplies titanium to planemakers Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus. 
Airbus has said it relies on Russia for half its titanium needs, while a U.S. industry source said VSMPO-AVISMA provided a third of Boeing's requirements.
But a decision by Western allies to block ""selected"" Russian banks from the SWIFT payments system could disrupt supplies of commodities that Russia exports, as could suspension of container shiping to and from Russia.
WHERE IS TITANIUM PRODUCED?
Titanium minerals are used to make titanium sponge, which is turned into metal for industrial applications.
China is the world's top producer of titanium sponge, accounting for 57% of global output at 210,000 tonnes last year, according to U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
USGS data shows Japan comes next with nearly 17%, followed by Russia with nearly 13% of the market. Kazakhstan produced 16,000 tonnes and Ukraine 3,700 tonnes.
Russia has low titanium mineral reserves.
""In 2021 Ukraine was the leading source of titanium mineral concentrates imports into Russia,"" USGS said. ""Other leading sources included Vietnam, Mozambique and Kazakhstan.""
USGS estimates that Ukraine produced 525,000 tonnes of titanium mineral concentrates last year.
WHO IMPORTS TITANIUM?
Consultancy CRU says that China was the largest importer of titanium sponge last year with more than 16,000 tonnes, up from 6,000 tonnes in 2020. 
The second-largest importer was the United States with about 16,000 tonnes last year, down from 19,000 in 2020.
Japan is the largest exporter of titanium sponge to China and the United States, shipping 8,000 tonnes and 14,000 tonnes respectively last year.
""The recovery of industries such as construction and aerospace last year led to a jump in demand for titanium products post-pandemic,"" CRU analysts said. 
Tight supplies can be seen in prices of titanium sponge which are up nearly 9% since the end of December at about $9 per kg.
WHAT IS TITANIUM USED FOR?
Titanium is used in the aerospace industry to make landing gear, blades and turbine discs, in the marine industry titanium sheet is used to make ships and submarines and in the auto sector it is used in components for internal combustion engines.
In chemical processing, titanium offers protection from fatigue and cracking, in vaping titanium wire is used to enhance safety and control temperature and in sport its uses include golf club heads.
Titanium is also used for joint replacements and dental implants because it has a similar density to human bones.
WHAT'S IN A NAME?

The name Titanium is derived from the Titans of Greek mythology, with the metal accounting for about 0.6% of the earth's mass. 
It is a hard, strong, lightweight metal with extraordinary resistance to corrosion. Titanium is as strong as steel, yet 45% lighter.

(Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms Inc are among internet companies facing possible punitive measures in Russia after failing to open local offices and take other measures required by a communications law.
Since July 2021, Russian legislation signed by President Vladimir Putin has obliged foreign social media companies with more than 500,000 daily users to open local offices or be subject to restrictions as severe as outright bans.
The new rules also require companies to register with Russian communications regulator Roskomnadzor and have a system for fielding user complaints. In November, Roskomnadzor listed 13 companies it wanted to set up officially on Russian soil. Last month, it said it would start imposing restrictions by the end of February.
Ahead of the March deadline, only a few had complied. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last week, Western governments have urged companies to push back on Putin in any way possible. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation.”
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) had fully complied before fighting began in Ukraine. On Monday, Roskomnadzor's website showed Rakuten Group Inc's messaging app Viber had completed all required steps.
Six other companies had fulfilled at least one policy but had not established a Russian legal entity or local office. Those were Google, Meta,  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), ByteDance's TikTok,  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc, JOYY (NASDAQ:YY) Inc's video app Likee, the government website showed late Monday.
Meta had been in ""protracted discussions"" with the Russian regulator up until the invasion of Ukraine occurred, Nick Clegg, Meta's head of global affairs, said during a press call on Tuesday.
Clegg said Meta sought to comply with the law ""where we feel we can in good conscience do so,"" but added there were other provisions the company felt were difficult to understand. 
Four companies - chat tool Discord, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s live streaming unit Twitch, messaging app Telegram and bookmarking service Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc - had taken no steps to comply, according to the website.
Likee said its Feb. 16 filing to form a Russian legal entity was under review and it plans to comply with the law. Twitter declined to comment. The other 11 companies did not respond to requests for comment. 
Last month, Roskomnadzor said it would begin barring non-compliant companies from selling ads in Russia. It previously has said blocking access to the targeted services would be a last resort, and other penalties could include limiting data collection and money transfers.
The regulation is a part of a wider campaign for internet control that critics say threatens individual and corporate freedom. Authorities in Russia have issued small fines to social media companies for ignoring demands to censor anti-government activists or information.
Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation,"" has curtailed access to Facebook in recent days in retaliation for the platform's censoring state media services, which critics say promote fake news and propaganda. Twitter has also been slow to access on mobile devices.

Demand has surged in Russia during the crackdown for virtual private networking (VPN) apps, which can help with circumventing internet restrictions. Three of the top five most downloaded apps on Apple's App Store on Monday were VPNs. They generated a combined 383,000 installs over the past seven days, 15 times more than the prior seven-day period, according to estimates from tracker Sensor Tower.

(Reuters) - Meta Platforms is globally demoting content from Russian state-controlled media outlets' Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) pages and Instagram accounts, as well as posts containing links to those outlets on Facebook, the company's head of global affairs said on Tuesday.
Tech and social media companies have faced pressure to respond to last Thursday's invasion of Ukraine by Russia, which has led to economic sanctions against Moscow by governments around the world.
Meta's Nick Clegg told reporters during a conference call that the company had seen a ""definitely discernable"" degradation of its services in Russia since authorities there announced they would restrict Meta's platforms. Video and other multimedia content had particularly been affected, Clegg said.
Meta had been in ""protracted discussions"" with Russia's communications regulator Roskomnadzor over its new law that requires some foreign internet companies to open offices in Russia, Clegg added. He called some of the provisions under the new law ""disproportionate."" 
Meta, along with Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, face possible punitive measures in Russia because they have not yet complied.

On Monday, Meta said it would restrict access to Russian state media outlets RT and Sputnik on its platforms across the European Union.
Clegg said the company had also received requests from governments outside of the European Union to block Russian state media. He said he was not aware of such a request from the United States government.

(Reuters) -U.S. retailer  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) posted record holiday quarter earnings on Tuesday and forecast an upbeat 2022 as it expects supply chain pressures to ease later in the year, lifting shares 14%.
Margins remain front and center for investors this earnings season, with big retailers spending heavily to expedite shipments and hiring thousands more people to navigate bottlenecks and ensure well-stocked shelves.
""We see supply chain constraints that are steadily working themselves out but will likely take more time... made more uncertain by the crisis in Ukraine (following the invasion by Russia),"" Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said on an earnings call. 
Minneapolis-based Target said raising prices would be the last lever it pulls to combat higher costs, but expects profits to improve later this year, as sales are boosted from new online options and same-day delivery.
Same-day businesses, which allow shoppers to pull into a store and pick up goods in minutes or get them delivered within hours, rose 45% in 2021, the company said. 
The big box chain said it would invest up to $5 billion this year - compared with the $4 billion it outlined for 2021 - to remodel stores, open more mid-size outlets and improve its online business to sustain the sales momentum. 
NO SLOWDOWN
Sales at Target and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) surged during the pandemic, and the retailers are building on those gains using their scale and negotiating power with suppliers to undercut smaller rivals through competitive pricing and gain market share. 

""The retailers who have been able to mitigate the supply chain issues and all the headwinds have gained an advantage over mom & pop stores,"" said Jessica Ramirez, retail analyst at Jane Hali & Associates. 
Target expects low- to mid-single digit revenue growth in fiscal 2022, compared with estimates of a 2.18% rise. It forecast adjusted profit to rise by high single-digits, above estimates of a marginal increase.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. banks saw their profits jump nearly 90% in 2021 as firms shrank how much money they were setting aside to protect against credit losses, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said on Tuesday.
Banks reported $279.1 billion in profits in 2021, up $132 billion compared to 2020, the FDIC said. The jump was mainly due to economic growth and banks rapidly shrinking their credit loss provision expenses, which dropped $163.3 billion in 2021, it added.
The reduction in credit losses came after banks moved to build up huge cushions in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. But with feared losses not materializing - the FDIC reported noncurrent loan balances were down 3% in the fourth quarter - banks moved to shrink those reserves in 2021 and deploy the funds elsewhere. 
The FDIC reported that banks reduced their credit loss provisions across all four quarters of 2021, with that pace slowing in the fourth quarter. 
In the fourth quarter of 2021, banks reported $63.9 billion in profits, up 7.4% from the same quarter in 2020, the FDIC said. However, profits were down slightly from the third quarter, falling 8.1% as banks slowed down their aggressive reductions in loss provisions.

A majority of banks reported an annual increase in profits, the FDIC said. Net interest and noninterest income were both up from the third quarter to the fourth.
However, FDIC Acting Chairman Martin Gruenberg cautioned that banks still face a number of headwinds including rising interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty. Gruenberg singled out the fact that higher interest rates could weigh down real estate and impact borrowers' ability to repay, adding that bank supervisors plan to closely monitor those areas this year.

The company also said it would stop providing insurance cover and investments for any new Arctic energy exploration activities.
It also revealed a target of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions across its global underwriting and investment portfolios by 2050.
""As one of the last major insurers without restrictions on coal insurance, AIG's new commitments to reduce underwriting for coal, tar sands oil, and Arctic oil and gas are a major step forward for people and the planet,"" said Hannah Saggau, an insurance campaigner with Public Citizen, an influential consumer advocacy group.
Lloyd's of London in late 2020 asked its members to stop providing new insurance cover for thermal coal, oil sands, or new Arctic energy exploration from Jan. 1, 2022, with a target date of Jan. 1, 2030 to phase out the renewal of existing cover.
European insurers, including AXA and Zurich, have for long pulled back from underwriting fossil fuels such as coal and oil sands, turning the focus on their U.S. and Asian peers, which have long been viewed as laggards.

Chubb (NYSE:CB) in November set a new goal to achieve carbon neutrality in its global operations by 2022 end through a combination of renewable energy and carbon offset purchases.
AIG said on Tuesday it would phase out the underwriting of all existing operation insurance risks and cease new investments in clients that derive 30% or more of their revenues from coal-fired power, thermal coal mines or oil sands, or generate more than 30% of their energy production from coal by Jan. 1, 2030 or sooner.

(Reuters) - Get ready for the $10 tube of toothpaste. 
Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) Co CEO Noel Wallace said last week at an industry conference that the household goods maker sees its new Optic White Pro Series toothpaste as the type of premium product ""vital"" to its ability to raise prices, which will help drive profit growth this year.
His remarks come when many consumer products companies are hiking prices as much as they can to offset their own rising costs, a trend that could continue due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, whose economic risks include driving up gasoline prices.
So far retailers and consumers seem largely unfazed by higher prices. But some lawmakers and consumer advocates argue that companies are excessively raising prices in order to fuel profits and return money to shareholders.
""We're seeing significant price hikes on virtually every item consumers purchase,"" said U.S. Representative David Cicilline, who is working on proposed antitrust legislation aimed at bringing down prices. ""They're imposing real hardships. People are taking things out of their grocery carts because it’s too expensive.""
In the past, major retailers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc pushed back on price hikes. But now, retailers like Walmart and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT)  Target said on Tuesday in an earnings call that bumping up pricing is the last lever it pulls when faced with increased costs. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission over the last three months has probed sky-high prices and supply chain disruptions, requiring companies including Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co, Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co and Walmart to turn over internal documents on profit margins, pricing and promotions. Comments on the inquiry are due March 14 and so far show small grocers angry with having to pay more and receive less of crucial products. Consumers wrote in about being unable to find oatmeal, cereal and cat food. In an interview with Reuters, Cicilline cited Colgate as an example of a company touting price hikes, making basic items too costly, and paying out more to investors.  Colgate expects its margins to widen this year, due in part to higher prices. It also bought back almost 50% more shares last year, a boon for investors. Raising prices is a ""key capability"" for Colgate that will help drive profit growth, Wallace said last week. A Colgate spokesperson said in a statement that the company has a wide portfolio of products at different price points, and touted its new $10 toothpaste as the first with 5% hydrogen peroxide, with ""demonstrated efficacy to whiten teeth.”  Consumer goods companies last year started hiking prices in response to rising raw material costs and labor shortages due to the pandemic. ""There is incredible appetite for our products,"" said Katie Denis, a spokeswoman for the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group for consumer packaged goods companies including Colgate. ""We make essentials. And there is no option of not delivering.""  Prices also rose on competing private label items, analysts said.  The White House is targeting corporate profits as it grapples with inflation. Bharat Ramamurti, deputy director of the White House's National Economic Council, said there are examples of companies outside of the meatpacking industry -- which has particularly been in the White House's crosshairs -- increasing prices beyond their own climbing costs. Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Owens, executive director of the progressive non-profit Groundwork Collaborative, named diapers as a category with little competition, paving the way for aggressive price hikes.  Kimberly-Clark Corp (NYSE:KMB)'s margins took a hit in 2021 due to rising costs. The maker of Huggies diapers is betting that consumers will buy pricier options made with plant-based material, helping its profits recover, executives said at last week's conference.  P&G executives said last week that they expect margins to continue to improve as higher prices hit stores. The company also plans to buy back more stock than originally planned.  
Graphic - U.S. CPG gross margins: https://graphics.reuters.com/CONSUMERPRODUCTS-PRICING/zdvxoamlypx/chart_eikon.jpg ""Many companies are taking advantage of high consumer demand to continue to raise prices when they don’t need to,"" said Jack Gillis, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, a non-profit consumer interest group. ""As long as consumers are willing to pay those prices, there’s no incentive to lower them.""

MILAN (Reuters) -The latest wave of sanctions on Russia over its Ukraine invasion has thrown the global banking industry deeper into turmoil, as Western countries try to squeeze Moscow's access to cash for its economy and international trade.
Some Russian banks will be excluded from the SWIFT international payments system and, crucially, other sanctions target the country's central bank to stop it from using its foreign reserves.
The moves aim to undermine Moscow's ability to weather the wider economic sanctions but they also impact Western banks which are exposed to Russia's economy.
The European arm of Sberbank, Russia's biggest lender, faces failure, the European Central Bank has said, after a run on its deposits sparked by the crisis.
In Europe, Italian and French banks have the largest Russian exposure, representing just over $25 billion each at the end of September, followed by Austrian banks with $17.5 billion, data by the Bank of International Settlements https://stats.bis.org/statx/srs/table/b4?c=RU&f=pdf (BIS) show.
The exposure of U.S. banks totals $14.7 billion, according to BIS data.
Following are some of the banks with significant Russian exposure. 
U.S. BANKS
CITIGROUP INC 
The U.S. bank on Monday said its total exposure to Russia amounted to nearly $10 billion.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) listed Russia as 21 among its top 25 country exposures with $5.4 billion of loans, securities and funding commitments at end-2021 - 0.3% of overall exposures based on a regulatory filing.
On Monday, Citigroup gave more details, taking the count for ""total third-party exposure"" to $8.2 billion. That includes $1.0 billion in cash at the Bank of Russia and other financial institutions and $1.8 billion of reverse repos.
Citigroup also said it has $1.6 billion of exposures to additional Russian counterparties outside of its Russian subsidiary that are not included in that $8.2 billion.
As a comparison,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) reported in a filing last month $293 million in net exposure to Russia, as well as a total of $414 million of market exposure as of December 2021.
EUROPEAN BANKS
RAIFFEISEN BANK INTERNATIONAL (RBI) 
The Austrian lender's Russian business ranks as the country's ninth largest bank by loans https://www.rbinternational.com/en/who-we-are/our-network/international-network/raiffeisen-in-russia.html. With overall assets of 15.8 billion euros, it employs around 8,700 staff to serve more than 4.5 million customers.
Its equity of 2.4 billion euros file:///C:/Users/u8018106/OneDrive%20-%20Thomson%20Reuters%20Incorporated/Documents/2022-02-02%20Presentation%20RBI%20(3).pdf represents 18% of consolidated equity. 
RBI has operated in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union and its business there contributed almost a third to the group's net profit of 1.5 billion euros ($1.66 billion) last year.
RBI's Russian exposure totalled 22.85 billion euros file:///C:/Users/u8018106/OneDrive%20-%20Thomson%20Reuters%20Incorporated/Documents/2022-02-02%20Presentation%20RBI%20(2).pdf, more than half relating to the corporate private sector, it said in its 2021 results presentation.
Russia's central bank accounts for 8% of RBI's exposure to the country, sovereign entities for 4% and Russian banks for 2%, based on the presentation. 
The overall figure comprises 11.6 billion euros in customer loans (or 11.5% of group), more than 80% of which are in Russian roubles.
Cross-border exposure to Russia is only 1.6 billion euros with no parent funding from Vienna. Raiffeisen also holds 2.2 billion euros in loans to Ukrainian customers.
Provisions against losses cover 64.3% of RBI's impaired exposures in Russia.
RBI Chief Executive Johann Strobl told Reuters this week that the group's Russian subsidiary ""had a very strong liquidity position and (was) recording inflows.""
SOCIETE GENERALE
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) started doing business in Russia in 1872 then left the country in 1917, the year of the Bolshevik revolution, to return in 1973. It has 1.5 million local customers.
Societe Generale, which controls Russian bank Rosbank, had 18 billion euros https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/documents/2022-02/Q4-21-Financial-Results-Presentation.pdf of overall exposure to Russia at the end of last year - or 1.7% of the group total.
That includes both on- and off-balance sheet items (for example a credit line that has not yet been tapped).
Of SocGen's Russian exposure, 39% is to the corporate sector and 36% to retail. Sovereign entities account for 21%, financial institutions for 4%.
Actual loans grew 13.3% last year to 10.5 billion euros.
Its Russian retail business - to which 1.05 billion euros of capital was allocated on average last year - produced 115 million euros in 2021 net income, up from 37 million euros in 2020. Including financial services, net income at SG Russia was 152 million euros, versus 76 million in 2020.
The bank said it had implemented measures to adapt to the new sanctions and that Rosbank continued to operate in a ""safe manner"".
UNICREDIT
The Italian bank's Russian subsidiary ranks as the country's 14th largest bank. UniCredit Russia's 2.3 billion euros in equity accounts for 3.7% of the group's total. 
UniCredit's ""exposure at default"" relating to Russia totalled 14.2 billion euros as of mid-2021.
Of that, around 8 billion euros are loans extended by the Russian arm and locally funded.
The rest includes off-balance sheet items and cross-border loans mainly granted by UniCredit SpA towards large corporates outside of Russia.
UniCredit said last week its Russian franchise accounted for only around 3% of group revenues and provisions covered 84% of its non-performing exposures.
INTESA SANPAOLO
Italy's biggest bank has financed major investment projects in Russia, such as the Blue Stream gas pipeline and the sale of a stake in oil producer Rosneft. It handles more than half of all commercial transactions between Italy and Russia. 
Intesa's loan exposure to Russia was 5.57 billion euros at the end of 2021 https://group.intesasanpaolo.com/content/dam/portalgroup/repository-documenti/investor-relations/presentazioni-it/2022/Presentazione_FY21_IT.pdf, or 1.1% of the total. 
Its subsidiaries in Russia and Ukraine have assets, respectively, of 1 billion euros and 300 million euros, which together represent just 0.1% of the group's total assets. 
ING 
The Dutch bank has around 4.5 billion euros in outstanding loans with Russian clients and around 600 million euros with clients in Ukraine, out of a total loan book worth more than 600 billion euros.

ING said many sanctions against Russia had been in place since 2014.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. banks' exposures to Russia may not be fully understood by investors due to a lack of transparency in disclosures made so far, and banks that get significant revenue from global operations could take a hit in the long run, analysts said.
The exposure so far disclosed by U.S. banks is $14.7 billion. Compared to Italian, French and Austrian banks, which combined have just over $42.5 billion in exposure to Russia, U.S. banks appear less at risk.
However,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) surprised analysts on Monday, saying its total exposure to Russia amounted to nearly $10 billion, far higher than previously communicated.
The new number took into account cash held at the Bank of Russia and other financial institutions, reverse repos and additional exposures to Russian counterparties.
Citigroup's revised total raised the question of whether other banks have higher exposures than so far disclosed.
In a research note published on Tuesday, JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein said that, in general, ""transparency on exposure by banks to Russia is low.""
""Most banks do not give net exposures, and do not provide granularity around the gross exposures,"" Abouhossein wrote, adding that U.S. banks' derivatives exposure risk and the impact that sanctions could have on their wholesale payments businesses are currently unknown. 
Only a handful of U.S. banks have quantified their Russia exposure.
In addition to Citi,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) reported $293 million in net exposure to Russia, as well as a total of $414 million of market exposure as of December 2021, according to its most recent filing.
Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp said it has less than $100 million of Russia exposure.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, which round out the top four largest U.S. banks, did not list Russia in the top 20 countries where they have the most exposure in their most recent filings. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) has not disclosed its exposure. 

While U.S. banks appear to have less financial exposure to Russia than their European counterparts, Citi analyst Ken Usdin said they may see greater indirect impacts to their businesses, given the sizeable revenue some get from global business. 
Citi, JPMorgan and the trust banks, like  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT), could see that kind of impact due to their large global revenue exposure, Usdin said.

The company has invested in fintechs Propel, Cointracker and edtech Masterclass, among others. It manages a portfolio of over 60 angel investments, thirteen of which are unicorns, according to the blog. 
Alison Rapaport, who has previously worked at J.P. Morgan, Wasserman and Melo7Tech Ventures, leads Serena Ventures along with Williams. 
The firm's move to raise its inaugural fund comes after a recent broader sell-off in tech stocks that is likely to put pressure on private valuations. 
However, the world's largest investors including SoftBank, Tiger Global and Andreessen Horowitz are still betting on valuations recovering later this year riding on strong investor appetite for cryptocurrency and the so-called metaverse. 

Last month, Insight Partners raised $20 billion for its twelfth flagship fund, its largest fundraise to date, as it looked to ramp up investments in technology and software companies.
In January, venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz also raised $9 billion through three new funds to invest across startups in different sectors, amid a global funding boom as large investors back high-growth tech startups at a record pace.

430,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 12:53PM ET</span>","Exclusive-Nord Stream 2 owner considers insolvency after pipeline halt, sanctions -sources","By Aziz El Yaakoubi and Shariq Khan
(Reuters) -The Swiss-based company which built the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany is considering filing for insolvency, two sources familiar with the situation said, as it attempts to settle claims ahead of a U.S. sanction deadline for other entities to stop dealings with it.
The United States sanctioned Nord Stream 2 AG last week after Russia recognised two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine prior to its invasion of the country, which has prompted a wave of economic sanctions by the West.
Nord Stream 2 AG, which is registered in Switzerland and owned by Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), last year completed the $11 billion project which was designed to double the capacity to pump gas from Russia to Germany.
The two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks about a potential insolvency are confidential, said that Nord Stream 2 AG has been working with a financial adviser on clearing some of its liabilities and could formally begin insolvency proceedings in a Swiss court as soon as this week.
Nord Stream 2 AG did not comment on possible insolvency. Gazprom declined to comment.
Swiss newspaper Blick's website posted a video interview with Silvia Thalmann, director of economic affairs in the canton of Zug, where Nord Stream 2 AG is based. 
In an apparent confirmation of Nord Stream 2 insolvency when Thalmann was asked about job cuts at the company, she said: ""This is not a mass dismissal (of staff). A mass dismissal is only when the company continues to exist. In this case, however, it is a bankruptcy.""
She could not be reached for immediate comment outside business hours. Nord Stream 2 AG was also not immediately available by phone.
The 1,230 km (767 mile) pipeline had not begun commercial operations because it was pending certification in Germany, which last week put this process on hold as a result of the escalating Ukraine crisis.
The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control issued an executive order on Feb. 23 authorising ""the wind down of transactions involving Nord Stream 2 AG"" or ""any entity in which Nord Stream 2 AG owns, directly or indirectly, a 50 percent or greater interest"" by March 2.
Gazprom paid half the cost of building Nord Stream 2, with the remainder of the $11 billion pipeline project financed by British oil and gas major Shell (LON:RDSa), Austria's OMV, France's Engie and Germany's Uniper and Wintershall DEA. 
Shell, Engie, and Wintershall DEA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. OMV declined to comment.
A spokesperson for Uniper said the company does not currently have any such information when asked about a possible insolvency filing by Nord Stream 2 AG.
It was unclear if all entities related to Nord Stream 2 AG would be shut down or how Gazprom plans to proceed with the pipeline maintenance. 
Switzerland's Economy Minister Guy Parmelin said in an interview with Swiss radio service RTS on Monday that all Nord Stream staff, more than 140 employees, who worked for the company in the Swiss city of Zug had been fired.
Job cuts were confirmed on Tuesday by Nord Stream 2 AG, which said in a statement: ""Following the recent geopolitical developments leading to the imposition of US sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG, the company had to terminate contracts with employees. We very much regret this development"".

Germany, which gets half its gas from Russia, had backed Nord Stream 2 to diversify energy supplies for Europe, but the project faced opposition within the European Union and from the United States for increasing the region's gas dependence on Russia and allowing Moscow to reduce volumes through Ukraine, for which it has to pay a transit fee.
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last week, several large companies, including oil majors, said they would exit their Russian operations, including Shell, which said it will no longer be involved in Nord Stream 2 among other investments.

431,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 12:53PM ET</span>",World's largest container lines suspend shipping to Russia,"By Jonathan Saul, Stine Jacobsen and Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen
LONDON/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -The world's three biggest container lines on Tuesday temporarily suspended cargo shipments to and from Russia in response to Western sanctions on Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine, in a further blow to trade with the country.
Russia's assault on its neighbour, which Moscow says is a ""special operation"", is the biggest state-to-state invasion in Europe since World War Two.
Swiss-headquartered MSC, the world's biggest container shipping company by capacity, said in a customer advisory that as of March 1 it had introduced ""a temporary stoppage on all cargo bookings to/from Russia, covering all access areas including Baltics, Black Sea and Far East Russia”. 
""MSC will continue to accept and screen bookings for delivery of essential goods such as food, medical equipment and humanitarian goods,"" it said. 
Denmark's Maersk , which is the second biggest carrier after MSC, said separately it would temporarily halt all container shipping to and from Russia, also adding that the suspension covering all Russian ports, would not include foodstuffs, medical and humanitarian supplies.
""As the stability and safety of our operations is already being directly and indirectly impacted by sanctions, new Maersk bookings within ocean and inland to and from Russia will be temporarily suspended,"" the company said in a statement. 
France's CMA CGM, the world's third-biggest container line, later on Tuesday announced it had suspended all bookings to and from Russia until further notice, citing safety concerns.
The moves follow similar decisions already taken by Singapore-headquartered Ocean Network Express and Germany's Hapag Lloyd - effectively cutting Russia off from the world's leading container shipping companies, adding to freight challenges ahead.
For the past year the world has been struggling with supply chain bottlenecks caused by surging demand for retail goods transported on container ships and lockdowns related to the coronavirus pandemic. 
MSC said it would contact customers directly in respect of any Russia-related cargo that was already in transit.
""MSC has been closely monitoring the advice from governments about new sanctions,"" the privately owned group added. 
In a coordinated response, the United States, European countries and others have made the unusual move of targeting Russia's central bank with financial sanctions and put limits on cross-border transactions by the country's largest lenders.
Maersk owns 31% of Russian port operator Global Ports, which runs six terminals in Russia and two in Finland. Global Ports' shareholders also include Russian state nuclear company Rosatom and Russian businessman Sergey Shiskarev.
""With Global Ports we are looking at how to comply with the ever evolving sanctions and restrictions and preparing possible next steps,"" Maersk said.

Maersk operates container shipping routes to St Petersburg and Kaliningrad in the Baltic Sea, Novorossiysk in the Black Sea, and to Vladivostok and Vostochny on Russia's east coast.
The Copenhagen-based company has around 500 employees in Russia. Last week, it temporarily halted all port calls in Ukraine, where it has some 60 employees in Odessa.

432,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 12:41PM ET</span>","Russia reinstates Twitter slowdown, says Meta, Google are 'instigators of war'","MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia cracked down on social media companies on Tuesday, reinstating a slowdown of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) traffic on computers, as a foreign ministry official accused Meta, Google and other Western tech giants of inciting war.
On the sixth day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a Russian armoured column bore down on the capital Kyiv and Russian forces fired rocket barrages into the centre of the second largest city Kharkiv, while at home Moscow stepped up efforts to control the narrative.
State communications regulator Roskomnadzor reimposed a slowdown on Twitter's loading speeds on computers, a measure it had lifted in May, accusing the U.S. company of failing to take down what it said were fake posts about Russia's ""special operation"" in Ukraine. 
Twitter declined to comment. 
Russia has been impeding Twitter on mobile devices for almost a year, part of a wider campaign for internet control that critics say threatens individual and corporate freedom.
Moscow has partially restricted Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) access, too.
This occurred, Facebook's owner Meta Platforms Inc said, after it refused a government request to stop independent fact-checking of several Russian state media outlets, many of which have faced restrictions in Ukraine and around the world as Western nations seek to stifle the Kremlin's messaging. 
Roskomnadzor said on Tuesday it had written to Meta demanding the immediate removal of restrictions on state-backed media outlets RT and Sputnik on Facebook and Instagram. 
Anna Belkina, RT's deputy editor-in-chief, said no evidence was being provided of inaccuracies in RT reporting. She said the Western establishment seemed terrified of alternative perspectives.
""What they fail to realise is that it is their own echo chamber that seeds the public mistrust that they have so long lamented. They will reap what they sow,"" she said.
'INSTIGATORS OF WAR'
Oleg Gavrilov, deputy head of the foreign ministry's information and press department, said the behaviour of primarily U.S. tech giants, singling out Meta and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, was unacceptable. 
""Hostile propaganda activities are being carried out openly on their social platforms, Russian sources of information are being blocked, access to domestic media is being massively restricted,"" Interfax news agency quoted him as saying. 
Gavrilov said a system should be created to ""hold foreign instigators of war against Russia accountable"" to strengthen Russian security. 
Google and Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The two companies are among a handful of foreign internet firms facing possible punitive measures in Russia after failing to open local offices and take other measures required by a communications law, after a deadline to do so expired on Monday. 
EXITING RUSSIA?
Facebook and Twitter were slow to load for some users on Tuesday, and Facebook was unavailable on some devices, underlining an improvement in Moscow's blocking capabilities since failed attempts to restrict access to messaging app Telegram in 2018.
The escalating pressure on foreign tech firms has increased expectations that companies may leave the Russian market - either through ejection by Moscow or voluntarily under pressure from Western governments. 

Industry consultant John Strand said the time when global companies could focus on profit and remain passive to aggression and autocracy had long since passed. He said Russia views the likes of Facebook and Google as a threat to its control over communication.
""A war in Ukraine and social media are not the best cocktail nowadays,"" Strand told Reuters by email. ""Western companies must make a choice: do they want to do business in Russia under the existing and future conditions or will they stop operating there?""

(Reuters) -European stocks tumbled on Tuesday, kicking off March on a dour note on weak earnings reports and jitters over the Ukraine crisis as Russia raged on with its attack after ceasefire talks between the two nations failed to reach a breakthrough.
Oil prices were back above $100 per barrel and gold, bonds and the dollar surged as investors fled to safe havens. 
Italy's financials-heavy benchmark sank 4.1% as banks lost 6.8%, while a slide in luxury names saw France's CAC 40 drop 3.9% and hit over five-month lows. 
The indexes deepened recent losses as Russian rained down rockets in Ukrainian cities after ceasefire talks between Russia and its southern neighbour failed to reach a breakthrough on Monday.
Stock markets across the globe plunged on Monday after the West imposed tough sanctions on Russia, including preventing its central bank from using its $630 billion foreign reserve war chest.
""For Europe, the downside risks exceed upside at this point because the conflict is still raging on... Sentiment is still going to remain down in the dumps,"" said Craig Erlam, senior analyst at Oanda. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index dropped 1.7%, but a rally in healthcare and miners helped limit losses. 
The travel and leisure sector dropped the most, down 7.5% after disappointing earnings from betting group Flutter.
""The combination of soaring oil prices and energy costs combined with the impact of sanctions that are being imposed and closing of airspace are all significant headwinds as far as airlines and travel are concerned,"" Erlam said. 
Energy major Shell (LON:RDSa) and shipping firm Maersk slipped on cutting Russia exposure and halting operations, respectively.
Shares in pandemic winners including German online fashion retailer Zalando and meal-kit delivery firm HelloFresh dropped 9.6% and 7.8% respectively after downbeat profit forecasts.
Germany's DAX index slid 3.9%. 
Europe Inc profits are expected to have risen 67.4% in the fourth quarter of 2021, data from Refinitiv I/B/E/S showed on Tuesday, as higher oil and gas prices boost the energy sector.
Meanwhile, IHS Markit's survey showed momentum in euro zone manufacturing growth waned slightly last month but activity was still strong and supply chain constraints eased.
German chemicals maker Covestro gained 2.3% after saying it had more than doubled its 2021 core profit and expected upbeat earnings for 2022. 

Rheinmetall topped the STOXX 600 to extend gains on the prospect of a big boost to military spending in Germany. Its shares have surged close to 70% in the past six sessions.
Drugmaker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) rose 1.8% on a $760 mln deal for an antibody-based drug with Swiss firm Neurimmune.

Moody's said Moscow's move to prohibit residents from transferring foreign currency abroad or servicing any foreign-currency-denominated loans from Tuesday onwards reflected an increasing lack of predictability in its decisions.
""Russia's ban on servicing new foreign-currency debt is credit negative,"" Moody's said in a report. 
""These developments will further increase adverse financial ramifications for the domestic economy and financial sector, raising the likelihood of further negative credit implications in the coming days and weeks."" 

Moody's put its Baa3 Russia rating on a downgrade review on Friday in the wake of the country's invasion of Ukraine. Hours later S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) cut its equivalent investment grade Russian rating to 'junk' and immediately put it on another downgrade warning.
Major steps such as sanctioning Russia's central bank to prevent it deploying its huge stockpile of currency reserve, and banning its top banks from the international SWIFT network have since followed, raising fears of a possible default.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Stellantis aims to double revenue to 300 billion euros ($335 billion) a year by 2030 and keep profit margins high, as it steps up efforts to roll out electric versions of its cars, profitable Jeep SUVs and RAM pickup trucks.
The world's No.4 carmaker said in a strategy update on Tuesday it would have 75 battery electric vehicle (EV) models on the market and sell five million EVs a year by 2030. 
Like other major carmakers, Stellantis faces major challenges in turning its product range from traditional combustion engines to zero-emission models and developing self-driving technology, all while fighting for market share with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and a number of other electric-only startups. 
""We are proud to be a legacy automaker,"" Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said during a presentation to analysts and reporters in Amsterdam. ""Being a legacy automaker shows our ability to design and produce safe products at scale."" 
""Others still have to prove it,"" he added. 
Stellantis, born last year from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA, said it would adopt an ""asset-light"" model for its lagging Chinese business - keeping only one fully-owned plant and opening up other manufacturing capacity to third parties to lower fixed costs. 
It is aiming for Chinese revenues to reach 20 billion euros by 2030. Revenues for ""China, India and Asia Pacific"" totalled 3.9 billion euros last year.
Still, that would mean less than 7% of the group's total revenues expected in 2030 from the world's largest car market.
Milan-listed shares in Stellantis closed down 6.9%, underperforming a 4.1% drop on Italy's blue chip index in a Ukraine crisis-hit trading session. 
The carmaker expects EVs to make up 100% of its sales in Europe and 50% in the United States by 2030, all while expanding in hydrogen fuel cells for vans and heavy-duty trucks, investing in EV software and using its partnership with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Waymo to develop self-driving delivery vehicles.
""We are moving, and moving fast, to become a mobility tech company,"" Tavares said. 
It is targetting revenues from its new data business, an increasingly important growth area for automakers, to reach 9 billion euros by the end of the decade, with a gross margin of up to 70%.
The carmaker expects to hit a target of 5 billion euros of synergies from its founding merger by the end of 2024, one year earlier than previously targeted.
It also expects a third of its sales to be online by 2030 and for revenue from luxury and premium car sales to quadruple by then. It aims to cut carbon emissions by 50% from 2021 levels by the start of the next decade. 
Earlier in the day, Tavares announced the creation of a task force to conform with sanctions against Russia and monitor its staff in Ukraine.
Leading carmakers, airlines and banks have cut shipments, ended partnerships and condemned Russia's actions as President Vladimir Putin moved into the sixth day of a military offensive on Ukraine.
Tavares said he hoped very soon to announce a deal with the Italian government on a battery plant the group wants to build in the country, after Rome pledged last month to support it with 369 million euros of public money.
The battery plant in Termoli, southern Italy, would be Stellantis' third in Europe, after ones previously announced in France and Germany, and would be converted from an existing combustion engine plant. 

Tavares said he did not expect the global semiconductor chip shortage that has caused carmakers worldwide to slash production to end in 2022.

Investing.com – Domino’s stock (NYSE:DPZ) stock gained 2.5% Tuesday after the company overcame supply chain challenges and higher inflation in commodities to grow its revenue and profit in the fourth quarter.
The company also announced top level changes. Its operating head Russell Weiner takes over as CEO from Ritch Allison starting in May. Weiner joined the company as chief marketing officer in 2008 and has been the chief operating officer for Domino's U.S. since July 2020.
Sales in 2020 had benefited from an extra week that contributed over $88 million to revenue in the fourth quarter of the year.
According to Domino’s, global retail sales in the quarter ended Jan. 2 rose 9%, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency and the 53rd week. The company had global net store growth of 1,204 stores in 2021, comprising 205 net U.S. store openings and 999 internationally on a net basis. This led to higher supply chain and global royalty revenue for the pizza-maker.
Operating margins suffered due to inflation in cost of raw materials and ingredients.
Advertising incentives of $6.5 million related to promotions hurt revenue. Total revenue in the quarter was $13.4 billion and fell short of estimates. Cost of sales rose 2% on higher raw material prices.
Quarterly net income rose 2.5% to $3.8 million, driven primarily by a pre-tax unrealized gain on the company's investment in DPC Dash, the master franchisee that owns and operates Domino's Pizza stores in China.
The company does not provide quarterly or annual earnings guidance although on a two-three-year basis, it expects global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, to come in at 6% to 10%.

The Singapore-based company announced a loss per share of 88 cents on revenue of $3.22 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated a per-share loss of 84 cents on revenue of $3.03 billion.
Sea stock plunged 12% Tuesday.
Sea's e-commerce revenue climbed 89% to $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, while digital entertainment revenue was $1.4 billion, up 104.1% year-on-year. In addition, financial services saw an enormous leap in revenue to $197.5 million, up 711.1% year on year.
For the full year of 2022, the company expects bookings for digital entertainment to be between $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion. 
Revenue for e-commerce is expected to be between $8.9 billion and $9.1 billion. In addition, digital financial services revenue is forecast to be between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion. 
Sea said its guidance considers that many economies are reopening, and they have observed some moderation in online activities and fluctuations in user engagement. In addition, it acknowledged that its Free Fire game is currently unavailable in the Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Play and iOS app stores in India after being banned.

However, more recently, the company has been facing rising inflation, labor shortages and higher commodity costs forcing the company to raise prices for its offerings.
Separately, the company on Tuesday reported weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter sales and profit as the world's largest pizza chain took a hit from a shortage in delivery driving staff due to a surge in Omicron cases at the end of the quarter.

Shares of the company fell as much as 9% to $392.45, but reversed course to trade up nearly 3% as analysts said Weiner would make for a good replacement.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -MSCI Inc, which ranks companies and countries on their environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance, said on Tuesday it downgraded Russia and Belarus in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
The move could add to pressure on western asset managers to move away from Russian stocks and debt, analysts said, although few ESG-focused funds own much in Russia.
MSCI said it cut Russia to ""B"" from ""BBB"" and Belarus to ""B"" from ""BB"" with immediate effect. Ratings range from ""AAA,"" the highest, to ""CCC,"" the lowest, it said, adding that both had a negative outlook.
""We are monitoring the situation closely and believe there is still significant downside risk to Russia's ESG Government Rating. It is possible that further developments could yet drive an additional downgrade,"" MSCI said in a statement.
Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and Mutual Fund Research for CFRA Research, said the downgrades would likely have little impact on most ESG funds ""given the low current exposure to Russia compared to China"" or other larger markets.
Only about 3% of BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)'s iShares ESG MSCI EM Leaders ETF holdings are in Russia, for instance, Rosenbluth said.

Asked about the downgrades, BlackRock did not comment on what impact there could be on its index funds. In a statement sent by a company spokesperson, BlackRock said it is consulting with regulators, index providers and other market participants ""to help ensure our clients can exit their positions in Russian securities"" where allowed.

Binance, the world's biggest crypto exchange, has also said it would not freeze all Russian accounts, after Ukraine requested major crypto exchanges for a complete ban.

Western countries including the United States and Britain have imposed sweeping financial sanctions on Russia for invading Ukraine, with major Russian banks shut out of the SWIFT international payments system. 
Trading volumes between the Russian rouble and the Tether cryptocurrency spiked sharply on Monday, indicating rising interest in crypto among Russians after the Western sanctions took a toll on the local currency.

LONDON (Reuters) -Asset managers including France's Amundi and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), Britain's HSBC and Switzerland's Pictet have frozen Russia-focused equity funds totalling over $3 billion in assets, as markets seize up following sanctions on Russia. 
Russian assets have gone into freefall due to the crippling restrictions, and Moscow has placed temporary curbs on foreigners seeking to exit them. 
Asset managers typically only suspend funds in exceptional circumstances, including when assets are hard to value, in order to ensure investors are treated equally.
Pictet said in a notice to shareholders dated Feb. 28 that it had suspended its Russian equities fund ""in light of the current and ever-evolving circumstances associated with Ukraine/Russia situation, the current political situation and liquidity constraints"". 
It said it would reopen the fund ""as soon as the market conditions allow"".
The fund has $637 million in assets, according to Morningstar data.
DWS and HSBC suspended Russia exchange-traded funds -- funds which track an index.
Amundi said it suspended three equity funds with exposure to eastern Europe, and BNP Paribas said it was not calculating a valuation for its Russia fund while the Moscow exchange was shut.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said Western sanctions and Russian restrictions curbed the ability of its London-listed Russian securities investment trust to pay dividends.
Barings said it valued Moscow stocks in its emerging EMEA opportunities investment trust at zero.
British asset manager Liontrust suspended dealing in its Russia fund, and Swedish fund managers Swedbank, Carnegie, East Capital and Handelsbanken froze their Russia-exposed funds.
Sweden's Pension Agency said it stopped buy orders in four Russia funds in its pension fund marketplace platform, as it assesses whether the funds are suitable for ethical and risk reasons. 

Sweden has a system which allows pension savers to allocate a portion of their state pension savings to a number of approved funds.
Nordic lender Nordea went beyond equities and said it had decided to exclude all Russian investments, including government bonds, equities and bonds from its funds.

LONDON (Reuters) -SWIFT said on Tuesday it was waiting to see which banks authorities want disconnected from its global financial messaging system as sanctions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine are rolled out.
The European Union, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Britain agreed on Saturday to ensure that selected Russian banks are removed from SWIFT to harm their ability to operate globally.
""We will always comply with applicable sanctions laws,"" SWIFT said in a statement on Tuesday.
""We are engaging with these authorities to understand which entities will be subject to these new measures and will disconnect them once we receive legal instruction to do so.""
Banks use Belgian-based SWIFT to send millions of instructions daily supporting trillions of dollars in payments annually to underpin international trade.
The Council of EU states, which is expected to publish a list of the banks affected, was unable to comment immediately.
The world's financial system is severing ties with Russia and its banks to stop Russian companies raising funds on foreign markets.
EU-based securities settlement house Euroclear said on Tuesday it will no longer accept the rouble as a settlement currency and it was disabling its account with ING Bank in Moscow immediately.
Trading platform Tradeweb said it has suspended trading in securities affected by Russian sanctions.
Market sources said Bloomberg had flagged Russian sovereign bonds as well as securities related to Russian banks VTB and Sberbank with a warning label saying ""sanctions apply to this security"" though trading continued.
The London Stock Exchange said on Tuesday it will stop trading in two global depository receipts (GDRs) for Russia's VTB Bank after Britain's financial regulator suspended them in response to sanctions.
However, listings on the LSE in Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) and Sberbank were still trading and down sharply on the day.
Denmark's Saxo Bank said it had halted trading pairs of the Russian rouble with other currencies such as the dollar and euro.

Major securities settlement houses, along with Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) in Frankfurt, and ICE (NYSE:ICE) and Nasdaq in New York, announced curbs on Russian trading on Monday.

TORONTO (Reuters) -Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) and Bank of Montreal (BMO) joined their Canadian rivals in beating analysts' expectations for first-quarter profits on Tuesday with both banks flagging margin improvements on the back of expected interest rate hikes. 
Scotiabank benefited from improving earnings in its international unit and a recovery in business lending at home, while BMO saw a surge in capital markets profits, with these positives helping offset declines in wealth management earnings.
Scotiabank, Canada's No. 3 lender, expects ""significant"" interest rate increases in the Pacific Alliance nations that make up its international unit, particularly Mexico and Chile, to continue to lift earnings for the rest of this year, executives said on an analyst call. 
The lender already saw net interest margins in its international business, which accounted for 18% of revenues during the quarter, rise seven basis points from the previous quarter. 
Margins in Canada are also set to improve in coming quarters, benefiting from higher central bank rates. The Bank of Canada is expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday. 
BMO, Canada's fourth-biggest bank, sees net interest margins excluding trading ""widen modestly"" in the second half of this year, executives said on an analyst call. 
Canada's major banks have reported strong results so far, with Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF) also reporting better-than-expected profits last week.. Toronto-Dominion Bank, the only Big-Six bank left, reports on Thursday.
Scotiabank reported adjusted income per share rose to C$2.15 in the three months ended Jan. 31, compared with C$1.88 a year earlier and analysts' C$2.05 average estimate.
BMO's adjusted earnings per share increased to C$3.89 from C$3.06 a year earlier, beating analysts' C$3.28 per share forecast.
In contrast to rivals including Royal Bank and National Bank, wealth management PTPP earnings fell at both Scotiabank and BMO, with growth in assets offset by higher expenses. 
Scotiabank shares rose 1% to C$92.77 in early trading, while BMO climbed 1.55% to C$146.98. The Toronto stock benchmark added 0.4%. 
BMO posted a 30% jump in capital markets pre-tax, pre-provision (PTPP) earnings, helped by strong advisory and underwriting revenues. Scotiabank reported more modest 2% growth in its capital markets PTPP earnings, which nevertheless beat expectations. 

Scotiabank's expenses remained flat from a year ago, while BMO's increased 7% year-on-year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Cartier sued  Tiffany & Co  (NYSE:TIF) on Monday, accusing its luxury rival of stealing trade secrets concerning its high-end jewelry from an employee it lured away in December, in a sign competition in the fast-growing jewelry category is heating up.
According to a complaint filed in a New York state court in Manhattan, Tiffany hired an underqualified junior manager away to learn more about Cartier's ""High Jewelry"" collection, where pieces typically cost $50,000 to $10 million.
Cartier, a unit of Switzerland's Richemont SA, called Tiffany's hiring of Megan Marino a desperate bid to revive its own high jewelry unit after it was left in ""disarray"" following several departures, reflecting Tiffany's ""disturbing culture of misappropriating competitive information.""
According to court papers, Tiffany appeared to pin ultimate blame on Marino by firing her after just five weeks.
In an affidavit accompanying the complaint, Marino said Tiffany was ""more interested in hiring me as a source of information than as a High Jewelry manager.""
Cartier also accused Tiffany, owned by luxury goods group LVMH, of letting a recently hired former Cartier executive work on a high jewelry project called the ""Blue Book"" despite her six-month non-compete agreement.
Contacted by Reuters, Tiffany said in a statement: ""We deny the baseless allegations and will vigorously defend ourselves.""
The lawsuit seeks an injunction requiring that Tiffany return and not use stolen trade secrets, plus unspecified damages.
Cartier said in a statement: ""Cartier fully respects the rights of competitors to pursue their commercial objectives. In this case, however, Tiffany’s commercial ambition crossed the line between the ordinary course of business and unfair competition.""
Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said he believed LVMH was indeed in the process of becoming a contender for category leadership against Richemont. 
""Branded jewelry – after the Tiffany acquisition – has transformed from an oligopoly to a duopoly. Tiffany has plenty of opportunity to revive its fortunes,"" Solca said in an emailed statement. 
On Jan. 19, Richemont said strong demand for jewelry and watches following a trough earlier in the coronavirus pandemic boosted quarterly sales by 32%.

Sales at Richemont's jewelry brands Cartier, Buccellati and Van Cleef & Arpels rose 38%.
The case is Cartier v Tiffany and Co, New York State Supreme Court, New York County.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producer  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) on Tuesday outlined a plan to raise buybacks and expand oil production through 2026, adding to long-term supply amid a tight market. 
The announcement, part of Chevron's previously scheduled investor outlook, comes at a time when oil supplies are strained and prices are jumping with countries putting sanctions on oil exporter Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
Chevron is ""relatively less exposed than others in our industry"" to the conflict, which played no influence in a decision to raise output by more than 3% per year through 2026, Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said. 
The second-largest U.S. oil producer plans to pump ""well over"" 3.5 million barrels of oil and gas per day (boepd) by 2026, Wirth said, up from 3.1 million boepd last year.
Chevron also raised its forecast for operating cash flow through 2026, benefiting from cost cuts and a recent surge in energy prices.
The company now expects to buy back between $5 billion and $10 billion of its shares every year, from $3 billion to $5 billion before. The program would be sustainable for five years with oil prices at $50 per barrel, Wirth said.
The buyback increase was ""ahead of expectations"" and ""is the main positive"" key takeaway from Chevron's annual update to investors, according to analysts Giacomo Romeo and Jamie Franklin from equity research firm Jefferies. 
Major oil companies are responding to a jump in profits this year from higher oil and gas prices by giving back more cash to shareholders, many of whom have been frustrated by years of low returns.
So far, most shale operators have signaled that they plan to put capital returns above output growth, even as U.S. oil prices crossed $100 per barrel earlier this week.
""We're aiming to grow cash flow and return more of it to shareholders, leveraging our strengths to deliver lower carbon energy to a growing world,"" Wirth said in a statement.
Chevron maintained its prior forecast for annual upstream spending at between $15 billion and $17 billion through 2026 and is expecting to cut operating expenses per barrel by more than 10% from last year's levels. 
The company's shares were up about 4% in early trading.
Chevron, which on Monday announced a $3 billion purchase of biodiesel maker Renewable Energy Group (NASDAQ:REGI) Inc, also reaffirmed its targets for lowering carbon intensity of its operations and growing new energy businesses.

Chevron holds a 15% interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), which exported 1.1 million bpd of crude from Kazakhstan and 0.2 million bpd from Russia in 2021. It also has a 50% stake in Tengizchevroil (TCO), which is developing the Tengiz and Korolev crude oil fields in western Kazakhstan. 
""We have had no indications from any government that operations of the Caspian pipeline consortium are likely to be interrupted,"" Wirth said. ""Beyond the Caspian pipeline, we really have no other exposure to Russia and none to Ukraine.""

That way, Porsche SE, which is controlled by the Porsche and Piech family, could rake in around 2.2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) at current market prices without losing the majority of Volkswagen's voting rights.
Such a move, which according to the sources is one funding option under discussion in addition to taking on debt, would help Porsche SE, Volkswagen's top shareholder, to pay for the stake in Porsche AG it is set to get under the listing plans.
Under a framework agreement unveiled last week, Porsche SE will be able to buy 25% plus one ordinary share in a Porsche AG listing, which would cost around 12 billion euros assuming a 90 billion valuation.
A spokesperson for Porsche SE said that settling on a specific funding package made no sense at this stage since several parameters of the potential transaction, which still lacks a firm decision by the companies, are unclear.
""In principle, however, Porsche SE has great financing potential due to its excellent equity ratio and positive net liquidity. We have prepared rock-solid financing plans in order to be well-positioned for the IPO in different price scenarios.""
Volkswagen declined to comment.
Porsche SE currently holds 53.3% of Volkswagen's common stock, which amounts to a 31.4% equity stake.

While Porsche SE stands to get 3.6 billion euros via a special dividend Volkswagen plans to pay from any planned listing of Porsche AG, it would still leave around 8 billion the holding group needs to pay for the rest.

Mar 1 (Reuters) - Startup Our Next Energy said a new $65 million funding round will enable it to accelerate development of a long-range battery and begin evaluating potential sites next quarter for its first U.S. battery plant.
Michigan-based ONE in December said a prototype of its new high-energy Gemini battery, retrofitted in a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model S sedan, delivered more than 750 miles of range between charges — far in excess of the best production electric vehicles on the market.
The U.S. plant initially will build ONE's new Aries battery, which uses an improved version of current lithium iron phosphate cells that eliminate such high-cost materials as cobalt and nickel.
ONE also is ramping up research and development on the Gemini battery, which will incorporate two different types of battery cells, including one with an advanced chemistry that has much higher energy density, enabling longer range.

The new round was led by existing investor BMW iVentures and joined by Coatue Management, a New York-based private equity firm with deep investments in sustainable transportation, including Tesla Inc, competitors Rivian Automotive Inc and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV), and battery materials startup Sila Nanotechnologies.

Investing.com –  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock surged 6.4% Tuesday after the company said its 2022 revenue will be around at least fourfold higher compared to a year ago, finally addressing concerns around the marketability of its COVID-19 vaccine.
The company has also developed an Omicron-specific vaccine and said it should begin manufacturing the doses by March-end.
The company is now guiding for annual revenue of $4 billion-$5 billion, up from $1.1 billion in 2021. A big chunk of the revenue will be through vaccine product sales, the company said. Novavax said it is keeping the second half of the year to pursue the full approval of its COVID-19 vaccine.
Held back due to manufacturing issues, Novavax was late by more than a year in bringing its COVID-19 vaccine to the market and filed with the FDA for emergency use authorization only late January.
The company had earlier forecast to deliver 2 billion COVID-19 shots around the world in 2022 but was silent Monday on the quantity it expects to hand over in the current quarter, Reuters said.  
According to the news agency, the company has completed delivery of around 9 million vaccine doses to Indonesia, 6 million to Australia, 2 million to South Korea, and expects to supply 69 million doses to Europe in the first half of this year.
Revenue in the fourth quarter fell 20% to $222 million owing to much higher grants received from the U.S. government and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations for its Covid vaccine in the same period last year. The Coalition is a global partnership to develop vaccines to stop future epidemics.
Royalty receipts rose in the fourth quarter as license partners in South Korea and Indonesia booked revenue from sales of the vaccine.
Adjusted net loss per share was $11.18 and worse than estimated, as expenses on research and development (R&D) and general and administrative (G&A) purposes more than doubled."

U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger in Nashville on Monday declined to dismiss the case, allowing investors to proceed with allegations Clover lied about the source of its growth and the existence of a U.S. Department of Justice probe into the company.
Representatives for Clover did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Tuesday.
Palihapitiya has been dubbed the ""SPAC King"" for his run of so-called ""blank check"" firms, which are empty shells of cash that are raised for the specific purpose of merging with a private target within two years of the SPAC being listed. The private company goes public through the process. 
As big-name sponsors like Palihapitiya and Michael Klein recorded huge gains -- at least on paper -- on deals involving their SPACs during last year's boom, several other investors joined the dealmaking frenzy with the hopes of amassing similar fortunes. 
However, the SPAC bonanza fizzed as quickly as it started. A regulatory crackdown led by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, coupled with the poor financial performance of a majority of SPACs, spooked investors and triggered a huge selloff. 
Clover, which sells Medicare-backed insurance plans, went public through a $3.7 billion deal with a Palihapitiya-backed SPAC in October 2020.
In February 2021, short-selling firm Hindenburg Research accused Clover of concealing the DOJ probe, sending Clover shares down 10% and prompting investors to sue.

Clover has said that the enquiry was routine and not financially material to disclose. The SEC has launched an investigation into Hindenburg's claims.
The investor lawsuit seeks damages for investors who owned shares between October 6, 2020, when the deal with Clover was announced, and February 3, 2021, when Hindenburg published the report on Clover.

PARIS (Reuters) -French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire declared an ""all-out economic and financial war"" against Russia to bring down the its economy as punishment for invading Ukraine, before rowing back on language he later said was inappropriate.
The United States and its allies have imposed sanctions on Russia's central bank, oligarchs and officials, including President Vladimir Putin himself, and barred some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments system.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire described the sanctions packages as proving ""extremely effective"".
""We're waging an all-out economic and financial war on Russia,"" Le Maire told France Info radio. ""We will cause the collapse of the Russian economy.""
Le Maire later told French news agency AFP he had misspoken and that the term ""war"" was not compatible with France's efforts to de-escalate tensions surrounding the Ukraine conflict.
""We are not in a battle against the Russian people,"" the minister added.
In a matter of weeks, Russia has turned from a lucrative bet on surging oil prices to an uninvestable market with a central bank hamstrung by sanctions, major banks shut out of the international payments system and capital controls choking off money flows.
On Tuesday, Russia said it was placing temporary curbs on foreigners seeking to exit Russian assets, putting the brakes on an accelerating investor exodus driven by the sanctions.

Le Maire's initial remarks drew an angry riposte from Russia's former president and prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, who is now the deputy Chair of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.
""Watch your tongue, gentlemen! And don’t forget that in human history, economic wars quite often turned into real ones,"" Medvedev tweeted.

Investing.com – Kohls stock (NYSE:KSS) traded 3% higher in premarket trading on Tuesday after the retailer’s 2022 guidance came in ahead of estimates amid signs its efforts to attract a younger audience are gaining traction.
Higher margins in the fourth quarter reflected a successful management of supply chain shortages by the company. Established brands like Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger and popular labels like Sephora, Cole Haan and Eddie Bauer drew in shoppers.
“In 2021, we delivered all-time record earnings per share, significantly ahead of our expectations. Our operating margin of 8.6% exceeded our 2023 goal two years ahead of plan, a direct result of our efforts to restructure the business to be more profitable,” CEO Michelle Gass said in a statement.
The company kept up with its plan to roll out 850 ‘Sephora at Kohl’s’ stores by 2023, an attempt to position the company as a beauty destination. At these stores, customers can explore an assortment of prestige makeup, skincare, hair, and fragrance brands.
According to Reuters, the company offered lower promotions and limited some of its weaker private label brands to shield profits from soaring freight expenses during the quarter.
The company has doubled its annual dividend while also proposing to buy back shares worth up to $3 billion. This includes a $1 billion exercise in 2022, of which $500 million could be through an accelerated program in the second quarter.
Kohl’s expects adjusted profit per share of $7 to $7.50 in the year while revenue is seen growing 2% to 3%. In the recent year, the company posted an adjusted EPS of $7.33 on revenue of over $19 billion.
Fourth-quarter total revenue rose about 6% to $6.5 billion. Adjusted EPS fell by 2 cents to $2.20.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy plans to set aside more than 4 billion euros ($4.6 billion) until 2030 to boost domestic chip manufacturing as it seeks to attract more investment from tech companies such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), a draft decree seen by Reuters showed on Tuesday.
The government is trying to persuade the U.S. group to spend billions of euros on an advanced chipmaking plant in Italy that uses innovative technologies to weave full chips.
Rome is ready to offer Intel public money and other favourable terms to fund part of the overall investment, which is expected to be worth around 8 billion euros ($9 billion) over 10 years, Reuters reported in December.
To boost domestic chipmaking, Italy is also in talks with French-Italian STMicroelectronics, Taiwanese-controlled MEMC Electronic Materials Inc and Israeli  Tower Semiconductor  (NASDAQ:TSEM), which is set to be bought by Intel.
Negotiations with Intel are complex as the U.S. group has tabled very tough demands, a government source involved in the talks told Reuters.
To clinch a deal with Intel, Rome is also relying on new funding rules for innovative semiconductor facilities announced last month by the European Commission under so-called Chips Act. 
Brussels has made available 15 billion euros in additional public and private investment by 2030, on top of 30 billion euros of public investments already planned from NextGenerationEU, Horizon Europe and national budgets.
Intel said in September it could invest as much as $95 billion in Europe over the next decade.
Under the plan, the U.S. group has chosen the east German city of Magdeburg as the site for a new multibillion-euro European chip factory, a person familiar with matter told Reuters on Feb. 26. 
As part of an 8 billion euro package to support the economy and curb surging energy bills, Italy plans to allocate 150 million euros in 2022 and 500 million euros per year from 2023 until 2030, the decree showed.
The Italian government will promote ""research and development of microprocessor technology and investments in new industrial applications of innovative technologies,"" the legislation added.
Rome aims to use the funding also to convert existing industrial sites and favour the construction of new plants in Italy.
Chipmakers are scrambling to boost output after explosive demand for consumer electronics such as smartphones and computers resulting from the work-from-home trend during the COVID-19 pandemic led.

Meanwhile EU countries are eager to reduce their dependence on semiconductor supplies from China and the United States after recent supply chain problems.

The company said the environment will remain robust for finance and HR transformation initiatives and it was thus expecting yearly subscription revenue to be $5.54 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, up 22%.
“We are also raising our fiscal 2023 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 18.5%,” Chief Financial Officer Barbara Larson said in a statement.
The company’s subscription revenue grew over 22% in the fourth quarter and it closed the year with a total subscription revenue backlog at about $13 billion, the 27% growth reflecting notable visibility into future sales.
The company’s stock had suffered a hammering in November when it said its subscription revenue will rise 21%. The outlook had then disappointed given it was the same pace it had grown by in the third quarter, and not materially different.

OSLO (Reuters) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine threatens global food supplies, Norwegian fertiliser maker Yara International (OTC:YARIY) said on Tuesday, adding that the international community needed to reduce its dependence on Russian raw materials for agriculture.
Ukraine and Russia are both major exporters of some of the world's most basic foodstuffs, together accounting for about 29% of global wheat exports, 19% of world corn supplies and 80% of world sunflower oil exports.
But Russia also exports crop nutrients as well as natural gas, which is critical for producing nitrogen-based fertilisers. Yara said that in total, 25% of the European supply of the key crop nutrients nitrogen, potash and phosphate come from Russia.
""With the geopolitical conditions out of balance, the biggest sources of raw material to Europe's food production are being subject to limitations, and there are no short-term alternatives,"" Yara said in a statement.
The Norwegian company, which is one of the world's biggest fertiliser producers, supplies Ukraine's agricultural sector and is a big buyer of raw materials, such as phosphate and potash, from Russia, which also supplies Europe's nitrogen fertilisers plants with natural gas.
David Beasley, Executive Director of the World Food Programme (WFP), said last week that war in Ukraine would have a dramatic impact on the organisation's ability to reach the 120 million people it feeds, adding that food, fuel and shipping costs would ""skyrocket"" in what he described in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post as ""an absolute catastrophe"".
Wheat futures have soared in recent days on concerns that Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which began on Feb. 24 and which Moscow is calling a ""special operation"" will continue to disrupt grain shipments from the Black Sea region.
""One potential consequence is that only the most privileged part of the world population gets access to enough food,"" Yara said, adding that while high prices may have a short-term positive impact on profit, they would mean an unsustainable food system, leading to starvation and conflict in the long term.

""It is therefore crucial that the international community come together and work to secure world food production and reduce dependency on Russia, even though the number of alternatives today is limited,"" Yara said.
Fertiliser prices rose sharply in the final months of 2021, tracking soaring natural gas costs. This is leading in turn to higher food prices, which could lead to famine for the most vulnerable, Yara warned in October.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The cyberattack on a  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp supplier that brought the automaker's domestic production to a halt shows how more vulnerable small firms can pose a big threat that Japan needs to do more to address, cybersecurity specialists said.
No information was available about who was behind the attack at supplier Kojima Industries Corp nor the motive, but it came just after Japan joined Western allies in clamping down on Russia after it invaded Ukraine. It was unclear if the attack was related.
The cyberattack on Kojima exposed the fragility of smaller companies that may have less sophisticated technical systems, said Takamichi Saito, a professor and Director of the Cybersecurity Laboratory (NYSE:LH) at Tokyo's Meiji University. 
""The big companies are pretty advanced with their measures, but a lot of their sub-companies and sub-sub companies aren't. Put that together with Japan's shift to manufacturing, and there just aren't enough technical people to keep up - and within companies, the IT sections don't have clout.""
Cybersecurity has emerged as a key area of concern in Japan, where government critics say responses to hacking threats have been hampered by a fractured approach.
At smaller companies in particular, computer systems have been often adopted piecemeal by individual firms, and have taken longer to replace.
""Basically you can't get at any of the larger companies directly, so you aim for one of the suppliers at their edges, and attacks have been increasing lately,"" said Yoshihito Takata, a manager at cybersecurity provider BroadBand Security Inc.
""These sorts of attacks don't just take place from 9 to 5 on weekdays, it's 24-hours a day, 365 days a year, from all around the world. So there's limits to what one company alone can do.""
Toyota declined to comment on whether it had detected early signs of a potential cyberattack. 
Smaller companies need to have a better grasp of what is needed for security, and that's where Japan most lags behind its overseas peers, said Toshio Nawa, senior analyst at the Cyber Defense Institute, a private cybersecurity firm. 
""The larger companies and outside observers need to go in and give pinpoint advice on where they're vulnerable,"" he said.

Both guidance and financial support are needed from the central government, Nawa and others said. Some regions already provide this, but it needs to be more comprehensive.
""What Japan's furthest behind in is this situational awareness, due to a lot of thinking still left over from the past, companies sticking to what worked well before,"" Nawa said.

The step was taken based on consideration of the airline's short-term demand, CEO Irfan Setiaputra said. 
Garuda's earnings have been hard hit by the pandemic, which forced the company to launch a major restructuring seeking to slash its debt to $3.7 billion from $9.8 billion.
""Hopefully we can get a win-win solution,"" Irfan said of the negotiations with the manufacturers.
Garuda is undergoing debt restructuring proceedings, known locally as PKPU, after a vendor petitioned a Jakarta court over unpaid liabilities. 
Garuda has proposed converting part of its debt to equity, offering a debt haircut and a new coupon debt. 
With Airbus, Garuda has outstanding orders for nine A330-900 jets and four A330-800s. 
Garuda has previously said it would cancel the remaining orders of Boeing 737 Max 8 following fatal crashes of the aircraft in Ethiopia and Indonesia. 

Garuda ordered 50 of the aircraft in 2014, valued $4.9 billion at that time, and had only received one unit, in 2017.

Investing.com –  Target  (NYSE:TGT) stock surged 13% in premarket trading Tuesday as the retailer guided for a year of positive growth after capping 2021 with a 13% rise in sales.
The optimistic outlook follows a year when most retailers struggled with high supply chain costs, fatter wage bills and shortages.  
The company closed the year with $106 billion in sales and said 2022 revenue should grow “low- to mid-single digit” with an operating margin rate of 8%, just 0.4 percentage point lower year-on-year.
Adjusted profit per share in the quarter rose over 19% to an all-time high of $3.19, according to the company.
Fourth-quarter sales were up 9.4% at $31 billion as the pandemic-fueled consumer propensity to stock up remained strong. Holiday sales, coming in the backdrop of an almost two-year-long pandemic, boosted the top line.
Digital sales grew 9.2% while comparable traffic was up 8.1%. More than 95% fourth-quarter sales were fulfilled by its stores, Target said.
Margins eroded in the fourth quarter due to multiple headwinds. Increased supply chain costs due to higher compensation and headcount in the company's distribution centers as well as freight and merchandising costs weighed on the margins, the company said. The company said the current-quarter operating margin rate will be “well below its first quarter 2021 rate of 9.8%”."

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) has helped about a quarter of its employees in Ukraine leave the country and is working to support those who had decided to remain following the invasion by Russia, chief executive Chuck Robbins said on Tuesday.
""Several weeks ago we engaged with them and gave them the opportunity for assistance to actually leave Ukraine,"" he told Reuters in an interview at Mobile World Congress.
""And probably about a quarter of our employees made that decision.""
The U.S. networking company was working to help its workers still in the country, which made a relatively small but still meaningful contribution. For example helping them access cash, he said.
The West has imposed heavy restrictions on Russia to close off its economy and block it from the global financial system, prompting shipping, energy and tech companies to halt sales, cut ties or dump tens of billions of dollars worth of investments. 
Swedish rival Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) has stopped supplying Russia while it assesses the impact of sanctions. 
Robbins didn't comment on what Cisco was doing specifically, but said the company would abide by the sanctions that the United States and other countries had put in place.
""We have a team of people that are working around the clock right now on employee issues, on anything associated with the conflict, including understanding the sanctions and what we need to do to actually implement those effectively,"" he said.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"".
Robbins said Cisco was confident about the opportunity in standalone 5G networks, particularly in enterprise services.
""I'm really confident about the strength of the business over the last four or five quarters relative to the demand, which is connected to these (5G) build-outs,"" he said.

Cisco was helping build end-to-end architectures for its customers, which included partnering with other players in technologies such as radio, he said.
Cisco has been long rumoured as a possible acquirer of either Nokia (NYSE:NOK) or Ericsson to get into radio, but he said there was ""no plan to get into radio"".

(Reuters) -Hollywood studios  Disney , Warner Bros., and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Pictures Entertainment said they would pause theatrical releases of upcoming films in Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine and the unfolding humanitarian crisis.
The Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Co said Monday it is pausing the release of theatrical films in Russia, starting with the upcoming Pixar Animation Studios release, ""Turning Red."" Within hours, WarnerMedia said it would pause this week's release of ""The Batman"" in Russia. 
""We will make future business decisions based on the evolving situation,"" Disney said in a statement. ""In the meantime, given the scale of the emerging refugee crisis, we are working with our NGO partners to provide urgent aid and other humanitarian assistance.""
Given the ongoing military action in Ukraine, ""we will be pausing our planned theatrical releases in Russia, including the upcoming release of Morbius"", a Sony Pictures Entertainment spokesperson said in an emailed statement. 
Over the weekend, the Ukrainian Film Academy created an online petition that called for an international boycott of Russian cinema and the Russian film industry following the invasion.
Russia is a significant market for Hollywood, accounting for $601 million in box office in 2021, or about 2.8% of worldwide ticket sales, which totaled $21.4 billion last year, according to Comscore. 
Several major films are slated for global release, ""The Batman,"" scheduled to open in Russia on March 3 as part of a worldwide roll-out, and Paramount Pictures' ""Sonic the Hedgehog 2"" which makes its global debut on April 8.

(Reuters) - Global inflation-protected bond ETFs have seen huge outflows this year, despite rising inflation levels, as investors prepare for price pressures to be tamed eventually by central banks.
According to Refinitiv data, global inflation-protected bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have faced net sales worth $3.8 billion in the first two months of this year, after receiving inflows over the past few years.
In February alone, they saw an outflow of $2.4 billion, the biggest since March 2020.
 
A related graphic: Flows into inflation-protected bond ETFs: https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-MARKETS/dwvkrleybpm/chart.png
 
The iShares TIPs bond ETF faced an outflow of $3.1 billion, while Lyxor Core US TIPS (DR) UCITS ETF - Monthly Hedged to GBP - Dist and iShares USD TIPS UCITS ETF USD had net sales worth $438 million and $369 million respectively.
 
A related graphic: Outflows from inflation-protected bond ETFs this year: https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-MARKETS/akpezxmrnvr/chart.png
 
Last year, inflation-protected bond funds received a record $48 billion as the post-pandemic economic recovery fanned expectations of higher inflation while supply chain constraints pushed up prices of electronic goods.
Average daily volumes on TIPs approached $22 billion last year, the highest on record, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association said.
The turnaround has been dramatic.
""TIPS were a big winner in 2021 and priced in very high levels of inflation for this year. Investors took profits in the first few months of 2022 on a successful trade that had a much higher bar to clear this year,"" said Andy Kapyrin, director of research at RegentAtlantic Capital.
""Also, its likely that inflation expectations will peak in the coming months, making owning inflation protection more complicated.""
The Treasury break even inflation curve, a measure of what inflation level a investor would break even on a given Treasury note yield, shows that investors expect inflation to run at 5.16% in the coming year, before declining to 4% in two years, 3% in five years and 2.6% in 10 years.
 
A related graphic: Hot inflation seen cooling off down the road: https://tmsnrt.rs/3hqqIzZ
 
The U.S. personal consumption expenditures price index rose at a 6.1% annual rate through January, its highest since 1982 and a level more than triple the 2% inflation rate the Fed had set as its target for the U.S. economy.
""While inflation readings have been getting hotter, investors are also expecting the Federal Reserve to take more aggressive action to put out the fire,"" Morningstar said in a report last month.
""With TIPS selling off, the market isn’t reacting to the inflation news, it’s reacting to expectations of strength by the Fed.""
Last week, Fed policymakers largely signalled a preference for a quarter-percentage-point interest rate rise when it begins its tightening cycle at its next meeting.
However, some analysts expect moderate inflows into inflation-protected bonds due to higher crude oil prices and tensions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
RegentAtlantic Capital's Kapyrin said the conflict in Ukraine could support flows into the shortest term TIPs on the risk of rising fuel prices.
""I think flows will even out and I don't expect a lot of net inflows in the absence of inflation continuing to get worse. With the Fed raising interest rates and some of the supply chain pressures peaking this is getting less likely,"" he said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -German diversified group Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) is aiming for a return to growth in adjusted core earnings this year as higher profit at its agriculture division would likely be tempered by investments in new genetic treatment technologies.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) before special items should reach 12 billion euros ($13.4 billion) in 2022, when adjusted for currency swings, up 7% from 11.18 billion euro last year, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.
Bayer reported its fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA was flat at 2.4 billion euros, in line with the average analyst forecast, resulting in a 2.5% decline for the full year due to higher costs, negative currency effects and drug development spending.
In its presentation slides, the maker of drugs and farming supplies said it was aiming for earnings growth at its crop science division due to mark-ups in prices, market share gains as well as efficiency measures that offset inflationary cost pressures.
Bayer is catching up with its closest rival  Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA) in the U.S. seeds market, offering a soy variety that resists a higher number of weedkillers.
The shares gained 1.2% to 52.12 euros, with Stiefel Research analyst Andreas Heine saying he expected much improved Crop Science results during the first half of the year.
The company warned that its outlook assumed a stable geopolitical environment in Eastern Europe, now thrown into doubt by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
""Bayer will closely monitor and mitigate these risks to the extent possible,"" it added.
In a media call, Chief Executive Werner Baumann said the company's focus on health and nutrition meant it would work hard to give civilians in Ukraine and Russia continued access to its products.
In Russia, which accounts for about 2% of group sales, money transfers have so far not been affected by Western sanctions on banks but finance chief Wolfgang Nickl described the situation as ""super volatile"".
In Ukraine, where Bayer derives well below 1% of its revenue, staff were handed out cash as part of a range of support measures, CEO Baumann added.
The company has built what it describes as one of the leading cell and gene therapy platforms in the industry, boosting its long-term drug development prospects but requiring substantial expenditure.

A successful clinical trial prompted the drugmaker last month to boost its peak sales estimates for prostate cancer drug Nubeqa to more than 3 billion euros.

(Reuters) - Connecticut Treasurer Shawn Wooden on Tuesday will direct state pension funds to sell Russian assets, one of the most direct steps by a U.S. pension official to date in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
In a statement sent by a spokesperson, Wooden said the sales were needed both for moral reasons and to reduce investment risk in the state retirement funds, worth more than $47 billion in all.
The names and exact amounts of specific securities to be sold were not immediately available. State funds held $218 million worth of Russian-domiciled investments as of Feb. 24.
“Connecticut’s action today will apply further economic pain on a dangerous autocrat who needs to know that the free world stands in solidarity with the Ukrainian people and that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin’s abhorrent actions will have enduring, harrowing economic consequences in the days, months, and years ahead,"" Wooden said in the statement.
Connecticut has cut holdings in Russian-domiciled companies and Russian sovereign debt since 2014, Wooden's office said, as risk concerns, previous sanctions and cyberattacks made Russian markets less favorable.
As sole trustee of the Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, Wooden has more power to act than pension leaders in some other U.S. states.
On Monday, California Treasurer Fiona Ma said she supports divesting Russian assets from plans like the California Public Employees' Retirement System, where she is a board member and which has around $1 billion in Russian assets.
But another board member, state Controller Betty Yee, stopped short of calling for divestment.
Energy giants BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa) and global bank HSBC are among a growing list of companies looking to exit Russia as the United States and Europe impose stiffening sanctions, and Moscow responds.
So far major U.S. investment firms with Russian holdings have offered little comment about their intentions, however.

Investing.com – Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) stock plunged 12.6% in premarket trading Tuesday after the EV-maker cut its production forecast for this year due to ""extraordinary supply chain and logistics challenges”.
The company, touted as one of the most potent challengers to Tesla, expects to produce 12,000 to 14,000 vehicles in 2022, down from its previous goal of 20,000.
Automakers have struggled with shortage of parts for more than a year due to pandemic-induced supply constraints as well as surging demand for semiconductor chips from end-users of all hues.
The startup delivered 125 cars to customers last year, falling short of its 2021 production target of 577 vehicles.
Lucid’s net loss more than tripled to $1.05 billion. Revenue was over $26 million.
Lucid also said it will build a new manufacturing facility in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Construction will start in the first half of this year, with a goal to manufacture up to 150,000 vehicles a year at its peak. This will be the company’s first international plant. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund holds a nearly 63% stake in the company.
Lucid’s Air Dream Edition range of cars is certified by the Environmental Protection Agency as the best in class, even outstripping the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) models. Its 9-inch wheel has a rating of 520 miles on one full charge, making it the longest-range EV ever rated by the body."

MILAN (Reuters) -  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) will this week set out its alternative to a 10.8 billion euro ($12 billion) takeover by U.S. fund KKR and also publish bleak annual results that will underline the challenges that it faces.
Under pressure from stiff competition on its home turf, the debt-laden former phone monopoly, which in January appointed its fifth executive in six years, has warned on its 2021 earnings three times, most recently in December. 
Analysts are forecasting an 11% annual fall in core profit after leases, with the decline having accelerated to more than 23% in the fourth quarter, according to a company-compiled consensus. Domestic revenues are forecast to fall 2.9% in 2021.
One-off impairments and writedowns are expected to darken the picture.
Changes to a tax scheme that provided a 5.9 billion euro boost to TIM's 2020 earnings have significantly reduced their impact, with Milan-based broker Akros calculating TIM could suffer a 4 billion euro hit as a consequence.
The numbers, however grim, are unlikely to be the main event. 
Much of the attention will instead focus on new CEO Pietro Labriola as he presents his standalone plan for TIM which has been in the shadow of the KKR approach since last November. His strategy for 2022-2024 is expected to centre around a split of TIM's assets and operations.
The TIM board is due both to review the plan and sign off on the results on Wednesday.

NETWORK PLAN
Backed by TIM's leading investors Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) and state lender CDP, Labriola is expected to propose splitting the company between a network and a services business to unlock value and pave the way for the creation of a unified network champion.
Sources familiar with the matter said Labriola is ultimately looking to breathe fresh life into efforts to merge Telecom Italia's fixed access network with that of rival state backed fibre optic firm Open Fiber, a move advocated by CDP, which would ultimately win control of the venture.
Talks between TIM and CDP on the single network project, aimed at avoiding a costly duplication of investments to upgrade the country's network infrastructure, could bring a preliminary agreement later this month, two sources said.
KKR already has an interest in TIM, having spent 1.8 billion euros last year for a 37.5% stake in the group's secondary network, known as FiberCop.
Protecting its investment in the network business remains a priority. 
""KKR's offer is still there but as of now it is a way to have a bargaining power on TIM's network assets,"" a third source said. 
""Rome does not rule out KKR could be part of a solution to win control of TIM's network under a demerger plan"", a fourth source said.

A special committee within TIM is expected to give its verdict on the KKR approach by mid-March once investors and markets have had a chance to digest Labriola's plan.
Vivendi has indicated it believes the price of 0.505 euros is too low as it does adequately value TIM. The shares traded below 0.38 euros on Tuesday. ($1 = 0.8949 euros)

Investing.com –  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) stock traded 1.5% higher in Frankfurt trading Tuesday after the company forecast its adjusted profits will return to growth in the current year.
The company said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization before special items should touch 12 billion euro ($13.4 billion) in 2022, when adjusted for currency swings, up 7%. This compares to a 2.5% fall in annual adjusted EBITDA in 2022 to $11.2 billion as the company weathered cost pressures and “significant currency headwinds” while attempting to offset those challenges with a price hike.
Adjusted EBITDA was almost flat in the fourth quarter.
The company is guiding for a 5% growth in 2022 revenue to around 46 billion euro, assuming “a stable geopolitical environment in Eastern Europe, which in the meantime has changed dramatically.” Bayer said it will closely monitor and mitigate these risks to the extent possible.
Bayer is anticipating sales growth of around 7% at crop science, the company’s largest business with around 45% share in total sales. According to the company, earnings growth at the division will come in from mark-ups in prices, market share gains as well as efficiency measures to offset cost pressures.
The company sees 3-4% sales growth at pharmaceuticals and around 4-5% at consumer health.
Sales in the fourth quarter rose 11.2% to 11.1 billion euro. All three businesses grew. Adjusted profit per share almost tripled to 1.18 euro, driven by both higher volumes and price increases."

Investing.com – Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) stock traded 4.6% lower in premarket Tuesday after the video conferencing company posted a disappointing outlook.
The company was the most visible winner of the pandemic-induced need for services that helped people and corporates connect. As offices, schools and colleges reopen, and people return to work, the need for the services is being felt less and less. To add to the challenges, competition is also getting stronger with more features in their applications.
The fact that rivals like Microsoft Teams (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google Meet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are more integrated with their respective broader ecosystems also poses a challenge to Zoom’s growth.  
The company beat estimates for fourth quarter sales and profit, but the current quarter projection of $1.07 billion in sales fell short. For the full year, Zoom anticipates revenue of $4.55 billion at the top end, which was also lower than Wall Street’s estimate of $4.75 billion, according to Bloomberg. On the lower side, revenue is seen at $4.53 billion.
Revenue in the fourth quarter rose 21% to $1.07 billion, the slowest ever quarterly growth since it went public in 2019.
At the end of January 31, Zoom had 509,800 customers with more than 10 employees, up around 9% year-on-year. Adjusted profit per share was $1.29.
The company will also buy back shares worth up to $1 billion, it said.  The program will run through February 2024. It has appointed ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) CEO Bill McDermott to the board. He will replace departing member and early investor Bart Swanson."

TOKYO (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp will restart domestic production from Wednesday after a cyberattack on a supplier ground the automaking giant's factories to a one-day halt, sparking concerns about vulnerability in Japan Inc's supply chain.
No information was available about who was behind the attack, or the motive. It came just after Japan joined Western allies in clamping down on Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine, although it was not known whether the attack was related.
Cybersecurity has emerged as a key area of concern in Japan, where government critics say responses to hacking threats have been hampered by a fractured approach, with an attack on a hitherto obscure supplier enough to bring one of the world's mightiest manufacturers to a domestic standstill.
Toyota's production lines will be switched back on at its 14 factories across the country on Wednesday, it said in a statement. Tuesday's suspension hit output of around 13,000 vehicles.
Kojima Industries Corp, which provides plastic parts and electronic components to the automaker, said it had discovered an error at one of its file servers on Saturday night. After rebooting the server, it confirmed it had been infected with a virus, and found a threatening message, it said in a separate statement. 
The message was written in English, a Kojima spokesperson told Reuters, but declined to give further details.
A system failure hampered communication with Toyota over parts orders and led to a suspension of production at the automaker, Kojima said.
TOP TIER
Government ministers said they were following the incident closely. While big companies have cybersecurity measures in place, the government is worried about small or mid-level subcontractors, the industry minister, Koichi Hagiuda, told reporters on Tuesday.
Underscoring those fears, a lower-tier maker of water pumps and other automotive parts, GMB Corp, said its server was also a target of unauthorised access suspected to be ransomware at the weekend. It was not clear when all operations would fully return to normal, it said. 
Reports of the powerful malware Emotet being used have increased since the first week of February 2022, according to the Japan Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center, which provides information on cybersecurity.
Emotet is used to gain access to a victim's computer before then downloading additional malicious software, such as those designed to steal banking passwords, or ransomware which can lock a computer until an extortion fee is paid.
It was not clear whether Emotet was used on the Toyota supplier. Toyota declined to comment on whether it had detected early signs of a potential cyberattack or whether Emotet was responsible for paralysing its operation. 
Kojima only supplies to Toyota and is a top-tier supplier of some parts, and a second-tier supplier of others, the Kojima spokesperson said. Toyota's operations in Japan encompass a supply chain of 60,000 companies across four tiers.
Toyota said it would be able to resume operation by tapping into a back-up network between it and the supplier. It would take a week or two to fully restore the system, it said.
In November 2020, Japanese videogame maker Capcom, which makes games including Resident Evil, said a ransomware attack had likely compromised personal information of up to 350,000 gamers, and some of its own financial data had been stolen.

Honda Motor Co suspended some of its auto and motorcycle production globally in June 2020 after a suspected cyberattack.
Toyota shares finished flat on Tuesday, underperforming a 1.2% gain in the broader market.

Answering a question on any impact on production and operations in the event of further sanctions on Russia, Skoda said: ""Impacts can certainly be expected, but the final decision and future direction will be determined by the (Skoda Auto board) and in consultation with the Volkswagen Group."" 

Russia was Skoda's second-largest market in 2021, with over 90,000 vehicles delivered. Ukraine has also been a stable market, it said.
""The sales strategy in Russia and Ukraine is currently the subject of intensive discussions. Sales in both Ukraine and Russia can be expected to fall in view of recent developments,"" Skoda said.

496,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 03:40AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Picking through the rubble,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Sujata Rao. 
Well-known emerging market commentator Tim Ash at BlueBay Asset Management noted it took a week for Fortress Russia to became Rubble Russia. 
Indeed, after shedding a third of its value on Monday, the rouble is down another 5%. And it's a matter of time before Russia is ejected from bond and equity indexes. 
Global markets are trying to make the best of it; after hefty losses, U.S. and European equity futures are inching higher, while safe-haven bonds and the yen are down.
The collapse of a fortress does reverberate however.
There is the growth and inflation impact from $100 oil prices. Many investors are also left holding tens of billions of dollars of unsaleable Russian securities. More companies may have to follow BP (NYSE:BP) in ditching Russia investments at immense cost
Tuesday's PMI data confirmed factory supply chains were recovering in February. But Russia's commodity footprint poses a threat -- aside from oil and gas, Russia produces half the world's palladium, 14% of the platinum and 6-7% of aluminium. Aluminium prices have hit a record, with shipment disruptions reported from Ukraine. 
Australia encapsulated the bind central banks are in. Policymakers noted risks from the crisis, yet inflation will likely force an interest rate rise by mid-year.
Next -- a Russian default? Its hard currency debt payments total some $55 billion this year, Oxford Economics estimates, with sovereign bonds comprising $2.6 billion. Without access to its $640 billion forex reserves or SWIFT payments systems, can Russia pay? Will it want to?
Tuesday brings a test in the form of a $417 million bond repayment from Russian telecoms firm VEON (NASDAQ:VEON). It says it has ""alternative routes"" to move cash. The wait is on. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Tuesday: 
-Asia's factory activity grows but Ukraine crisis clouds outlook
-Group of Seven finance ministers discuss the Ukraine crisis.
-German Jan retail sales/prelim CPI/HICP
-U.S. President Joe Biden delivers State of the Union address.

-Fed speakers: Atlanta President Raphael Bostic

Hopes that talks last night between Russian and Ukrainian officials near the Belarusian border could result in a ceasefire have been dashed as they ended with no agreement, while Russian troops continue to heavily shell the Ukrainian capital Kyiv amid fierce resistance.

501,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 02:31AM ET</span>",Toyota to restart Japan production after cyberattack on supplier triggers one-day halt,"By Satoshi Sugiyama, Maki Shiraki and Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) -  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp will restart domestic production from Wednesday after a cyberattack on a supplier ground the automaking giant's factories to a one-day halt, sparking concerns about vulnerability in Japan's Inc's supply chain.
No information was available about who was behind the attack, nor the motive. It came just after Japan joined Western allies in clamping down on Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine, although it was unclear whether the attack was related.
Cybersecurity has emerged as a key area of concern in Japan, where government critics say responses to hacking threats have been hampered by a fractured approach: an attack on a hitherto obscure supplier was enough to bring one of the world's mightiest manufacturers to a domestic standstill.
Toyota's production lines will be switched back on at its 14 factories across the country on Wednesday, it said in a statement. Tuesday's suspension hit output of around 13,000 vehicles.
Kojima Industries Corp, which provides plastic parts and electronic components to the automaker, said it had discovered an error at one of its file servers on Saturday night. After rebooting the server, it confirmed it had been infected with a virus, and found a threatening message, it said in a separate statement. 
The message was written in English, a Kojima spokesperson told Reuters, but declined to give further details.
The system failure at Kojima meant the supplier was unable to ship parts, forcing Toyota, which does not stockpile components at its plants, to pause production, a Toyota spokesperson said.
TOP TIER
Government ministers said they were following the incident closely. While big companies have cyber security measures in place, the government is worried about small or mid-level subcontractors, the industry minister, Koichi Hagiuda, told reporters on Tuesday.
Reports of the powerful malware Emotet being used have increased since the first week of February 2022, according to the Japan Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center, which provides information on cybersecurity.
Emotet is used to gain access to a victim's computer before then downloading additional malicious software, such as those designed to steal banking passwords, or ransomware which can lock a computer until an extortion fee is paid.
It was not clear whether Emotet was used on the Toyota supplier. Toyota declined to comment on whether it had detected early signs of a potential cyberattack or whether Emotet was responsible for paralysing its operation. 
Kojima only supplies to Toyota and is a top-tier supplier of some parts, and a second-tier supplier of others, the Kojima spokesperson said. Toyota's operations in Japan encompass a supply chain of 60,000 companies across four tiers.
Toyota said it would be able to resume operation by tapping into a back-up network between it and the supplier. It would take a week or two to fully restore the system, it said.
In November 2020, Japanese videogame maker Capcom, which makes games including Resident Evil, said a ransomware attack had likely compromised personal information of up to 350,000 gamers, and some of its own financial data had been stolen.

Honda Motor Co suspended some of its auto and motorcycle production globally in June 2020 after a suspected cyberattack.
Toyota shares finished flat on Tuesday, underperforming a 1.2% gain in the broader market.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's top lender will not process any transactions involving Russian entities subject to international sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, according to a letter seen by Reuters and people familiar with the matter. 
""No transactions involving entities, banks, ports or vessels appearing"" on a U.S., European Union or United Nations sanctions list shall be processed irrespective of the currency of the transaction, said a letter sent by State Bank of India (SBI) to certain clients.
SBI did not immediately respond to emails or calls seeking comment on the matter.
""We have a significant international presence and we need to comply with U.S. and EU regulations as we are present in those jurisdictions and we cannot be seen as not adhering to these rules,"" said a senior SBI executive.
The invasion, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"" and which is the biggest assault on an European state since World War Two, was met with widespread condemnation and an array of sanctions.
India, which has deep trade and defense ties with Russia, has so far not publicly condemned its long-standing ally, but has called for an end to violence and for diplomacy and dialogue to resolve the conflict. 
SBI in the letter to clients also urged ""extra precautions"" while handling any transactions related to sanctioned countries. 
Many major Indian corporate houses have deep links with the state-controlled lender, which has a large network of overseas branches.
SBI has also sought information from Indian oil companies about their exposure to Russia including stakes in Russian assets, funds received from Russia in the last year and lenders involved in routing these transactions, according to two senior energy industry sources.

One of India's top refiners, Indian Oil Corp, said on Monday it would no longer accept cargoes of Russian crude and Kazakh CPC Blend cargoes on a free on board (FOB) basis due to insurance risk.
Apart from oil companies, Indian fertiliser companies also deal extensively with Russia for imports of crop nutrients.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -An Australian government agency filed a lawsuit on Tuesday accusing casino operator Crown Resorts Ltd of ""serious and systemic noncompliance"" with anti-money laundering laws, complicating a $6.3 billion buyout by Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc.
In a Federal court filing, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) said the company started by billionaire James Packer failed its due diligence obligations ""innumerable"" times from 2016 to 2020, leaving it and the country's financial system ""vulnerable to criminal exploitation"".
""As a result of (Crown's) non-compliance, the Australian and global community and financial system has been exposed to systemic ML/TF risks over many years,"" AUSTRAC said in a legal filing, using acronyms for money laundering and terrorism financing.
""It is likely that many ML/TF risks were realised,"" the agency added in the filing, which it published on its website.
Though not unexpected, the lawsuit presents an additional hurdle as Crown tries to pull off a buyout by Blackstone, which its shareholders have welcomed as a way out of an investment that has been weighed down by regulatory headaches - including a suspended gambling licence - for years.
AUSTRAC didn't specify the damages it was seeking, saying there had been ""innumerable"" breaches. However, the court filing listed 547 contraventions and noted that each violation carried a fine of up to A$22.2 million ($16 million), implying a potential fine of more than A$1.2 billion. The case would not result in prison time because it is in the civil court. 
Blackstone declined to comment. Crown said it was reviewing the lawsuit, but added that it had developed a comprehensive mediation plan and overhauled its governance since allegations of poor due diligence surfaced at a regulatory inquiry in 2020.
The company has also replaced most of its board and management in the past year. Packer, who still holds 37% of the company, has withdrawn his representatives from its board to end accusations of having an inappropriate level of control over it.
Still, AUSTRAC said it wanted the company to answer for turning a blind eye to - and in some cases, knowingly allowing - suspicious transactions on its premises on a massive scale.
The oversight failures were most apparent in the company's reliance on foreign tour groups, known as junkets, which involved ""movement of large amounts of money across borders and through multiple bank accounts"" by people whose identities were often obscured, the court filing said.
Crown knew of 60 customers, responsible for A$70 billion in turnover, who engaged in suspicious activity like making large payments to unknown third parties offshore and making payments from ""cash in plastic bags, shoeboxes or cardboard boxes"", the filing said.

The company knew some of the customers were connected with organised crime but failed to invest in technology - or any system other than ""manual"" observation by staff - to monitor risky transactions, the filing said.

China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.25% by 9:29 PM ET (2:29 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component was up 0.24%. Data released earlier in the day showed that the manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) for February was 50.2, while the non-manufacturing PMI was 51.6. The Caixin manufacturing PMI was 50.4.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched up 0.07%, with the city potentially imposing a lockdown ahead of a mandatory COVID-19 testing project.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.52% and in Australia, the ASX 200 rose 1.17%.
Korean markets are closed for a holiday.
Pressure on Russian markets remains firm after the West blocked the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (Bank of Russia)’s access to foreign reserves and removed some Russian banks from the global SWIFT messaging system.
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced countersanctions, and Russia introduced capital controls to minimize the rouble’s fall. The risk that Russian stocks and bonds could be kicked out of major investment benchmarks as they become increasingly hard to trade is also growing.
The sanctions have contributed to market volatility and concerns about inflation, with Russia rich in commodities and the conflict disrupting supplies of raw materials such as grain and energy. This comes as the U.S. Federal Reserve is about to hike interest rates, and lenders worldwide are also making it harder to finance transactions involving Russian resources.
“We could see a longer off-ramp for inflation here” amid the added pressures to energy prices from the invasion, Wells Fargo Investment Institute head of global asset allocation strategy Tracie McMillion told Bloomberg.
A half-point Fed hike in March 2022 “is probably off the table” she said, predicting four quarter-point increases in 2022.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he is in favor of raising rates by 25 basis points in March and would consider a half-point move if inflation does not start to fall.
“Over the next few weeks, we’ll see a lot of gyrations and a potential for an even bigger dip. But that will be a dip worth buying because most geopolitical crises are resolved relatively quickly,” Regentatlantic Capital LLC co-chief investment officer Andy Kapyrin told Bloomberg.

Neither company is allowed to operate during heavy fog or heavy rain.
Earlier this month, GM and Cruise petitioned U.S. regulators for permission to deploy a limited number of self-driving vehicles without human controls like steering wheels or brake pedals.
Waymo on Monday said it would use what it has learned operating its autonomous commercial ride hail service in Arizona and apply it ""to our growing service in San Francisco.""
Waymo said it has tens of thousands of riders on a waitlst in California after it launched a tester program in August. ""We’ll begin offering paid trips through the program in the coming weeks,"" the company said.

Prashanthi Raman, Cruise's vice president for global government affairs, said in a statement the announcement was ""another positive incremental step forward. Our mission has always been to launch a driverless commercial ridehail service here in San Francisco, and that’s what we’ll continue working with our regulators to deliver.""
Cruise has not received a response from the CPUC on its request for a driverless deployment permit.

A few months ago, U.S. companies were forced to reimpose mask mandates due to a steep rise in COVID-19 infections across the country from a rampaging Omicron variant. 
U.S. President Joe Biden, however, told NBC News in an interview earlier this month that Omicron and other COVID-19 variants had had a ""profound impact on the psyche of the American people"" and conceded that changing mask guidelines were ""confusing.""

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended lower after a volatile session on Monday, with investors wrestling with uncertainty and bank stocks dropping following powerful Western sanctions against Russia as it continued its invasion of Ukraine.
Helping the Nasdaq close in positive territory after opening at a loss, electric car makers Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Rivian Automotive jumped 7.5% and 6.5%, respectively.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) fell 4.5% and helped push the S&P 500 banks index down 2.35% as the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield slipped. The broader S&P 500 financial index dropped 1.5%. 
Global stocks slumped, the Russian rouble tanked to record lows and safe-haven assets got a boost after Western allies imposed new sanctions that limited Moscow's ability to deploy its $630 billion foreign reserves and cut off some of its banks from the SWIFT global payments system.
Russian artillery bombarded residential districts of Ukraine's second-largest city, as Moscow's invading forces met stiff resistance on a fifth day of conflict.
""The Russia-Ukraine invasion in itself is not likely going to be a long-term headwind for U.S. equities. But I think in the short term, it's a massive contributor to the equity pullback,"" said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs.
The S&P 500 energy sector rallied 2.6%, thanks to higher oil prices. [O/R]
Defense stocks Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX),  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD),  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) and L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) gained between 2.8% and 8% following news that Germany would increase its military spending.

The S&P 500 fell 3.15% in February, while the Nasdaq lost 3.43%. So far in 2022, the S&P 500 has lost over 8%, the index's deepest two-month decline since March 2020.
The worsening geopolitical crisis has added to investors' concerns about soaring inflation and the Federal Reserve's rate-hike plans. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq logged their biggest two-month declines since the pandemic-led crash in March 2020.
The CBOE volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, rose for a second straight session.
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) dropped 3.9% after Russia closed its airspace to airlines from 36 countries in response to Ukraine-related sanctions targeting its aviation sector.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican bottler and retailer Femsa plans to increase the number of its Oxxo convenience stores by as much as 50% across Latin America over the next decade, executives said on Monday, with hundreds planned for Brazil, Chile and Colombia in 2022 alone.
Femsa already operates 20,431 Oxxo stores in Latin America, generating some 35% of the parent's revenue, its fourth-quarter results showed.
In addition to adding some 800 new Oxxo stores in its home country in 2022, executives told investors on a call the company hoped to open another 200 Oxxo stores in Brazil as well as 150 between Chile and Colombia.
""As we're getting bigger in these other countries, obviously, the profitability there begins to kind of supercharge,"" said Juan Fonseca, investor relations director, of the company's ambitious expansion plans.
Femsa also said it had completed the purchase of OK Market, which operates 134 convenience stores in Chile.
Earlier on Monday, Femsa posted a fourth-quarter net profit of 6.7 billion pesos ($328 million), up from a net loss of 1.2 billion pesos in the year-earlier period, boosted by a higher operating profit and a decrease in net interest expenses.
The conglomerate, which manages one of the largest Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) producers in the world, also reported a 16.3% increase in quarterly revenue, helped by growth in all its business units.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the quarter rose to 23.4 billion pesos, in line with a Refinitiv estimate of 23.07 billion pesos.
The company's subsidiary, Coca-Cola Femsa, reported an 82.8% increase in quarterly net profit last week. Chief Executive John Santa Maria attributed the rise to increased sales across Latin America in the quarterly earnings report.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) said in a mid-January analysis that Femsa was positioned well in 2022.

Shares in Femsa inched up 0.86% by market close Monday afternoon.

515,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 07:31PM ET</span>","Russia sanctions snarl flights, compound airline industry woes","By Anne Kauranen, Tim Hepher and Rajesh Kumar Singh
HELSINKI/PARIS/CHICAGO (Reuters) -Airlines are bracing for potentially lengthy blockages of key east-west flight corridors after the European Union and Moscow issued tit-for-tat airspace bans and Washington did not rule out similar action in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Industry officials say the Biden administration would ban Russia from U.S. airspace. The White House said on Monday while barring Russian flights was not off the table, it had yet to make a decision.
""There are a lot of flights that U.S. airlines fly over Russia to go to Asia and other parts of the world and we factor in a range of factors,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters. 
The issue has been a subject of intense U.S. government discussions in recent days. Senator Dick Durbin, the second-highest ranking Democrat in the U.S. Senate, voiced his support for the ban.
""Other countries have done it in Europe and turning the lights out at the airport on those guys isn't a bad idea,"" he told reporters. 
A European official, who asked not to be identified, said the EU had full confidence Washington would follow suit.
U.S. Representative Carlos Gimenez, a Republican member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that he would file legislation this week to ban Russian-operated airlines and private jets from flying in U.S. airspace.
A move by the White House to ban Russia's carriers is expected to provoke a response from Moscow, which could affect carriers like United Airlines. The Chicago-based carrier, for example, uses Russian airspace for flights from Delhi. 
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) said it was not using any Russian airspace for international flights and it would suspend interline deals with Russian carriers Aeroflot and S7 Airlines indefinitely.
Russia on Monday banned airlines from 36 countries including all 27 members of the European Union after EU ministers agreed to refuse entry to Russian airplanes including the private jets of the country's oligarchs.
In one of the first signs of differences in European ranks, the chairman of Italy's civil aviation authority called the airspace sanctions against Russia a violation of international treaties.
The European official, however, said the EU's sanctions were ""carefully crafted in line with international law.""
The sanctions have sparked flight cancellations and costly detours, denting the industry's pandemic recovery and dealing a blow to the mainly Ireland-based leasing industry which was ordered to stop doing business with Russian airlines.
The rerouting meant that flights in Kazakhstan's airspace tripled to more than 450 on Monday.
Without access to Russia's airspace, many carriers will have to divert flights south while also avoiding areas of tension in the Middle East.
Finnish national carrier Finnair cancelled flights to Japan, Korea, China and Russia and scrapped 2022 guidance, as sanctions block access to Asia - a cornerstone of its strategy in recent years due to its Helsinki hub's location.
Shares in Finnair plunged 21%, leading a retreat in airline stocks in both Europe and the United States.
Germany's Lufthansa group said 30 flights to Russia would be cancelled this week and flights from Europe to Tokyo and Seoul would have to fly detours.
Russia's Aeroflot said it has cancelled flights to the United States, Mexico, Cuba and the Dominican Republic through Wednesday due to the closure of Canadian airspace. The announcement came a day after the carrier said it would cancel all flights to European destinations.
On Monday, an Aeroflot jet headed to Verona in Italy was forced to enter a holding pattern outside EU airspace and was diverted to Turkey after apparently being refused access, according to flightradar24. 
That came hours after one of its flights crossed Canadian airspace despite Toronto's ban on Russian planes, prompting a regulator to launch a review into the conduct of Aeroflot and Canada's air-traffic control service provider.
DISRUPTION
Other carriers from Latvia's AirBaltic to Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) have also suspended flights to Russia.
Korean Air, Japan Airlines and Japan's ANA Holdings said they were continuing to use Russian airspace but had no plans to add flights to Russia or Europe to replace flights cancelled by European carriers.
Demand to Japan and South Korea has been low due to COVID-19-related travel restrictions.
Airspace shutdowns and flight cancellations also started to affect cargo traffic, further exacerbating global supply-chain woes.
Many cargo carriers use Russian airspace, which is a major intersection for global trade, about half of which by value is carried by air.

""Due to the ongoing dramatic developments in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Lufthansa will no longer use Russian airspace,"" Lufthansa Cargo said.
U.S.-based  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX), two of the world's largest logistics companies, said they were halting deliveries to Russia.

LONDON (Reuters) -Russia's stock market is ""uninvestable"" after stringent new Western sanctions and central bank curbs on trading, making a removal of Russian listings from indexes a ""natural next step"", a top executive at equity index provider MSCI said on Monday.
""It would not make a lot of sense for us to continue to include Russian securities if our clients and investors cannot transact in the market,"" Dimitris Melas, MSCI's head of index research and chair of the Index Policy Committee, told Reuters.
""It is obvious to all of us that the market is very difficult to trade and, in fact, it is uninvestable today.""
Financial institutions around the world are winding down or suspending business in Russia, following heavy sanctions by Western governments against Russia in the wake of its military invasion of Ukraine last week.
Melas said the company could launch a consultation with investors immediately, the result of which could be announced within days along with the action which would be taken.
MSCI announced on Thursday that it had frozen the index and would not implement the changes for Russian securities it had previously announced as part of its February review.
""The natural next step that we could potentially implement - we haven't made any decision yet - but the natural next step might be to actually consider removing MSCI Russia or removing Russian securities from our indices"" Melas added. 
Later on Monday, MSCI released a statement https:// seeking feedback on the current level of accessibility and investability of the Russian equity market for international institutional investors. 

MSCI also said it would issue further communication before the end of the week following a review of feedback from market participants.
Russia has a weighting of 3.24% in MSCI's emerging market benchmark and a weighting of around 30 bps in the index provider's global benchmark.

CBA said it would sell down its shareholding to entities controlled by the Hangzhou municipal government, advancing a strategy that has been adopted by most Australian retail banks to do away with non-core operations and focus on essential services at home.
China's banking and insurance sectors have, meanwhile, been under pressure from their non-performing assets since problems of debt-laden developer China Evergrande Group came to light last year.
CBA, the 1996-established Chinese lender's biggest shareholder, will retain its remaining shareholding of about 5.6% in Bank of Hangzhou until at least February 2025.
The completion of the deal, currently expected in mid-2022, was also estimated to bring in a tax gain of about A$340 million for Australia's biggest lender.
""The partial sale of our shareholding is consistent with our strategy to focus on our core banking business in Australia and New Zealand,"" CBA Chief Executive Officer Matt Comyn said.

Bank of Hangzhou's Chairman Chen Zhenshan said it ""understands and respects the decision of CBA"" to reduce the shareholding due to its own strategic considerations and capital allocation needs.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump on Monday appealed a judge's ruling that he answer questions under oath in a civil probe by New York's attorney general into the former U.S. president's business practices.
The appeal, which was expected, will delay Attorney General Letitia James from obtaining testimony from Trump and his two oldest children, Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump, possibly for months.
Justice Arthur Engoron of a state court in Manhattan had on Feb. 17 said James had a ""clear right"" to question the Trumps in her probe into the Trump Organization, after her office had found ""copious evidence of possible financial fraud.""
The Trumps have said testifying violated their constitutional rights because their words could be used in a related criminal probe led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, and which James joined last May.
Donald Trump, a Republican, has also accused James of selectively prosecuting him because he is a political enemy. James and Bragg are Democrats.
Monday's appeal asks a state appeals court to consider both of these issues, and whether the Trumps' grand jury protections would be ""easily avoided, indeed, eviscerated"" by James' probe.
In response, James' office repeated its statement from last Friday on the Trumps' planned appeal.
""While they have the right to seek a delay, they cannot deter us from following the facts and the law wherever they may lead,"" it said. ""No one is above the law.""
Engoron's ruling had required the Trumps to testify within three weeks.
Trump at the time issued a statement decrying it as ""a continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt in history--and remember, I can't get a fair hearing in New York because of the hatred of me by judges and the judiciary. Its not possible!""
James' nearly three-year civil probe focuses on whether the Trump Organization improperly valued its real estate properties to get better loans and lower tax bills.

None of the Trumps has been accused of criminal wrongdoing.
The appeals court typically takes several months to issue decisions but can expedite cases where, as here, both sides consider it urgent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Monday it is expanding the use of independent safety expert groups to review new designs and technologies in certifying commercial aircraft.
The FAA said it is expanding use of Technical Advisory Boards (TAB) to help ensure it has a ""consistent and thorough approach for all aircraft certification projects.""
The FAA convened a TAB soon after the second Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crash in March 2019 to assist in its review of the grounded airplane.
 Boeing Co  said on Monday it will continue to work transparently through the FAA's ""detailed and rigorous processes ... We will continue to engage with the FAA to ensure we meet their expectations and all applicable requirements.""
The FAA plans to establish the boards earlier in the certification process and use them on aircraft that are largely like current models and typically referred to as derivative aircraft.
The FAA has a board in place for the certification review of the Boeing 777X. 
The boards review numerous issues including identifying new technologies or designs ""that could be catastrophic if they failed,"" the FAA said, and to determine ""whether similar systems have caused problems on other aircraft"" and to ensure the proper FAA offices were involved in the certification process.
Boeing continues to face scrutiny from the FAA following two fatal 737 MAX crashes in the space of five months in 2018-2019 that killed 346 people.

FAA Administrator Steve Dickson told Congress last year the agency is delegating fewer responsibilities to Boeing for aircraft certification and ""demanding more transparency"" from manufacturers.
The FAA is currently scrutinizing a number of issues involving Boeing airplanes. The agency said earlier this month it will retain authority to issue airworthiness certificates for Boeing 787s until it is confident ""Boeing’s quality control and manufacturing processes consistently produce"" planes that meet FAA ""design standards.""

Electric vehicle startups like Rivian Automotive and Lordstown Motors, which have raised money in public listings, have fallen short of their own production targets. 
In late October, Lucid started deliveries of its $169,000 Lucid Air premium electric sedans, which have an estimated driving range of 520 miles (835 km) per change, a longer range than rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). 
The California-based startup delivered 125 cars to customers last year, falling short of its 2021 production target of 577 vehicles.

Shares in Albertsons, which last month posted a bigger-than-expected third-quarter profit, increased nearly 10% in extended trading.
The review will also include an assessment of various strategies to optimize the balance sheet and return capital, development of other initiatives to complement existing businesses and responding to inquiries, Albertsons said.

Albertsons, which operates more than 2,270 stores across 34 states, said its board had not set a timetable for the conclusion of this review. It added the review might not result in any deal or other strategic change or outcome.
Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons has retained Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) to serve as financial advisers to assist in the review, the supermarket chain said.

Albertsons and Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the COVID-19 pandemic as many Americans have taken to cooking at home, but investors are worried the sales growth would only taper as people venture out and inflation leads to higher prices of groceries.
Albertsons last month also said the Omicron coronavirus variant had put a dent on the recovery of its supply chain, and also forecast the issues to linger for a longer duration.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Top California pension leaders on Monday offered different takes on whether the state's big retirement funds should divest from Russian assets in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, underscoring a broader debate among investors.
California Treasurer Fiona Ma said she supports divesting Russian assets, while California Controller Betty Yee stopped short of calling for the sale of Russian stocks and bonds.
""We need to send a very clear and unequivocal response that California will not stand for Russia's aggression,"" Ma said in a statement sent by a representative.
Decisions would be made by systems where Ma is a board member including the $480 billion California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) and the $320 billion California Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS).
However, fellow state official and board member Yee adopted more of a wait-and-see stance.
""As the world witnesses the devastating invasion of Ukraine by the Russian military, I am certain both CalPERS and CalSTRS will follow all relevant federal sanctions that can more quickly bring this crisis to a peaceful resolution,"" Yee said in a statement sent by a spokesperson.
""Investment teams at both funds continue to monitor their performance and analyze our options going forward,” the statement said.
Energy giants BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa) and global bank HSBC joined a growing list of companies looking to exit Russia as the U.S. and Europe impose stiffening sanctions, and Moscow responds.
But so far major U.S. investment firms have offered little comment about their intentions.
CalPERS has about $1 billion in Russia assets. CalPERS CEO Marcie Frost said Monday, ""We are monitoring current events and will take action as appropriate to protect the interests of our members.""
CalSTRS has said it was monitoring potential risks to its portfolio related to Russia, valued around $800 million last June.

(Reuters) -Aircraft leasing firms are set to terminate hundreds of leases with Russian airlines following Western sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-isolation-deepens-ukraine-resists-invasion-2022-02-28 that give the sector a month to act.
Dublin-based AerCap, the world's biggest aircraft leasing company, saw its New York-listed shares tumble 12.7% after it said it would cease leasing activity with Russian carriers, while U.S.-based Air Lease (NYSE:AL) fell almost 8%.
Russian airlines have 980 passenger jets in service, of which 777 are leased, according to analytics firm Cirium. 
Of these, two-thirds, or 515 jets, with an estimated market value of about $10 billion, are rented from foreign firms.
AerCap said that by net book value, 5% of its fleet was leased in Russia as of Dec. 31. The company, which recently strengthened its leadership of the specialist aviation leasing industry by buying rival GECAS, has the largest exposure to Russia and Ukraine with 152 planes, consultancy IBA said.
Its Russian clients include Aeroflot, S7 Airlines, Rossiya, Azur Air and Ural Airlines, its website showed, involving aircraft worth an estimated $2.5 billion, according to aviation services firm ACC Aviation.
Leasing companies control about half of the world's fleet and are a vital source of financing for airlines that lack sufficient capital to buy or prefer to pay a monthly rent.
The European Union on Sunday gave leasing companies until March 28 to wind up current rental contracts in Russia, presenting lessors with a major new headache hard on the heels of crises over Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX safety and the COVID-19 pandemic.
Russia warned the West it would retaliate against sanctions targeting its aviation industry.
REPOSSESSING JETS
Bankers have said Russian airlines have been among the most reliable in paying bills during the pandemic, but leasing companies face the prospect of having to abruptly wind up deals and recover aircraft in an uncertain climate post-sanctions.
Russia is a member of the Cape Town Convention, a specialist but vital treaty underpinning the fast-growing air finance industry by making it easier for lessors to recover jets when airlines cannot pay, in return for cheaper finance for airlines.
But the cooperation of courts is often still needed to enforce the rules and it remains unclear how Russia's courts would react to a request to recover jets under sanctions.
ACC Aviation Vice President Viktor Berta said repossessing aircraft could prove challenging, especially if Russian aviation authorities and airlines do not cooperate with lessors. Given the airspace bans, even sending staff to Russia to repossess aircraft could also be a headache, Berta added.
Financial restrictions may also prove a burden.
Avolon, the world's second-biggest leasing company, has fewer than 20 airplanes in Russia and one or two in Ukraine out of a total fleet of more than 550 aircraft, CEO Domhnal Slattery told Reuters this month.
Slattery said at the time that Avolon was concerned that sanctions on international payment transfers through SWIFT could be disrupted, making it hard for airlines to pay their bills.
Avolon declined to comment when asked about the sanctions. 
G7 leaders said on Sunday that Western allies had decided to cut off ""certain Russian banks"" from the SWIFT secure messaging system to ensure rapid cross-border payments, which has become the principal mechanism to finance international trade.
Lessor BOC Aviation said it had 18 planes representing 4.5% of its owned fleet based in Russia. It also manages one other plane.
""Our policy is to fully comply with all laws applicable to our business,"" BOC Aviation said in a statement. ""The practical consequences of the new EU sanctions are complex and at the present time we are unable to provide further information.""

Dubai Aerospace Enterprise (DAE) has at least three Russian airline customers, including Aeroflot, according to its website. The Dubai-owned lessor did not respond to a request for comment.
Novus Aviation Capital Co-Chief Executive Mounir Kuzbari told Reuters the firm has no aircraft in Russia but that mass cancellation of leases in Russia could hit global lease rates and aircraft values.

(Reuters) -Energy giants BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa), global bank HSBC and the world's biggest aircraft leasing firm AerCap joined a growing list of companies looking to exit Russia on Monday, as Western sanctions tightened the screws on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.
The West has moved to punish Russia with a raft of measures, including closing airspace to Russian aircraft, shutting out some Russian banks from the SWIFT global financial network and restricting Moscow's ability to use its $630 billion foreign reserves.
Russia's economy was already reeling on Monday. The rouble plunged to a record low, while the central bank doubled its key interest rate to 20%, and kept stock markets and derivative markets closed.
Shell on Monday said it would exit all its Russian operations, including the flagship Sakhalin 2 LNG plant in which it holds a 27.5% stake, and which is 50% owned and operated by Russian gas group Gazprom (MCX:GAZP).
""We cannot – and we will not – stand by,"" Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said in a statement announcing the move and calling Russia's attack a ""senseless act of military aggression"". He added that his company was talking to governments about securing energy supplies to Europe.
BP, Russia's biggest foreign investor, announced at the weekend it was abandoning its 20% stake in state-controlled Rosneft at a cost of up to $25 billion, cutting the British firm's oil and gas reserves in half.
Equinor, the energy firm majority owned by the Norwegian state, said it would start divesting its joint ventures in Russia.
The moves put the spotlight on other Western companies with stakes in Russian oil and gas projects, such as ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and TotalEnergies.
NO-GO ZONE
Large parts of the Russian economy will be a no-go zone for Western banks and financial firms after the decision to cut off some of its banks from SWIFT, a secure messaging system used for trillions of dollars' worth of transactions around the world.
The European arm of Sberbank, Russia's biggest lender, faces failure, the European Central Bank warned on Monday, after a run on its deposits.
British bank HSBC said it was starting to wind down relations with a host of Russian banks including the second-largest, VTB, one of those targeted by sanctions, a memo seen by Reuters showed.
Even neutral Switzerland said it was adopting European Union sanctions and freezing assets of some Russian individuals and companies. It joined others by imposing sanctions on President Vladimir Putin and other officials.
Some Western companies were suspending operations while others were drawing up contingency plans as they reviewed the rapidly changing landscape for business with Russia.
Nasdaq Inc and Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE)'s NYSE have temporarily halted trading in stocks of Russia-based companies listed on their exchanges, their websites showed.
Global auto and truck makers, including U.S. automaker General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Germany's Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) Truck, on Monday took some actions. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) suspended deliveries of cars to dealers in Russia and Swedish automaker Volvo and GM said they would suspend exports to Russia. 
""Deliveries are to resume as soon as the effects of the sanctions imposed by the European Union and the United States have been clarified,"" a VW spokesperson said.
That may not be soon, though, given the complexity of the conflict and sanctions process.
""We are likely to be in this environment of a very complicated, multipronged, multifaceted sanctions regime for months if not years,"" said Marcus Thompson, a London-based partner at Kirkland & Ellis.
Singapore-headquartered container shipping company Ocean Network Express on Monday suspended bookings to and from Russia while Maersk said it was considering doing the same.
Several companies with exposure to Russia had their shares pummeled on Monday. Nokian Tyres tumbled after withdrawing its 2022 outlook. It said last week it was shifting some production to Finland from Russia.
Shares in Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), which owns Russia's Rosbank, and carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA), which controls Russian carmaker Avtovaz, also fell.
TIT-FOR-TAT 
Finnair lost a fifth of its value after withdrawing its 2022 outlook amid airspace closures.
Russia is barring airlines from 36 countries from its airspace, including European nations and Canada which had earlier shut their airspace to Russian aircraft. U.S. officials said Washington was considering a similar move.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) have voluntarily halted overflying Russia for international routes, while United Airlines has rerouted some international flights that had typically flown over Russia. 
Leasing firms including AerCap Holdings, the world's biggest plane lessor with about 5% of its fleet leased to Russian airlines, and BOC Aviation, said they would terminate hundreds of aircraft leases with Russian airlines because of sanctions. The mechanics of retrieving the planes from Russia are not clear. 
AerCap's shares dropped more than 12% on Monday.
U.S.-based  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) said they were halting deliveries to Russia and Ukraine.
Big tech companies are juggling calls for them to shut services in Russia with what they see as a mission to give voice to dissent and protest. 
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on Monday said it would remove Russian state-owned media outlet RT's mobile apps from its Windows App store and ban ads on Russian state-sponsored media.

Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has barred RT and other Russian channels from receiving money for ads on websites, apps and YouTube videos, similar to a move by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
Investors also are pulling out of Russian companies. Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, will divest its Russian assets, worth about $2.8 billion, while Australia's sovereign wealth fund said it planned to wind down its exposure to Russian-listed companies.

The move marks an important milestone in the downfall of the $15 billion Structured Alpha funds, a saga that has dogged the German insurer and asset manager for two years.
But it isn't over yet. Allianz is still bracing for the outcome of U.S. regulatory investigations by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Allianz said earlier this month that it had settled with a number of investors, but didn't provide details about who. At the time, it said that it set aside 3.7 billion euros ($4.15 billion) to deal with the lawsuits and investigations. 
The sum pushed Allianz into a fourth-quarter loss and resulted in a cut in pay for its chief executive and other board members.
Monday's filings in a New York court were from pension funds for various Blue Cross and Blue Shield entities and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp.
The filings and Sean Gallagher, a lawyer for some of the plaintiffs with the firm Bartlit Beck, didn't disclose financial details. 
""We are happy to say that we reached a settlement with Allianz, which is good for our clients,"" he said.
The Allianz funds used complex options strategies to generate returns but when the coronavirus pandemic sent stock markets into a tailspin in February and March 2020, they plummeted in value, in some cases by 80% or more. 
Investors in the funds, which were predominantly U.S. public pension funds, then sued Allianz for a total of $6 billion in damages.
In their lawsuits, investors alleged Allianz had strayed from its stated investment strategy of hedging to limit potential losses.
Other pension funds that invested in the funds included those for labourers in Alaska, teachers in Arkansas and subway workers in New York.

Allianz declined to comment.

526,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 06:05PM ET</span>","'The new Atos' is on the way to recovery in 2022, CEO says","(Reuters) - Atos is entering ""a pivotal year"" after facing a series of setbacks in 2021, the head of the French IT consulting group said on Monday.
The firm, which lost half of its market value last year, exited France's blue-chip CAC 40 equity index and parted ways with its boss, stirring speculation about a buyout or the arrival of activist investors.
""Atos faced significant headwinds in 2021,"" Rodolphe Belmer, who took over the reins from former Chief Executive Officer Elie Girard in January, said in an earnings statement. ""It failed to meet its financial objectives, and a comprehensive review of its assets and contracts (...) have led to major impairments.""
Formed partly by a string of acquisitions under former CEO Thierry Breton, now EU industry chief, Atos saw its annual net income swung to a loss of 2.96 billion euros and, as a result, will refrain from proposing a dividend.
Belmer, who vowed to start over with a clean slate, said this month Atos had taken writedowns of about 2.4 billion euros ($2.7 billion) in the second half of 2021.
Le Monde reported earlier Monday on a potential dismantling scenario as the new CEO also plans to reorganise the group around three business units, ""as if he were preparing a split"", an expert told the French daily newspaper.
""Simplified, more efficient, this governance will be the backbone of the new Atos,"" Belmer said.
The continued decline in classic IT services, personnel cost inflation and supply chain tensions will put further pressure on profitability in the first half, the company noted, but revenue growth should turn positive in the second part of the year.

""2022 will be a pivotal year for the group, paving the way for a recovery driven by an ambitious turnaround plan,"" Belmer added.

Uber last year divested its stake in the foodtech and delivery joint venture, which it established with the tech giant in 2018 to combine their ride-sharing businesses in Russia and neighboring countries.
The ride-hailing company sold all of its holdings in the delivery and autonomous units of Yandex last year, and sold down its stake in the Yandex.Taxi mobility business to about 29%, roughly valued at about $800 million, while agreeing to a call option for Yandex to acquire the remaining shares.
""We are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings and, in the meantime, will remove our executives from the board of the joint venture,"" a spokesperson for Uber said.
The three executives have resigned, effective immediately, and will be replaced by a single non-executive representative, who will help to oversee the remaining divestiture.
Yandex had said earlier that it was interested in taking full control of the Yandex.Taxi ride-hailing service as a part of its plan to boost investment in online services.

The Russian company is also under pressure as Nasdaq Inc and Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc's NYSE temporarily halted trading in the stock due to regulatory concerns.
Yandex was not immediately available for comment.

528,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 05:42PM ET</span>",Markets pare rate hike bets as West gets tough on Russia,"By Dhara Ranasinghe and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors further reduced bets on Monday for interest rate hikes from major central banks this year, as the West ramped up sanctions against Russia for invading Ukraine, creating fresh uncertainty about the world economic outlook. 
Aggressive rate-hike bets priced in by markets from the likes of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank of England and European Central Bank had already come off in the past week. 
But they eased further on Monday, with money markets increasingly confident that the ECB will move later rather than sooner since tougher Russia sanctions which include blocking some banks from the SWIFT global payments system and an oil price surge will hurt the euro zone economy.
Rate futures significantly pared back the odds of a 50 basis-point tightening by the Fed at its meeting this month to 6.5% late on Monday, from about 23% roughly a week ago. It was as high as 70% early in the month after U.S. consumer price data showed annual inflation hitting a 40-year high.
The Fed, however, is widely expected to push through with a quarter-point rate increase at the two-day March meeting.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell will appear before Congress this week for his semiannual Monetary Policy Report testimony in the final week leading up to the pre-meeting blackout period.
""The near-term effects of the crisis appear to be inflationary, but the hit to growth is tougher to discern and puts central bankers in a very tough spot,"" wrote  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in a research note.
""We expect Chair Powell to hint strongly in his congressional testimony that the Fed will go 25 basis points, not 50 basis points, at the March 16 meeting.""
In Europe, markets have fully priced in a first, 10 basis- point rate hike from the ECB at its September meeting, having positioned for a June move following the ECB's hawkish pivot earlier this month . 
They anticipate 30 basis points worth of tightening in total by year-end, or the equivalent of three, 10 bps hikes. That's down from 35 bps late last week and as much as 50 bps just a couple of weeks ago. 
""It is logical for curves to shave off the likelihood of rate hikes in Europe and the U.S.,"" said ING senior rates strategist Antoine Bouvet. ""It is too early to assess the economic impact of the current crisis but the impact on growth will be negative, we just don't know by how much.""
A Bank of Canada meeting on Wednesday could prove a gauge of how central banks in the West are assessing the potential impact of Russia's attack on Ukraine on their growth and inflation outlook.
Canada's central bank is widely expected to lift rates by 25 basis point in its first hike since October 2018, with just over six rate moves in total priced in by year-end. 
The Bank of England is also expected to lift rates by 25 bps in March, although bets on a more aggressive 50 bps hike have come off the table.

ECB chief economist Philip Lane has told fellow policymakers that the Ukraine conflict may reduce the euro zone's economic output by 0.3%-0.4% this year, four people close to the matter told Reuters on Friday.
""It becomes very tricky for them to navigate, especially the ECB, whereas for the Fed this will be more an inflation issue than a growth issue, so they will continue to tighten – maybe not 50 bps but 25 bps – they don’t want to be the source of theatrics in this environment,"" said Salman Ahmed, global head of macro at Fidelity International.

BOGOTA (Reuters) -Colombian magnate Jaime Gilinski on Monday became the largest shareholder in investment holding company Grupo SURA through a public acquisition offer, according to figures published by the stock exchange.
Gilinski - one of Colombia's richest men and the owner of bank GNB Sudameris - was seeking between 5% and 6.25% of SURA's shares at $9.88 per share in the offer. According to Reuters calculations his total spend in the offer would amount to $288.9 million.
The offer was oversubscribed, the stock exchange said in a statement, with interest totaling 7.74% of SURA shares, but Gilinski can buy only up to 6.25%.
With 31.5% of SURA shares, Gilinski will now rank as a larger shareholder than Grupo Argos, which owns 27.7% of SURA.
Both Grupo Gilinski and SURA declined to comment on the result.
The price per share was nearly a quarter more than that offered by Gilinski in a previous offer when he bought 25.3% of SURA, part of a series of offers by him which have shaken up the country's largest conglomerate, Grupo Empresarial Antioqueno (GEA).
Shareholders in Nutresa - which, like SURA and Argos, is part of GEA - responded to a separate acquisition offer from Gilinski by selling 3.11% of shares, the exchange said, much below the up to 22.88% sought by the businessman.
Gilinski had previously purchased 27.7% of Nutresa shares.
SURA said earlier on Monday it will restart the search for a possible strategic partner after the end of the acquisition offer.
""Once the first offer was presented the search for a strategic partner clearly had to be suspended and so we're waiting for the passivity rule to expire, so the board of directors ... can continue to consider the possibilities,"" SURA head Gonzalo Perez told investors on a conference call.

SURA - which has a presence in 11 Latin American countries - has projected growth of between 10% and 15% in its net profit for this year, after it more than quadrupled profit last year to $388.6 million.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Former U.S. vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin asked a U.S. court on Monday for a new trial after losing her defamation case against the New York Times earlier this month, and requested that the judge overseeing the case be disqualified. 
Palin's attorneys said last week they would take those steps because several jurors received push notifications on their cellphones before deliberations were over about U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff's decision to dismiss the case regardless of their verdict.
The jury rejected the Republican former Alaska governor's argument that the newspaper and former editorial page editor defamed her in a June 2017 editorial that incorrectly linked her to a mass shooting in 2011 where six people died and then-congresswoman Gabby Giffords was seriously wounded. The article was corrected the next day.
Rakoff said jurors assured his clerk that the notifications did not affect their deliberations, which lasted about two days. He said at a Feb. 23 hearing that he would issue a written opinion by March 1 explaining why he dismissed Palin's case while jurors were deliberating.
A day before the Feb. 15 verdict, Rakoff said he would dismiss the case because Palin had not showed the Times acted with ""actual malice."" 
Palin's case is considered a test of a landmark 1964 U.S. Supreme Court decision, New York Times v. Sullivan, that established an ""actual malice"" standard for public figures to prove defamation.
Palin, a prominent conservative, was the late Senator John McCain's running mate in the 2008 presidential election and served as Alaska's governor from 2006 to 2009.
She said during the trial the Times editorial left her feeling ""powerless"" and ""mortified,"" but did not offer specific examples about how it hurt her reputation or caused her harm.
Rakoff told the jury about his planned dismissal only after they had finished deliberations.

""We reached the same bottom line, but on different grounds,"" he told jurors. ""You decided the facts. I decided the law.""
U.S. judges often instruct jurors in high-profile cases not to read news coverage of their trials to avoid exposure to information that could bias them. Experts said a judge would have to find that the push notifications biased the jury before overturning a verdict on that basis.

(Reuters) -  Cummins Inc  (NYSE:CMI). expects ""some impact"" to its business in Russia and is analyzing and preparing for current and anticipated sanctions, the U.S. truck engine maker said in an e-mailed statement on Monday.
Many firms have idled operations in Russia after it invaded Ukraine last week, resulting in powerful Western sanctions. 
Cummins has an office in Moscow. In 2006, Cummins entered an agreement with Russian truck maker Kamaz Inc. to produce engines for the company's fleet of trucks, buses and other heavy machinery. 
Cummins did not respond to a request for comment on its relationship with Kamaz, which is 47% owned by Russian state conglomerate Rostec and supplies parts to Russian military vehicles. 
Shares of Cummins were down 0.6% in late afternoon trading, in line with Wall Street's main indexes as investors digested the sanctions against Russia.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine was the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""
Other U.S. manufacturers including Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) have distribution and manufacturing facilities in Russia. Deere, the world's largest farm equipment maker, opened a manufacturing and parts distribution plant near Moscow in 2010. It was the company's largest single investment in more than 100 years of doing business in Russia.

(Reuters) - Global auto and truck makers, including U.S. automaker General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Germany's  Daimler  (OTC:DDAIF) Truck, on Monday suspended some business in Russia following that country's invasion of Ukraine.
Russian forces invaded Ukraine last week, marking the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two. Many firms have idled operations in Russia following Western sanctions against Russia. 
Energy giant BP (NYSE:BP) Plc, Russia's biggest foreign investor, abruptly announced over the weekend it was abandoning its 20% stake in state-controlled Rosneft at a cost of up to $25 billion.
On Monday, GM said it would suspend all vehicle exports to Russia until further notice. The Detroit company does not have plants in Russia, only sells about 3,000 vehicles annually there and has limited supply-chain exposure.
""Our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine at this time,"" Gm said in a statement. ""The loss of life is a tragedy and our overriding concern is for the safety of people in the region.""
Swedish automaker Volvo Cars said it would suspend car shipments to the Russian market until further notice, becoming the first international automaker to do so as sanctions over the invasion continue to bite.
In a statement, the company said it had made the decision because of ""potential risks associated with trading material with Russia, including the sanctions imposed by the EU and US.""
""Volvo Cars will not deliver any cars to the Russian market until further notice,"" it said.
A Volvo spokesman said the carmaker exports vehicles to Russia from plants in Sweden, China and the United States.
Volvo sold around 9,000 cars in Russia in 2021, based on industry data.
Also on Monday, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) in Russia temporarily suspended deliveries of cars to dealers until further notice. ""Deliveries are to resume as soon as the effects of the sanctions imposed by the European Union and the United States have been clarified,"" a VW spokesperson said.
VW previously said it would halt production for a few days this week at two German factories after a delay in getting parts made in Ukraine.
Daimler Truck said on Monday it would freeze its business activities in Russia with immediate effect, including its cooperation with Russian truck maker Kamaz, which is 47% owned by Russian state conglomerate Rostec.
Mercedes-Benz Group is also looking into legal options to divest its 15% stake in Kamaz as quickly as possible, the Handelsblatt newspaper reported.
A Mercedes spokesperson said business activities would have to be re-evaluated in light of the current events.
Mercedes-Benz Group, formerly Daimler AG (DE:MBGn), was the parent company of Daimler Truck before the truck maker was spun off.
U.S. truck engine maker  Cummins Inc  (NYSE:CMI) on Monday declined to discuss its relationship with Kamaz, but said it expected ""some impact"" to its business in Russia without providing further details. In 2006, Cummins agreed to produce engines for Kamaz's fleet of trucks, buses and other heavy machinery.
Media representatives for Kamaz could not immediately be reached to comment.
HALTED PRODUCTION
Swedish truck maker AB Volvo said it has halted all production and sales in Russia due to the crisis. It generates about 3% of its sales in Russia and has a factory there.
""We now have a bit more clarity on sanctions and security in the region ... this means all operations in Russia end,"" a company spokesperson told Reuters, adding the measures would apply until further notice. 
Officials with U.S. automaker Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co could not be reached to comment on Monday.
Ford, which has a 50% stake in three Russian plants, previously said it was working to manage any impacts on its operations but its primary focus was the safety of its employees in the region. 
U.S. airplane manufacturer Boeing (NYSE:BA) said Monday it has paused operations at its Moscow Training Campus and temporarily closed its office in Kyiv.
Separately on Monday,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp said it would suspend factory operations in Japan after a supplier of plastic parts and electronic components was hit by a suspected cyberattack.

No information was immediately available about who was behind the possible attack, or their motive. The attack comes just after Japan joined Western allies in clamping down on Russia after it invaded Ukraine, although it was not clear if the attack was at all related.
Japanese government officials said they would investigate whether Russia was involved.

533,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 04:57PM ET</span>",Investors seek bargains as Ukraine keeps markets on edge,"By Sujata Rao and Lewis Krauskopf
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Money managers are scanning roiled global markets for bargains after unprecedented Western sanctions propelled Russia into a full-blown crisis, sent oil prices soaring and put monetary policy bets in flux. 
The wild gyrations that have been a hallmark of markets in recent weeks continued on Monday, as the rouble lost nearly a third of its value, investors sought safety in government bonds and the dollar and major indexes in Europe and the United States pared initial sharp losses.
Though few expect the volatility to quiet down anytime soon, some were looking for opportunities in stocks they believe may have grown cheap after a weeks-long selloff that has taken the S&P 500 down 8% in 2022 and shaved 7% off Europe’s STOXX 600, as they bet that strong earnings will buoy stock prices. 
""On a fundamental basis the world economy is in reasonable shape, earnings are strong and we are not expecting a (global) recession,"" said Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros. ""The range of outcomes is very wide but in the long run we invest based on several metrics ... Those things do not scream panic,"" he said. 
The S&P 500 recently traded at around 19.7 times forward earnings, from around 22 times at the beginning of the year after losing more than $3 trillion in value year-to-date. Data from Refinitiv also indicates that U.S. and European companies overall are expected to increase earnings this year by about 8%. 
""Russia-Ukraine tension is a low earnings risk for US corporates, but an Energy price shock amidst an aggressive central bank pivot focused on inflation could further dampen sentiment/growth,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts said in a note.
Still, others were betting that the recent geopolitical uncertainty would mitigate monetary tightening from central banks, a factor that has weighed heavily on stocks in recent weeks. 
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) strategists said the Ukraine crisis ""has reduced the risk of central banks slamming the brakes to contain inflation."" The strategists said they were ""tactically"" upgrading equities, noting they believe ""market expectations of rate hikes have become excessive and have created opportunities in equities.""
Markets are pricing in nearly 150 basis points of Federal Reserve tightening by next February, including a widely expected rate increase in March. However, odds of a hefty 50 basis-point hike next month are down to about 7% from 22% chance estimated 10 days ago, according to the CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool.
Analysts at UBS Global Wealth Management, meanwhile, advised clients to increase their exposure to raw materials to buffer portfolios against inflation. The conflict between Russia, one of the world’s largest commodity exporters, and Ukraine has already helped push up oil prices to their highest level since 2014, while U.S. inflation last month grew at its fastest pace in nearly four decades. 
King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco, was shifting more of client portfolios to commodities, through an Invesco ETF with diverse exposure to commodities, which generally are expected to benefit in inflationary environments. “We were buying it already because of the inflation hedge and now we just think it is going to have more tailwinds on it because you are going to have supply disruptions,” Lip said. 
But many remained wary. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) recently cut forecasts for the STOXX 600 pan-European equity index and the FTSE, noting the knock-on effect on production costs and GDP to Europe, which is heavily dependent on Russia for its energy needs. They said, however, that corporate balance sheets were strong and called the conflict ""largely one that raises the risk premium rather than derails the recovery.""

Generali (MI:GASI) Investments equity strategist Michele Morganti predicted another 5% downside, based on previous risk premia spikes during the financial crisis of 2008 and the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.
""Looking further ahead though, there's a sense it will probably get worse before it gets better,"" Morganti told clients. ""Markets remain event-dependent, and we would refrain from aggressively buying current dips.""

(Reuters) - Arbutus Biopharma (NASDAQ:ABUS) Corp on Monday sued  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc in Delaware federal court, claiming Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine infringes its patents. 
Arbutus and Genevant Sciences said in the lawsuit that Arbutus' technology for delivering mRNA was responsible for Moderna's ability to get its vaccines out in record time. 
Arbutus and Genevant, a joint venture between Arbutus and Roivant Sciences Ltd, told the court that the lawsuit was necessary because Moderna had ""consistently declined to engage meaningfully in licensing discussion."" 
Shares of Arbutus were down about 2.5% while Moderna was up 0.6% in late afternoon trading. 
""Moderna denies these allegations, and will vigorously defend itself against Genevant's claims in Court,"" a Moderna spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement to Reuters.
The lawsuit said the companies were not seeking to block Moderna from producing or distributing the vaccines, and asked for money damages including a reasonable royalty on vaccine sales.
Sales of Moderna's COVID vaccine, which is cleared for use in over 70 countries, have been on the rise. The vaccine garnered $17.7 billion in sales in 2021 and is expected to bring in up to $19 billion in 2022. 
Roivant and Genevant said that the litigation could take at least two years. 
""It could obviously take lesser time than that especially if all the parties reach a settlement agreement,"" said Jefferies analyst Dennis Ding. 
A federal appeals court in December rejected Moderna's challenges to some of the Arbutus patents. 

Moderna is also embroiled in a months-long patent conflict over its COVID-19 vaccine with the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH).

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -The Russian ruble hit record lows on Monday while world stocks slid and oil prices jumped after the West ramped up sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, including blocking Russian banks from the SWIFT global payments system.
Russia's central bank hiked its key interest rate to 20% from 9.5% and introduced some capital controls to bolster the ruble and fight inflation. Authorities ordered exporting companies to sell 80% of their foreign revenues as the ruble slid as much as 32% before recouping some losses.
The European arm of Sberbank, Russia's biggest lender, faces failure, the European Central Bank (ECB) said, an early sign of a looming economic crisis in Russia.
The fallout from tougher sanctions also rippled across financial markets outside Russia, especially in Europe where the main German and French bourses fell more than 3% in early trade but later pared most of those losses.
European banks were hit hard, with those most exposed to Russia, including Austria's Raiffeisen Bank, UniCredit and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), falling between 9.5% and 14%. The wider euro zone index of 22 major banks lost 5.7%, but the pan-regional STOXX 600 stock index closed down a scant 0.09% as sentiment improved at its close.
However, talks on a ceasefire ended without a breakthrough and a member of the Ukrainian delegation said the discussions were difficult as the Russian side was biased, news that darkened the mood on Wall Street. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.49% and the S&P 500 lost 0.25%. The Nasdaq Composite rebounded, adding 0.41%, as investors bet the Federal Reserve will be less aggressive hiking interest rates. MSCI's all-country world equity index closed down 0.077%.
Markets are likely to remain choppy in the near term, analysts said. While valuations have fallen and some risks have been priced into the market, it's not time to derisk, Solita Marcelli, chief investment office for the Americas at UBS Global Weather Management, told clients in a note.
""Investors trying to trade off geopolitical events can easily get whipsawed,"" Marcelli said, noting that sell-offs based on geopolitical events have been brief in the past.
Oil prices surged after Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday put nuclear-armed forces on high alert.
The ramp-up in tensions heightened fears that oil supplies from the world's second-largest producer could be disrupted, sending Brent crude futures to settle up $3.06 at $100.99 a barrel. U.S. oil settled up 4.5% at $95.72 a barrel, after topping $100 last week, their highest since 2014.
The White House said it hasn't ruled out restrictions on U.S. purchases of Russian oil and gas.
The global economy faces significant economic and financial turmoil in Russia, the world's 11th largest economy, that will spill across its borders, analysts warned. 
Even if Western governments allow the purchase of oil and gas from Russia, markets need to digest the disruption to hedging contracts, insurance coverage and energy markets, said Christopher Smart, chief global strategist at Barings Investment Institute.
""If Russian entities are effectively blocked from exchanging their money into the world's reserves currencies, will the Russian government allow the foreign debts to be paid?"" he said.
SAFE HAVENS SHINE
As uncertainty continued to grip markets, investors sought the safety of the dollar, Swiss franc and Japanese yen.
The euro fell 0.48% to $1.1213, while the yen strengthened 0.55% to 114.92 per dollar. The ruble fell to 101.40, down about 20% on the day.
Government debt, such as U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds, which are considered among the safest global assets, were in strong demand.
The 10-year Treasury yield fell 15.6 basis points at 1.828%, down from a high of more than 2% on Friday, while equivalent German yields slid 4.7 basis points to 0.109%.
Money markets continued to push back rate hike expectations with investors now pricing roughly 30 basis points (bps) worth of tightening from the European Central Bank in total this year, down from 35 bps late last week.
Bitcoin rose 10.43% to $41,645.99.

U.S. gold futures settled up 0.7% at $1,900.70 an ounce. Prices for palladium, used by automakers for catalytic converters, rose 5.1% to $2,488.20. Russia's Nornickel is the world's largest supplier of palladium. 
MSCI's Russia equity index slid 25.5%, while London and Frankfurt-listed Russian equity exchange traded funds (ETFs) tanked between 37% and 53% as investors dumped Russian assets.

536,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 04:46PM ET</span>","International banks, funds and exchanges put Russian sanctions into action","By Carolyn Cohn, Saeed Azhar and David Henry
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Banks around the world were winding down relationships with a host of Russian banks as they put Western sanctions against Russia into practice, while funds and exchanges also pulled back and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) disclosed billions of dollars of exposure.
The United States, Britain, Europe and Canada announced new sanctions on Saturday - including blocking certain banks' access to the SWIFT international payment system - following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
An advisory notice from British banking group HSBC, seen by Reuters, told staff how they should apply the new global sanctions on Russia.
Headed ""Action Required"" and dated Feb. 27, it highlights the fact that the UK Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation had authorised ""The wind down of certain transactions involving VTB Bank and certain UK subsidiaries."" VTB, one of Russia's biggest banks, is affected by British sanctions.
HSBC declined to comment.
HSBC has little direct exposure in Russia, with its Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson telling reporters last Tuesday it has around 200 employees and annual revenue of $15 million there, a fraction of its global income of $50 billion.
But as the world's leading trade finance bank and Europe's second-largest lender, HSBC is a vital cog in the global banking machine and being cut off from its services is a blow to Russia.
The London Stock Exchange has suspended the membership of VTB Capital, which is owned by VTB. The suspension means VTB Capital can no longer trade on the LSE.
Other exchanges also made similar moves. Nasdaq Inc and Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc's NYSE have temporarily halted the trading in stocks of Russia-based companies. The halts were due to regulatory concerns as they seek more information following the sanctions, said sources familiar with the matter.
Two leading banks in South Korea confirmed on Monday that while they have not yet received specific guidelines from SWIFT, they stopped trade financing with at least seven Russian banks.
France's Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) said it had ""both anticipated and swiftly put in place all measures linked to new sanctions imposed"", and that its Russian business Rosbank continued to operate in a ""safe manner."" 
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Germany's largest bank, said it had created a website to help its corporate clients deal with the Russia fallout. It includes information on the impact of sanctions and changes in international payment transactions.
International departments of Chinese banks are likely to be monitoring their links with Russian banks, Han-Shen Lin, senior adviser for advisory firm The Asia Group, said. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s CEO Jamie Dimon said banks were talking to the government so everyone understood the issues over sanctions, adding that people were concerned about the unintended consequences.
Lawyers said clients were trying to get to grips with the new rules, although the growing number of different jurisdictions involved and the time lag between the announcement of sanctions and the provision of key details was causing growing confusion.
""Wherever you operate, you are potentially exposed if you're an international business to the sanctions regime of multiple different countries,"" said Marcus Thompson, a London-based partner at Kirkland & Ellis. ""And so the weight and complexity of sanctions increases the obligation to check on an ongoing basis you are complying with the laws of each of those countries where you operate becomes harder and harder."" 
Thompson added: ""We are likely to be in this environment of a very complicated, multipronged, multifaceted sanctions regime for months if not years.""
Among U.S. banks operating in Russia, Citi said total exposure to Russia amounts to nearly $10 billion, higher than previously communicated, following questions over whether it will have to set aside funds to cover potential losses.
Funds were also stepping back from Russia. JPMorgan Asset Management suspended its JPM Emerging Europe Equity fund on Monday, a source familiar with the matter said, and Denmark's Danske Invest said it had suspended trading in equity funds with a significant exposure to Russian shares.
GLOBAL BANKING
HSBC's internal notice also set out other sanctions imposed by Britain, the European Union and the United States and lists other Russian companies subject to the sanctions, including development bank VEB.
In an indication of the far-reaching nature of the restrictions, HSBC pointed out that under U.S. sanctions, an entity that is 50% owned or more, directly or indirectly, by one or more blocked persons is itself also considered blocked, whether or not it is on the sanctions list.
EU sanctions apply a similar rule, HSBC said.
South Korea's Shinhan Bank and a second leading South Korean bank said that they stopped issuing letters of credit and other trade financing to Russian banks PSB, VEB, VTB, Bank Otkritie, Novikombank, Sovcombank, and Sberbank.
The second South Korean bank declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Britain said on Monday it was taking further measures against Russia in concert with the United States and the EU, including banning any British entities from undertaking transactions with the Russian central bank, finance ministry and wealth fund.

Banks are likely to err on the side of caution, said Ross Denton, head of international trade at law firm Ashurst.
""A lot of financial institutions go beyond what the law requires.""

541,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 04:06PM ET</span>",Factbox-Key Russian sovereign and corporate bond payment deadlines in coming days,"LONDON (Reuters) - Tough Western sanctions on Russia and rhetoric from Moscow have raised doubts about whether the Russian government and the country's companies will continue to make payments on their bonds in the coming days, or default on them instead.
The last time the Russian government defaulted was in 1998 when the combination of heavy government spending, the Asian financial crisis and a sharp drop in oil and metals prices - Russia's key revenue earners - caused a currency turmoil. 
Below are four upcoming bond payments to watch.
1) Telecoms firm VEON (NASDAQ:VEON), formerly known as VimpelCOM has a $417 mln bond maturing on Tuesday. The company's shares are actually listed in Amsterdam but a lot of its operations are in Russia, so investors wonder whether this could be the canary in the coal mine. The firm's shares plunged 27% on Monday.
2) Russian Railways has a 23 million euro annual coupon payment to make on one of its 2023 bonds on March 6. The company is state-owned so it will be another key moment to watch. 
3) Russian gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) has a $1.3 billion dollar bond due for repayment on March 7. It will be a huge litmus test of Moscow's attitude towards the international capital markets. 
The firm will want to keep selling its gas to its main European customers and it had over $20 billion in cash on its books at the end of last year, so it has plenty of money to pay, the question is will Vladimir Putin want it to pay? And will the sanctions cause any technical difficulties?

4) The next Russia government bond payment is a 2023 bond 'coupon' payment due on March 16th. The next full 'principal' repayment is a $359 million 2030 bond on March 31st and then a larger $2 billion maturity on April 4th. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimates that the various 'grace periods' built into bonds to give the borrower a bit of extra time in case of technical hiccups means the earliest possible sovereign default would be April 15th. That is when the grace period of 2023 bond coupon payment expires.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed lower Monday, as investors weighed up the impact of hard-hard-hitting sanctions on Russia over its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.
The S&P 500 fell 0.30%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5%,or 179 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.4%.
The sanctions included booting certain Russia banks from the global payment SWIFT, and freezing Russia central bank’s ability to tap its $640 billion of reserves abroad, which serves as a rainy day fund to protect its economy.
Talks between Russia and Ukraine to find a resolution to the conflict are expected to resume in the coming days as both sides pledged  “to keep the negotiations going,” following the first round of talks. 
But reports that Russia has stepped up its aggression in Kharkiv as it continues to move closer to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv stifled hopes for a successful outcome on talks.
Financials, mostly banks, led the market lower as investors weighed up the exposure of U.S. banks to Russia in the wake of tougher sanctions aimed at crippling Russia’s economy to deter Moscow to end its invasion of Ukraine.
Among the biggest decliners,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) fell more than 4% after warning of a $5.4 billion hit from exposure to Russian assets. JPMorgan Chase(NYSE:JPM), meanwhile, suspended its emerging Europe fund and Russia fund, sending its shares more than 4% lower.
As well as the impact of sanctions on Russia, investor sentiment on banks was also hurt by falling U.S. Treasury yields, which trade inversely to prices, as investors fled to safety.
Falling Treasury yields, or rates, hurt the net interest margin of banks, the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to depositors.
Energy was the sole sector in the green, as oil prices jumped 4% on fears of supply disruptions amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.

Investing.com – Stocks came under pressure on Monday after a weekend of rising tensions and increasing sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
Banks were hit especially hard. European countries and American officials moved to block Russian banks from the international bank messaging system SWIFT, making it harder for them to move money around for payments, and officials also moved to freeze Russian central bank assets held abroad. Both moves choked off Russia’s financial system, forcing it to close local stock markets.
The Russian currency also sank to record lows, and television news in the U.S. showed images of Russians standing in long lines to try to withdraw cash from bank machines.
The Nasdaq was on track for its sharpest two month drop since the beginning of the pandemic, Reuters reported.
The Ukraine news is also putting pressure on companies to withdraw their investments in various Russian projects. Oil major BP (NYSE:BP) said over the weekend it would exit its nearly 20% stake in Rosneft, and Shell (LON:RDSa) said Monday it was exiting its stake in Gazprom (MCX:GAZP).
There could be more such divestitures announced in the coming days as the world continues to put pressure on Russia.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Shell Divests
Shell PLC (BS:SHELl) said Monday it intends to exit its joint ventures with Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom and related entities after Russia invaded Ukraine. Shares of the oil major fell nearly 5%.
Shell will sell its 27.5% stake in the Sakhalin-II liquefied natural gas facility in Russia and its 50% stake in the Salym Petroleum Development and the Gydan energy ventures also in Russia. 
2. Salesforce earnings

The enquiry, involving some of the largest banks and financial institutions in the United States, was first launched in October by the regulator to assess if the firms were keeping an adequate track of employees' digital communications.
The scrutiny highlights the challenges Wall Street institutions have faced in tracking staff communications in the work-from-home pandemic era, particularly over personal devices. 
The company said the SEC was investigating Citigroup Global Markets Inc's record-keeping compliance and that it was cooperating with the regulator. 
The SEC has contacted several companies since last year to check if employees' work-related communications, such as messages and emails, have been properly documented. 

Last week, Wall Street giant  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) said it was cooperating with the regulatory body and providing the necessary documents required for the investigation.

LONDON (Reuters) -Europe's financial market on Monday began severing Russia's ties to its critical plumbing for trading, clearing and settling securities as sanctions on Moscow started to bite.
Euroclear in Brussels said it had closed its link to rival settlement house Clearstream Banking in Luxembourg for settling trades in Russian securities in response to European Union financial sanctions, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-isolation-deepens-ukraine-resists-invasion-2022-02-28.
Euroclear, owned by exchanges and banks, and Clearstream, part of Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn), settle securities transactions.
Clearing ensures a trade is completed even if one side goes bust, while settlement is the final leg when legal ownership is swapped between the two sides.
European countries want to stop Russian companies from tapping their markets for financing by barring access to market infrastructure.
""We closed the bridge with Clearstream Banking Luxembourg for the settlement of all Russian domestic securities and all securities denominated in the Russian rouble,"" a Euroclear spokesman said on Monday, referring to settlement of trades transacted inside Russia.
Clearstream said that with immediate effect the rouble is no longer an eligible settlement currency for transactions inside or outside Russia.

UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said on Monday that Britain would introduce legislation to prevent Russian banks from clearing payments in sterling.
Without access to clearing, banks could not access Britain's financial system to trade in sterling denominated assets.

551,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 02:11PM ET</span>",Explainer-Could Germany keep its nuclear plants running?,"By Christoph Steitz and Markus Wacket
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and economy minister Robert Habeck on Sunday mapped out potentially radical changes to the country's energy system, going as far as floating the possibility to keep nuclear power plants running for longer.
WHY BOTHER?
Germany depends massively on Russian gas but Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has caused a political rethink in Berlin.
Overall, gas accounts for more than a fifth of Germany's energy mix, and Russia supplies 38% of it with Norway ranking second at 35%.
Alternatives are now under consideration, including more solar and wind power, liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, gas- and coal-fired power plants as well as possibly a return to nuclear power.
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH GERMANY'S NUCLEAR PLANTS?
Nuclear-fired power plants, which still supplied 12% of Germany's gross electricity generation in 2021, remain controversial in Germany, which decided to shut them down after Japan's Fukushima disaster in 2011.
Of the 17 nuclear power plants Germany had at the time, only three remain in operation now: Isar 2, Emsland and Neckarwestheim 2, which are operated by German energy firms E.ON, RWE and EnBW, respectively.
Under current plans, the plants, with combined capacity of 4,200 gigawatts (GW), will be shut down by the end of 2022.
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO KEEP THE PLANTS RUNNING?
It's politically tricky given opposition from the rank and file of the ecologist Greens party, but not impossible.
Under current legislation the remaining operators will lose the right to operate the plants beyond Dec. 31, 2022, the effective end-date for the stations.
Should Germany's network regulator, which is part of the Economy Ministry, decide that they are critical to Germany's security of supply it could allow them to run for longer, which they could technically do.
""Yes, you can extend the life-span of the nuclear-fired power plants ... if there's the will and the operators are on board,"" said Dirk Uwer, partner at law firm Hengeler Mueller.
Achieving this would still be complex and require parliament to change existing laws, most notably a 2017 deal under which the utilities transferred their decommissioning funds to a public trust.
""There are no longer any prohibitions on thinking,"" said Marc Ruttloff, partner at law firm Gleiss Lutz, who has advised E.ON on various matters related to nuclear energy policy.
Due to the hurdles, however, chances for an extension are rather low, with Germany's minister for nuclear safety - of the Greens party of which Habeck is also a member - saying on Monday such a move was irresponsible and unsafe.
WHAT ARE THE OPERATORS SAYING?
They're not euphoric.
""For years, we have been doing nothing other than preparing both technically and organisationally for the decommissioning of our plants,"" a spokesperson for E.ON's nuclear division PreussenElektra said.
The group neither has the nuclear fuel nor the staff that would be required to keep plants going, the spokesperson added.
RWE said its Emsland plant was scheduled to be decommissioned at the end of 2022, by which time its fuel will have been used up, adding there would be high hurdles to overcome, both technically and in terms of getting the necessary approvals, to extend the life-span.

EnBW, however, is less opposed.
""If it is necessary for the security of supply, EnBW is of course prepared to examine measures in an open-minded manner and to provide advice to the German government,"" it said in e-mailed comments.

552,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 02:07PM ET</span>",Mexico's Pemex posts $6 billion Q4 loss versus year-ago profit,"By Adriana Barrera and Ana Isabel Martinez
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican state oil company Pemex reported a $6.05 billion fourth-quarter net loss on Monday, driven by higher taxes and currency exchange losses despite more oil output, with the firm set to require further big cash infusions from the government.
Pemex , which has long struggled to stay in the black, managed to turn a profit of nearly $5 billion in the year-ago period.
Revenue for the state-run company, known officially as Petroleos Mexicanos, rose almost 80% in the last three months of 2021, boosted by a jump in domestic sales and crude exports.
But tax payments cost the company about 98 billion pesos ($4.78 billion), while a weaker peso versus the U.S. dollar contributed around 22 billion pesos ($1.07 billion) to the quarterly loss.
During his first three years in office, Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sought to prioritize the health of the struggling Mexican oil giant, helping it with its massive debt payments via cash transfers plus a lower tax bill.
His government covered Pemex debt payments in 2021 to the tune of more than 202 billion pesos, or some $9.88 billion, also providing the company with nearly $3.6 billion in tax benefits, according to the firm's filing with the local stock exchange.
Pemex's liquids production, mainly crude and condensates, averaged 1.75 million barrels per day (bpd) for the last three months of 2021, up 4.5% compared with the same quarter in 2020.
The company's 2021 output rose almost 3% from the previous year, powered in large part by growing production from some 30 new priority fields, or 322,000 bpd through the end of last year.
Despite another multi-billion-dollar quarterly loss, the company's top brass sought to put the results in the best light.
""Petroleos Mexicans had a very good year in terms of crude oil production, which is not only stable but continues to grow,"" said Chief Executive Octavio Romero during a call with analysts. 
Pemex expects crude processing at its domestic oil refineries will reach 1 million bpd by end of 2022 to average 900,000 bpd for the year, which is also a top goal of Lopez Obrador, who wants to wean Mexico off of foreign fuel supplies.
The state-run company also reported that its financial debt closed 2021 at $109 billion, down 0.7% from the previous year, due largely to cash from the government.
Debt owned to Pemex service providers totaled $12.9 billion last year.
Pemex said in December it would continue to cut crude exports this year and could suspend them altogether in 2023 as it works to meet the government's target of refining all of its oil domestically.
In January, it took complete ownership of the 340,000-bpd Deer Park refinery in Texas, which adds a seventh refinery to the company's downstream portfolio, and said it would supply the new plant with over 100,000 bpd of its flagship Maya heavy crude.

Pemex is also building a new domestic oil refinery in southern Tabasco state, giving it eight once the Dos Bocas plant is brought online.

554,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 01:51PM ET</span>",Citigroup says total Russian exposure nearly $10 billion,"By David Henry and Niket Nishant
(Reuters) -Citigroup Inc's total exposure to Russia amounts to nearly $10 billion, the bank said on Monday, higher than previously communicated, following questions over whether it will have to set aside funds to cover potential losses.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) listed Russia as 21 among its top 25 country exposures with $5.4 billion of loans, securities and funding commitments at the end of December, compared with $5.5 billion at the end of September. That represents 0.3% of the bank's exposures in 2021, according to a regulatory filing.
Citigroup also gave details of further exposures that had not previously been disclosed.
The United States, Britain, Europe and Canada announced new sanctions on Russia on Saturday - including blocking certain banks' access to the SWIFT international payment system - following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Those sanctions could affect the value of Russian assets held by international banks.
Citigroup said its other exposures include $1.0 billion in cash at the Bank of Russia and other financial institutions and $1.8 billion of reverse repos with various counterparties, taking the count for ""total third-party exposure"" to $8.2 billion.
Citigroup also said it has $1.6 billion of exposures to additional Russian counterparties outside of its Russian subsidiary that are not included in the $8.2 billion.
Citigroup will likely have to add $300 million of reserves for possible losses on nearly $3 billion of funded loans included in that amount, analyst Mike Mayo of  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said in a research note on Monday before the regulatory filing came out.
Mayo reduced his prior estimate for 2022 profits, which he had made before Western nations imposed new sanctions on Russia, for the cost of the reserves. He said consensus estimates from analysts are 20% to 25% too high.

Citigroup warned generally of a potential hit to its business from escalated tensions between the West and Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.
""Citi continues to monitor the current Russia–Ukraine geopolitical situation and economic conditions and will mitigate its exposures and risks as appropriate,"" the bank said in the filing.

555,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 01:33PM ET</span>","Container lines suspend shipments to Russia, Maersk considering","LONDON/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Container shipping company Ocean Network Express (ONE) on Monday suspended bookings to and from Russia while Maersk said it was considering doing the same in response to Western sanctions on Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine.
Russia's assault on its neighbour, which Moscow says is a ""special operation"", is the biggest state-to-state invasion in Europe since World War Two. 
""Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) acceptance to and from St Petersburg, Russia is suspended with immediate effect until further notice whilst we evaluate the operational feasibility,” Singapore-headquartered ONE said in a customer advisory on Monday. 
ONE added that it had also suspended bookings for the Russian port of Novorossiisk as well as the Ukrainian container port of Odessa.
Germany’s Hapag Lloyd said on Feb. 24 it had issued a temporary suspension on bookings for Russia and halted sailings for Ukraine. A Hapag spokesperson said on Monday it was “due to the developments we have seen last week and to ensure we comply with any sanctions imposed”. 
MSC, the world's biggest container line by capacity, said as of Monday it was maintaining shipping and inland services to and from Russia ""in full compliance with international sanctions measures"".
""Bookings for permitted Russia-related cargo will be accepted only with a thorough screening process by MSC with prepayment required for all imports to Russia,"" the company said in a statement.
""We expect Russia-related cargo shipments to be impacted by an increasing number of inspections and controls at European and other international ports."" 
Meanwhile, Maersk said on Monday it was closely monitoring the fast-evolving sanctions and restrictions imposed against Russia, and making preparations to comply with them.
""Our preparations include a possible suspension of Maersk bookings to and from Russia on ocean and inland,"" it said in a statement.
In a coordinated response, the United States, European countries and others have made the unusual move of targeting Russia's central bank with financial sanctions and put limits on cross-border transactions by the country's largest lenders.
Maersk, which handles roughly one in six containers shipped worldwide, said it was focusing on safeguarding types of containers and cold chain operations that ""include important goods such as groceries and pharmaceuticals"".
Maersk said limitations to operations over Russian air space would impact its air services.
A spokesperson declined to elaborate on the possible measures and said the company expects to provide further information later on Monday.
The company last year generated roughly 2.5% of its total revenue from Russia. It operates container shipping routes to St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad in the Baltic Sea, Novorossiysk in the Black Sea, and to Vladivostok and Vostochny on Russia's east coast.
Maersk has been active in Russia since 1992. 
Last week, the company halted all port calls in Ukraine until the end of February and has shut its main office in Odessa on the Black Sea coast.

MSC said it has been unable to serve Ukrainian ports since Feb. 24.
Russia says its actions in Ukraine are designed not to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.

556,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 01:25PM ET</span>",Which banks in Europe are exposed to Russia?,"By Valentina Za
MILAN (Reuters) - A ramping up of financial sanctions against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine has plunged European lenders into turmoil.
The European arm of Sberbank, Russia's biggest lender, faces failure, the European Central Bank (ECB) warned on Monday, after a run on its deposits sparked by the backlash from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Upending the financial sector, Western countries will exclude some Russian lenders from the SWIFT international payments system and, crucially, target the country's central bank to stop it from using its foreign reserves.
The moves aim to undermine Russia's ability to weather wider economic sanctions and threaten Western banks in Russia and exposed to its economy.
In Europe, Italian and French banks have the largest Russian exposure with a little more than $25 billion each at the end of September, followed by Austrian banks with $17.5 billion, data by the Bank of International Settlements show.
By comparison, U.S. banks' exposure is $14.7 billion.
Which banks are affected?
RAIFFEISEN BANK INTERNATIONAL (RBI) 
The Austrian lender's Russian unit ranks as the country's ninth largest bank by loans https://www.rbinternational.com/en/who-we-are/our-network/international-network/raiffeisen-in-russia.html.
With overall assets of 15.8 billion euros, it employs around 8,700 staff to serve more than 4.5 million customers. Its equity of 2.4 billion euros file:///C:/Users/u8018106/OneDrive%20-%20Thomson%20Reuters%20Incorporated/Documents/2022-02-02%20Presentation%20RBI%20(3).pdf represents 18% of consolidated equity.
The Austrian bank's Russian exposure totalled 22.85 billion euros file:///C:/Users/u8018106/OneDrive%20-%20Thomson%20Reuters%20Incorporated/Documents/2022-02-02%20Presentation%20RBI%20(2).pdf, more than half relating to the corporate private sector, it said in its 2021 results presentation.
Russia's central bank accounts for 8% of RBI's exposure to the country, sovereign entities for 4% and Russian banks for 2%. 
The overall figure comprises 11.6 billion euros in customer loans (or 11.5% of group). Just over 80% of the loans are in Russian roubles, with foreign currency lending reserved for borrowers with a matching forex exchange income.
However, cross border exposure to Russia is only 1.6 billion with no parent funding from Vienna. Raiffeisen also holds 2.2 billion euros in loans to Ukrainian customers.
Provisions against losses cover 64.3% of RBI's impaired exposures in Russia.
RBI Chief Executive Johann Strobl told Reuters that the group's Russian subsidiary ""had a very strong liquidity position and (was) recording inflows"".
SOCIETE GENERALE
The French bank, which operates Russian unit Rosbank, had 18 billion euros https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/documents/2022-02/Q4-21-Financial-Results-Presentation.pdf of overall exposure to Russia at the end of last year - or 1.7% of the total for the group.
That includes both on- and off-balance sheet items (for example a credit line that has not yet been tapped) under a risk disclosure definition known as 'exposure at default'.
Of SogGen's Russian exposure, 39% is to the corporate sector and 36% to retail. Sovereign entities account for 21%, financial institutions for 4%.
Actual loans grew 13.3% last year to 10.5 billion euros.
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) started doing business in Russia in 1872 then left the country in 1917, the year of the Bolshevik revolution, to return in 1973. It has 1.5 million local customers.
Its Russian retail business - to which 1.05 billion euros of capital was allocated on average last year - turned in 115 million euros in 2021 net income, up from 37 million euros in 2020. When including financial services, net income at SG Russia was 152 million euros, versus 76 million in 2020.
The bank said it had implemented measures to adapt to the new sanctions imposed against Russia and that its Russian unit Rosbank continued to operate in a ""safe manner"".
UNICREDIT
Italy's only lender deemed of global systemic importance by regulators owns a subsidiary in Russia which ranks as the country's 14th largest bank. UniCredit Russia's 2.3 billion euros in equity accounts for 3.7% of the group's total. 
UniCredit's exposure at default relating to Russia totalled 14.2 billion euros based on its Pillar 3 risk disclosure requirements, as of mid-2021.
Of the total figure, around 8 billion euros are loans extended by the Russian arm and locally funded, while the rest includes off-balance sheet items and cross-border loans mainly granted by UniCredit SpA towards large corporates outside of Russia.
UniCredit said last week its Russian franchise accounted for only around 3% of group revenues and provisioned covered 84% of its non-performing exposures.
INTESA SANPAOLO
Rival Italian heavyweight Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) is also active in Russia where it has financed major investment projects such as the 'Blue Stream' gas pipeline and the sale of a stake in oil producer Rosneft.
Intesa's loan exposure to Russia totalled 5.57 billion euros at the end of 2021 https://group.intesasanpaolo.com/content/dam/portalgroup/repository-documenti/investor-relations/presentazioni-it/2022/Presentazione_FY21_IT.pdf, or 1.1% of the total. 
Its subsidiaries in Russia and Ukraine have assets, respectively, of 1 billion euros and 300 million euros, which together represent just 0.1% of the group's total assets. 
Intesa, Italy's biggest bank, handles more than half of all commercial transactions between the two countries. 
ING 
The Dutch bank has around 4.5 billion euros in outstanding loans with Russian clients and around 600 million euros with clients in Ukraine, out of a total loan book worth more than 600 billion euros.

The majority of these loans are in euros and dollars, mostly project finance and collateralised loans, and in a good number of cases loans and collateral are outside Russia or Ukraine.
ING said many sanctions against Russia had been in place since 2014.

After ordering that the fund’s investments in Russia be frozen, the finance ministry has asked Norges Bank to prepare a proposal for the implementation of the sale, including dates for adjusting the benchmark index and changes in the investment universe, according to a letter from the ministry. The timeline could be shortened if the situation changes significantly, it said.
The Oslo-based fund is the world’s biggest owner of publicly traded companies with a portfolio of about 9,000 stocks. The government announced late on Sunday a decision to drop Russian assets from the fund in response to the country’s invasion of Ukraine.
With Russia on Monday announcing a ban on selling shares on the Moscow Stock Exchange, it may take time to complete the sale, the ministry said. The sale must take place within the current sanctions, which are legally binding.
The decision covers Russian financial instruments, real estate, infrastructure and cash holdings, and also means that the Russian stock market will be removed from the benchmark, the ministry said.

The legislation, which Ford called a first for a Canadian province, includes clarity around hours and pay calculations. It also includes protection against dismissal from a digital platform without proper notice or explanation, and ensure tips that workers earn remain with them, Ford told reporters.
""In the last two years, we've seen huge shifts around traditional labor markets and as we build a resilient economy, our government must keep pace with those changes,"" Ford said.
The proposal will have to go through the legislative process and be voted on by the provincial parliament, though Ford's government holds a majority, making its passage likely.
Gig companies have long been criticized for the lack of benefits and protections they offer drivers.

Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc in January reached an agreement with Canada's largest services-sector union to offer employee-like benefits to contractors who work as ride-hail and food delivery drivers. 
Uber and United Food and Commercial Workers Canada (UFCW) had said they would jointly lobby Canada's provincial governments to pass labor reforms that would provide gig workers with minimum earnings, a benefits fund that includes pension and sick pay and other rights.

Licht who helped create MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" and gave ""CBS This Morning"" a newsier focus, will step into a news organization that has been in turmoil since the abrupt exit of its longtime leader, Jeff Zucker, who resigned in early February. 
""I have known and admired Chris for more than 15 years and strongly believe he is the best person to lead CNN Global as part of Warner Bros Discovery,"" Discovery CEO David Zaslav, who will lead the new Warner Bros Discovery, said in a statement.
CNN's current owner, AT&T (NYSE:T), is preparing to spin off the news organization along with the rest of WarnerMedia in a $43 billion acquisition that could be completed as soon as April, according to one source.
Licht is currently the executive producer of ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" which received an Emmy Award in 2021 for its a special, ""Stephen Colbert's Election Night 2020: Democracy's Last Stand."" 
Paramount Global's CBS unit promoted Licht to executive vice president of special programming in 2016, where he consulted on various forms of content across the network.
Discovery expects Licht to start at CNN in early May and report directly to Zaslav.
""I think he’s walking into a hornet’s nest of talent,"" said one longtime news executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""I think it’s going to be thankless. But he’s proven adept, over the years,"" at managing talent.
Licht issued a statement lauding CNN's legacy, and adding, “I’m honored to have this opportunity, especially at such an important time for our country and the world."" 

Under Licht's guidance, ""CBS This Morning"" became the network's most successful morning newscast in two decades, earing a Peabody Award, two news and documentary Emmys and one Daytime Emmy. However, it lagged behind the two dominant morning news shows, ABC's ""Good Morning America"" and NBC's ""Today"" show, which invested more heavily in the programming. 
Licht joined CBS News from MSNBC, where he was the co-creator and original executive producer of ""Morning Joe.""

566,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 12:06PM ET</span>","Twitter will label, reduce visibility of tweets linking to Russian state media","By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) - Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) is adding labels and reducing the visibility for tweets containing content from Russian state-affiliated media websites like RT and Sputnik, the social media company said on Monday.
It said that since Russia invaded Ukraine on Thursday, it had seen more than 45,000 tweets a day from people sharing these links. Twitter said this meant the majority of content from state-affiliated media was coming from individuals sharing the material rather than the state-affiliated media accounts it already labels. 
State-run media, which has long been a contentious presence on major social platforms, has emerged as a key battleground in Moscow's stand-off with big tech companies during the Ukraine crisis. 
Last week, Russia said it would partially restrict Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for censoring its media, a move the company said came after it refused Russian authorities' request to stop independent fact-checks and labels on content from some state-owned media organizations. 
Twitter, which has faced punitive site slowdowns from Russia, said on Saturday that its site was being restricted for users in the country.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and Facebook-owner Meta have also banned Russian state-controlled media from earning money through ads on their platforms.
Twitter said the label would automatically be applied to any tweets with a URL from a designated state-affiliated media website. It will also reduce the visibility of these tweets by not recommending them to users and taking them out of the 'Top Search' function.

The company started labeling and ""de-amplifying"" state-affiliated accounts belonging to Russia and several other countries in 2020. It stopped allowing advertising from accounts owned by RT and Sputnik in 2017 following the U.S. presidential election and in 2019, it banned ads from all state-backed media.
Twitter said it was starting to add the new labels on tweets linking to Russian state media content but it intended to add additional state-backed outlets from other countries in the coming weeks.

The request to remove the app in Lithuania is in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the transport ministry said in a statement.
Yandex did not immediately comment. 
""Security of our people and their data is of utmost importance now ... The ride-hailing app, which threatens our national security, must be stopped in Lithuania,"" transport minister Marius Skuodis said in the statement.
Yandex.taxi is not licensed in Lithuania as the service is provided by drivers who enroll via the app, the ministry said.
Lithuanian state Cyber Security Centre in 2018 advised against using the app, saying it suspects the app collects excessive amounts of user data and can send it to servers in Russia, making it available to Russian security officers.
In response, Lithuania 15min news outlet quoted a Yandex official saying all user data is processed within the European Union.

Uber holds a 29% stake in Yandex's mobility businesses, which include ride-hailing and car-sharing.
But as of late December, Yandex has an American call option to acquire that stake from Uber for around $2 billion if exercised in September 2023.

569,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 11:41AM ET</span>",TD expands in U.S. with $13.4 billion First Horizon purchase in its biggest-ever deal,"By Nichola Saminather, Manya Saini and Niket Nishant
(Reuters) -Toronto-Dominion Bank Group said on Monday it will buy First Horizon (NYSE:FHN) Corp for $13.4 billion in cash to expand its footprint in the southeastern United States, as the Canadian lender bets on rapid population growth in the region with its record acquisition.
The deal is the culmination of a concerted hunt for U.S. acquisitions by TD, Canada's second-largest bank by market value, and follows unsuccessful bids for other U.S. assets in recent months.
TD will pay $25 for each First Horizon share, a 37% premium to the target's last close, funding the deal entirely with its excess capital, it said.
Shares of Memphis-based First Horizon jumped 20% to $23.78 in New York. TD shares fell 2.1% to C$102.50 ($80.82) in Toronto, versus a 0.55% decline in the Toronto stock benchmark. 
The deal will make TD the sixth-largest U.S. bank, from No. 8, with about $614 billion in assets, operating in 22 states, the bank said. The populations in First Horizon's markets are expected to grow about 50% faster than the U.S. national average, offering growth opportunities, TD said.
""We are positive on the transaction as it not only deploys TD’s significant excess capital profitably but also infills its southeastern platform and extends around the Gulf Coast,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Analyst John Aiken said in a note. 
The deal is TD's biggest ever, Aiken said.
Canada's top six lenders control about 90% of domestic banking operations, and they have been accelerating their expansion into the more fragmented U.S. market, helped by billions of dollars in excess capital. Bank of Montreal in December agreed to pay $16.3 billion for BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY)' U.S. unit.
SURPLUS CAPITAL 
TD's core capital level after the deal will remain above the minimum set by the regulator, executives said. It had about C$21.6 billion of excess capital as of Oct. 31.
The deal comes amid a stream of tie-ups among midsized U.S. lenders in the last two years, seeking to build scale to better compete against the country's largest banks.
Southeastern regional lender BB&T Corp bought SunTrust Banks (NYSE:STI) in 2019 to create Truist Financial (NYSE:TFC) Corp in the biggest bank deal since the 2008 financial crisis. First Horizon itself bought Iberiabank (NASDAQ:IBKC_old) in 2020.
TD's acquisition will yield pretax cost savings of $610 million, as well as additional ""meaningful"" revenue synergies, executives said. TD, which expects merger and integration costs of $1.3 billion, has no plans to close any branches or to scale down any of First Horizon's existing businesses, they said.
Should the deal not close before Nov. 27, First Horizon shareholders will receive another 65 cents per share on an annualized basis until the closing date.
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is pushing regulators, including the Federal Reserve, to take a tougher line on mergers amid worries that declining competition is hurting Americans. 
""There have been instances where some deals have been slightly delayed,"" TD Chief Executive Bharat Masrani said on the call. ""So (the additional payment) does compensate First Horizon shareholders should there be a delay."" 

Separately, smaller Canadian rival Bank of Nova Scotia said on Monday it will acquire Grupo Said's 16.8% stake in Scotiabank Chile for C$1.3 billion, increasing its ownership share to 99.8%.

570,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 11:36AM ET</span>",Toyota suspends domestic factory operations after suspected cyber attack,"TOKYO (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp said it will suspend domestic factory operations on Tuesday, losing around 13,000 cars of output, after a supplier of plastic parts and electronic components was hit by a suspected cyber attack. 
No information was immediately available about who was behind the possible attack or the motive. The attack comes just after Japan joined Western allies in clamping down on Russia after it invaded Ukraine, although it was not clear if the attack was at all related. 
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said his government would investigate the incident and whether Russia was involved. 
""It is difficult to say whether this has anything to do with Russia before making thorough checks,"" he told reporters. 
Kishida on Sunday announced that Japan would join the United States and other countries in blocking some Russian banks from accessing the SWIFT international payment system. He also said Japan would give Ukraine $100 million in emergency aid.
A spokesperson at the supplier, Kojima Industries Corp, said it appeared to have been the victim of some kind of cyber attack. 
A spokesperson from Toyota described it as a ""supplier system failure."" 
The company does not yet know if the halt at its 14 plants in Japan, which account for about a third of its global production, will last more than a day, the spokesperson added.
Some plants operated by Toyota's affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu are included in the shutdown.
Toyota, which has experienced cyber attacks in the past, is a pioneer of Just-In-Time manufacturing with parts that arrive from suppliers going straight to the production line rather than being stockpiled.
State actors have launched cyberattacks on Japanese corporations in the past, including an attack on  Sony  Corp (T:6758) in 2014, which exposed internal data and shut down computer systems. 
The United States blamed North Korea for that attack, which came after Sony (NYSE:SONY) released ""The Interview"", a comedy about a plot to assassinate the regime's leader Kim Jong Un.

Toyota's production halt comes as the world's biggest automaker is already tackling supply chain disruptions around the world caused by the COVID pandemic, which has forced it and other carmakers to curb output. 
Toyota this month also saw some production stopped in North America due to parts shortages caused by the Canadian trucker protests.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States government on Monday proposed extending temporary waivers of international minimum flight requirements at some U.S. airports through late October due to COVID-19.
Airlines can lose their slots at some congested airports if they do not use them at least 80% of the time. The waivers have been in place since the pandemic began in March 2020. International passenger air travel in 2021 was down 46% to 61 million over 2019 levels, but up over the 34 million international air passengers in 2020.
The Federal Aviation Administration said it proposed extending temporary waivers of the requirements at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia airport and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport that were set to expire in October after petitions from airlines.
At four other U.S. airports where the FAA has a formal schedule-review process - Chicago O’Hare, Newark in New Jersey, Los Angeles and San Francisco - the agency proposes to extend credits to airlines for flights that were canceled in the pandemic as though those flights were operated.
The FAA said ""based on global vaccination rates, changing infection rates and the threat of new virus strains, continued unpredictability of travel restrictions, and the disparity between demand for domestic air travel and demand for international air travel, extending the current limited, conditional waiver for international operations by all carriers, is reasonable.""

The government said that American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines submitted a joint petition to ""urgently request continued relief from standard international slot usage rules"" during the 2022 summer season.
The airlines said the ""COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively impact worldwide air travel; the Omicron variant has caused governments to significantly restrict or control entry of passengers and airline crew members and unfortunately, the future remains unpredictable.""

NIO shares have bounced Monday, rising 8% above Friday's closing price. 
The company will list its shares on the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited, with its American depositary shares (ADSs), continuing their primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange.
NIO shares are expected to commence trading on the Main Board of the SEHK on March 10. The shares will be listed ""by way of introduction,"" meaning a portion of NIO's existing shares will be available for trading in Hong Kong. The decision means the company won't sell new shares or raise any money.
The move comes at a time of heightened regulatory risk for Chinese companies in both the US and China, providing a way to offset some of the risk of being delisted from U.S. exchanges. 
Citi analyst Jeff Chung reiterated a Buy rating and $87 price target on NIO following the news, telling investors in a note that NIO's Hong Kong listing will mitigate the political risks.

(Reuters) -Electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors Corp said on Monday it plans to sell its first 500 Endurance electric pickup trucks this year even as expenses related to the launch surged in the fourth quarter, sending its shares down 16%.
The company, when it went public under the previous management, had previously forecast sales of about 32,000 vehicles in the first full year of production. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst Mark Delaney said the target of 500 cars was ""well below"" Street estimates and had based his revenue estimates based on 2,250 deliveries in 2022 and 10,000 units in 2023.
The Ohio-based startup had delayed the launch of the new electric truck by three months due to supply-chain issues and has never sold a vehicle and did not record any revenue in the fourth quarter.
Legacy automakers have made a drastic shift to focus on electric cars as demand increases, while startup companies are gearing for new launches this year, making competition more intense as they try to take on industry leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc
Lordstown is spending heavily to launch its first truck that will rival with Ford and General Motor's new electric trucks, also expected to hit the market this year. It expects to increase production five-fold by 2023.
The company's Chief Executive Officer Dan Ninivaggi said the cost of materials and components at launch will be significantly higher than the vehicle's anticipated selling price but would improve over time. 

For the fourth quarter, net loss widened to $81.2 million as it incurred a total of $115 million in expenses, some related to the commercial launch of Endurance. 
Lordstown is also in discussions with Taiwanese technology company Foxconn Technology Co to develop vehicles and has considered alternatives to raise capital for the partnership.

FRANKFURT/VIENNA/SARAJEVO (Reuters) -The European arm of Sberbank, Russia's biggest lender, faces failure, the European Central Bank (ECB) warned on Monday, after a run on its deposits sparked by the backlash from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Western allies have taken unprecedented steps to isolate Russia's economy and financial system, including sanctioning its central bank and excluding some of its lenders from the SWIFT messaging system, used for trillions' of dollars of transactions.
Sberbank Europe and two other subsidiaries were set to fail, after ""significant deposit outflows"" linked to ""geopolitical tensions"", according to the ECB. Austria's Financial Market Authority imposed a moratorium on Sberbank Europe, which is based in the country.
Separately, Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn), the German stock exchange operator, said that it was suspending from trading a number of securities from Russian issuers with immediate effect. The list includes Sberbank.
""We've triggered a run on this kind of bank,"" said Hans-Peter Burghof, a professor at the University of Hohenheim.
Western banks and their lawyers are scrambling to assess the impact of the wave of sanctions, which prompted Russia's central bank to more than double its main interest rate on Monday and introduce some capital controls to try and stabilize the rouble. 
Russia's central bank stands ready to support the nation's banking sector following the high demand for cash, its governor Elvira Nabiullina said.
Shares of leading European banks sank with the European banking sector down 5.4%, steeper than a 1.9% fall for the Euro Stoxx index.
The market turmoil came as ceasefire talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials began on the Belarusian border on Monday and as Russia faced deepening economic isolation four days after invading Ukraine. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"".
European banks with significant operations in Russia were hit the hardest on Monday. Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International fell 13.8% as it said it was working through the impact of sanctions.
""Our Russian subsidiary bank has a very strong liquidity position and is recording inflows,"" RBI's chief executive Johann Strobl said in a statement to Reuters. 
The ECB's warning extended to Sberbank subsidiaries in Croatia and Slovenia. Sberbank is majority owned by Russia.
The lender said in a statement that several of its subsidiaries saw ""significant outflow of client deposits within a very short time"" and that it was in close contact with regulators.
Sberbank's branches in Slovenia were closed until Wednesday and services temporarily limited to card transactions with a withdrawal limit of 400 euros a day, the Slovenian central bank said on Monday. 
The issue has disrupted government benefit payouts through Sberbank. Some 1,000 child welfare payments have been rejected, according to the nation's labour ministry.
The Croatian central bank said depositors at Sberbank, which has about a 2% share of the country's banking market, would be allowed to withdraw just under 1000 euros a day. 
Sberbank Europe said in November it had reached a deal to sell its subsidiaries in Croatia, Slovenia, Hungary, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to a group including Serbia's AIK bank and Slovenia's Gorenjska bank. 

Serbian regulators gave their consent on Monday, the only ones yet to do so. Gorenjska said it was no longer viable to proceed with the acquisition of Sberbank's Slovenian subsidiary in the current situation.
Depository receipts of Sberbank on the London Stock Exchange were down 70%.

Investing.com – PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) and Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) traded around 1% higher Monday after getting a double upgrade from Bank of America Securities (NYSE:BAC) due to favorable risk-reward profile.
The brokerage is now rating the homebuilders ‘buy’ from ‘underperform’ earlier.
BofA maintained its target for Pulte at $58, over 22% higher than the stock’s current price of $49.  Toll Brothers  is seen at $63, around 17% higher than its current level of $54. Analyst Rafe Jadrosich earlier had a target of $61 for the stock.
Pulte recently announced a $1 billion share buyback program.
According to Jadrosich, industry tailwinds and fundamentals remain strong, despite the recent increase in interest rates.
Pulte currently trades at discount on price-to-book relative to its return-on-equity compared to peers while Toll Brothers is at a slight premium, the analyst said, while adding that both should outperform compared to their peers.
Jadrosich pointed out that roughly 75% of Toll’s land was purchased pre-pandemic (~3 year supply) and should provide a long runway for healthy margins."

LONDON/BOSTON (Reuters) - As investors and businesses increasingly pledge to cut their carbon emissions, scientists on Monday offered a fresh warning about the need to better understand and plan for the physical damage caused by global warming.
Rising sea levels, water and food scarcity, as well as the impacts of hurricanes, floods and drought are likely to become more frequent and severe, leaving companies and their investors exposed to mounting losses that are poorly understood.
A report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a ""dire warning"" of the consequences of failing to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and adapting properly to the impacts of climate change.
""It should be a wake up call for the financial system,"" said Cinzia Losenno, climate adaptation lead at the European Investment Bank, the lending arm of the European Union, which is targeting adaptation spend of 4 billion euros ($4.48 billion) a year by 2025.
""We're getting better at understanding the risks of investing in high carbon assets, the transition risk, but not so good in the financial system in understanding... the impact of climate risk on assets.""
Ian Simm, founder and CEO at Impax Asset Management, said the ""hard-hitting"" report highlighted the scale of uncertainty facing companies and the need for more radical action to prepare.
ARMS AROUND THE DATA
Regulators around the globe are only beginning to lay out rules for how companies should disclose the impact of their operations on climate change, and the risks they could face.
An analysis in October of groups using the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures framework, designed to ensure companies properly disclose climate risks, found many were still not reporting fully.
""On the whole disclosure is massively lacking,"" said Chris Goolgasian, director of climate research and portfolio manager on the Sustainable Investment Team at U.S. asset manager Wellington Management, which invests more than $1 trillion.
""Are some companies tackling it full on and doing a good job? Sure. Is the median company doing that? No. The median company is not disclosing enough for Wall Street to analyse all the risk factors and all of the plans to address them."" 
To help get a better grip on the data, Wellington has teamed up with the Woodwell Climate Research Center to push for companies to disclose the physical location of their assets and operations.
""Companies must prepare themselves for the impacts of climate change and show that they have the ability to adapt, be it through resilient supply chains or business models, efforts toward adaptation are now the minimum requirement for survival,"" said Nicolette Bartlett, Chief Impact Officer at climate data non-profit CDP.
Bartlett said the IPCC report had made the need to focus on getting to 1.5C ""even more critical"" and that failure to do so would make adaptation harder, calling for companies to publish five-year action plans that drive capital expenditure.
Oliver Johnson, Head of ESG at Climate Asset Management, which is focused on nature-based solutions such as sustainable forestry, said the report showed the need for companies, cities and countries to focus on building more resilient ""green"" infrastructure to increase the adaptive capacity of ecosystems.
""Investors that don't take climate physical risks into account potentially face disruptions including the increased risk of forest fires, reduced yields and higher insurance premiums to name a few,"" he said.

""As regulations around climate change disclosure increase, we believe those investors that are demonstrably managing these risks will be better placed to access capital.""

581,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 10:22AM ET</span>",BP quits Russia in up to $25 billion hit after Ukraine invasion,"By Ron Bousso and Dmitry Zhdannikov
LONDON (Reuters) - BP (NYSE:BP) is abandoning its stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft in an abrupt and costly end to three decades of operating in the energy-rich country, marking the most significant move yet by a Western company in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Rosneft accounts for around half of BP's oil and gas reserves and a third of its production and divesting the 19.75% stake will result in charges of up to $25 billion, the British company said, without saying how it plans to extricate itself.
""I have been deeply shocked and saddened by the situation unfolding in Ukraine and my heart goes out to everyone affected. It has caused us to fundamentally rethink bp's position with Rosneft,"" BP Chief Executive Bernard Looney said.
The rapid retreat represents a dramatic exit for BP, the biggest foreign investor in Russia, and puts the spotlight on other Western companies with operations in the country including France's TotalEnergies and Britain's Shell (LON:RDSa), amid an escalating crisis between the West and Moscow.
It also underscores growing pressure from Western governments on their companies to curtail operations in Russia as they widen a net of economic sanctions against Moscow.
British Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who on Friday had expressed ""concern"" over BP's Rosneft, welcomed the decision. 
""Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine must be a wake up call for British businesses with commercial interests in (President Vladimir) Putin's Russia,"" Kwarteng said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Rosneft blamed BP's decision on ""unprecedented political pressure"", Russian news agencies reported, saying 30 years of successful cooperation had been ruined.
Susannah Streeter, senior investment analyst at British retail stock broker  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), said it will be ""highly difficult"" for BP ""to recover anywhere near what was considered to be the full value"" of Rosneft.
Last week, Looney said that BP was sticking to its Russian business and would comply with any Western sanctions on Moscow.
Earlier, Putin put Russia's nuclear deterrent on high alert in the face of Western reprisals for his invasion of Ukraine, which included blocking access to the SWIFT international payment system for some Russian banks.
And Norway's $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, will divest its Russian assets after the Ukraine invasion, its prime minister said.
DIVIDEND BLOW 
BP said its move and financial hit will not impact its short and long term financial targets within its strategy to shift away from oil and gas to low-carbon fuels and renewables energy.
But Hargreaves Lansdown's Streeter said a write down of this magnitude is ""likely to limit the extent to which BP can continue to accelerate its transition towards renewables.""
Looney and his predecessor as CEO Bob Dudley will both step down from the board of Rosneft, which BP acquired a shareholding in as part of its $12.5 billion TNK-BP stake sale in 2013.
BP held a board meeting on Friday and another on Sunday where the decision to quit Rosneft, as well as two other joint ventures BP has with Rosneft in Russia, was taken, a spokesperson for the company said.
It will take an $11 billion foreign exchange non-cash charge after the exit from Rosneft, which BP will no longer include in its accounts. BP said it also expects a second non-cash charge of up to $14 billion, for the ""carrying value"" of Rosneft. 
BP received revenue from Rosneft in the form of dividends which totalled around $640 million in 2021, roughly 3% of its overall cash flow from operations. 
The company currently has around 200 employees in Russia, most of whom are local staff, the BP spokesperson said. 
Many other Western energy companies have operations in Russia, including TotalEnergies which holds a 19.4% Novatek stake and 20% of the Yamal LNG project.

""In the current environment any European or American company with assets in Russia must be considering similar moves,"" Eurasia Group analyst Henning Gloystein told Reuters.

LONDON (Reuters) - British bank HSBC is beginning to wind down relations with a host of Russian banks including the second-largest, VTB, according to a memo seen by Reuters, as financial institutions start to implement restrictions on Russia.
The United States, Britain, Europe and Canada announced new sanctions on Russia on Saturday - including blocking certain lenders' access to the SWIFT international payment system - following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The advisory notice from HSBC, one of the world's largest banks, tells staff how they should apply the new global sanctions on Russia.
Headed ""action required"" and dated Feb 27, it highlights the fact that the UK Office of Financial Sanctions had authorised ""the wind down of certain transactions involving VTB Bank and certain UK subsidiaries"".
HSBC declined to comment. 
HSBC has little direct exposure in Russia, with its Chief Financial Officer telling reporters last Tuesday it has around 200 employees and annual revenues of $15 million there, a fraction of its global income of $50 billion.
As the world's leading trade finance bank and Europe's second-largest lender, however, HSBC remains a vital cog in the global banking machine and being cut off from its services is a blow for Russia.
The internal notice also sets out other sanctions imposed in recent days by Britain, the European Union and the United States and lists other Russian companies subject to the sanctions, including development bank VEB.
In an indication of the far-reaching nature of the restrictions, HSBC points out that under U.S. sanctions, an entity that is 50% owned or more, directly or indirectly, by one or more blocked persons is itself also considered blocked, whether or not it is on the sanctions list.
EU sanctions apply a similar rule, HSBC said.

Britain said on Monday it was taking further measures against Russia in concert with the U.S. and the EU, including banning any British entities from undertaking transactions with the Russian central bank, finance ministry and wealth fund.
The London Stock Exchange on Friday said it had suspended VTB unit VTB Capital's membership.

Investing.com — American electric vehicle automaker Lordstown Motors Corp (NASDAQ:RIDE) is down more than 6% Monday after it reported fourth quarter and full-year results. 
The company reported a loss per share of 42 cents. Analysts polled by Investing.com predicted a loss per share of 77 cents. 
The Lordstown, Ohio-based company said it ended 2021 with a cash balance of $244 million, driven by disciplined spending, favorable working capital, additional equity issuances, and a deferral of certain investments into 2022.
The pre-revenue company expects commercial production and sales of the Endurance — a full-size electric pickup truck — of approximately 500 units in 2022, growing to up to 2,500 units in 2023.
Those numbers have disappointed investors, with Lordstown shares down more than 16% shortly after the open. 
""Our organization's top priority remains bringing the Lordstown Endurance full size all-electric pickup to market as quickly and efficiently as possible,"" said Edward Hightower, President of Lordstown. 
""In the fourth quarter and into 2022, we continued to build and test pre-production vehicles that we are using to complete a variety of validation activities needed to achieve full homologation. Despite ongoing challenges securing parts and other supply chain issues, we continue to target commercial production and sales in the third quarter of 2022.""
Lordstown added that they are working to finalize the Foxconn transaction, which includes a contract manufacturing agreement and an agreement and funding structure to develop new vehicles in collaboration with Foxconn, based on the MIH platform — a software and hardware open platform for electric vehicles."

Investing.com --- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Monday as drastic new sanctions enacted by the West on Russia over the weekend drew a furious response and further threats of escalation from the Kremlin. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 392 points, or 1.2%, at 33,667 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.2% and the NASDAQ Composite was down 1.0%.
Earlier Monday, the U.S. Treasury said it would impose sanctions on the Russian Central Bank - a measure which, in conjunction with others taken over the weekend in Europe - will freeze over half of Russia's foreign reserves and severely limit its foreign trade. The Russian ruble fell over 20% against the dollar in response. President Vladimir Putin responded over the weekend by placing his strategic nuclear forces on high alert, while Russia's invading forces intensified their attacks on Ukraine's cities, striking residential areas with long-range missiles. 
Aviation stocks were among the worst hit: AerCap (NYSE:AER) stock fell 12.4% after it said it would halt leasing to Russia, a market that accounts for 5% of its revenue.
The escalation supported defense and energy stocks, with  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) stock rising 4.6% and Raytheon (NYSE:RTX) stock rising 1.5%.  With oil prices surging again due to fears that supplies out of Russia - the world's second-largest exporter - will be disrupted,  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock fell 0.8%, outperforming the broader market but still depressed by fears about its own exposure to Russia, where it operates the massive Sakhalin-1 oil field. 
Exxon's rival  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) fared better, supported by news of a $3.15 billion acquisition of Renewable Energy Group (NASDAQ:REGI), whose stock rose 38%. By contrast, BP ADRs (NYSE:BP) fell 6.9% after it said it would exit its near-20% stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft immediately. The holding has generated a large part of BP's cash flow for the last seven years. 
There was also M&A news in the financial sector, where Toronto Dominion (TSX:TD) said it will buy First Horizon National (NYSE:FHN) for $13.4 billion, a 37% premium to Friday's close. The deal will make TD, which already has a sizeable presence in the U.S. through its Ameritrade unit, into the country's sixth-biggest lender, according to some estimates.
Financials were nonetheless hit by concerns about their exposure - direct and indirect - to Russia, and by the renewed fall in bond yields that will depress their lending margins.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock lost 4.2%, while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock fell 3.3% and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock fell 3.2%.
Despite the shock to financial markets out of eastern Europe, analysts still said U.S. equities were well supported by fundamentals. 
Fidelity analyst Naveen Malwal argued that the U.S. is likely not to get directly involved in the conflict, and that its economy ""is still in a mid-cycle expansion"" despite the headwind from higher energy prices. Malwal pointed to ""strong consumer spending, a tight job market, and rising corporate profits.""

PARIS/DUBAI (Reuters) -Airbus hit back in an escalating dispute with Qatar Airways over A350 jets on Monday, asking a British judge to award $220 million in damages over two undelivered airliners.
The planemaker's claim for two A350s that Qatar's national carrier has rejected comes after the airline sued Airbus for $600 million over degradation on more than 20 jets recently grounded by Qatar.
Airbus also wants to recover millions of dollars of credits awarded to the airline, a filing showed, offering a rare glimpse into negotiating details in the secretive global aircraft industry.
The counter-offensive is the latest salvo in a months-old contractual and safety dispute that has brought ties between Qatar and one of France's most high-profile firms to a low as Qatar prepares for an influx of visitors for the World Cup.
Once basking in headlines as they signed multi-billion-dollar deals at air shows, the two sides are now locked in an unprecedented public dispute over erosion to the painted surface and lightning protection on the Airbus A350 airliner.
Qatar Airways has said the surface degradation raises unanswered questions over the safety of the jets, prompting its regulator to ground planes one by one as the problem appears.
Airbus reiterated that the planes are safe because of margins built into the anti-lightning system and accused the airline of instigating the regulator's decision. 
Qatar Airways had no immediate comment. Qatar's aviation authority did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The row dates back to November 2020 when Qatar Airways sent one of its large A350s to be repainted in a special livery for the FIFA World Cup which the Gulf state is set to host this year.
That led to the discovery of more than 900 surface flaws and damage to anti-lightning mesh, according to Qatar Airways. 
The two sides later agreed a compensation clause whose value has risen to $206,500 per plane per day. 
But they disagree about whether that has been activated and even if it has been, whether it applies to the rest of the grounded fleet.
'ECONOMIC INTEREST'
Airbus has acknowledged wider A350 quality problems after a Reuters investigation in November revealed that at least five other airlines had reported similar findings. 
But it has accused Qatar Airways alone of misportraying them as safety issues. 
Monday's filing said it was in the interests of the airline, which launched the A350 programme as its largest customer, to keep the planes grounded and seek Airbus compensation because of lower long-haul travel demand following the pandemic.
Qatar Airways has said the country's regulator is strictly independent and that it needs the planes to fly for the World Cup, forcing it to lay out new costs in leasing replacement aircraft or bringing recently mothballed Airbus A380s back into service.
The airline is loss-making but has received $3 billion in aid since the start of the pandemic from the state of Qatar, one of the world's richest nations.
European regulators say that despite their scaly appearance the aircraft skin problems do not amount to an airworthiness issue on the A350, which is not grounded elsewhere.
Qatar Airways confirmed on Monday that another of its A350s had been grounded, bringing the total number idled to 22.
Reuters reported the move on Friday as Qatar sought to enforce a separate contract between Airbus and the same carrier for in-demand A321neo jets. Airbus has cancelled the A321neo deal as their divorce heads towards a rare UK trial.
The two sides also clashed about the chances of a truce.

An Airbus spokesman said Monday's counter-claim was a ""last resort and followed many fruitless attempts to find mutually beneficial solutions"".
Qatar Airways said earlier it was not aware of ""any efforts by Airbus to try to resolve the situation in an amicable way"".

(Reuters) -Chevron Corp is buying biodiesel maker Renewable Energy Group (NASDAQ:REGI) Inc for $3.15 billion, in its biggest bet so far on alternative fuels.
The second-biggest U.S. oil and gas producer said on Monday it would pay $61.5 in cash for each share of Renewable Energy, a premium of over 40% to the company's Friday close. Renewable Energy shares rose more than 37% in premarket trading.
Major oil firms are facing increasing pressure from governments and investors to shrink their carbon footprint and join the fight against climate change, given their large contributions to global emissions. 
Many U.S. refiners have been ramping up production of renewable diesel to take advantage of increased state and federal subsidies to decarbonize their fuels.
 Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) has set a target to cut operational emissions to net zero by 2050 and in September pledged to invest $10 billion to reduce its carbon emissions through 2028, with about $3 billion earmarked for renewable fuels.
Ames, Iowa-based Renewable Energy Group produces both biodiesel and renewable diesel.
Biofuels are made from agricultural waste and traditional food crops grown specifically as fuel feedstock. 
While biodiesel and renewable diesel use similar feedstocks, renewable diesel undergoes a separate refining process to make it chemically identical to ultra-low-sulfur diesel.
The company has said it is eyeing opportunities to blend biodiesel into renewable diesel in certain markets.
""Most people see (biodiesel) as growing in the U.S. and Southeast Asia ... and view it as a blendstock to get optimum margin because it's less expensive than renewable diesel,"" Mark Nelson, executive vice president of downstream and chemicals, told Reuters.
The Energy Information Administration estimates renewable diesel production capacity in the United States may increase fivefold by 2024 from 1 billion gallons currently to more than 5 billion gallons per year.
The deal is expected to accelerate progress toward Chevron's goal to grow renewable fuels production capacity to 100,000 barrels per day by 2030 and brings additional feedstock supplies and pre-treatment facilities, the company said in a statement.
Chevron will not immediately be breaking out separate financials for its renewable business, Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth told Reuters.

The transaction is estimated to close in the second half of the year and is likely to add to Chevron's earnings in the first year and to its free cash flow after the start-up of Renewable Energy Group's Geismar expansion in Louisiana.
Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS) was Chevron's financial adviser, while Guggenheim Securities advised Renewable Energy on the deal.

The agency has asked Amryt to submit additional data confirming effectiveness of the drug.
The decision comes after the FDA had extended its review of the treatment, oleogel-S10, in November by three months to review additional analyses of data previously submitted by the company. The regulator had also asked for new information on the drug. 
Amryt said it intends to discuss with the FDA regarding the nature of data required to address the health regulator's concerns.
Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a disease causing fragile skin that blisters and tears easily. Currently, there is no approved therapy for the condition. Treatment for EB has usually involved controlling symptoms by using and changing bandages as well as managing pain and itching with medications.

Oleogel-S10 is a topical gel containing birchbark extracts that speeds up healing of skin wounds in patients with dystrophic and junctional EB, two types of the disorder.
The European Medicines Agency is also reviewing oleogel-S10 for the treatment of junctional and dystrophic EB. The agency's panel of experts is expected to give its opinion on the treatment in March.

Consumer Business Group CEO Richard Yu, speaking in a video presentation ahead of the Mobile World Congress, said the products were a ""bold statement"" of its Smart Office concept. 
President of Huawei's Western Europe Consumer Business Group William Tian said they would appeal to people who were increasingly working from home. 
""These are not standalone devices,"" he said in an interview. ""We can connect and collaborate much easier with our Super Device concept.""
Super Device is a technology that allows Huawei's products to connect and share capabilities and resources. 
Tian said Huawei remained committed to the smartphone market despite the U.S trade ban, introduced in 2019 and taking full effect a year later, which stopped it using Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s services on the Android operating system and constrained its chip technology. 
""We are going to continue to invest in new technologies to keep our leading position in the smartphone category,"" Tian said. 

He also said Huawei did not have any issues with the supply of chips for its products. 
""We can meet the market demand, we don't have any supply issue,"" he said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Alphabet unit Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and its subsidiary YouTube, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) must do more to tackle disinformation related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the premiers of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia said.
In a joint letter to the chief executives of the four companies dated Feb. 27, the four prime ministers criticised the U.S. tech giants, saying what they have done so far is inadequate.
""Although the online platforms have undertaken significant efforts to address the Russian government's unprecedented assault on truth, they have not done enough,"" they said in the letter.
""Russia's disinformation has been tolerated on online platforms for years; they are now an accessory to the criminal war of aggression the Russian government is conducting against Ukraine and the free world.""
They urged the companies to proactively suspend accounts denying, glorifying or justifying wars of aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
They also urged the tech giants to suspend the official accounts of Russian and Belarusian government institutions, state-controlled media and personal accounts of the countries' leadership and their associates that consistently disseminate disinformation about the situation in Ukraine.
The countries called on the companies to prevent Russian state-controlled media from circumventing restrictions imposed by several national regulators against them.
The online platforms should adjust their search and recommendation algorithms to inform users of disinformation and immediately demonetise all accounts controlled by the Russian and Belarusian governments, they said.
Facebook referred to a Sunday tweet by its vice-president Nick Clegg which said the company was reviewing other government requests to restrict Russian state-controlled media.
It will continue to label and fact-check these outlets as well as prohibit ads and demonetise their accounts globally, the tweet added.

Google and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Russian state-controlled news service Sputnik said on Monday its Polish site was no longer available to users, and that Youtube had subsequently banned its account in Poland.

Viasat said a third-party cybersecurity firm was looking into the causes of an outage in recent days across its KA-SAT network, which provides high-speed satellite internet coverage in Europe and Mediterranean markets.
The outage could have been due to a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, Sky News reported on Monday. Such attacks hit a number of Ukrainian banks and government websites shortly before Russia's invasion last week.

Investing.com – Stocks of Renewable Energy Group (NASDAQ:REGI) surged 37% in premarket trading Monday after  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) said it is acquiring the company in a $3.15 billion deal.
Chevron is paying $61.50 for each share of Renewable Energy in the all-cash transaction. Renewable shares closed at $43.81 Friday. Chevron shares traded 0.4% higher in premarket after closing 4% Friday.  
Renewable claims to be North America’s largest producer of advanced biofuels, turning feedstock into fuel at more than a dozen locations in the U.S. and Germany.
The deal would significantly boost Chevron’s push into renewable fuels, demand for which is expected to grow in the coming years as businesses and governments move away from oil and gas to cut carbon emissions.
Chevron aims to have a renewable fuel production capacity of 100,000 barrels per day by 2030. The deal gets it additional feedstock supplies and pre-treatment facilities, Chevron said in a statement.
Compared to their European counterparts, American energy majors have been a little slow in embracing green and sustainable fuels.
The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2022.
According to Bloomberg, Chevron, last year, committed to investing $10 billion through 2028 on low-carbon technologies."

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening sharply lower Monday, as investors digest the potential economic ramifications of the increased sanctions on Russia at the start of a week that includes the release of the key monthly employment report.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 430 points, or 1.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 62 points, or 1.4%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 180 points, or 1.3%.
Global markets were roiled at the end of last week when Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized an invasion of Ukraine.
More volatility is likely Monday after the West announced plans to block some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments network as punishment for the continued bombardment of Ukraine.
Although the move isn’t intended to impact energy flows from the world’s second largest crude oil producer, the measures are still designed to isolate Russia and thus are likely to disrupt global trade and hurt Western interests as well as those in Moscow.
""Exclusions from SWIFT will lead to missed payments and giant overdrafts similar to the missed payments and giant overdrafts that we saw in March 2020,” analysts at Credit Suisse said, in a note.
Adding to the geopolitical tensions, Putin placed his country’s nuclear deterrence forces on high alert as the West adopted a more aggressive stance to the invasion.
The EU stated it would start sending lethal weapons to Ukraine to help it defend itself, while Germany announced its biggest increase in defense spending since the end of the Cold War and vowed to spend above the amount recommended for NATO members in the future.
This has overshadowed the news that representatives of both Ukraine and Russia have agreed to meet on the Ukraine-Belarus border to discuss the situation “with no preconditions.”
Away from eastern Europe, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to testify before the House Committee on Financial Services on Wednesday, and again before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.
This comes ahead of Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report for February, which is expected to show that the economy added a healthy 450,000 jobs in the month.
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to start a tightening process in a couple of weeks, potentially with a hike of 50 basis points, but investors will closely follow Powell’s testimony to see whether the uncertainty caused by Russia’s actions will stay the central bank’s hand.
Oil prices soared amid fears the additional sanctions will disrupt oil shipments from Russia, the world's second largest crude producer and the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe.
Global output is already struggling to meet the rebound in consumption fueled by the reopening of economies after the pandemic, and any disruptions to Russian flows will only exacerbate this.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, a group called OPEC+, is set to meet later this week to discuss further production levels.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 4.8% higher at $96.01 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 5.6% to $98.68.
Additionally, gold futures rose 1.2% to $1,909.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.7% lower at 1.1192."

(Reuters) -Viatris Inc, the drugmaker formerly known as Mylan (NASDAQ:VTRS), said on Monday it had agreed to pay $264 million to resolve a class action lawsuit alleging it engaged in a scheme to delay generic competition to its EpiPen allergy treatment.
The proposed settlement would resolve litigation that began following public outrage in 2016 over Mylan's decision to raise the list price for a pair of EpiPen to $600 from $100 in 2008, fueling a debate about rising U.S. drug costs. 
The case, brought on behalf of consumers and third-party payers like insurers, until recently was slated to go on trial this month, with the plaintiffs seeking $1 billion in damages, a sum that under some state antitrust laws could be multiplied.
The lawsuit accused Mylan and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), which manufactured the EpiPen, of engaging in wide-ranging anticompetitive conduct that allowed them to maintain a monopoly over the market for the devices.
But U.S. District Judge Daniel Crabtree in Kansas City, Kansas, last year dismissed much of the case against Mylan, leaving only a claim concerning a 2012 patent litigation settlement with generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd.
Viatris said the settlement, which is pending court approval, does not contain any admission of liability. 
The plaintiffs had alleged the defendants entered into an unlawful ""pay-for-delay"" settlement with Teva that resulted in the delayed release of a generic version of the EpiPen, allowing Mylan to raise its product's price without fear of competition.
The plaintiffs alleged that Mylan as part of a ""quid pro quo"" agreed to similarly settle unrelated patent litigation involving a brand name drug Teva produced and delay the release of Mylan's proposed generic version of that medication.

Teva and Pfizer denied wrongdoing. Pfizer agreed last year to settle for $345 million. Teva was not a defendant.
Separately, India's Biocon Ltd on Monday announced a $3.34 billion deal for Viatris' biosimilars business.

LONDON (Reuters) -Associated British Foods said on Monday the outlook for its Primark fashion business was improving, though it cautioned its food businesses were facing increasing inflationary pressures.
The group said sales and adjusted operating profit for its first half to March 5 would be ""strongly ahead"" of the prior year and ahead of pre-COVID 19 levels, reflecting a better performance from Primark.
Primark's sales were forecast to be well over 60% ahead of last year at constant currency with an operating profit margin of 11%.
The improved outcome reflected all Primark stores remaining open and trading throughout the period except for short spells in Austria and The Netherlands. That compared to prolonged periods of store closure in the UK and Europe in the first half of last year.
""Omicron really reduced footfall in December but now across the piece we're seeing footfall improving,"" finance chief John Bason told Reuters, highlighting strong demand for luggage and swimwear.
The effect of inflation on raw materials and the supply chain in Primark was broadly mitigated by a reduction in store operating costs and overheads and a favourable U.S. dollar exchange rate. It said in January it would not raise prices for spring/summer.
The group said all its food businesses had experienced increasing inflationary pressures in raw materials, commodities, supply chain and energy.
Steps have been taken to offset these higher input costs through operational cost savings and in the grocery, ingredients and agriculture businesses, the implementation of price increases. However, the group cautioned the price rises inevitably lag input cost inflation.
As a result, it expects some margin reduction in these three businesses at the half year but expects a recovery by the financial year-end.
Shares in the group were down 2.9% at 1009 GMT.
AB Foods (LON:ABF)' grocery brands include Twinings tea, Jordans cereals, Kingsmill bread and Ovaltine drinks.
Bason also cautioned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could drive global wheat prices higher.

The group expects further growth in profit at AB Sugar at the half year.
AB Foods outlook for the full year was unchanged with ""significant progress"" expected in both adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share.

“If one is selling on the back of the latest geopolitical developments now, the risk is of getting whipsawed,” Matejka and his team wrote in a note to clients on Monday. “Historically, vast majority of military conflicts, especially if localized, did not tend to hurt investor confidence for too long, and would end up as buying opportunities.”
READ: Portfolios Need Adjustments With Oil Above $100: Taking Stock
The appeal for calm comes as a fresh wave of Western sanctions against Russia and an increasingly aggressive rhetoric by president Vladimir Putin, who ordered his nuclear forces to be on alert over the weekend, exacerbated this year’s rout in equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic. 
Banking stocks were the biggest decliners in Europe on Monday, sinking to the lowest in two months, after the U.S. and EU ramped up their measures against Russia blocking some of the nations banks from the international SWIFT transaction messaging system and moving to target the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves. 
“We acknowledge that our longs in Europe and in banks are not likely to perform as long as this crisis dominates the headlines,” JPMorgan’s strategists said. Still, on anything longer than a one-month horizon, banks and Europe should continue to be seen as fundamental overweights, the strategists added, “especially if commodity flows are not cut from Russia.”
UBS Global Wealth Management echoed the sentiment on Monday. “We caution against hasty shifts in positioning based on events,” strategists led by Mark Haefele wrote. “We think it is important that investors maintain a calm stance and keep a long-term perspective,” they said, advising investors to diversify across regions, sectors, and asset classes, use commodities as a geopolitical hedge, and position for U.S. dollar strength.

Investing.com – Stocks of European defense manufacturers soared Monday as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine forces European governments to have a relook at their preparedness, including a reconsideration of their established doctrines.
 Rheinmetall  AG (DE:RHMG) shares surged 31% in Frankfurt as German Chancellor Olaf Scholz decided to sharply increase its spending on defense to more than 2% of its economic output.
 Thales  (PA:TCFP) was up 13% in Paris, while Leonardo (LON:0ONG) and BAE (LON:BAES), both listed in London, traded around 16% and 14% higher, respectively.
Since the end of the Second World War, Germany has long refrained from getting involved in conflicts, resisting pressure to raise its defense spending in the light of its military past and resulting strong pacifism within its population.
Scholz said the government had decided to more than double last year’s military investment to 100 billion euro in the 2022 budget.
Germany could purchase U.S. F-35 fighter jets built by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) to begin with, Reuters quoted Scholz as saying. Lockheed shares were up 4.4% on NYSE in premarket trading.  
But the next generation of fighter jets and tanks must be built in Europe jointly with European partners, particularly with France, he said.
As Germany reverses its policy, pressure on governments in other European nations could mount too, considering the heightened geopolitical risks in the region and the lack of unity among countries on critical security issues."

Shares of European banks with links to Russia suffered the sharpest declines on the region’s exchanges Monday, as Western nations intensified financial sanctions on Moscow following the invasion of Ukraine.
Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank International (VIE:RBIV) led the declines with a drop of as much as 18% after the open in Vienna, amid investor concern that the sanctions would hit one of the lender’s most profitable units. France’s Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA and Italy’s UniCredit SpA (MI:CRDI)  were both down about 10%. All three have significant businesses in Russia.

Lenders are waking up to a rapidly shifting scenario after the U.S. and EU ramped up their measures against Russia blocking some of the nations banks from the international SWIFT transaction messaging system and moving to target the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves.  The ruble sank at the open on Monday, prompting emergency interest-rate hikes.
Raiffeisen said it couldn’t yet estimate the financial effect of sanctions as they were being expanded daily, according to a statement Monday. The lender said the measures had a “tough and far-reaching” impact on financial markets and the real economy.
The bank has about 11.6 billion euros of its loans in Russia, or 11% of its total, and makes more than 30% of its pretax profit there, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.
“The exclusion of Russian banks from international payments means that these financial institutions can no longer repay their debts to their European creditors,” VP Bank chief economist Thomas Gitzel said. “For the EU as a whole, Russia’s liabilities are manageable. The claims amount to around US$75 billion or 0.7% of the total bank claims.”

618,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 04:44AM ET</span>","BP Tumbles as It Exits Rosneft, Hit Seen around $25 Billion","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – BP ADRs (NYSE:BP) slumped 8.6% in premarket trading Monday after the company said it will exit from its stake of around 20% in Russia’s  Rosneft  (LON:ROSNq), a decision that is likely to leave a big non-cash charge on its books.
The British company has held that stake since 2013. The company said it will also exit its other businesses with Rosneft within Russia.
The abrupt move follows Russia’s attack on Ukraine last week that has prompted several European and American companies to have a relook at their interests in the Communist country. Norway’s Equinor has taken a similar decision.
Additionally, BP said its Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney has quit the Rosneft board with immediate effect.
At the end of 2021, BP’s Rosneft stake was worth around $14 billion. Accounting changes may result in another $11 billion hit for BP. The impact of the move, including the removal of Rosneft’s dividend from the books, will reflect in the company’s current quarter results, BP said.
With a European or an American buyer ruled out for BP’s stake, the sale is likely to be a distressed one.
American oil majors, namely Shell (NYSE:SHEL) and Exxon (NYSE:XOM), too, hold big stakes in oil and gas projects in Sakhalin, in the far east of Russia. They have so far been silent on the fate of their holdings.
Notwithstanding the blow, BP reiterated its forecast for a capital expenditure of $21 billion-$22 billion in the current year. It is also holding on to its commitments to dividends and buyback."

Unveiled by the Japanese company in October, the 4680 format (46 millimetres wide and 80 millimetres tall) battery is around five times bigger than those currently supplied to Tesla, meaning the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) maker will be able to lower production costs.
The new powerpack is also expected to improve vehicle range, which could help Tesla lure more drivers to EVs.
Panasonic will build two new production lines at its Wakayama factory in western Japan to build the batteries, the company said in a news release. 
The company did not say how much it will spend on the expansion. 

The Nikkei newspaper reported earlier that Panasonic planned to invest 80 billion yen ($692 million) in the plant.

State-owned Rosneft accounts for around half of BP's oil and gas reserves and a third of its production. A sale of the 19.75% stake ends three decades of partnership between the two companies and will result in charges of up to $25 billion, BP said on Sunday.
BP shares pared some early losses and were down 4.5% at 361.5 pence on the London Stock Exchange by 0825 GMT, but were still among the top losers on Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 index.
BP is the biggest foreign investor in Russia, and its dramatic exit puts the spotlight on other Western companies with operations in the country amid an escalating crisis between the West and Moscow.

BP - which has around 200 employees in Russia, most of whom are local staff - said its latest move would neither impact its short- and long-term financial targets, nor would it alter its focus on low-carbon fuels and renewable energy.
It will take an $11 billion foreign exchange non-cash charge after the exit from Rosneft, which BP will no longer include in its accounts. BP said it was also expecting a second non-cash charge of up to $14 billion for the ""carrying value"" of Rosneft.

Ireland's largest lender by assets swung to an underlying full-year pretax profit of 1.37 billion euros from a 374 million euro loss in 2020 when it set aside 1.1 billion euros to cover possible loan defaults owing to COVID-19 disruption.
It wrote back 194 million euros of those provisions, helping to almost double profits from the pre-pandemic 758 million euros in 2019. The bank's previous highest profit since the Irish banking crisis was 1.2 billion euros in 2015.
Finance chief Myles O'Grady told Reuters a 12% rise in income year on yeare and a 4% drop in costs was a strong endorsement of its strategy to cut costs to 1.5 billion euros by the end of next year and deliver a sustainable return on tangible equity (ROTE) above 10%.
Its ROTE was 12.8% last year, which the bank said reflected a strong business performance and the impairment writebacks.
O'Grady said he expects the European Central Bank (ECB) to increase interest rates over the course of 2022. In an updated estimate, Bank of Ireland said a 100 basis point rise would boost annual net interest income by 274 million euros.
The bank said the outlook for 2022 is positive, with total income expected to be in line with 2021 and impairment charges to be below normalised levels while costs continue to fall and distributions increase.

Bank of Ireland is also in the process of buying most of KBC's performing Irish assets as the Belgian group leaves the shrinking Irish market. O'Grady said there was no indication yet that competition authorities would set any conditions to approve the deal.

SODEGAURA, Japan (Reuters) -  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, a late-comer to the battery electric vehicle (BEV) market, is weaving in all efforts to make sure its first mass-market model is safer and lasts longer than rivals' products when it goes on sale later this year.
BEVs have grown in popularity globally, but some consumers have been put off by EV battery-related fire risks and rapid degradation.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Hyundai Motor were forced last year to recall EVs, carrying batteries manufactured by LG Energy Solution, after reports of fires. 
""We focused on balancing three factors: cruising range, battery degradation and charging speed,"" Masaya Yamamoto, a project manager at Toyota, said at a test-drive event for the bZ4X sport utility vehicle (SUV) prototype last week.
BEVs typically take hours to charge, and using quick-charging methods often cause the battery's cells to heat up, leading to degradation. That, in turn, reduces cruising range over time, hurting a vehicle's resale value.
Toyota said its batteries, developed with Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp, contain a special coolant that does not conduct electricity easily. Battery packs are also structured to keep the cells and coolant separated in case of a leak.
This and other innovations mean the new BEV series' batteries would retain more than 90% of their capacity after a decade, Toyota said.
For consumers in Japan, where EVs have been slow to take off, Toyota is considering offering the EVs only through ""subscription"" - a bid to address worries over battery life and resale value. The subscription fee would cover the cost of maintenance and battery replacement among other features.

Toyota has said it would start selling the SUV model in Japan and other major markets in mid-2022.
Toyota has set a goal of selling 3.5 million BEVs annually by 2030 through an 8 trillion yen ($70 billion) investment to electrify its vehicles.

630,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 02:26AM ET</span>",Take Five: The cost of war,"(Reuters) -Russia's invasion of Ukraine has wide-ranging implications for the economy and financial markets. Oil's spike above $100 a barrel may exacerbate inflation and hurt economic growth. But expect no extra oil from OPEC+ when it meets on Wednesday.
The shift in the growth-inflation equation is a quandary for policymakers, though the Bank of Canada may not blink in delivering an interest rate rise. 
But events may help the BoC's Australian counterpart justify its resolutely dovish stance, while U.S. employment and European inflation readings will provide fodder for the Fed and ECB ahead of their March meetings.
Here's your week ahead in markets from Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, Ira Iosebashvili in New York, Ahmad Ghaddar, Sujata Rao and Dhara Ranasinghe in London. 
1/HIGHER OIL BUT PERHAPS NOT FROM OPEC 
Russia's Ukraine invasion has lifted Brent crude above $105 a barrel, and the Biden administration says it is working with allies on a combined release of additional oil from global strategic crude reserves. 
So will the OPEC+ producers' group, meeting on Wednesday, revisit its strategy of increasing output targets by 400,000 barrels per day and provide additional crude? Actually, OPEC+ production has consistently been below target as some members struggle with capacity constraints.
Prior to the Russian attack, Nigeria's oil minister said U.S. talks with Iran over its nuclear programme could pave the way for Iranian oil exports to rise, meaning additional OPEC+ supplies may not be needed. nL1N2UY0J1]
Meanwhile, some buyers of Russian oil say they are struggling to secure guarantees at Western banks or find ships to transport oil from one of the world's largest producers.
2/HIGHER PAY
March will be a highly consequential month for monetary policy worldwide, and Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls number will be the last such report the Federal Reserve sees before its March 15-16 meeting. 
With inflation at 40-year highs, that meeting should enact the first interest rate increase since end-2018, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has signalled. But the jobs data could colour the outlook for Fed policy in the near term.
Reuters surveys predict 381,000 jobs were added in February, while average earnings rose another 5.8% annualised. Numbers well above that might revive expectations of a half-percentage-point rate rise, which have been pared back as the Ukraine crisis has escalated, triggering heavy stock market falls. 
Markets are currently pricing in over 150 points of interest rate increases by next February.  
3/HIGHER INFLATION
One economist called January's 5.1% euro area inflation print a slap in the face for the European Central Bank. A day later the bank appeared to throw in the towel and concede that a 2022 interest rate hike was possible.
With oil and food prices seen soaring due to the conflict in Ukraine - both it and Russia are major grain producers - it seems unlikely the 5.2% inflation print predicted for February and due on Wednesday will be the peak. German flash inflation, due a day earlier, is also expected at 5.1%. 
Elevated oil costs could send European inflation to 5.7% this year, a whole percentage point above the non-conflict scenario,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) estimates. But the corresponding hit to GDP will put the ECB in a tough spot. 
4/HIGHER INTEREST RATES
Ukraine or not, some central banks can't delay tightening policy. On Wednesday, the Bank of Canada looks all but certain to hike interest rates by 25 basis points, marking its first rate increase in over three years. 
    With inflation at 30-year highs, markets price in just under six rate hikes this year.
    Economists do not rule out a 50 bps move in March. Inflation is well above the BoC's 2% target and has been above its 1-3% control range for 10 consecutive months. Note Deputy Governor Timothy Lane's recent warning that the BoC would be ""nimble"" and potentially ""forceful"" in tackling inflation.
5/BUT NOT YET HIGHER DOWN UNDER
The Ukraine crisis may give the Reserve Bank of Australia, one the world's more dovish central banks, extra reasons to stand pat.
While Governor Philip Lowe has been sparring with markets over what happens to rates this year, the RBA's Tuesday meeting was not expected to change its record-low 0.1% rate.

    Traders reckon an inflation shock will force a rate hike by the third quarter. While Lowe has admitted a move this year is ""plausible,"" he's still pushing for patience.
    And he can point to New Zealand's recent decision to forgo a half-point rate increase in favour of a smaller 25 bps move.

631,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 02:10AM ET</span>",Marketmind: When the end of History ends,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Julien Ponthus.
Francis Fukuyama's bestseller ""The End of History and the Last Man"" was published 30 years ago and popularised the idea that the triumph of liberal democracy would open a new era of global peace and prosperity after the Cold War.
Since then, a long list of events and trends, from the 9/11 attacks to the rise of populism, has made that idea look somewhat outdated but Russia's invasion of Ukraine probably constitutes the final nail in that narrative's coffin. 
On this last Monday morning of February 2022, the future looks very different to what it did just a week ago. 
Short term, financial markets are facing an extremely volatile situation worsened by the fact the 2022 outlooks sent by investments banks at the end of 2021 are now completely irrelevant.
The massive sanctions implemented by Western allies, notably the step to block certain Russian banks from the SWIFT payments system is sending oil prices above $100 a barrel. 
One of the most spectacular effect of the sanctions was the rouble collapsing nearly 30% overnight with investors rushing to find safe havens in the dollar and gold while the euro fell a sharp 1%.
The urgency to park capital safely was also exposed through the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield falling about 9 basis points to 1.89%. 
Still, the current rally on safe government bonds tells little about how central banks will react to the crisis. 
As much as surging energy prices lifting inflation further make the case to speed up monetary tightening, the unavoidable hit on economic growth also needs to be addressed. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimates the conflict could shave off as much as 0.4% of euro area GDP this year.
Bets were on the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to proceed more cautiously than previously expected have grown.
Across equity markets, European bourses are most exposed and futures show the continent's blue chips opening down about 3% while in Asia, MSCI's index of regional stocks was roughly flat.
Among major announcements over the weekend, Norway's $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund said it would divest its Russian assets and Britain's BP (NYSE:BP) decided to exit the capital of Russian giant Rosnet. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday: 
-Japan's factory output hit by car production cuts, Ukraine crisis adds to risks
-Fed speakers: Atlanta President Raphael Bostic

Singapore-based Olam in August announced plans for Olam Food Ingredients (OFI) to pursue a primary listing in London and a secondary listing in Singapore in the first half of 2022.
Sources familiar with the matter said at that time Olam was considering raising about 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) through the London listing, which would make it one of the biggest London IPOs in years.
""We are controlling everything that we can control in making sure that we can complete the IPO and the concurrent demerger of OFI from the Olam group in the second quarter of this year,"" Olam co-founder and group CEO Sunny Verghese said in a results call on Monday.
Global markets have fallen sharply following Russia's invasion of Ukraine as investors scramble for the safety of gold and the protection of inflation hedges. Market jitters are threatening Europe's IPO launch season.
Olam, one of the world's biggest agricultural commodity traders, has been rehauling its businesses as it seeks to simplify its complex portfolio and boost valuations.
The company has appointed a raft of global and regional banks to work on OFI's IPO.
Olam's executives did not specify if the group was looking to postpone its IPO but reiterated that the focus was on creating a strong business.
""The markets will be markets. We will figure out the balance. Obviously, right now, nobody really knows,"" A. Shekhar, OFI's CEO said, responding to a question on whether war in Europe could hurt risk appetite and impact OFI's IPO.

634,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 12:25AM ET</span>","Chinese EV maker Nio pursues Hong Kong, Singapore secondary listings","By Scott Murdoch and Anshuman Daga
SYDNEY/SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc plans to carry out secondary listings by introduction in Hong Kong and Singapore as it seeks to grow its business in the region. 
Stock exchange filings on Monday showed the New York-listed firm had received preliminary approval from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to trade its shares in the city, while the Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY) was reviewing an application for a secondary listing on the main bourse of that board. 
Shanghai-based Nio said the Class A shares are due to start trading on March 10 in Hong Kong under the code 9866 once it receives final approval from the stock exchange. 
Its primary listing will remain in New York, the company said.
Unlike a typical initial public offering (IPO) or secondary listing, companies listing stock by introduction raise no capital and issue no new shares. 
The mechanism was popular among companies in the past looking to build a brand in Hong Kong and the rest of Greater China.
The decision to pursue an listing by introduction was ordered by the company to not dilute or put further pressure on its stock by issuing new shares in Hong Kong and Singapore, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.
Singapore was chosen as a listing venue because of the company's desire to grow its EV market share in that region, the source added.
The source could not be named as the information was not yet public. Nio did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A Singapore Exchange spokesperson declined to comment on Nio's listing application. The spokesperson said SGX had nearly 30 secondary listings from companies from diverse sectors and geographies as firms look to broaden their access to a wider range of investors while using the city-state as a launchpad into Southeast Asia. 

Nio's New York shares have fallen nearly 34% so far this year.
Nio had planned to list in Hong Kong last year but faced questions from regulators over its company structure, including a ""users trust"", Bloomberg reported in September.

In a statement on Monday, GF Fund Management said that the price of its fund for qualified domestic institutional investors tracking the Dow Jones U.S. Select Oil Exploration and Production Index was ""significantly higher"" than net asset value.
""Investors who blindly invest in funds at a high premium to net asset value may suffer large losses,"" the statement said, adding that the fund was operating normally. It was GF's second such risk statement since Friday, after investors betting on a jump in oil prices jolted the fund's share price higher in secondary markets.
Chinese payment-related stocks jumped as investors wagered that the United States and Europe kicking Russia out of the SWIFT global payment system would benefit China's own cross-border payment system and accelerate the development of the country's digital currency, the e-CNY.
Ratcheting up sanctions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the United States and Europe said on Saturday they would banish big Russian banks from SWIFT and announced other measures to limit Moscow's use of a $630 billion war chest.
Investors speculating on the impact of the news pushed shares of leading Chinese companies involved in developing digital yuan payment infrastructure higher, including Newland Digital Technology Co, Lakala Payment Co and Client Service International (NYSE:SCI) Inc, despite weakness in the broader market.
A sub-index tracking the internet finance sector jumped more than 2% early in the trading day before trimming gains. 
The SWIFT sanctions against Russia ""is a milestone event that will accelerate the process of de-dollarisation,"" wrote Dang Congyu, analyst at Founder Securities. 
""Although it's hard to replace SWIFT in the short term, this incident is very beneficial to yuan's globalisation over the long run."" 
The view was echoed by Guosheng Securities, who recommended Chinese payment-related stocks, citing the potential of China's own payment system, CIPS, and digital yuan, to break the dollar's hegemony. 

Against the backdrop of global power competition, the digital yuan ""will pay a key role in promoting the yuan's global status, and its development will accelerate,"" analysts Liu Gaochang and Yang Ran wrote. 
China's CSI Defense sub-index also surged on Monday, climbing more than 2.5% at one point, while energy shares rose 1.6%, against a 0.35% drop in the blue-chip CSI300 index.

636,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2022 11:06PM ET</span>","After decades in a spin, Sonic's break-out leaves Sega hoping for more","By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Sega Sammy Holdings Inc is hoping to ride the fast-moving coattails of Sonic the Hedgehog as the character enjoys a renaissance amid a global scramble for entertainment content. 
This year sees the release of a sequel to a record-breaking Hollywood movie and a Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) series, along with a title that Sega hopes will revive the fortunes of the long-running Sonic game franchise after decades of malaise. 
""Sonic is the face of Sega. If Sonic is doing well, then Sega is doing well to an extent, too,"" Shuji Utsumi, co-chief operation officer of Sega, told Reuters in an interview. 
The blue blur became a household name in the West in a series of side-scrolling games in the 1990s on the Sega Mega Drive console, also known as the Sega Genesis in North America, which outsold Nintendo's Super NES in many countries. 
""Sonic was cool with humour and an attitude... that resonated in the West,"" said Utsumi, who worked at  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) when it launched the first PlayStation. 
Unlike Nintendo's Mario, who starred in decades of acclaimed titles, Sonic struggled to make the transition to 3D games as Sega withdrew from the console business to become a game publisher. 
Now, after years of trial and error during which Sega merged with pachinko gambling machine maker Sammy, Sonic revived his career as a movie star as studios raided corporate larders for underused characters with mass appeal.
Sonic-related sales, including from the movie, have quadrupled in the five years to the financial year that ended March 2021. 
The game series has a committed, and long-suffering, fanbase in the West, in contrast with other Sega franchises such as ""Yakuza"" and ""Persona"", which have a large audience in Japan. 
""It's definitely a nostalgic love for him,"" said Jacob Mills, 31, a British game level designer, referring to the hedgehog. Mills plays new Sonic releases and describes his enthusiasm as ""a shared experience of mutual disappointment."" 
Initial prospects for the first Sonic movie from Paramount, which featured Jim Carrey, seemed in doubt when a trailer showing the character with prominent white teeth was derided on social media. 
The studio tweaked the design, and the movie eventually raked in more than $300 million worldwide - becoming one of the best grossing video game adaptations - after its release in 2020 during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""Sonic the Hedgehog 2"" will be released in April. The franchise's importance to Paramount was underscored in an investor presentation earlier this month outlining the future of the company and announcing a second Sonic sequel along with a hybrid animated/live-action series about the Knuckles character for its streaming service. A separate animated series is due to launch on Netflix this year.
""It's another big franchise for us and for Sega,"" Paramount Pictures chief Brian Robbins told Reuters. The Sonic investment is part of a broader commitment to franchises spanning movies and series, Paramount Chief Executive Bob Bakish said during the presentation. Shares fell on scepticism over whether the content could compete in an increasingly crowded streaming market. 
OPEN WORLD 
Sega has embraced the Sonic community, in 2017 releasing Sonic Mania, a widely praised retro platformer that began life as a fan-made game before being backed by firm. 
An artist from the game later worked for Paramount on the Sonic movie, and Sega interacts humorously with fans on via the Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account, which has 5.8 million followers. 
Expectations are growing for ""Sonic Frontiers"", an open world platformer due for release this year. The format is novel for the franchise, whose other games have been bought or downloaded 1.38 billion times. Sega has not shown any gameplay for the title, which was delayed for a year, and wary fans point to the ""Sonic cycle"", in which excitement and talk of a comeback in the build-up to a new release is dashed by disappointment on playing the game.
The earnings impact of Sonic-related output ""is going to be tangible"" in the financial year starting in April, Utsumi said, without providing further details. 
This month, the company upgraded its full year operating profit forecast by a third to 31 billion yen ($268 million). The gaming unit has been boosted by sales of titles such as role-playing game ""Shin Megami Tensei V"" for the Nintendo  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH). 
Utsumi, who returned to Sega two years ago after founding his own gaming company and working at Disney and Warner Music, says the company is a ""treasure island"" of content that could be further commercialized. 
Other Japanese characters joining the rush include a forthcoming Super Mario movie from ""Minions"" studio Illumination and Netflix's live action remake of cult 1990s anime Cowboy BeBop released last year. 
Sega has a close relationship with Xbox maker Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and in November said it was exploring an alliance to develop titles using the Redmond, Washington-based firm's cloud technology. 
Longer term, Sega aims to create a ""super game"" with global appeal - that perhaps will be part of the ""metaverse"", a buzzy term for a network of persistent simulated online environments. 
Sega, whose shares have rise by 16% year-to-date, has long experience across arcade and console gaming and different genres, Utsumi said.

""There's no one better suited to do this than us,"" he said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Monday morning, with Western countries slapping harsher sanctions on Russia in response to the latter’s invasion of Ukraine.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.36% by 9:28 PM ET (2:28 AM GMT). Japan earlier in the day released data, including industrial production month-on-month and retail sales year-on-year for January 2022.
South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.21%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.48%. Australia also released data, including private sector credit and retail sales month-on-month for January, earlier in the day. The Reserve Bank of Australia will hand down its policy decision on Tuesday.
Across the Tasman Sea, New Zealand also released its ANZ business confidence index for February.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.92%.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.12% and the Shenzhen Component fell 0.71%.
The most recent sanctions will ban some Russian lenders from using the global SWIFT messaging system, while doubts are rising as to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (Bank of Russia)’s ability to keep the Russian financial system and the rouble under control.
The SWIFT exclusion may leave holes in international banking that require monetary authorities to supply the market with dollars, according to Credit Suisse Group AG strategist Zoltan Pozsar.
The conflict is already driving prices of resources such as wheat, natural gas, oil, and metals up. Investors are now waiting to see how this will impact the U.S. Federal Reserve’s plans for interest rate hikes starting in March 2022.
“Markets will have to digest once again the next stage of this crisis,” Medley Global Advisors global macro strategist Ben Emons told Bloomberg. The sanctions have the effect of curbing market liquidity, he added.
Russian and Ukrainian officials will meet at the border with Belarus, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is skeptical about the talks.
In Russia, queues formed at cash machines across the country, with people withdrawing foreign currency as fears of a rouble collapse increased. S&P Global Ratings also slashed Russian bonds to below investment grade on Friday.
Companies are also taking action, with BP Plc exiting its shareholding in Russia’s Rosneft PJSC and Norway planning to remove Russian assets from its $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund.
The conflict is “likely to boost energy prices significantly, resulting in immediate inflationary effects and a large drag on global growth,” Federated Hermes senior economist Silvia Dall’Angelo said in a note.
“It’s fair to say that the crisis increases the room for central banks’ policy mistakes,” the note added.
In other central bank news, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will testify before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday. The Bank of Canada hands down its policy decision on Wednesday, while the European Central Bank will release the minutes from its February 2022 meeting a day later.

After the German government put the Nord Stream 2 pipeline on hold last week, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki on Saturday called for shutting down Nord Stream 1, which has transferred Russian gas to Germany since 2011. 
Nord Stream is a joint venture of Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), Germany's oil and gas producer Wintershall DEA, PEG Infrastruktur E.ON , Dutch Gasunie and French Engie.

E.ON, which holds a 15.5% stake in Nord Stream 1, said the project was ""completely different from the ongoing discussions about the Nord Stream 2 line"".
""Nord Stream 1 is a permitted and fully operational gas import pipeline,"" a spokesperson for the company told the paper, adding that the line's capacity was fully utilized in the past two years.

BOSTON (Reuters) - New York City Comptroller Brad Lander on Sunday said he plans to specify Russian assets for city pension boards to ""consider for divestment"" in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
In a statement emailed by a spokesperson, Lander said he will specify the assets after reviews, and said final decisions on asset sales are made by the five boards that oversee city pension assets.
The system had roughly $271 million in Russian assets as of Feb. 23, the spokesperson said. 
""Russia's aggression in Ukraine merits the swift global action"" now beginning to cut off Russian President Vladimir Putin and his supporters from the global financial system, Lander said in the statement.
""We are watching developments in Ukraine with great concern and following responses by fellow institutional investors closely,"" he said.
The comments follow sharper steps by some European companies and investors to move away from Russia in the wake of Putin's war on Ukraine. Norway's $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, will sell its Russian assets, the Norwegian prime minister said on Sunday.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory.
With $275 billion in total assets, the New York City pension system overseen by Lander is one of the largest in the United States, and his comments go the furthest of a major public investment leader to date.
But like New York City, most other large systems report to boards that could take time to decide on any action.

Officials for the California Public Employees' Retirement System, and for the California State Teachers' Retirement System, did not respond to questions on Sunday afternoon. 
New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who oversees separate pension assets, said on Sunday in a statement sent by a spokesperson that: ""We are closely monitoring the situation in Russia and the Ukraine, but our exposure is minimal. We will follow any federal restrictions for investors as we assess how it impacts our investments.""

641,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2022 08:06PM ET</span>",Russia sanctions cause weekend compliance scramble for global banks,"By Matt Scuffham, David Henry and Pete Schroeder
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior management and compliance teams at major banks were working around the clock this weekend to understand the raft of new sanctions imposed on Russia and its banking system in the wake of the country's invasion of Ukraine.
Banks were scrambling to ensure they understood the full implications of the restrictions, including the banning of certain Russian lenders from the SWIFT international payment system, sources at major global banks said. The SWIFT measure was announced Saturday without naming the affected Russian banks, leaving the sector waiting for details.
With global financial markets set to open within hours, bankers described staff working on overdrive to apply the sanctions, including frantic calls to governments and regulators to fill in gaps in knowledge.
One European bank source said it was imploring authorities for more time to make system changes for full compliance in what the source described as a fast-moving, fluid situation.
While global banks have extensive experience with sanctions and have invested heavily in compliance programs in recent years, the scale of the restrictions imposed on a major country such as Russia is unprecedented, said industry sources.
While banks in Iran and North Korea have been kicked off SWIFT before, their banks are not significant global trade participants, those sources said.
Banks generally exercise extreme caution and would do so until the picture is clear, a source at one U.S. bank said, noting that it was prioritizing changes that needed immediate implementation.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) declined to comment. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) did not respond to requests for comment.
SANCTIONS SKIRTING
U.S. and European banks have had to implement sanctions involving Russian entities before, as in 2014 after Russia's annexation of Crimea. 
Many have maintained strong business links with the country, earning millions of dollars from facilitating trade, and advising Russian companies on mergers and acquisitions and raising cash from international markets. That business is now threatened, including the investment banking fees that many U.S. banks earn. 
Citigroup has a retail banking operation in Russia that it has been trying to sell since April.
The newest U.S. restrictions announced in the last week complicate the picture. These include banning banks from having correspondent banking relationships with Sberbank - preventing Russia's largest lender from making payments and facilitating trade with other banks, and freezing all U.S. assets belonging to VTB and its 20 subsidiaries and forbidding dealings with them.

One of the biggest concerns of U.S. and European banks is the risk of inadvertently doing business with Russian-sanctioned entities via shell companies that may not be obviously connected, the banking sources said.
Banks have extensive Know Your Customer programs, which require lenders to make full checks on parties they do business with. And, since the imposition of sanctions in 2014, U.S. banks have grown more skilled at ascertaining the true beneficial ownership of assets.

643,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2022 07:25PM ET</span>",Londongrad tries to kick its 30-year Russian money habit,"By Andrew MacAskill and Catherine Belton
LONDON (Reuters) - VTB Capital last week lowered a large Russian flag at its palatial building opposite the Bank of England in London's financial district, signalling a retreat from one of the main global centres for money flows.
Hours earlier, Britain had said it was freezing the assets of Russia's largest investment bank as punishment for Moscow's invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, as part of what the government said is its largest-ever package of sanctions.
Britain has targeted Russian banks and members of President Vladimir Putin's closest circle, imposed a ban on Russia selling debt in London's markets and limited deposits by its citizens.
These and other planned moves could signal the end of 'Londongrad' as the Western capital of choice for the Russian oligarchs who flaunt their wealth in European luxury hot spots.
London has also been the go-to venue for foreign capital-raising by Russian firms, many of which craved a listing to gain international financial respectability, and more than 20 of them, with a total market value of more than 400 billion pounds ($536 billion), are listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).
VTB Capital, the investment banking arm of VTB, Russia's second biggest bank, was set up during the global financial crisis in 2008 as a symbol of Russia's attempts to promote the country's integration into the global economy.
The lender said it was ""taking all necessary measures to resolve the situation with each of our clients"" and was ""determined to continue co-operation with clients and partners in accordance with the law"".
Britain said the bank, which raised tens of billions of pounds for the Russian government and state-owned companies through London's markets, was being targeted because it was controlled by the Russian state. It has given VTB Capital 30 days to wind down any transactions, potentially allowing the bank to move assets and transfer operations elsewhere.
Nevertheless, the LSE suspended VTB Capital on Feb 25., the first full day after the measures were announced, meaning the bank could no longer trade shares on behalf of clients.
VTB Capital, which had already been reducing its presence in London after the disruption caused by Brexit, did not respond to a request for comment.
The exact scope of the new sanctions will only be disclosed in legislation this week and most of the names of the 100 Russian oligarchs and entities Britain has promised to target have not been revealed.
So far Britain has only sanctioned ten Russians, with minimal assets in Britain, giving others a chance to move them to proxies offshore. Over the weekend, Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich said he was giving management of Chelsea soccer club to the team's charitable foundation amid calls for him to be sanctioned.
""If the government decides to take action, London could significantly impact the activities of ... (Putin's) inner circle,"" said Tom Best, an international investigations partner with Paul Hastings in Washington.
IN OVERDRIVE
Russian business has grown tentacles deep in Britain's financial system in the thirty years since the Soviet Union's collapse, prompting the British parliament's security and intelligence committee to warn in 2020 that its influence was so deeply embedded that by now it ""cannot be untangled"". 
While Russian billionaires are best known for their high-end mansions in Belgravia and Knightsbridge, the protection provided by the English legal system, along with light-touch regulation, has also made London a haven for much of their private wealth.
Russians have more than 27 billion pounds invested in Britain where they come to bank, shop, educate their children and make use of the courts, government data shows.
With an estimated 60% of the wealth of Russia's richest households held offshore, this has come under increasing scrutiny in the build-up to the invasion of Ukraine.
And, as happened before previous rounds of sanctions imposed in 2014 and 2018, some Russians have prepared for ownership changes to be triggered in the event of new sanctions in order to soften the blow, people close to them said.
Two with billions of dollars in the West are among those who have been preparing to shield their fortunes, they added. 
""Law firms have been working in overdrive,"" one said. 
Financial transparency campaigners say even more Russian money flows into British tax havens, including the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands, than into London.
But the British government has not said if, or how, it will force this network to disclose the true owners of assets.
Roman Borisovich, a former Moscow investment banker who is now an anti-corruption campaigner, said because London was the biggest centre of Russian money in the West the British government needed to do much more. 
""The UK is a weakest link letting down the entire Western alliance's effort,"" Borisovich said, adding that the measures announced so far ""are not even remotely sufficient"".
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was once Russia's richest man but who fell foul of the Kremlin, also said Britain and the United States need to take tougher measures to stop Russian money gaining political influence in Washington or London.
""If you say you are putting three oligarchs under sanctions, tell Putin that he is a bad man and prevent him shopping in Milan, then Putin will simply laugh,"" he said. 
TOUGHER MEASURES
Unlike after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 or a nerve agent attack blamed on Russia in southern England in 2018, British officials say this time is very different.
""Our clear intention is to choke off Russians' use of London as a place to keep or raise money,"" one told Reuters.
Britain will announce more sanctions, including against high-profile individuals and businesses, they said, adding that the size of the team involved in putting them in place has trebled in two months.
Some British lawmakers, Russian businessmen, and anti-corruption campaigners are sceptical about stopping Russian money moving in London's housing, financial and energy markets.
Liz Truss, the foreign minister, told lawmakers in a private meeting last week that London law firms are delaying efforts to implement sanctions against Russian oligarchs, according to Ben Bradshaw, a member of the opposition Labour Party.
Even if accounts could be traced, a big obstacle for British sanctions officials seeking to freeze individual accounts held by Russian billionaires could be the multi-layered system of trusts through which most hold their private wealth.
""I think most of them have already transferred their accounts just to make sure they do not fall under sanctions,"" Sergei Aleksashenko, a former deputy chairman of the Russian Central Bank now in exile in the United States after falling out with Putin's government. 
However, Britain's decision to ban commercial flights, including Aeroflot, and all Russian private jets will have a dramatic impact, said Chris Weafer, a director of Moscow-based consultancy Macroadvisory and a long-time British member of Russia's investment community.
Russia responded with a ban on British airlines.

""The Aeroflot ban has put the final nail in what was Londongrad,"" Weafer said, pointing to the number of Russian children at school in Britain and the use of London's medical facilities by Russians, as well as its world-renowned shops.

644,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2022 07:15PM ET</span>","Analysis-As Russia invades Ukraine, Moscow battles big tech to control the narrative","By Elizabeth Culliford
NEW YORK/MOSCOW (Reuters) - As Russian missiles rained down on Ukrainian cities, another battle took place online and over the airwaves. 
Moscow ramped up efforts to control the narrative playing out in news media and on tech platforms, while big tech companies Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google put restrictions on Russia's state-controlled media outlets in Ukraine and around the world. 
On Friday, Russia said it would partially restrict Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), a move Meta said came after it refused a government request to stop the independent fact-checking of several Russian state media outlets. By Saturday, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) also said its service was being restricted for some Russian users.
Images and videos were slower to load on Facebook after the slowdown was announced, according to users, while Facebook Messenger had long periods of not loading at all. On mobile devices, Twitter remained slow - it has been the subject of a punitive slowdown since March. Many state websites, including the Kremlin site kremlin.ru, have also suffered outages in recent days. 
For the tech companies, the stand-off is the latest step in an ongoing confrontation with Russia where platforms risk government-imposed restrictions in the country as it seeks to censor dissidents while protecting state-run media. 
Major social, video and livestreaming platforms from Facebook to TikTok and Twitch are coming under increasing pressure to combat falsehoods on their platforms relating to the conflict, including the spread of misleading footage.
The escalation of Russia's clash with big tech comes days before a deadline Moscow set for major foreign tech companies to comply with a new law that requires them to set up official representation in the country, which could make it easier for the Kremlin to regulate platforms. It follows a series of fines and slowdowns imposed on platforms which the Russian government said failed to remove illegal content. 
Ahead of the March deadline, an online list by Russia's communications regulator Roskomnadzor showed only Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) and Viber had fulfilled all three requirements of the law as of 2145 GMT on Sunday. They are: registering an account with the regulator, giving users a way to communicate directly with the company, and setting up a representative office.
This month, Russia threatened the companies with an advertising ban if they do not comply. Harsher restrictions that could follow include speed slowdowns or outright blocks, Russian officials have said.
Big tech companies also face the burden of weighing demands from Ukrainian officials and sympathizers worldwide who have called on them to expel Russian users from their services to stop the spread of false information, while also preserving the access of dissidents to vital digital tools.
""Mark Zuckerberg, while you create Metaverse - Russia ruins real life in Ukraine! We ask you to ban access to @facebookapp and @instagram from Russia - as long as tanks and missiles attack our kindergartens and hospitals!"" Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov wrote on Twitter on Sunday. 
Responding to the demands, Meta's head of global affairs Nick Clegg tweeted on Sunday that turning off Facebook and Instagram in Russia would ""silence important expression at a crucial time.""
It was clear others across the tech landscape were grappling with similar dilemmas. Just minutes after saying in a post on Sunday that the Telegram messaging app would consider restricting some channels for spreading false information, founder Pavel Durov said the company would no longer do so after receiving feedback from users.
RESTRICTIONS 
The activities of state-controlled media such as RT and Sputnik, which were hit with new EU sanctions on Sunday, has been a key source of conflict between Moscow and major tech platforms, as activists and politicians demanded the companies demonetize or ban the Kremlin-sponsored outlets.
Roskomnadzor has warned local media not to circulate what it called ""false information"" about Moscow's military operation, banning the use of the words ""invasion"" and ""assault"" to describe its attack on Ukraine. Russian tech giant  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX) has also started warning Russian users looking for news about Ukraine on its search engine about unreliable information on the internet. 
Russia calls its actions a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy Ukraine's military capabilities and capture individuals who it sees as dangerous nationalists - something the government in Kyiv and Western powers say is baseless propaganda.State-run media has long been a contentious presence on major social platforms, some of which label those accounts in an effort to be more transparent about the source of information.
Amid Russia's invasion, Facebook, Twitter, Google and its video streaming service YouTube took new measures to restrict Russian state media from making money from ads on their sites. Twitter, which banned ads from state-backed media in 2019, said it was pausing all ads in Russia and Ukraine to ensure the visibility of public safety information. Google, the world's biggest ad seller, also said it was not allowing Russian state media to sell ads using its tools. 

Facebook and Google also said they had restricted access to some state media accounts in Ukraine at the request of the Ukrainian government. Google said on Sunday it had banned downloads of RT's mobile app in Ukraine in response to a government legal request.
As Western companies begin to heed new economic new sanctions against Russia and pressure mounts to combat online disinformation, experts say the fight between Russia and the most powerful tech companies may intensify.

Meanwhile, German logistics company Deutsche Post (OTC:DPSGY) DHL said it had temporarily suspended shipments to and from Ukraine and was avoiding Ukrainian airspace for its global operations.
Both inbound and outbound services have been suspended to Ukraine, as well as deliveries to destinations in Russia, UPS and FedEx said in online statements seen on Sunday.
Both Atlanta-based UPS and Memphis-headquartered FedEx had said on Feb. 24 that they were suspending services to Ukraine in light of the invasion.

It was unclear if both firms continue to use Russian airspace as part of their general operations. Neither responded immediately to requests for comment.

The company said in September it could invest as much as $95 billion in Europe over the next decade and announce the locations of two major new European chip fabrication plants by the end of 2021, but no announcement has been made. 
Germany was top of the list of potential locations, with the local governments of Penzing in Bavaria and Magdeburg and Dresden in eastern Germany trying to tempt the U.S. company.
Analysts had said Intel could be waiting for the introduction of new legislation before deciding on a European location. The European Chips Act aims to reduce the continent's dependence on Asian suppliers for advanced semiconductors by subsidising the local development of large chip factories.
Chief Executive Patrick Gelsinger travelled to Europe last year. The government subsidies, stability and availability of skilled workers were factors that encouraged the CEO to choose Germany for the new plant, the source said.
Germany is also home to many of the world's biggest automakers which have been particularly badly hit by the global chip shortage.
The small city of Magdeburg is the capital of Saxony-Anhalt state. It hosts the Otto von Guericke University and has space for a new plant in the Eulenberg industrial area in the southwest.

It is not clear when production could start.
Intel, which in January announced plans to build a $20 billion U.S. chipmaking complex in Ohio, is likely to consider France and Italy for new locations in Europe as it plans to build a design centre and packaging plant, the source added.

The fund's Russian assets, consisting of shares in some 47 companies as well as government bonds, were worth 25 billion Norwegian crowns ($2.83 billion) at the end of 2021, down from 30 billion crowns a year earlier, the government said.
""We have decided to freeze the fund's investments and have begun a process of selling out (of Russia),"" Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere told a news conference.

652,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2022 01:21PM ET</span>",U.S. banks' Russian investment banking fee income in doubt after Moscow sanctions,"By David French and Megan Davies
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Western sanctions on Moscow could throw the small but lucrative Russian investment banking business that several large U.S. banks have maintained into question, lawyers said, which could deal a hit to tens of millions of dollars in fees. 
Major U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), have continued to underwrite and advise on Russian deals, often alongside the investment banking arm of state-owned VTB. VTB Capital is the largest investment bank by fees in Russia.
But U.S. sanctions placed on Thursday on VTB and Sberbank in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine make the prospect of doing so in the future difficult, lawyers said. That's only been compounded by the moves to block certain Russian banks' access to the SWIFT international payment system, announced Saturday.
All the U.S. banks declined comment. 
Under the U.S. sanctions, any assets of VTB, including 20 subsidiaries, that touched the U.S financial system would be frozen and U.S. persons would be prohibited from dealing with them.
The sanctions against VTB, which one lawyer said were as severe as those placed against terrorist organizations, would raise new reputation and compliance risks for banks doing business in Russia and make it impossible for U.S. banks to work with VTB on any deals, that lawyer said.
""These are very strong sanctions on the financial system,"" said Clay Lowery, executive vice president at the Institute of International Finance, a Washington-based bank group. 
One of the lawyers who advises financial institutions said the sanctions were ""a brick wall,"" and for banks there was now a reputation risk of dealing with Russia, even when it is not one of the sanctioned entities.
Ross Delston, a U.S. lawyer and former banking regulator, said that the moves on SWIFT would result in Russia being viewed as ""radioactive"" by banks in the U.S. and Europe.
Still, some see a future for U.S. banks in Russia despite the measures. 
A source familiar with one U.S. bank in Moscow said that they were working out how to apply the sanctions and recognized there would be an impact on how to conduct investment banking business. But the source added that the bank was not considering pulling out of the country.
A source close to another U.S. bank said that even if VTB could not be in deals such as IPOs or M&A, other banks could replace it - as long as those banks are not also subjected to sanctions. That source said the sanctions were not an insurmountable problem for the international banks, adding that there were other segments of the market and sources of revenue for international banks. 
VTB said in a statement on Thursday that sanctions had ""been a reality for us over the past few years"" and the bank has ""had time to learn the lessons and prepare for the most severe scenario."" The bank did not respond to follow up questions. 
Investment banking business in Russia has been dwindling since 2014, when the United States sanctioned Moscow for invading Crimea. But U.S. banks managed to retain a toehold in the market.
Russia accounted for 0.27% of the global fee pot last year, including advisory and underwriting fees on mergers and acquisitions, equity and debt capital markets. In 2013, Russia accounted for nearly 1% of the fee pool.

Even so, the number translates to sizeable fees. The investment banking arm of Russia's No.2 bank, VTB Capital, collected $142.9 million - or a third - of the fees earned in Russia in 2021, Refinitiv data showed. 
JPMorgan was second overall with $32.8 million, Morgan Stanley fourth, generating $27.3 million, and Citigroup fifth with $22.8 million, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was seventh, generating $19.5 million.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. banks are preparing for retaliatory cyber attacks after Western nations slapped a raft of stringent sanctions on Russia for invading Ukraine https://www.reuters.com/world/india/war-with-ukraine-putin-puts-nuclear-deterrence-forces-alert-2022-02-27, cyber experts and executives said. 
Tensions between Russia and the West escalated on Saturday as the United States and its allies moved to block https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-announces-new-russia-sanctions-with-us-others-including-swift-2022-02-26 some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payment system https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/swift-block-deals-crippling-blow-russia-leaves-room-tighten-2022-02-27 and placed curbs on the Russian central bank's international reserves.
Western governments have warned for weeks that the tensions could spark massive cyber attacks from Russia or its supporters. Some executives said the latest measures may be the trigger.
""There will be some retaliatory measures taken by them, and I think in the least costly way that they can do it - that means some kind of cyber attack,"" said Steven Schweitzer, senior fixed income portfolio manager at the Swarthmore Group in New York.
Global banks, already top targets for cyber attacks in peacetime, are increasing network monitoring, drilling for cyber attack scenarios, searching their networks for threats and lining up extra staff in case hostile activity surges, according to cyber security experts.
Among the threats they are preparing for: ransomware and malware attacks; denial-of-service attacks that take down websites; and data wiping and theft, possibly simultaneously. 
""Banks are incredibly prepared. They have taken out their playbooks and it's practice, practice, practice,"" said Valerie Abend, who leads Accenture (NYSE:ACN)'s global financial services security group.
The largest U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to discuss their cybersecurity plans. 
As guardians of critical national financial infrastructure, global banks are subject to strict operational risk rules and have some of the highest cyber security standards in corporate America, according to cyber experts.
The industry regularly plans for attacks and completed a massive, system-wide ransomware drill in November, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, which led the exercise.
Leading up to the invasion, there has been a more concerted industry effort to ensure banks' incident responders are on high alert and that they had increased monitoring, Abend said.
The New York Department of Financial Services and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency have warned private companies to be vigilant for cyber threats.
""We wouldn't be doing our due diligence if we weren't preparing for that,"" said Teresa Walsh, global head of intelligence at the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, an international group of institutions that share cyber intelligence.
""Right now, they've been warning in generalities - just be prepared. We are trying to put some more specificity to it,"" Walsh added.
Walsh said banks have been brainstorming risk scenarios based on tactics Russian hackers have used in the past. The 2020 SolarWinds Corp software breach https://www.reuters.com/world/us/hackers-solarwinds-breach-stole-data-us-sanctions-policy-intelligence-probes-2021-10-07 that gave hackers access to hundreds of companies using its products, is top of mind.
That has increased lenders' focus on third-party providers such as big cloud and software-as-a-service firms. While banks themselves have big IT budgets and strict compliance programs, if such providers are hacked their data could be exposed. 
Banks are urging such partners to ensure they have the right security protocols, according to Walsh and Abend.

They are also ""threat hunting,"" searching for known malicious behaviors inside bank IT systems, examining potential vulnerabilities and testing anything they had to recently patch, Walsh said.
""It's all about being prepared and not waiting for when the crisis happens,"" Walsh added.

LONDON (Reuters) -Two Russian billionaires, Mikhail Fridman and Oleg Deripaska, called for an end to the conflict triggered by President Vladimir Putin's assault on Ukraine, with Fridman calling it a tragedy for both countries' people.
Billionaire Fridman, who was born in western Ukraine, told staff in a letter that the conflict was driving a wedge between the two eastern Slav peoples of Russia and Ukraine who have been brothers for centuries. 
""I was born in Western Ukraine and lived there until I was 17. My parents are Ukrainian citizens and live in Lviv, my favourite city,"" Fridman wrote in the letter, excerpts of which Reuters saw.
""But I have also spent much of my life as a citizen of Russia, building and growing businesses. I am deeply attached to the Ukrainian and Russian peoples and see the current conflict as a tragedy for them both.""
Russian billionaire, Oleg Deripaska, used a post on Telegram to called for peace talks to begin ""as fast as possible"".
""Peace is very important,"" said Deripaska, who is the founder of Russian aluminium giant Rusal, in which he still owns a stake via his shares in its parent company En+ Group.
On Feb. 21, Deripaska said there would not be a war.
Washington imposed sanctions on Deripaska and other influential Russians because of their ties to Putin after alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, which Moscow denies.
Russia's so-called oligarchs, who once exercised significant influence over President Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s, are facing economic chaos after the West imposed severe sanctions on Russia over Putin's invasion of Ukraine.
Putin, after consulting his security council of senior officials, said he ordered the special military operation to protect people, including Russian citizens, from ""genocide"" - an accusation the West calls baseless propaganda.
The Ukrainian president's office said negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow would be held at the Belarusian-Ukrainian border. 
""This crisis will cost lives and damage two nations who have been brothers for hundreds of years,"" Fridman said.  
""While a solution seems frighteningly far off, I can only join those whose fervent desire is for the bloodshed to end. I’m sure my partners share my view.""
One of Fridman's long-term partners, Pyotr Aven, attended a meeting at the Kremlin with Putin and 36 other major Russian businessmen last week, the Kremlin said. 
Another Moscow billionaire told Reuters on condition of anonymity that the war was going to be a catastrophe.
""It is going to be catastrophic in all senses: for the economy, for relations with the rest of the world, for the political situation,"" the billionaire said.
The billionaires who gathered for a meeting with Putin in the Kremlin on Thursday were silent, he said.

658,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2022 10:20AM ET</span>","Some investors wary of 'buying the dip' as Ukraine, Fed gyrate stocks","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks drew buyers after a recent tumble, but some investors believe buying the dip this time may be a far riskier bet than in the past as markets face geopolitical strife and a hawkish Federal Reserve. 
The benchmark S&P 500 surged more than 6% from Thursday's lows to close higher on the week, after investors swooped in following sharp declines on the heels of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
Investors were preparing for more gyrations in asset prices after Western nations announced a harsh set of sanctions to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, including blocking some banks from the SWIFT international payments system. [
On the surface, last week’s rebound resembled past bounces the index has experienced in its more than 200% run over the past decade, when ""buying the dip"" proved a winning strategy.
Yet while bargain hunters over the last two years could count on the Fed's historically loose monetary policy to offer stocks support, today they face heightened geopolitical uncertainty and a central bank that is expected to pull out the stops in its fight against inflation – starting with a widely anticipated rate increase in March. 
""Investors were trained to buy the dip because they had the backing of the Fed. But now you could make a case that this is one of the most significant geopolitical events for the last decade, and you don't have the Fed in your corner,"" said Burns McKinney, a senior portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group.
The S&P is down 8% year-to-date and confirmed it was in a correction by falling more than 10% from its record high earlier this week - its biggest decline since stocks lost nearly a third of their value in the COVID-19 selloff of March 2020 before doubling from their lows. 
Many expect geopolitical tensions to continue plaguing markets, as the implications from the war in Ukraine become clearer. 
Kyle Bass, founder and chief investment officer of hedge fund Hayman Capital Management, believes investors still have not factored in all of the possible outcomes that could result from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including a prolonged conflict that weighs on global growth and sends inflation higher by pushing up commodity prices.
""This is going to get worse before it gets better,"" he told Reuters in a recent interview. ""Asset managers don't have these outcomes in their realm of possibilities.""
Measures to cut off some Russian banks off from SWIFT and place restrictions on the Russian central bank's international reserves may fuel more market swings, including a renewed rush to safe haven assets such as gold and Treasuries, investors said.
""We saw an equity rally and risk assets rally recently on the basis that the West was not going to impose very severe sanctions, but that is certainly going to change,"" said Peter Kinsella, global head of FX strategy at UBP. ""The fact that it looks like this is going to be a more drawn out and protracted conflict is not a particularly good environment for risky assets."" 
Bass said investors should own assets that can hold value during inflationary times, such as commodities and real estate.
McKinney is buying dividend-paying stocks that he expects to withstand future volatility in the market and moving some money into defense companies.
In addition to the fast-moving situation in Ukraine, investors next week will be watching Friday's non-farm payrolls data for February – the last such employment report the Fed will see before its monetary policy meeting in March.
Anticipation of Fed tightening has weighed on markets in recent weeks, as investors price in around 165 points of interest rate increases by next February. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said he expected to raise interest rates in March for the first time since 2018. [FEDWATCH]
Though Ukraine remains in flux, those in favor of buying on weakness argue that stock declines from past geopolitical events have been short-lived. LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA)'s study of 37 major geopolitical events since World War Two found that stocks were up an average of 11% one year later, provided a recession does not occur.
Retail investors have been among the dip buyers, purchasing a net $1.5 billion on Thursday, data from Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research showed.
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) last week added to its strategic overweight in equities, saying investors may be overestimating how hawkish central banks will need to be in their battle against inflation. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s analysts, meanwhile, argued that ""initial volatility around rate liftoff didn't last and equities made new all-time highs 2-4 quarters out.""
Others, however, are taking a more dour view, as the markets price in Fed tightening in the face of soaring inflation.

Charles Lemonides, portfolio manager of hedge fund ValueWorks LLC has been increasing his bets against some stocks, including semiconductor maker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc and plant-based meat company Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc, skeptical that markets will be able to sustain a rally in the face of a hawkish Fed.
""The reality is that the market has had a huge run and inevitably you give back some of those gains,"" he said.

The Norwegian fund owns 1.03% of Apple's shares, making it the company's eighth largest shareholder, according to Refinitiv data.
The maker of iPhones, computers and other devices is due to hold its annual meeting of shareholders on March 4.
Chief Executive Tim Cook's pay in 2021 was 1,447 times that of the average Apple employee, a company filing on Jan. 7 showed, fuelled by stock awards that helped him earn a total of $98.7 million.
Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) last week urged investors to vote against Cook's remuneration, citing concerns around the magnitude and structure of his equity award, which amounted to some $82.3 million.
Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), which operates the Norwegian wealth fund, said in a statement it would follow the advice.

""A substantial proportion of annual remuneration should be provided as shares that are locked in for five to ten years, regardless of resignation or retirement,"" NBIM said.
""The board should provide transparency on total remuneration to avoid unacceptable outcomes. The board should ensure that all benefits have a clear business rationale.""

661,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2022 08:05AM ET</span>",Stocks set for a painful week as conflict intensifies; bonds to gain,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - World markets were set for another tumultuous week after Western nations announced a harsh set of sanctions to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and as fighting intensified for a fourth day.
U.S. stocks have fallen nearly 8% so far this year, on track for the worst annual start since 2009, and worries over the intensifying conflict in Ukraine has shaken markets across the world.
Though Wall Street ended higher on Friday with major indices up between 1.5%-2.5%, analysts expected markets to come under selling pressure on Monday. 
""Nobody likes uncertainty, investors certainly dislike uncertainty and we are looking at a pretty protracted conflict,"" said Peter Kinsella, global head of FX strategy at UBP. 
""It seems to me we are in the opening stages of a new Cold War, that is pretty clear and that will weigh on sentiment for a long time.""
Russian military vehicles pushed into Ukraine's second-largest city on Sunday and explosions rocked oil and gas installations on a fourth day of the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two.
In response, the United States and its allies moved to block certain Russian banks' access to the SWIFT international payment system. The measures also include restrictions on the Russian central bank's international reserves and will be implemented in the coming days. [PnL8N2V117C] 
""Friday's bounce looked like a genuine short squeeze but Monday should bring some fresh selling pressure as the SWIFT sanctions and the growing likelihood of freezing Russian currency reserves will inflict some real financial pain across markets,"" said John Marley, CEO of forexxtra, a London-based FX consultancy. 
The Russian invasion comes at a time when investors are already worried about expensive market valuations and hawkish central banks with world stocks falling to a 10-month low on Thursday and down more than 7% so far this year.
DIALING DOWN RISK
The latest developments could also put fresh pressure on energy and grain prices, with Brent futures having topped $105 per barrel and wheat futures scaling to levels last seen in mid-2008 on Thursday before easing back somewhat on Friday. 
Latest weekly positioning data indicates investors frantically trying to dial down risk in their portfolios.
Hedge funds cut long bets on the British pound while yen short positions were slashed, according to data from Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Separate data from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) showed outflows from European-focused equity funds while flows into developed market equities fell into negative territory.
Safe-haven assets will be in demand with U.S. Treasuries, German Bunds and the Swiss franc likely to see heavy buying as traders digest the implications of the latest round of sanctions. 
Russia's main stock index closed up 20% on Friday after Thursday's record 33% drop while the rouble recovered somewhat after falling to a record low on Thursday at 90 per dollar with analysts expecting more pain on Monday.

""There is increased risk of a Russian debt default, last seen in 1998, as a result of weekend announcements,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY).
Volatility gauges across markets, already at elevated levels, are expected to shoot higher on Monday while investor buying of derivative contracts to protect themselves against further losses are likely to surge.

Taiwan, which announced it was joining international sanctions against Russia on Friday, is a major chip manufacturer, home to the world's largest contract chip maker and Asia's most valuable listed company, TSMC.
The Economy Ministry said it was following the Wassenaar Arrangement on export controls for weapons and dual-use goods and technologies, signed in 1996 by 42 countries, to strictly scrutinise products sent to Russia.
""Domestic semiconductor manufacturers have also expressed that they will abide by the laws and closely cooperate with government measures,"" it added, without elaborating. 
TSMC said last week it would comply with all export control rules. It declined further comment on Sunday.
Taiwan, claimed by China as its own territory and so excluded from most international bodies and agreements, is not a signatory to the Wassenaar Arrangement.
But the government likes to show they are a responsible member of the international community in following measures such as United Nations sanctions on North Korea for its missile and nuclear tests.

Taiwan's exports to Russia are minimal.
Taiwan expects little impact from the war in Ukraine on the supply of key raw materials for semiconductors, the government said on Saturday.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett is this year bringing back the annual extravaganza for shareholders of his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc that he calls ""Woodstock for Capitalists.""
But the 91-year-old billionaire has a cautionary message: If you want to attend, get vaccinated against COVID-19.
Proof of vaccination will be required to attend Berkshire's annual meeting in a downtown Omaha, Nebraska arena on April 30, and to shop from Berkshire-owned businesses in an adjacent exhibit hall.
The meeting is the centerpiece of three days of events across Omaha including shopping discounts, an outdoor picnic, and a 5-kilometer run that typically attract some 40,000 people from around the world, including large numbers from China.
Many go to reconnect with friends and share investment ideas. ""It's a tuition-free course in Investments 101,"" said Tom Russo, a principal at Gardner Russo & Quinn who said he plans to attend his 35th meeting this year.
Before the pandemic, it was common for people to camp out overnight before the arena's 7 a.m. opening, so they could get good seats.
""It's a weird combination of trade show and press conference and celebration of capitalism,"" said Jim Shanahan, an Edward Jones & Co analyst who has gone twice. ""A lot of people are looking forward to attending, me included.""
Berkshire scrapped the weekend in 2020 and 2021 because of the pandemic, while streaming truncated annual meetings online. This year's meeting will also be live-streamed.
Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 98, will field five hours of shareholder questions with a break for lunch, with Vice Chairmen Greg Abel and Ajit Jain joining them in the morning.

In his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett also said the ""Margaritaville"" singer Jimmy Buffett (no relation) has designed a ""pontoon 'party' boat"" now being built by Berkshire's Forest River unit. It will be available for sale, at 10% off.
""Your bargain-hunting chairman will be buying a boat for his family's use,"" Buffett wrote. ""Join me.""

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Investors were preparing on Saturday for more wild gyrations in asset prices after Western nations announced a harsh set of sanctions to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, including blocking some banks from the SWIFT international payments system. 
New measures announced by the United States, Britain, Europe and Canada also include restrictions on the Russian central bank's international reserves. The moves will be implemented in the coming days. 
Investors have feared Russia would get kicked off SWIFT, the world's main international payments network, as this would disrupt global trade and hurt Western interests as well as hit Russia.
""It means there is going to be a catastrophe on the Russian currency market on Monday,"" said former Russian Central Bank Deputy Chairman Sergei Aleksashenko. ""I think they will stop trading and then the exchange rate will be fixed at an artificial level just like in Soviet times.""
Michael Farr, chief executive of financial consulting firm Farr, Miller & Washington LLC, said of the impact on global markets, ""This could be a surprise that is not taken very well if it means a slowdown in international trade.” 
The news comes after a week when worries over the intensifying conflict in Ukraine shook markets across the world. Stocks tumbled and oil prices soared as investors rushed to gold, the dollar and other safe havens. 
Many of those safety moves were at least partially unwound on Thursday and Friday, and U.S. stock markets rallied to close up for the week.
The latest measures could send markets on another wild ride, as traders assess the implications for the global economy, including potentially higher commodity prices and inflation. The war between Russia, one of the world’s biggest raw materials’ exporters, and Ukraine has already helped push up oil prices to their highest level since 2014. 
The S&P 500 is off 8% for the year to date, dragged down by worries over geopolitical strife and a more hawkish Federal Reserve. 
""A lot of traders were kind of becoming convinced that the U.S. and Europe were not taking a hard stance,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. “This action will be really difficult to digest and it will really pick a nerve for a lot of investors. ... A lot of the rebound we saw in the latter half of last week will be tested.” 
Mohamed El-Erian, part-time chief economic adviser at Allianz (DE:ALVG) and chair of Gramercy Fund Management, said excluding Russia from SWIFT “has the potential to cripple the economy there"" if done comprehensively.
""Inevitably there would be spillovers and spillbacks, including more of a stagflationary impetus to the global economy and greater likelihood of Russian arrears to Western companies and creditors,"" he said, in emailed comments.
Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments, said the move is going to continue fueling demand for gold, Treasuries and other popular destinations for nervous investors.
“SWIFT is going to be painful and the markets are going to recognize that,” he said. “What you are going to get is continued volatility as all the participants are going to be adjusting their risk tolerance.”
One likely casualty will be the Russian rouble, investors said. Russia’s currency fell to an all-time low against the U.S. dollar in the past week, though it pared some of those losses on Friday.
“With the central bank likely to face severe constraints on currency intervention, the rouble will struggle to find a bottom,” said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay. “No one wants to catch a falling knife.""

Some investors, however, said the markets could put a positive spin on the fresh measures as Western troops had not joined the war. 
“It’s the closest thing to a declaration of war from a financial perspective,"" said Ross Delston, a U.S. lawyer and former banking regulator. ""It’s going to result in Russia being viewed as radioactive by U.S. and EU banks, which in turn would be a major barrier to trade with Russia.”

(Reuters) -Alphabet Inc's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) barred on Saturday Russia's state-owned media outlet RT and other channels from receiving money for ads on their websites, apps and YouTube videos, similar to a move by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) after the invasion of Ukraine. 
Citing ""extraordinary circumstances,"" Google's YouTube unit said it was ""pausing a number of channels’ ability to monetize on YouTube."" These included several Russian channels affiliated with recent sanctions, such as those by the European Union.
Ad placement is largely controlled by YouTube. 
Google added later that it was also barring Russian state-funded media outlets from using its ad technology to generate revenue on their own websites and apps.
In addition, the Russian media will not be able to buy ads through Google Tools or place ads on Google services such as search and Gmail, spokesman Michael Aciman said.
""We’re actively monitoring new developments and will take further steps if necessary,"" Aciman said.
On Wednesday, the European Union unveiled sanctions on individuals such as Margarita Simonyan, whom it called RT's editor-in-chief and ""a central figure"" of Russian propaganda.
Videos from affected media will also come up less often in recommendations, YouTube spokesperson Farshad Shadloo said. He added that RT and several other channels would no longer be accessible in Ukraine after a Ukrainian government request.
On Saturday, Ukraine Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) he contacted YouTube ""to block the propagandist Russian channels — such as Russia 24, TASS, RIA Novosti.""
RT and Simonyan did not respond to requests for comment. YouTube declined to identify the other channels restricted.
For years, lawmakers and some users have urged Google for more action on channels linked to the Russian government, concerned that they spread misinformation and should not profit by it.
Russia received an estimated $7 million to $32 million over the two years to December 2018 from ads across 26 YouTube channels it backed, digital researcher Omelas told Reuters at the time. 

YouTube has previously said it did not treat state-funded media channels that comply with its rules differently from others when it comes to sharing ad revenue.
On Friday, Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc barred Russian state media from running ads or generating revenue from ads on its services.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk said on Saturday that the company's Starlink satellite broadband service is available in Ukraine and SpaceX is sending more terminals to the country, whose internet has been disrupted due to the Russian invasion. 
""Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route,"" Musk tweeted. 
He was responding to a tweet by a Ukraine government official who asked Musk to provide the embattled country with Starlink stations.
“@elonmusk, while you try to colonize Mars — Russia try to occupy Ukraine! While your rockets successfully land from space — Russian rockets attack Ukrainian civil people!"" Ukraine’s vice prime minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, tweeted.
Internet connectivity in Ukraine has been affected by the Russian invasion, particularly in the southern and eastern parts of the country where fighting has been heaviest, internet monitors said on Saturday. 

While extremely costly to deploy, satellite technology can provide internet for people who live in rural or hard-to-serve places where fiber optic cables and cell towers do not reach. The technology can also be a critical backstop when hurricanes or other natural disasters disrupt communication.
Musk said on Jan. 15 that SpaceX had 1,469 Starlink satellites active and 272 moving to operational orbits soon.

An announcement is expected as early as next week, according to the source. 
Licht is currently an executive producer of the Emmy Award-winning ""The Late Show With Stephen Colbert"" on Paramount Global's (O:PARA) CBS network. He served for six years as executive producer of ""CBS This Morning,"" offering a newsier alternative to rival network morning shows. He has also served as executive producer of MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" an experience that provided the backdrop of his book ""What I Learned When I Almost Died,"" in which he describes the life-changing experience of surviving a brain aneurysm. 
Industry newsletter Puck first reported https://puck.news/jeff-zuckers-successor-is-chris-licht the development. 
This marks the first major appointment by Discovery CEO David Zaslav, who will lead the new Warner Bros. Discovery once the acquisition of WarnerMedia is completed. 
The network was thrown into turmoil earlier this month following the abrupt departure of its longtime leader Jeff Zucker, the executive who reshaped the news network. He was forced to leave, he told colleagues, because he failed to disclose a consensual relationship with a colleague. 
Discovery has said it was not consulted on that decision.

Licht will run CNN as head of news for Warner Bros. Discovery and unlike Zucker, his purview will not extend to sports, the newsletter reported, citing sources. 
Zaslav heaped praise on CNN's coverage of the war in Ukraine during Discovery's investor call this week, lauding ""journalists in bulletproof vests and helmets ... doing what journalists do the best, which is fight to tell the truth in dangerous places.""

670,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2022 02:16PM ET</span>",Buffett laments lack of good investments even as Berkshire profit sets record,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday signaled he will stick to his knitting, bemoaning the lack of good investment opportunities for Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc as it sits on a massive pile of cash even after repurchasing a huge amount of its own stock.
In his widely read annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, the 91-year-old billionaire expressed strong confidence in Berkshire, saying its emphasis on investing in strong businesses and stocks benefits investors with a similar long-term focus.
""People who are comfortable with their investments will, on average, achieve better results than those who are motivated by ever-changing headlines, chatter and promises,"" Buffett wrote.
Noting generally the risks of changes in world politics, terrorism and cyberattacks, Berkshire remains wary.
Cash swelled to a near-record $146.7 billion, even after Berkshire repurchased $51.7 billion of its own stock in 2020 and 2021.
Buffett also said, ""We find little that excites us"" in the stock market, and that major acquisitions remain hard to come by after six years without any.
""Today, internal opportunities deliver far better returns than acquisitions,"" he wrote.
Many of those opportunities appeared to pay off in 2021.
Operating profit rose 25% to a record $27.46 billion, with more than one-third from the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy despite COVID-19 supply chain disruptions. In the fourth quarter, operating profit swelled 45%.
Full-year net income more than doubled to a record $89.8 billion, bolstered by gains from Buffett's investments in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) and other stocks in Berkshire's vast portfolio.
""He is offering a story of a multifaceted growth engine,"" said Tom Russo, a partner at Gardner, Russo & Quinn in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, a longtime Berkshire investor. ""The primary message is that Berkshire has found some magnificent businesses, so let's celebrate them.""
The Apple stake alone totaled $161.2 billion as of Dec. 31, more than five times the $31.1 billion Berkshire paid for it. Buffett called Apple's Tim Cook a ""brilliant"" chief executive.
Stock buybacks totaled $27 billion in 2021 but have slowed in 2022, totaling $1.2 billion so far. Berkshire's stock price is 2% below its record high.
""Buffett's patience and discipline enabled him to make what is in essence the largest acquisition in Berkshire's history, its own stock, at a substantial discount to its current market price,"" said Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co.
'FOUR GIANTS'
In his letter, Buffett touted what he called Berkshire's ""four giants"" including its massive insurance operations, BNSF, Berkshire Hathaway Energy and the Apple stake.
""Our goal is to have meaningful investments in businesses with both durable economic advantages and a first-class CEO,"" Buffett wrote.
He said also Berkshire favors an ""old-fashioned sort of earnings,"" including $6 billion last year at its BNSF railroad, throwing shade on companies that may manipulate their results to boost their stock prices.
""Deceptive 'adjustments' to earnings -- to use a polite description -- have become both more frequent and more fanciful as stocks have risen,"" Buffett wrote. ""Speaking less politely, I would say that bull markets breed bloviated bull....""
Buffett said Berkshire's huge cash stake was ""not some deranged expression of patriotism,"" but rather a shield against losses in its vast insurance operations, including a business insuring against major catastrophes.
Uncle Sam does benefit from Berkshire's size, Buffett said, collecting $3.3 billion of income tax from the company in 2021 out of the $402 billion in total corporate income tax receipts received by the U.S. Treasury.
Buffett also pledged to keep more than $30 billion of cash on hand, after long saying $20 billion was the minimum. That still leaves plenty available for the right acquisition.
""They are having a tough time (making acquisitions), given frothiness in the market and difficulty competing with private equity firms and SPACs,"" said CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert, referring to special purpose acquisition companies.
Berkshire's annual report, also released Saturday, included a letter from Vice Chairman Greg Abel describing the company's commitment to sustainability and protecting the environment.
Abel, 59, would become Berkshire's chief executive if Buffett were unable to continue. Portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who invest $34 billion, are in line to oversee Berkshire's stock investments.
The company's more than 90 operating units also include Dairy Queen ice cream, See's candies and several industrial companies.
Berkshire also said on Saturday it plans for the first time since 2019 to hold its usual shareholder weekend in Omaha, including the April 30 annual meeting.

""Woodstock for Capitalists,"" as Buffett calls the weekend, typically draws about 40,000 people for shopping, dining, a 5-kilometer run and other events.
Proof of COVID-19 vaccination will be required to attend the annual meeting and obtain some shopping discounts.

671,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2022 01:25PM ET</span>","Buffett's Berkshire posts record annual profit, extends but slows buybacks","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc on Saturday said fourth-quarter profit swelled, boosted by gains in many of its businesses and common stock investments such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and said annual earnings reached a record high.
Berkshire also signaled renewed confidence in its own stock, repurchasing $6.9 billion in the quarter, and boosting total buybacks in 2021 to a record $27 billion.
But the pace of buybacks has slowed, with Berkshire, whose share price is just 2% below its record high, repurchasing just $1.2 billion of stock in 2022.
In his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett said buybacks make ""good sense"" when alternatives such as buying whole companies or more stocks appear ""unattractive.""
He also expressed confidence in Berkshire's dozens of operating businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Geico auto insurer, after having gone six years since a major acquisition and letting Berkshire's cash stake swell to $146.7 billion.
""Today, internal opportunities deliver far better returns than acquisitions,"" Buffett wrote.
Quarterly operating income rose 45% to $7.29 billion, or approximately $4,931 per Class A share, from $5.02 billion a year earlier.
Analysts on average expected operating profit of $4,251 per Class A share, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S.
""Overall results looked good,"" said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research with a ""hold"" rating for Berkshire. ""Many industrial and consumer businesses benefited from the tailwind of an economic recovery.
She said 2022 could be tougher for top-line and margin growth because of inflationary pressure, including higher fuel and other input costs, and geopolitical pressure.""
For all of 2021, operating income rose 25% to $27.46 billion, topping the previous record $24.78 billion set in 2018.
Net income more than doubled to $89.8 billion, aided by the stock prices of Berkshire's largest stock investments--Apple, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) Co--which each rose by more than one-third.
Buffett considers net income a misleading performance measure because it includes gains and losses from stock holdings, regardless of what Berkshire buys or sells.
CRASHES AFFECT GEICO
Quarterly operating results benefited from improvement in property and casualty insurance operations, offset by rising accident claims at the Geico auto insurer as people drive more.
James Shanahan, an Edward Jones & Co analyst who rates Berkshire ""buy,"" said insurers are raising premiums to offset crash losses, and that higher premiums should be a ""pretty strong catalyst"" for improvement at Geico in 2022.
Seifert, however, said the deterioration in claims trends in life insurance ""won't turn around in the next couple of quarters. That affects underwriting profitability for reinsurers such as Berkshire.""
The BNSF railroad, one of Berkshire's largest units, boosted profit 13%, helped by higher shipping volumes of consumer products, industrial products and coal.
Profit also rose 11% at Berkshire Hathaway Energy, as units including PacifiCorp and MidAmerican Energy reported benefiting from higher margins and increased income tax benefits.
Precision Castparts, an aircraft and industrial parts unit that took a $9.8 billion writedown in 2020 as plane production and air travel plummeted, boosted full-year pretax earnings 79% after eliminating more than 13,000 jobs, though revenue fell 8%.

A quick recovery for Precision's aerospace business isn't likely, Berkshire said, citing supply chain disruptions and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's ""significant inventory levels"" following quality issues with its 737 and 787 planes.
Berkshire's share price rose 30% in 2021, topping the 29% gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 including dividends, and ending two years of significant underperformance relative to that index. They are also outperforming in 2022.

(Reuters) - Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) is being restricted for some users in Russia, the social media company said in a tweet on Saturday.
On Friday, one day after Russia invaded Ukraine, Moscow said it was partially limiting access to Meta Platforms Inc's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), accusing it of ""censoring"" Russian media.
Twitter said it was working to keep its service safe and accessible. It did not immediately respond to a question on whether Russia had communicated with the company about any actions.
Internet blockage observatory NetBlocks reported that Twitter had been restricted on leading networks https:// A Reuters reporter in Moscow on Saturday said the site was slow and had difficulties sending tweets. 

Russia has been trying to exert tighter control over the internet and big tech companies for years, in efforts that critics say threaten individual and corporate freedom, and are part of a wider crackdown against outspoken opponents of the Kremlin.
Last year, Moscow slowed down the speed of Twitter in a punitive move because it said the site was not removing illegal content.

673,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2022 06:55AM ET</span>",Europe at war: Six charts to know in financial markets,"LONDON (Reuters) - Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine this week, sparking a slew of sanctions and turmoil in global financial markets.
Below are six charts showing the week's dramatic moves in financial markets:
ENERGY SURGE
Fears of a potential supply disruption on oil markets from the war in Ukraine saw crude prices surge above $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014, with Brent touching $105. [O/R] UK and Dutch gas prices rose about 40%-50% on Thursday. Both crude and gas prices came down on Friday, markets remain jittery. [NG/EU]
While a raft of harsh sanctions imposed by western capitals has not specifically targeted Russia's oil and gas flows, top buyers of Russian oil were struggling to secure guarantees at Western banks or find ships to take crude from the country.
Russia is the world's second-largest crude producer and provides around 35% of Europe's and 50% of Germany's natural gas supply. 
(Graphic: Oil and gas prices jump - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xmpjoelrbvr/Gas%20and%20brent%20prices%20jump.PNG) 
INFLATION FEARS
Soaring energy prices fuelled a dash for inflation-linked bonds - securities whose payouts rise in line with inflation.
That has sent real yields - borrowing costs after adjusting for inflation - sharply lower, while so-called breakevens, indicating where markets see future inflation, rose sharply.
Essentially, that implies belief that central banks may have to go slower than earlier forecast with interest rate rises to battle inflation as economic growth also takes a hit.
Yields on rate-sensitive Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) slipped while breakevens rose towards 3% this past week. In Germany, vulnerable to surging European gas prices, two-year real yields slumped around 30 bps and breakevens rose as high as 3.7% TIPS funds received net inflows for the first time in five weeks, BofA data shows.

STOCK MARKETS: BEWARE OF THE BEAR 
Thursday's market rout wiped nearly $1 trillion off the value of the global stock market and accelerated a drop in the major indexes that has come this year as investors have started to get jittery about major central bank rate hikes.
The tech-heavy U.S. Nasdaq flirted with ""bear"" market territory, as a 20% fall from the last peak is known, but U.S. markets ended up closing higher despite all the damage elsewhere and were making more ground on Friday.
Europe's 3.3% drop for the STOXX 600 took its recent reverse past 10%, but it then bounced just as much on Friday. 
MSCI's 24-country emerging markets index meanwhile did earn its ""bear"" market tag as its 4.3% drop on Thursday left it down just over 20% from a record high almost exactly a year ago.

RUSSIAN ROUT
Predictably, Russia's stock market was hit the hardest on Thursday. Moscow's MOEX exchange slumped a record 33% having plunged more than 1,000 points at one stage as traders braced for stiff sanctions. MSCI's Russia index crashed 38%. Analysts estimate that it was one of the top three stock market crashes of all time.

UKRAINE DRAIN
Ukraine was hit just as hard. Its currency and government bonds crashed violently, with investors wondering whether the country would be able to avoid another sovereign default.

SOARING WHEAT & GRAINS
Wheat prices hit their highest since mid-2008 as markets tried to gauge the consequences on grain and oilseed supplies from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine - two of the world's biggest exporters.
Interruption to the supply out of the Black Sea region will put pressure on prices and further drive up food inflation at a time when affordability is a major concern across the globe following the economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ukraine's military on Thursday suspended commercial shipping at its ports after Russian forces invaded the country. Russia earlier ordered the Azov Sea closed to the movement of commercial vessels until further notice, but kept Russian ports in the Black Sea open for navigation.

674,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2022 06:40AM ET</span>",India's Reliance to take on 200 Future stores amid Amazon dispute - sources,"By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's top retailer, Reliance, will take on at least 200 Future Retail stores after the company failed to make lease payments for them to Reliance, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Saturday.
Since 2020, Reliance has failed to close a $3.4 billion deal to acquire the retail assets of Future, whose partner Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has successfully blocked the transaction by citing violation of some contracts. Future denies any wrongdoing.
The takeover of stores by Reliance signals Future's worsening financial situation. Future in January challenged its lenders in India's Supreme Court to avoid facing insolvency proceedings over missing bank payments, citing its dispute with Amazon.
Future - which has more than 1,700 outlets, including popular Big Bazaar stores - has been unable to make lease payments for some of its outlets. As a result, Reliance transferred the leases of some stores to its name and sublet them to Future to operate the stores, the sources said.
As Future failed to make the payments, Reliance has decided to run and rebrand about 200 outlets that would otherwise be closed, they said.
In a statement to Indian stock exchanges, Future said ""termination notices have been received for significant number of stores"" to which it will ""no longer have access.""
The company is ""scaling down its operations which will help us in reducing losses in the coming months,"" it said, without mentioning Reliance's plan to take over many such outlets.
Reliance and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment. 
""Over 200 stores will transition to Reliance stores,"" said one source, who asked not to be named as the details of the plan were not public.

In a letter seen by Reuters, Reliance offered Future employees at these stores new jobs on the same terms. ""We welcome you to join our organization,"" it reads.
Amazon has argued that Future violated the terms of a 2019 deal the companies signed when the U.S. giant invested $200 million in a Future unit. Amazon's position has been backed by a Singapore arbitrator and Indian courts.

The airline has said the problem, which came to light on Friday and affected its website, app, and airport operations, was not caused by a cyber attack but was a hardware issue.
BA has been caught up in tit-for-tat bans by Russia and Britain that have stopped their respective national carriers from using each other's airspace. 
""We are extremely sorry that due to the continuing technical issues we are facing we have regrettably had to cancel all short-haul flights from Heathrow today until midday,"" the airline said in a statement.
""Our long-haul services at Heathrow and all flights at Gatwick and London City Airport are due to operate as planned, but customers may experience some delays. Our website ba.com is working and customers can check-in online and at the airport,"" the airline said.
It advised passengers to check on its website for the latest information before travelling to the airport as more disruption was expected.
BA, owned by IAG (LON:ICAG), was hit by a major computer system failure in 2017 that stranded 75,000 passengers over a holiday weekend, sparking a public relations disaster and pledges from the carrier that it would do better in future.

The company said customers would be offered a full refund for cancelled services or could rebook at a later date for free.

On Monday, Didi said it was leaving Russia on March 4, about a year and a half after launching services there. It has been in Kazakhstan for about a year.
""Unfortunately, due to changing market conditions and other challenges, it has become clear at the moment we will not be able to provide the best results in Russia and Kazakhstan,"" it said on Monday.
Neither statement mentioned geopolitical factors in the decision, but some critics online said the timing of the move opened Didi to accusations of succumbing to U.S. pressure on Russia, which invaded neighbouring Ukraine on Thursday.

DUBAI (Reuters) - E&, the UAE telecoms group formerly called Etisalat, is looking to expand into new markets in Africa, Europe and Asia and in areas outside telecoms such as financial technology as its seeks to drive growth, its CEO told Reuters. 
The company is exploring a range of possibilities, including potential joint ventures, acquisitions and listings of subsidiaries, though it would want to retain control of all its units, Group CEO Hatem Dowidar said in an interview.
""While telco is a good business, and we're still focusing on telco - as for us it is the money-generating cash cow - the long-term growth needs to be through expansion,"" Dowidar said.
""In the telco space, we are looking at geographic expansion,"" he said, exploring markets in Africa, Europe and Asia with room for growth, political stability and strong regulations. He did not name any specific target markets.
The group has separated its business into consumer services-focused e& life, e& enterprise to provide digital services to government and business, and telecoms arm Etisalat, which Dowidar said is the world's seventh largest by market capitalisation. 
It has also set up e& capital to drive acquisitions and mergers.
Dowidar said a breakdown of how much each unit contributes would be shared with investors ""in a few months."" Total revenue growth at e& was 3% in 2021, while e& enterprise grew by 17%, he said, adding he expected growth to accelerate.
""We are preparing a few more announcements soon in Egypt,"" as well as Pakistan, he said. The announcement in Egypt will be related to the fintech sector, he added.
The firm is open to potential deals with other large telecoms providers, he said. He did not expect any to enter the UAE, where the government holds controlling stakes in the two telecoms providers, due to high penetration and already high-quality internet speeds and service.
""Given e&'s ambitions highlighted in the new operating model, we may consider raising debt if a suitable inorganic opportunity materializes,"" a representative said.

Whether popular internet-calling applications like WhatsApp - which have long been blocked in the UAE - will be allowed is up to regulators, he added. WhatsApp and others were allowed at Dubai's Expo world fair.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine triggered a flurry of credit rating moves on Friday, with S&P lowering Russia's rating to 'junk' status and Moody's putting it on review for a downgrade to junk.

Both countries' financial markets have unsurprisingly been thrown into turmoil by this week's events, which rank as the biggest military attack in Europe since World War Two, bringing stiff Western sanctions on Moscow.
S&P lowered Russia's long-term foreign currency credit rating to 'BB+' from 'BBB-', and warned it could lower ratings further, after getting more clarity on the macroeconomic repercussions of the sanctions.
""In our view, the sanctions announced to date could carry significant negative implications for the Russian banking sector's ability to act as a financial intermediary for international trade, S&P said. 
It also cut Ukraine's rating to 'B-' from 'B'.
Russia now has an ""investment grade"" rating of Baa3 from Moody's and an equivalent BBB- from Fitch, due to one of the lowest debt levels in the world at just 20% of GDP, and nearly $650 billion of currency reserves. 
A downgrade, however, would lower that rating to the riskier ""junk"" or sub-investment grade category.
""The decision to place the ratings on review for downgrade reflects the negative credit implications for Russia's credit profile from the additional and more severe sanctions being imposed,"" Moody's said in a statement.
Sovereign rating reviews can take months but this time are likely to be quicker.
Moody's said its decision would factor in the scale of the conflict and the severity of additional Western sanctions, which have already hit some of Russia's top banks, military exports and members of President Vladimir Putin's inner circle. 
It added it would also weigh the degree to which Russia's substantial currency reserves are able to mitigate the disruption stemming from the new sanctions and lengthy conflict. 
""Moody's will look to conclude the review when these credit implications become more clear, particularly when the impact of further sanctions takes shape in the coming days or weeks,"" it said.
Moody's also put Ukraine's already-junk ""B3"" rating on review for a downgrade.
Fitch did not wait, however, and moved immediately to slash its Ukraine rating by a whole three notches to ""CCC"" from ""B"".
It explained, ""There is a high likelihood of an extended period of political instability, with regime change a likely objective of President Putin, creating heightened policy uncertainty and potentially also undermining the willingness of Ukraine to repay debt.""
Moody's had also warned a heavy conflict could leave Kyiv struggling to make debt payments.
Scope, a smaller European rating agency, has estimated Ukrainian government debt could jump above 90% of GDP by 2024 from about 50% now while S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) also warned on Friday of a spate of downgrades as a result of the war..
The International Monetary Fund is exploring all options to aid Ukraine with further financial support, said its head, Kristalina Georgieva.
Russia's central bank has beefed up its banking sector with billions in additional foreign exchange and rouble liquidity, while the government has separately pledged full-scale support to sanctions-hit companies. 

It is not the first time Russia is being cut to junk. Moody’s and S&P both took similar steps in early 2015 after the annexation of Crimea and plunging oil prices caused a rouble currency crisis.
There are ""serious concerns"" around Russia's ability to manage the disruptive impact of new sanctions on its economy, public finances and financial system, Moody's said on Friday.

KYIV (Reuters) -The Russian and Ukrainian governments on Friday signalled an openness to negotiations even as authorities in Kyiv urged citizens to help defend the capital from advancing Russian forces in the worst European security crisis in decades.
Ukraine and Russia will consult in coming hours on a time and place for talks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's spokesman Sergii Nykyforov said on social media, offering the first glimmer of hope for diplomacy since the invasion began.
The Kremlin said earlier it offered to meet in the Belarusian capital Minsk after Ukraine expressed a willingness to discuss declaring itself a neutral country, but that Ukraine had proposed Warsaw as the venue. That, according to Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov, resulted in a ""pause"" in contacts.
""Ukraine was and remains ready to talk about a ceasefire and peace,"" Nykyforov said in a post on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). ""We agreed to the proposal of the President of the Russian Federation.""
But U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Russia's offer was an attempt to conduct diplomacy ""at the barrel of a gun"", and that President Vladimir Putin's military must stop bombing Ukraine if it was serious about negotiations.
The diplomatic overtures stood in stark contrast to events unfolding on the ground and Putin's harsh rhetoric against Ukrainian leaders, including a call for a coup by the country's military.
Kyiv residents were told by the defence ministry to make petrol bombs to repel the invaders, and on Friday evening witnesses reported hearing artillery rounds and intense gunfire from the western part of the city. The sound of frequent artillery fire, apparently some distance from the city center, continued in the early hours of Saturday.
Zelenskiy filmed himself with aides on the streets of the capital, vowing to defend Ukraine's independence. 
""Tonight, they will launch an assault. All of us must understand what awaits us. We must withstand this night,"" he said in a video address posted to his Telegram channel. ""The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.""
Some families cowered in shelters after Kyiv was pounded on Thursday night by Russian missiles. Others tried desperately to get on packed trains headed west, some of the hundreds of thousands who have left their homes to find safety, according to the United Nations' aid chief. 
After weeks of warnings from Western leaders, Putin unleashed a three-pronged invasion of Ukraine from the north, east and south on Thursday, in an attack that threatened to upend Europe's post-Cold War order.
""I once again appeal to the military personnel of the armed forces of Ukraine: do not allow neo-Nazis and (Ukrainian radical nationalists) to use your children, wives and elders as human shields,"" Putin said at a televised meeting with Russia's Security Council on Friday. ""Take power into your own hands.""
Putin has cited the need to ""denazify"" Ukraine's leadership as one of his main reasons for invasion, accusing it of genocide against Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies dismiss the accusations as baseless propaganda.
The United States imposed sanctions on Putin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov. The European Union and Britain earlier froze any assets Putin and Lavrov held in their territory. Canada took similar steps.
However, the steady ramping-up of economic restrictions has not deterred Putin.
Moscow said on Friday it had captured the Hostomel airfield northwest of the capital - a potential staging post for an assault on Kyiv that has been fought over since Russian paratroopers landed there in the first hours of the war. This could not be confirmed and Ukrainian authorities reported heavy fighting there. 
Early on Saturday, Ukraine's air force command reported heavy fighting near the air base at Vasylkiv southwest of Kyiv, which it said was under attack from Russian paratroopers. It also said one of its fighters had shot down a Russian transport plane. Reuters could not independently verify the claims.
The mayor of Kyiv and its 3 million people, former world heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, said on Friday Russian saboteurs had already entered the city. ""The enemy wants to put the capital on its knees and destroy us,"" he said.
'GLORY TO OUR DEFENDERS'
In New York, Russia vetoed a draft U.N. Security Council resolution that would have deplored Moscow's invasion, while China abstained, a move Western countries viewed as proof of Russia's isolation. The United Arab Emirates and India also abstained while the remaining 11 members voted in favor.
Amid the chaos of war, a picture of what was happening on the ground across Ukraine - the second largest country in Europe after Russia itself - was slow to emerge.
Zelenskiy wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that there had been heavy fighting with deaths at the entrance to the eastern cities of Chernihiv and Melitopol, as well as at Hostomel.
""Glory to our defenders, both male and female, glory to Ukraine,"" he said, flanked by the prime minister and advisors in a video posted to confirm he was in the capital.
Witnesses said they had heard explosions and gunfire near the airport in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, close to Russia's border. Ukraine's military said Russian troops had been stopped with heavy losses near the northeastern city of Konotop.
Britain's defence ministry said Russian armoured forces had opened a new route of advance towards the capital after failing to take Chernihiv.
Ukraine said more than 1,000 Russian soldiers had been killed so far. Russia did not release casualty figures. 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart and condemned reported civilian deaths, including those of Ukrainian children, in attacks around Kyiv, the State Department said.
United Nations aid chief Martin Griffiths said hundreds of thousands of people were on the move in Ukraine.
The White House asked Congress for $6.4 billion in security and humanitarian aid for the crisis, officials said.
Ukraine has banned men of fighting age from leaving, and at borders with Poland, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia, those seen crossing by Reuters journalists were mostly women and children.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the coordinated decision to sanction Putin - something U.S. President Joe Biden had avoided until now - was intended to send a clear message of allied unity.
Russia's foreign ministry said the new sanctions reflected the West's ""absolute impotence,"" the RIA news agency reported.
Western countries have announced a barrage of sanctions on Russia, including blacklisting its banks and banning technology exports. But they have so far stopped short of forcing it out of the SWIFT system for international bank payments.
On Friday, European soccer's governing body moved May's Champions League final from St Petersburg to Paris, and Formula One cancelled this year's Russian Grand Prix. The European Broadcasting Union shut Russia out of the widely watched Eurovision Song Contest for 2022.
'BURN IN HELL'
U.S. officials believe Russia's initial aim is to ""decapitate"" Zelenskiy's government.
Putin says Ukraine, a democratic nation of 44 million people, is an illegitimate state carved out of Russia, a view Ukrainians see as aimed at erasing their more than thousand-year history.
He says he does not plan a military occupation, only to disarm Ukraine and remove its leaders, but it is not clear how a pro-Russian leader could be installed unless Russian troops control much of the country.
Ukrainians voted overwhelmingly for independence at the fall of the Soviet Union and Kyiv hopes to join NATO and the EU - aspirations that infuriate Moscow.
As air raid sirens wailed over Kyiv for a second day, some residents sheltered in underground metro stations.
Windows were blasted out of a 10-storey apartment block near the main airport. ""How can we be living through this in our time? Putin should burn in hell along with his whole family,"" said Oxana Gulenko, sweeping broken glass from her room.

Hundreds crowded into a cramped shelter beneath one building after a televised warning of air strikes.
""How can you wage a war against peaceful people?"" said Viktoria, 35, as her children aged 5 and 7 slept in their winter coats.

(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc is testing a new driver earnings algorithm in 24 U.S. cities that allows drivers to see pay and destinations before accepting a trip and raises the incentives for drivers to take short rides in an effort to attract more drivers. 
The changes, which are currently in pilot programs, mark the most wide-ranging updates to Uber's driver pay algorithm in years and come at a time when the company is still trying to win back drivers who left at the start of the pandemic. Fares paid by consumers are not affected.
Drivers have long demanded the ability to see the fare and destination before accepting a trip, but Uber has resisted, saying it could open the door to drivers cherry-picking trips or discriminating against riders in disadvantaged neighborhoods.
Uber already has a similar program in California, launched in the wake of a 2020 state battle over gig worker rights to prove its drivers are independent contractors. 
But the company said its latest fare pilot in the United States was not related to gig worker regulation. The test has been rolled out in cities across Texas, Florida and the Midwest where gig worker reforms are not on the agenda.
""Gig work is very competitive, not just with  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) but other platforms, and we think this feature really enhances our platform's competitiveness versus others,"" said Dennis Cinelli, Uber's head of mobility in the United States and Canada.
Cinelli said the pay changes at this point would not impact consumer prices, adding the changes ""aren't financial features.""
Uber declined to comment on the financial impact of the changes for the company, which could mean it has to incur higher costs for short trips.
Cinelli said the company had not seen any discrimination by drivers in California since the policy launched there in 2020.
""Otherwise, we wouldn't have rolled it out at this time,"" he said, adding that Uber had the ability to deactivate drivers who repeatedly declined trips based on race or low-income areas.
Providing drivers with upfront pay details meant the company also had to reduce earnings for longer trips to prevent drivers from avoiding short rides, Cinelli said.
Uber said data from some cities with upfront pay have shown a 22% average increase in driver earnings for trips in which the distance to the pickup location is longer than the trip itself.
Driver responses were mixed on some online groups. Some complained the new algorithm seemed arbitrary and no longer allowed them to calculate pay based on a per-mile (per-km) basis.
""My earnings are already destroyed by the high prices for gas and now Uber is taking even more money away from me on long trips,"" said Kevin Hernandez, a Houston driver.

Other drivers in online groups said the upfront fare information allowed them to select only higher-paying rides, with several drivers sharing screenshots of increased earnings since the altered algorithm was launched.
Expansion will depend on drivers. ""If we're not seeing it attract and retain drivers we wouldn't roll it out further,"" Cinelli said.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Oil companies led by Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) and the United Steelworkers (USW) agreed to a new national contract on Friday for 30,000 U.S. workers in refineries, chemical plants, and pipelines, the company and the union said.
Once the deal is ratified, workers will receive a 12% pay increase over its four-year term, said three sources familiar with the matter. 
""We’re pleased to have reached a mutually satisfactory four-year pattern labor agreement with the United Steelworkers,"" Marathon spokesman Jamal Kheiry said. 
USW International President Thomas Conway said in a statement the membership played a key role.
""The industry came to the table with demands that would have undermined generations of collective bargaining progress,"" Conway said. ""Thanks to the solidarity of the membership and the hard work of our (national oil bargaining policy) committee, we have achieved a fair agreement."" 
Both sides did not disclose terms of the agreement.
Negotiations between Marathon and the Steelworkers had been stalled until early this week when meetings resumed, the sources said. 
Talks stopped on Jan. 31 when USW negotiators rejected a 9% increase over three years and extended the current contract. basis. The current contract will remain in effect until the new contract is ratified. 
USW local unions will now combine the national agreement with agreements on site-specific issues at each refinery, chemical plant and pipeline and put the combined contracts to ratification votes. 
After talks stopped on Jan. 31, the USW carried out a series of protests outside refineries across the United States, which, the sources said, pushed other companies to pressure Marathon in restarting talks and increasing the pay offer as well as moving on other issues. 

One issue long sought by the USW is agreement to appoint union health and safety representatives at each facility which is included in the new contract.
The pay increases are not evenly split between the four years, the sources said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow on Friday registered its biggest daily percentage gain since November 2020 with the market rebounding for a second day from the sharp selloff leading up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Oil prices fell below $100 a barrel, easing some concerns about higher energy costs, and all 11 of the major S&P 500 sectors ended up on the day. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also posted gains for the week.
Russian missiles pounded Kyiv and families cowered in shelters on Friday, a day after Russia unleashed a three-pronged invasion of Ukraine in the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.
Investors also were assessing news that Russian President Vladimir Putin told his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in a call that Russia was willing to hold high-level talks with Ukraine, according to China's foreign ministry.
Some strategists say stock-selling may have been overdone. The S&P 500 confirmed earlier this week it was in a correction when it ended down more than 10% from its Jan. 3 record closing high.
""It sure feels a lot more like we've really exhausted sentiment in this correction,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, noting that economic fundamentals and corporate health remain favorable.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 834.92 points, or 2.51%, to 34,058.75, the S&P 500 gained 95.95 points, or 2.24%, to 4,384.65 and the Nasdaq Composite added 221.04 points, or 1.64%, to 13,694.62.
For the week, the Dow was down 0.1%, the S&P 500 was up 0.8% and the Nasdaq was up 1.1%. 
The West on Thursday unveiled new sanctions on Russia, while NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday the alliance was deploying parts of its combat-ready response force and would continue to send weapons to Ukraine.
""In general, the sanctions are going to have some bite,"" but investors seem to be relieved that Washington dismissed the idea of going to war with Russia, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco.
She said volatility should remain high in the coming days as events in Ukraine dictate market moves, but that focus eventually will turn back to the Federal Reserve and the outlook for interest rates. 
Some strategists noted that the sanctions announced Thursday targeted Russia's banks but left its energy sector largely untouched.
Health care gave the S&P 500 its biggest boost.
Shares of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) climbed 5% after a U.S. judge ruled that the drugmaker's subsidiary can remain in bankruptcy, preventing plaintiffs from pursuing 38,000 lawsuits against the company alleging its baby powder and other talc products cause cancer.
The Cboe Volatility index, Wall Street's fear gauge, ended down at 27.59.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.63-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 39 new highs and 66 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.47 billion shares, compared with the 12.1 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

688,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2022 07:21PM ET</span>",Workers at an Arizona Starbucks cafe win union drive,"By Hilary Russ and Danielle Kaye
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Workers at a  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) cafe in Mesa, Arizona, on Friday won their bid to join a labor union, marking the first company-owned U.S. location outside of New York state to do so. 
Employees voted 25-to-3 to join Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union, according to a livestreamed ballot count conducted by the National Labor Relations Board.
Only three out of the company's roughly 9,000 U.S. locations have voted to join the union so far, but a stream of other stores are waiting in line behind them to hold union elections.
In the last six months, employees at more than 100 stores in at least 26 states have petitioned the NLRB to hold union elections in their locations – including the company's flagship Reserve Roastery stores in New York and Seattle, Starbucks' hometown.
The union is also winning legal arguments. Friday's ballot count had been rescheduled after Starbucks challenged election procedures but lost.
""As we have said throughout, we will respect the process and will bargain in good faith guided by our principles,"" Starbucks said in a statement about Friday's results. ""We hope that the union does the same.""
Two stores in Buffalo, New York, joined the union and have begun negotiating contracts. Workers at a third location in the city voted down the union, and three other stores there had ballots impounded on Wednesday pending resolution of Starbucks' appeal.
The battle between Starbucks and Workers United is getting frothier. At some point, the union's effort to move store by store will ""have to congeal into a more coordinated strategy, or risk losing relevance,"" Jefferies Equity Research analysts wrote, citing an interview with former SEIU President Andy Stern.
First contracts can set precedent, so they are ""onerous and time-consuming"" to bargain, the note said of the pressure on Buffalo stores to reach a deal.
The union drive does not appear to pose major financial risk to the coffee chain in terms of big wage or benefit increases, the note added. 

But the landslide Workers United victory in Mesa might propel the Starbucks campaign and a broader organizing wave across the low-wage service sector, said John Logan, a labor professor at San Francisco State University.
""The amount of support that we received from Buffalo is absolutely amazing,"" said Mesa employee Michelle Hejduk at a press conference after the vote, referring to the collaboration among pro-union Starbucks workers nationwide.

(Reuters) -Some Western companies severed their ties with Russia on Friday, and others studied whether and how to do so, as President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine triggered sanctions and pressure to abandon some business dealings.
European sports and entertainment businesses were among the first to announce such moves. 
Premier League club Manchester United withdrew the sponsorship rights of Russian airline Aeroflot, Formula One canceled the 2022 Russian Grand Prix, and organizers of the Eurovision song contest said Russia would not be allowed to participate in this year's final. 
The ""inclusion of a Russian entry in this year's (Eurovision) contest would bring the competition into disrepute,"" the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said in a statement.
Gadget maker Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) Inc said it suspended sales in Ukraine and Russia and would closely monitor the situation to determine next steps. New U.S. rules on exports to Russia announced on Thursday covered computers, and Dell accounted for about 6% of computer shipments to Russia last quarter, according to researcher IDC.
U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) said, without providing a reason, that it had suspended its codesharing service with Aeroflot.
Alexandria, Virginia, marketing consultant Dan Sondhelm said companies were trying to balance the reputational risk of continuing to deal with Moscow with their economic interests and concerns about upsetting some of their investors.
""It will take some time for companies to make their decisions to act or do nothing,"" Sondhelm said. ""It doesn't happen overnight.""
The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on Russia that targeted five major Russian banks, including state-backed Sberbank and VTB, the country's two largest lenders, as well as wealthy individuals, and announced new export control measures. 
On Friday, European Union member states agreed to freeze European assets of Putin and his foreign minister, among other measures.
Some experts and attorneys said Western executives would seek to end commercial arrangements, even if they were not obliged to do so, to avoid public relations problems or the bureaucracy of trying to navigate sanctions in areas such as technology exports.
""What a lot of them will do is just drop any Russian customers. They will just say 'we’re not going to deal with that,'"" said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former U.S. Commerce Department export official.
David Smith, partner at insurance broker McGill and Partners in London, said that even before the invasion and sanctions, two underwriters had told him they did not want to insure a shipping company operating in Russian waters on the grounds they did not want to facilitate business with Russia.
""People should be thinking more and more about the moral issue, it’s not just a box-ticking exercise,” Smith said.
Western consumer brands operating in the region could face backlash. For instance, several posters on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) responded with outrage after a verified account for McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) posted that it closed restaurants in Ukraine, but did not address its Russia locations. 
""The Russian occupiers, the military, and their children will continue to enjoy a variety of burgers. And my child is sitting in a bomb shelter with tears in his eyes,"" one of the posters, identifying himself as Vitaliy Skalsky, told Reuters in Ukrainian in a Facebook message.
McDonald's representatives in the United States and Ukraine did not respond to requests for comment.
'FALLEN FOUL' OF CORPORATE STANDARDS 
Western banks and financial firms have been studying the practical implications of new sanctions, said several sources in the heavily regulated industries.
The rules prohibit direct dealings with sanctioned entities and ""correspondent"" banking relationships that enable Russian banks to make international payments via U.S. banks. But they are less clear on areas such as buying and selling Russian sovereign debt in secondary markets, said a senior source at a large European bank with U.S. operations.
Many details on how the sanctions will work need to be confirmed by the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and other international regulators, this source said. OFAC did not respond immediately to requests for comment.
The chief investment officer of one European asset manager said on condition of anonymity it was considering whether to sell sovereign and corporate debt it holds in Russia, much as it might sell the bonds of a company that failed to take action on an issue like climate change.

""Russian actions have fallen foul of the standard you would have at the corporate level,"" the executive said.
But client interests might argue for a different approach, this person said. ""At the other side of the transaction is our client, who might be losing if you're selling it in a fire sale,"" the executive said.

The airline said the problem, which was affecting its website, app, and airport operations, had not been caused by a cyber attack.
""We are experiencing significant technical issues this evening which are affecting the running of our operation and regrettably has led to the cancellation of a number of flights,"" it said in a statement.
It was working to get as many flights away as possible, it said, and customers on flights that had not been cancelled could still check in at the airport.
The airline, owned by IAG (LON:ICAG), was hit by a major computer system failure in 2017 that stranded 75,000 passengers over a holiday weekend, sparking a public relations disaster and pledges from the carrier that it would do better in future.
Users on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) posted messages on Friday asking BA when the problem would be fixed, with one customer showing a video of lengthy queues at check-in for what he said was a Miami to London flight, while another user posted pictures of blank screens.
BA and Virgin Atlantic began routing flights around Russian airspace on Friday after London and Moscow banned each other's airlines in tit-for-tat retaliation over the Ukraine invasion.

Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a part of the GCHQ eavesdropping intelligence agency, had warned companies and organisations to bolster their online defences against cyber attacks after Russia invaded Ukraine.
The airline said it would make decisions about its schedule on Saturday as soon as it could.

691,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2022 06:26PM ET</span>","European, U.S. bank shares recoup some losses ahead of new EU sanctions","By Tom Sims and Carolyn Cohn
FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) -European and U.S. bank shares on Friday clawed back some of the previous day's steep losses as the sector started to get to grips with a slew of sanctions unveiled this week in retaliation for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
Shares got off to a jittery start as missiles pounded the Ukrainian capital and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy pleaded with the international community to do more, saying sanctions announced so far were not enough.
Investors have been on high alert for sanctions against Russia over fears of rippling complexity and compliance risks for global banks. But many U.S. and European industry executives say they had already reduced their exposure to Russia.
After early losses, leading European banks later edged up, with a European banking sector index 4.27% higher by mid-afternoon, having fallen 8% on Thursday. 
Shares of major U.S. banks also closed up, with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) adding between 2% and 3.26%. 
The S&P 500 banks index rose 3.36% while the KBW Bank index rose 4%.
After the market close late on Friday, the European Union said in a statement it had adopted further sanctions that will have ""massive and severe consequences"" for Russia. 
The EU imposed a ban on issuing bonds, shares or loans in the bloc for refinancing Russia's Alfa Bank and Bank Otkritie.
Three Russian banks were already subject to asset freezes from earlier in the week. The top three Russian banks - Sberbank, VTB and Gazprombank - were not included in the measure.
The bloc also set a cap of 100,000 euros for EU bank accounts of Russian citizens, who will not be allowed to buy euro-denominated shares, while Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov were put on the EU sanctions list.
""This package includes financial sanctions, targeting 70% of the Russian banking market and key state-owned companies, including in defence,"" EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Swiss financial watchdog FINMA told banks on Friday to freeze assets of people and entities on the EU's sanctions list.
Behind the scenes, bankers said they and their lawyers were scrambling to determine the impact of sanctions.
Washington on Friday also imposed sanctions on Putin and Lavrov, following on from a tranche of sanctions against Russian banks and individuals on Thursday.
""What banks are focused on right now is updating their screening mechanisms within their compliance programs to make sure they are capturing all the entities that have been designated by the Treasury Department,"" said Caroline Brown, a partner at Crowell & Moring in Washington.
Germany's financial regulator, BaFin, said that it was in close contact with the banks it oversees regarding risks from the crisis and it expected full compliance with sanctions.
In a sign that sanctions were beginning to bite, the London Stock Exchange suspended the membership of VTB's subsidiary VTB Capital.
Elsewhere, compliance officials at insurance brokers are instructing staff to cease using Russian insurers and find alternatives, said Ben Sheppard, senior research analyst at insurance investment adviser Argenta Private Capital.
DISAGREEMENT OVER SWIFT
In a report on Friday, JP Morgan analysts said sanctions would have a limited impact on banks directly and the bigger problem was the impact on the economy.
""The key risk for European banks relates to potential GDP downgrades due to higher commodity related prices and hence potential delays in interest rate hike expectations,"" the report said.
The prospect of higher interest rates had brightened the earnings outlook for banks after years of ultra-low and negative rates ate away at their profit margins.
On the ground in Ukraine, banks have been carrying out emergency measures. Germany's Solarisbank said that it had evacuated its tech hub in Kyiv, which it opened last year with dozens of employees.
""It is sad to think that just one week ago, I was in Kyiv, working and developing business. Now we have to rebuild our plans and to adapt,"" the bank's Ukraine chief, Dumitru Condrea, posted on LinkedIn.
On Thursday, banks with the biggest exposure to Russia fell the most. 
That included Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International, which lost 23%, regaining 4.6% on Friday. Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), which lost 12% on Thursday, was up 4.2% on Friday.
Some investors had already cut exposure to Russia.
""We had our own screening view of what businesses would most likely be impacted through strong sanctions and that had been an area where we've been seeking to reduce our exposure,"" said Andrew Formica, the chief executive of Jupiter Fund Management.
For European banks, the greatest concern has been that governments would cut Russia out of the SWIFT international payment network, but so far that hasn't happened.

Bankers have argued cutting Russia off from the international payments network could seriously hurt its economy and everyday citizens, and would create enormous complexity and compliance risks for the global banking industry.
While Britain is pushing to cut Russia out of SWIFT, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Friday that option would only be used as a last resort but is being assessed for its impact.

693,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2022 05:55PM ET</span>","Automakers idle production following Russia's invasion, other firms also scramble","By Ben Klayman
(Reuters) - Several companies, including automakers Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) and tire maker Nokian Tyres, on Friday outlined plans to shut or shift manufacturing operations following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
After invading earlier this week, Russian forces pressed their advance on Friday as missiles pounded Kyiv and authorities said they were girding for an assault aimed at overthrowing the government.
The United States announced sweeping export restrictions against Russia on Thursday, hammering its access to global exports of goods ranging from commercial electronics and computers to semiconductors and aircraft parts. That could lead companies to alter manufacturing plans or seek alternative supply lines.
The invasion was a factor in consulting firms J.D. Power and LMC Automotive slashing their 2022 global new-car sales outlook by 400,000 vehicles to 85.8 million units. The auto industry had already been dealing with a tight supply of vehicles due to the global semiconductor shortage.
""An already-tight supply of vehicles and high prices across the globe will be under added pressure based on the severity and duration of the conflict in Ukraine,"" said Jeff Schuster, president of global vehicle forecasts at LMC. 
""Rising oil and aluminum prices will likely affect consumers’ willingness and ability to purchase vehicles, even if inventory improves,"" he added. ""We have made significant downgrades to the Ukraine and Russia forecasts due to the escalating conflict between the two and the repercussions associated with sanctions against Russia.""
The conflict could boost oil prices above $100 a barrel, which would add inflationary pressure on European and American consumers,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Colin Langan said in a research note. While consumers have been willing to pay above sticker price to get new vehicles, sustained higher gas prices could impact long-term recovery, he said. 
Germany's Volkswagen said it would halt production for a few days at two German factories after a delay in getting parts made in Ukraine.
France's Renault said it would suspend some operations at its car assembly plants in Russia next week due to logistics bottlenecks caused by parts shortages. It did not specify whether its supply chain had been hit by the conflict, but a spokeswoman said the action was a consequence of reinforced borders between Russia and neighboring countries through which parts are carried by truck.
The carmaker is among Western companies most exposed to Russia, where it makes 8% of its core earnings according to Citibank.
""Interruptions are primarily caused by tighter border controls in transit countries and the forced need to change a number of established logistics routes,"" the company's Russian unit said, without naming any countries. 
Russian carmaker Avtovaz, controlled by Renault, also said it might suspend some assembly lines at a plant in central Russia for one day, on Monday, due to a persistent global shortage of electronic components. Avtovaz also did not mention the invasion in its statement.
Finnish tire maker Nokian said it was shifting production of some key product lines from Russia to Finland and the United States to prepare for possible further sanctions following the invasion.
MANAGING DISRUPTION
Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) Chief Executive Kevin Clark said on Thursday that over the last couple of months the American auto parts maker had swapped high-volume parts work out of Ukraine in favor of lower-volume products ""so we were better-positioned to manage disruption.""
Japanese auto supplier Sumitomo Electric Industries, which employs some 6,000 people in Ukraine to make wire harnesses, said it suspended operations at its factories there and was talking to clients about potentially substituting supplies from other places.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co has a 50% joint venture in Ford Sollers, which has three assembly plants in Russia according to the Ford website. Ford said in a statement it was ""deeply concerned"" about the situation and would ""manage any effects"" on its business in real time. 
The U.S. automaker also said it would follow any laws on trade sanctions, but declined to discuss whether the Sollers plants have been affected. 
While French car parts maker  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) said the direct impact on the company is minimal, the invasion could drag down industry production volumes, and hike energy or raw material prices. 
For automakers, one of the supply-chain concerns created by the Ukraine conflict centers on the metals palladium, platinum and rhodium used in exhaust-scrubbing catalytic converters.
Russia produces about 38% of the world’s palladium, excluding recycled material, said Mark Wakefield, co-leader of consulting firm AlixPartners global automotive practice.
“It’s hard to think of a global auto business that doesn’t have palladium coming from Russia,” he said.
Automakers should not face an immediate shortage of palladium, Wakefield said, because there are stocks of the metal in London. There is “a six-month journey before palladium finds its way into a car,” he said.
Aluminum prices had been rising before the Ukraine conflict, Wakefield said. A cutoff of Russian aluminum supplies would add to the cost pressures on automakers.
Japan's biggest steelmaker, Nippon Steel Corp, said on Friday it would secure alternatives for a raw material it buys from Russia and Ukraine in the event of any supply disruptions.
Nippon Steel buys 14% of its iron ore pellets, small balls of iron ore powder used in steel production, from those countries. Officials said it switched sourcing to Brazil and Australia and the impact should be minimal. 
Agricultural equipment maker Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co said on Friday it had closed its Ukraine office in recent weeks as a precautionary measure. It employs about 40 people in Ukraine.
Meanwhile, Russia said it was partially limiting access to Meta Platforms Inc's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), accusing it of ""censoring"" Russian media.
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), which does not operate services to Ukraine or Russia, said on Friday it had suspended its codesharing service with Russian airline Aeroflot.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc’s home security subsidiary, Ring, said it was coordinating closely with its partners at Squad in Ukraine “to support the safety and well-being of the team and their families.” According to LinkedIn data, Squad employs more than 700 people, some of whom worked for the research arm Ring Ukraine until about a year ago. 

Amazon had no additional comment about its footprint in Ukraine or Russia, or on how U.S. trade actions would impact its business, if at all. 
Toronto-based  Kinross Gold  (NYSE:KGC) Corp said its underground Kupol gold mine in Russia's far northeast corner is operating normally. Nearly all of the company’s employees in the country are Russian, and Kupol has stored a full year's worth of supplies on site, given that it operates in a cold region, the company said. Kinross added it was reviewing the latest sanctions against Russia to see how they could affect operations.

(Reuters) -Zendesk Inc said on Friday that its investors rejected a proposed takeover of SurveyMonkey parent Momentive Global and that it terminated the merger agreement.
""While we were excited by the potential of this transaction to transform the customer experience and create stockholder value, we respect and appreciate the perspectives of our stockholders,"" Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) founder and Chief Executive Officer Mikkel Svane said in a statement.
The deal, valued at roughly $4 billion, had been roundly criticized by prominent investors including state pension funds and large mutual funds, which questioned its rationale and said it would likely be too risky.
Shareholders of both companies had to vote for the deal in order for the merger to be completed. But with Zendesk investors lining up against it, it was widely expected that the deal would be voted down, leading to an end of the proposed takeover.
The official vote occurred several hours ago and the company said in a regulatory filing late in day that holders of 101,509,554 shares, or 83.5% of the common stock issued, were present at the vote. A total of 91,677,121 votes were cast against the deal while 9,334,851 votes were cast in favor, while 497,581 abstained. 
In spite of the loss, Svane sounded an optimistic note, saying that Zendesk's ""business has never been stronger"" and that the company is on a ""clear path to (generate) $3.4 billion in revenue by 2025.""
In October, Zendesk agreed to buy Momentive in an all-stockdeal. Activist investment firm Jana Partners urged the company to abandon the acquisition and investors including Janus Henderson, Neuberger Berman and Florida's pension system, Florida State Board of Administration, spoke out against it.

""We believe a rejection of the proposed Momentive acquisition would be a huge win for Zendesk shareholders, a repudiation of Zendesk’s board, and a strong indication that Zendesk either requires significant board change or should be sold,"" a representative for Jana Partners said earlier on Friday before the vote was completed but as early indications suggested Zendesk investors would reject it.
Last week Reuters reported that Jana Partners launched a proxy fight at Zendesk and nominated four director candidates, arguing the company needs to be rehabilitated after the unpopular attempt to buy Momentive.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index on Friday notched its biggest gain in nearly four weeks as investors looked past Russia-Ukraine uncertainty amid optimism that an energy crisis could be averted. 
The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index ended up 344.07 points, or 1.66%, at 21,106.00, its biggest gain since Jan. 31. For the week, the index rose 0.47%. 
U.S. stocks also ended higher, posting a second day of sharp gains, as investors welcomed coordinated Western sanctions on Russia that targeted its banks but left its energy sector largely untouched.
Investors worry that an energy crisis could derail global economic recovery.
""We are seeing a relief rally as oil prices have returned to where they were before this week, before the conflict escalated,"" said Angelo Kourkafas, investment strategist at Edward Jones.
""Historically, the stock market has had a long history of being able to look through these geopolitical uncertainties.""
U.S. crude oil futures settled 1.3% lower at $91.59 a barrel, after notching a seven-year high during Thursday's session at $100.54.
The Toronto market's energy sector climbed 2.3% despite the pullback in oil, while heavily-weighted financials also ended 2.3% higher.
It included a 5.6% gain for Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) and a 1.9% advance for National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF) after both lenders comfortably beat analysts' estimates for quarterly earnings.
The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 1.8%.

""We continue to have a lot of uncertainty both on the geopolitical side and when it comes to inflation,"" Kourkafas said. ""The market recovery might not be as swift as the last two days imply.""
To fight inflation, the Bank of Canada is expected to hike interest rates next week for the first time since October 2018.

The deadline, which expired on Friday, has been considered unrealistic by the mining industry ever since it was first set in early 2019, a month after the collapse of a tailings dam in Brumadinho that killed 270 people.
According to the draft agreement, struck with the Minas Gerais state prosecutors, the company will also meet a series of obligations to remove all of its upstream tailing dams. 
The figure Vale has to pay will be used to fund projects aimed at environmental preservation and the improvement of the government's actions related to the safety of tailing dams, the document showed.
The miner confirmed the signing of the agreement and reiterated its commitment to remove the dams ""in the shortest time possible, having as an absolute priority the safety of people and care for the environment"".
It also said that the agreement brings ""more legal and technical security to the process of decharacterization of the company's 23 upstream dams in Minas Gerais."" 
Brazilian prosecutor Carlos Eduardo Ferreira Pinto told Reuters that the agreement does not extend the deadline or grant amnesty, but is a technical and legal adjustment.

Vale said it removed seven structures since 2019 and expects to end 2022 with 40% of its upstream dams eliminated. This means that 12 out of its 30 mapped dams will have been eliminated by the end of this year.

701,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2022 05:11PM ET</span>",Judge greenlights J&J strategy to resolve talc lawsuits in bankruptcy court,"By Dietrich Knauth and Tom Hals
(Reuters) -Johnson & Johnson can use the bankruptcy system to resolve multibillion-dollar litigation claiming its talc products cause cancer, a U.S. judge ruled on Friday, signing off on a legal maneuver that enables the company to avoid fighting more than 38,000 individual lawsuits.
J&J (NYSE:JNJ) used a strategy known as the ""Texas two-step,"" which allows companies to split valuable assets from liabilities through a so-called divisive merger. In October, J&J, which maintains its talc products are safe, put the claims into a newly created entity called LTL Management LLC, which filed for bankruptcy days later.
Plaintiffs argued the move was an abuse of the Chapter 11 system.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan forcefully rejected that argument on Friday, saying J&J’s approach was ""unquestionably"" proper and that bankruptcy offers a faster and more fair alternative to decades of litigation in other courts. 
Jon Ruckdeschel, an attorney for plaintiffs pursuing the talc lawsuits, said the ruling would be appealed.
""The bankruptcy code was never intended to be abused in this way by massively profitable corporations as a means to delay or prevent cancer victims from having their day in court,” he said in a statement.
J&J's stock closed up 5%, its biggest one-day gain since the start of the pandemic in spring 2020. The company, which has a stock market value of more than $400 billion, also said on Friday it planned to move ahead with a $5 billion settlement to resolve claims by states and local governments that J&J contributed to the U.S. opioid epidemic..
Talc plaintiffs and some critics had warned that the strategy could ""open the floodgates"" for other companies facing mass litigation risk.
Kaplan said ""maybe the gates indeed should be opened.""
""There is nothing to fear in the migration of tort litigation out of the tort system and into the bankruptcy system,"" Kaplan wrote.
After Kaplan's ""extremely strong"" defense of J&J's bankruptcy strategy, other companies would be ""negligent"" if they did not consider a similar approach, said Jared Ellias, a professor at UC Hastings College of the Law.
""This couldn't have been a better opinion for people who think that the Texas two-step bankruptcy strategy is a good way for companies to deal with mass tort problems,"" Ellias said.
The plaintiffs had alleged that J&J's talc-based products contained asbestos and caused ovarian cancer and mesothelioma, a type of cancer linked to asbestos exposure. 
J&J denies the allegations, saying decades of scientific testing and regulatory approvals have shown its talc to be safe and asbestos-free.
Before the bankruptcy filing, the company faced costs from $3.5 billion in verdicts and settlements, including one in which 22 women were awarded a judgment of more than $2 billion, according to bankruptcy-court records.
J&J, in a statement, called the ruling a positive development, adding that an independent investigation would establish that the formation of LTL and the Chapter 11 filing were appropriate.
""LTL stands ready to work with claimants’ counsel and the mediator to reach an equitable and efficient resolution as ordered by the Bankruptcy Court,"" J&J said in a statement.
J&J has set aside $2 billion to settle talc claims, but LTL executives characterized that number as a starting point rather than a ""cap"" during court proceedings last week.
Kaplan said he believed there was a need for ""independent scrutiny"" of the company's restructuring and said he would consider appointing an examiner at a March 8 hearing.
Reuters exclusively reported earlier this month that J&J secretly launched ""Project Plato"" last year to shift liability from its pending talc lawsuits to the newly created subsidiary, which was then to be put into bankruptcy.

The strategy angered lawyers for cancer plaintiffs, who in court called it ""rotten to the core.""
It also alarmed lawmakers including U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, who said it provided a blueprint for other well-heeled corporations to deprive victims of the compensation and ""hide assets in plain view.""

Ford's F-150 plant in Dearborn, Michigan will continue to function, the automaker said. 
F-150 is Ford's top selling vehicle and, along with other large utility vehicles and vans, generates the bulk of the company's global profit.
Earlier this month, Ford said it would continue to idle some of its assembly plants in the week of Feb. 14 due to semiconductor bottlenecks.

A shortage of semiconductors that are used for everything from computer management of engines to driver-assistance features has hit several automakers across the globe forcing some to produce vehicles without certain features.
Shares in Ford, which more than doubled in market value last year, closed 4% higher on Friday, with the market rebounding for a second day from the sharp selloff leading up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. retail investors bought stocks during Thursday’s selloff, even as many of their favorite names have been battered by worries over geopolitical strife and a hawkish Federal Reserve that looks set to keep volatility elevated. 
Individual traders bought a net $1.5 billion on Thursday, as the S&P 500 extended its declines to an intraday year-to-date loss of nearly 14% on worries over Russia's invasion of Ukraine before surging higher later in the day, according to data from Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research. 
“We believe that retail investors played a key role in driving the sharp rebound in equities yesterday,” Giacomo Pierantoni, head of data at Vanda Research, said in a note. The benchmark index rose 2.24% on Friday, cutting its year-to-date losses to 8%.
Earlier data showed that buying by retail investors ebbed in the latest week, with flows falling by 50% to $1.8 billion in the week to Wednesday, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). 
The year-to-date decline in the S&P 500 and the 12.5% drop in the Nasdaq have masked far larger declines in many of the stocks and ETFs that retail traders have favored in recent months.
Analysts said the crisis in Ukraine would likely keep volatility elevated as investors digest the implications of the biggest attack against a state in Europe since World War Two. 
""It's one more volatility-inducing event on top of a backdrop that already offers plenty of opportunities for volatility,"" said Steve Sosnick chief strategist at Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR). 
As of Thursday, the most popular stocks among Interactive Brokers' customers, on a five-day moving average, include many of the names that have taken a beating in the market this year.
The most active names with net buys included Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, down 23.4% year-to-date; Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc, down 15.9% year-to-date; Meta Platforms Inc, down 37.4% year-to-date; and  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc, down 38.8% year-to-date, among others.
With many retail investors' favorites in the red in 2022, the average punter's portfolio is close to dipping into the negative as well, analysts at Vanda said in a separate note.
As Russia's aggression toward Ukraine has intensified, retail investors have also been focused on potential winners and losers from the crisis. 

Areas of interest among retail traders have been the United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO) LP ETF, which last week had the second- highest weekly net buying flow by retail investors since April-May 2020 period, along with energy stocks, VIX ETFs and gold ETFs, they said. 
The top pick among retail investors in the past week, as tracked by JPMorgan, was ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ETF, which bets against the Nasdaq 100 index and has risen 38.6% year-to-date.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 rallied Friday, clawing its way out from correction territory as investors weighed signs that Russia could be open to returning to the diplomatic table even as the Kremlin's forces are closing in on Ukrainian capital Kyiv.   
The S&P 500 rose 2.2% falling out of the 10% correction territory, with losses since its recent peak falling to 9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 2.2%, or 834 points, the Nasdaq gained 1.6%.
As the Russian invasion of Ukraine entered its second day, reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin is open to sending a delegation to Belarusian capital Minsk to negotiate with Ukraine underpinned bullish bets on risk assets. There is still uncertainty, however, as to how serious Putin is about a diplomatic resolution as Russia forces are reported to be closing on Kyiv. 
The U.S. and Europe continued to step up their sanctions on Russia. The U.S. and EU announced sanctions on Russia President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
Still, the sanctions are viewed by some as not going far enough to force Putin to rethink his plan, which he said seeks to bring about the ""denazification"" and ""demilitarization"" of Ukraine. 
U.S. President Joe Biden outlined fresh sanctions on Thursday aimed at further crippling Russia’s economy and curbing its access to key technology used to advance its military and industrial capabilities. 
There had been some pressure on the president to roll out even tougher measures including cutting Russia off from the global payments system, and implementing measures to hamper Russia's oil and gas industry, which accounts for the bulk of the latter’s growth.
The weaker-than-expected sanctions have played a role in resuming bullish bets on stocks, though the jury is still out on whether the market has bottomed. 
“It’s hard to declare with too much certainty that the market has hit a bottom, but I do think the weaker sanctions supported the market reversal yesterday,” Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer at Penn Mutual Asset Management, said in interview on Friday.
Materials led the broader market move higher as investors bet on commodity prices continuing to trend higher because the Russia and Ukraine conflict could disrupt key global commodity supplies including energy, metals, and wheat from the region.
 Nucor  (NYSE:NUE), Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold (NYSE:FCX), Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) were among the biggest gainers in the sector.
Financials were boosted by rising bank stocks, pushed higher by Treasury yields as signs of ongoing red-hot inflation keeps the Federal Reserve on course to begin hiking rates in March.
 Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY), Truist Financial (NYSE:TFC), Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION) were up more than 6%.
“What's happening in Ukraine does give the Fed a little more cover to be patient on monetary policy tightening, but a 25 basis point hike in March and a 25 basis point hike in June, are the base case scenarios,” Heppenstall said. “I see the Fed funds rate at 1% to 1.25% by year end… I would say four to five rate hikes sounds reasonable to me."" 
Sentiment on the broader market was also underpinned by mostly upbeat quarterly results.
Block (NYSE:SQ) reported fourth-quarter results that beat on the top and bottom lines, and delivered better-than-expected guidance, sending its shares more 26% higher.
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) fell more than 9% after reporting a wider-than-expected loss as revenue came in below Wall Street estimates as management  ""ramped up investment spending in an environment of slowing growth at retail, leading to significant losses,” Oppenheimer said in a note. 
“We expect a meaningful reset of Street numbers and view a path to profitability [for Beyond Meat] even more challenging going forward.""
Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), meanwhile, reporting better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, sending its shares more than 16% higher."

Investing.com -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) said Thursday evening that its board of directors approved a new $8 billion share repurchase program.
AMD shares rose 3.84% Friday on the back of the news. They closed the week out at just above the $121 mark.
The new authorization is in addition to the $4 billion share repurchase program announced in May 2021. Under the previously announced program, AMD company has repurchased approximately $3 billion of shares of common stock.
The company said the new program — which has no termination date — is designed to return value to shareholders by offsetting dilution from stock issuances and reducing share count over time. 
AMD will fund repurchases through cash generated from operations. 
“We are pleased to expand our share repurchase program based on the strength of our balance sheet and expectations for future free cash flow generation,” said AMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su.

""For the first phase of our shareholder return framework initiated, we have the options in future years to invest in cash flow growth,"" Hollub said during a call with analysts to discuss fourth quarter financial results.

Getting to ""a level at some point that is in that $15 billion or less net debt is an ultimate goal for the company"", Peterson added. A total debt below $20 billion would enable a potential upgrade to investment grade by credit rating agencies, he said. 
During the call, Hollub criticized Russia President Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine this week, in the strongest message by an oil producer so far. 
""I'd like to say that we stand in firm condemnation of the insane and inhumane actions taken by Putin and Russia to invade Ukraine,"" she said. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to all the people of Ukraine.""

711,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2022 03:11PM ET</span>","Drug distributors, J&J agree to finalize $26 billion opioid settlement","By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - The three largest U.S. drug distributors and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) have agreed to finalize a proposed $26 billion settlement resolving claims by states and local governments that they helped fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic.
Distributors McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) along with J&J had until Friday to decide whether enough cities and counties nationally had opted to join the landmark settlement to justify moving forward with it.
The deal aims to resolve around 3,000 lawsuits by state and local governments seeking to hold the companies responsible for an opioid abuse crisis that has led to hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths in the United States over the last two decades..
The distributors and J&J in separate statements on Friday confirmed they had determined there was ""sufficient"" participation to move forward with the settlement, which was first announced in July. They are not admitting wrongdoing.
The announcement paves the way for the companies to begin making payments to the governments in April, money that officials say will be used to fund treatment and other programs aimed at addressing the health crisis.
""Because of the money, there will be people alive next year who otherwise would have died,"" North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, a lead settlement negotiator, said in an interview.
The lawsuits accuse the distributors of lax controls that allowed massive amounts of addictive painkillers to be diverted into illegal channels, and that drugmakers, including J&J, downplayed the risk of addiction when marketing the pain medicines.
The proposed settlement calls for the distributors to pay up to $21 billion over 18 years and for J&J to pay up to $5 billion over nine years. About $2.3 billion is set aside to cover fees and expenses of plaintiffs' lawyers and state attorneys general.
""Billions of dollars are now going to flow to treatment, recovery, education and abating this public health crisis,"" said Paul Geller, a lawyer for local governments at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd.
Most states are settling. All four companies continue to face claims in Alabama, Oklahoma, Washington and West Virginia, while New Hampshire did not settle with J&J. The companies recently also agreed to settle with Native American tribes.
Peter Mougey, a plaintiffs' lawyer at the law firm Levin Papantonio involved in the negotiations, said over 7,000 local governments opted into the settlement. ""Almost 40 states are 99% or higher,"" he said of participation within the states.
It is likely the biggest, though not the last, settlement to result from opioid litigation. 

This month, the Sackler family owners of OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma in its bankruptcy proposed a revised settlement worth up to $6 billion that would resolve claims the company fueled the epidemic. Drugmaker  Mallinckrodt  (OTC:MNKKQ) this month won bankruptcy court approval for a $1.7 billion settlement.
Other drugmakers like Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd as well as major pharmacy chains remain in litigation. Talks with those companies are ongoing, Stein said.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 continued to rally Friday, clawing its way out from correction territory, led by a jump in cyclical stocks including materials, financial and energy.
The S&P 500 rose 1.9% with losses since its recent peak falling to 9.8% just shy of the 10% correction territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 2.2%, or 735 points, the Nasdaq gained 1.1%.
Materials led the move higher on Friday as investors bet on commodity prices continuing to trend higher because the Russia and Ukraine conflict could disrupt key commodities including energy, metals, and wheat from the region.
 Nucor  (NYSE:NUE), Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold (NYSE:FCX), Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) were among the biggest gainers in the sector.
“It’s hard to declare with too much certainty that the market has hit a bottom, but I do think the weaker sanctions supported the market reversal yesterday,” Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer at Penn Mutual Asset Management, said in interview on Friday.
U.S. President Joe Biden outlined fresh sanctions on Thursday aimed at further crippling Russia’s economy and curbing its access to key technology used to advance its military and industrial capabilities. Biden is also reportedly planning to impose sanctions on Russia President Vladimir Putin, Bloomberg reported.
There had been some pressure on the president to roll out even tougher measures including cutting Russia off from the global payments system, and implementing measures to hamper Russia oil and gas industry, which accounts for bulk of the latter’s growth.
“The as yet absence of sanctions on Russian commodities could see energy markets give up gains triggered by the initial invasion,” ANZ Research in a note Thursday.
Energy stocks were up more than 2%, shrugging off weakness in oil prices.
Financials were boosted by rising bank stocks, pushed higher by Treasury yields as signs of ongoing red-hot inflation keeps the Federal Reserve on course to begin hiking rates in March.
 Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY), Truist Financial (NYSE:TFC), Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION) were up more than 5%.
“What's happening in Ukraine does give the Fed a little more cover to be patient on monetary policy tightening, but a 25 basis point hike in March and a 25 basis point hike in June, are the base case scenarios,” Heppenstall said. “I see the Fed funds rate at 1% to 1.25% by year end… I would say four to five rate hikes sounds reasonable to me.""
Sentiment on the broader market was also underpinned by mostly upbeat quarterly results.
Block (NYSE:SQ) reported fourth-quarter results that beat on the top and bottom lines, and delivered better-than-expected guidance, sending its shares more 25% higher.
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) fell more than 9% after reporting a wider-than-expected loss as revenue came in below Wall Street estimates as management  ""ramped up investment spending in an environment of slowing growth at retail, leading to significant losses,” Oppenheimer said in a note. 
“We expect a meaningful reset of Street numbers and view a path to profitability [for Beyond Meat] even more challenging going forward.""

714,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2022 02:37PM ET</span>",Airlines tackle Russia risks as Ukraine fallout widens,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh, Jamie Freed and Allison Lampert
(Reuters) -The fallout to the global aviation industry from Russia's invasion of Ukraine spread on Friday as two more European countries banned Russian carriers and the European Union said it would restrict exports of aircraft parts.
Virgin Atlantic and British Airways began routing flights around Russian airspace after London and Moscow banned each other's airlines in tit-for-tat retaliation over the Ukraine invasion.
Poland and Czech Republic also said they were banning Russian airlines from their airspace. Some industry leaders said they were prepared for further bans despite the prospect of a costly sanctions war over mutual overflight rights.
The governing council of the United Nations' aviation agency, the International Civil Aviation Organization, was due to discuss the conflict at a meeting on Friday.
Russia's invasion has ""significant potential to derail the fragile airline recovery in Europe,"" Rob Morris, chief consultant at UK-based Ascend by Cirium said.
While many airlines are still using Russia's east-west transit corridors, some have begun asking about capacity in Anchorage, harking back to Alaska's Cold War use as a refuelling hub for jets barred from Soviet airspace.
Western airlines, lessors and manufacturers were assessing the growing risks of doing business with Russia as sanctions targeted Russian companies, banks and individuals.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) said it was suspending a codesharing service with Russia's Aeroflot.
""It will be more difficult for investors to accept portfolios of aircraft assets containing Russian airlines. Nobody wants to take Russian risk today,"" aviation adviser Bertrand Grabowski said, adding that fears included a lack of insurance coverage.
Russian forces were closing on Ukraine's capital on Friday in the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.
Airspace in Ukraine, Moldova, parts of Belarus and in southern Russia near the Ukraine border has been closed, giving airlines a narrower range of routing options.
Japan Airlines on Thursday cancelled a flight to Moscow, citing potential safety risks and Britain closed its airspace to Russian airlines, including Aeroflot, as part of a raft of punitive measures. 
In response, Moscow barred British airlines from landing at its airports or crossing its airspace, citing ""unfriendly decisions"" by London.
Virgin Atlantic said skirting Russia would add 15 minutes to an hour to its flights between Britain and India and Pakistan.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc said it had re-routed its Delhi-New York flight. Rival United Airlines, however, was still using Russia's airspace for Delhi-Chicago and Delhi-Newark flights, according to flightradar24.
SANCTIONS RISKS
Gulf carrier Emirates said it had made minor routing changes, leading to slightly longer flight times.  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) said it was implementing contingency plans.
OPSGROUP, an aviation industry cooperative that shares information on flight risks, said any aircraft travelling through Russian airspace should have such contingency plans in place for closed airspace due to risks, or sanctions.
Revenue from Russian overflights goes to state carrier Aeroflot.
""Russia are unlikely to initiate their own sanctions and airspace bans as they would not wish to see Aeroflot receive reciprocal bans,"" OPSGROUP said. ""However, they may react in response to sanctions from other states.""
Airlines were also reeling from a rise in oil prices to more than $105 a barrel for the first time since 2014. 
That raises operating costs at a time when travel demand remains low because of the pandemic.
Rating agency Fitch said airlines' profits and cashflows could suffer if crude prices continued to rise or stayed high.
Jefferies analysts said European airlines were likely to take a longer-term hit in light of the conflict.
A network of millions of parts has also been affected.
Washington announced export controls on goods including aircraft parts. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU also planned to stop exporting such parts to Russia. The U.S. said there would be steps to uphold safety.

""(W)e believe that sanctions and export control activities should not hinder the need to maintain flight safety of commercial aircraft,"" said Eric Fanning, chief executive of the U.S.-based Aerospace Industries Association.
Russian airlines have 980 jets in service, of which 777 are leased, according to analytics firm Cirium. Of these, 515 with an estimated market value of $10 billion are rented from abroad.

Russia’s ultra-rich are among the biggest owners of private jets and superyachts, two of the most opulent displays of massive wealth. 
So far, even as the U.S. and U.K. have ramped up sanctions on more than 100 Russian individuals and entities, these assets of the country’s elite -- which can be worth hundreds of millions of dollars each -- have avoided any direct hit. So too have their high-end real estate holdings, which in London range from Chelsea penthouses to Highgate mansions.
Read more: U.K. Takes Aim at Russia’s Opaque Embrace of London Property
One of the most high-profile status symbols in the U.K. is drawing attention lately: Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich’s ownership of the prized English football club Chelsea FC. It’s one of Europe’s most successful teams and valued at about 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion). Prime Minister Boris Johnson mistakenly said on Tuesday that Abramovich had already been sanctioned.
As tensions in the region escalate, some U.K. lawmakers are pressing to widen the scope of those subject to harsh penalties for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine, even as he signals a potential willingness to talk. 
“Surely Mr. Abramovich should no longer be able to own a football club in this country,” Labour MP Chris Bryant said on Thursday. “Surely we should be looking at seizing some of his assets, including his 152 million pound home, and making sure that other people who have had Tier 1 visas like this are not engaged in malign activity.”
Abramovich is not currently on the U.K.’s sanctions list.
Aircraft Activity
Aircraft controlled by Abramovich, as well as Dmitry Mazepin and Alexey Mordashov, landed in Moscow on Thursday, according to flight data website ADS-B Exchange. Abramovich’s Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787-8 Dreamliner took off from an airport near Monaco, while Mazepin’s Gulfstream G650 flew from the New York area. Mordashov’s Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Global 6000 traveled from the Seychelles region in the western Indian Ocean, according to the data, which didn’t include details of passengers on the flights.
Putin had invited executives and owners of major Russian businesses to a meeting on Thursday at the Kremlin. Mazepin was there, as was Mordashov. So was Vladimir Potanin, Russia’s wealthiest person in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with a $26.1 billion fortune. 
The aircraft owned by Mordashov, Russia’s second-richest person with a net worth of $23 billion, then flew back to the Seychelles region on Thursday, the flight data show. Mordashov’s yacht Nord, completed in 2020 at an estimated cost of $500 million, has been sailing in the island nation for 10 days.
Representatives for Mazepin, 53, and Mordashov, 56, declined to comment, while a representative for Abramovich, 55, didn’t respond immediately to a request for comment.
Billionaire Comforts
Assets like planes or yachts could be targeted by a round of sanctions, according to Andrew Lohsen, a fellow in the Europe, Russia and Eurasia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The challenge is they could be held through shell companies, complicating the ownership chain.
Imposing sanctions on Russian’s ultra-rich “is important, but I recognize that it is complex,” Natalie Jaresko, Ukraine’s former finance minister, said in a telephone interview. “It takes time, but you have to take away their comforts.”
Abramovich, by virtue of his Chelsea FC ownership, is facing public backlash first. Sports investors and private equity firms, including some from the U.S., have began to draw up potential takeover offers for the football club in case sanctions force the Russian billionaire to sell, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News. Chelsea has already fielded an enquiry this month, one of the people said. 
One of Abramovich’s yachts, My Solaris, is in Barcelona, while the other, the Eclipse, is in Saint Martin in the Caribbean.
Russian billionaires crave the legitimacy afforded from places frequented by high-net-worth individuals, such as New York, London and Singapore, said Raj Bhala, a professor at the University of Kansas Law School who specializes in international trade.
“To then be denied that access or to be shunned from those sorts of places does hurt them,” he said. “I wouldn’t underestimate that.”
A broadside against Russia’s billionaire class isn’t so simple for most countries. Meanwhile, Putin is rolling out a domestic response to sanctions that will initially focus on assisting lenders hit with penalties, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News, which may soften any economic blow in the coming weeks. The country’s richest lost $39 billion on Thursday alone, according to the Bloomberg wealth index.
Still, many of the billionaires are enjoying global travels. At least four of their superyachts remained anchored in Barcelona. Two were last parked along the Florida coast, in Miami and Palm Beach.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Exxon Mobil Corp and the United Steelworkers union (USW) reached a tentative agreement on the terms for workers locked out of a Beaumont, Texas, refinery for 10 months to begin returning to work in March, an Exxon (NYSE:XOM) spokesperson said.
USW Local 13-243, which represents the workers, has scheduled a vote on Saturday for members to ratify the agreement, said three sources familiar with the matter.
""We look forward to welcoming our employees back to work,"" said Exxon spokesperson Julie King.
Approval of the agreement would be the last step needed for Exxon to end the lockout, which it started on May 1, 2021, to avoid a threatened strike after the two sides could not reach agreement on a new six-year contract.
The refinery workers voted on Monday to ratify Exxon’s latest contract offer, yielding to the company on a key demand that gave Exxon control over all job assignments in the 369,024 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery and adjoining lubricant oil plant.
Under the return-to-work agreement, the nearly 600 workers would begin returning on March 7, the sources said. Most workers would be back in the refinery by March 11.

The return-to-work agreement does not require the USW to withdraw charges being investigated by the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleging that Exxon started the lockout to force the union's removal.
The NLRB conducted a vote on removing the union in November and December, which had been requested by 30% of the locked-out workers. Ballots were impounded on Dec. 29 by the board as it investigates the charges.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday unveiled a pair of proposals that would broaden the data short sellers must disclose about their bets that stocks will fall. 
The new rules would offer the public visibility into aggregated data around large short positions for individual equity securities, the SEC said. 
The proposals would also impose a ""buy-to-cover"" mandate for brokers to identify sales as ""long, short or short-exempt,"" said the SEC in its release, adding the classifications would only be required if a purchaser has any short position in the same security at the time of order, and would further amend the national market system plan to include a report of such ""buy-to-cover"" information.
The SEC said its proposals would apply to institutional investment managers with a short position of at least $10 million, or the equivalent of at least 2.5% of the total shares outstanding. It would also apply to those who hold a short position of at least $500,000 in an equity security of a nonreporting issuer.
Many hedge funds engage in short selling, where investors bet the price of a stock will fall. Some investors view it as an effective way to punish poor corporate management by doing more than selling a stock. Others complain that some short sellers look to cash in by ganging up on companies by publishing questionable research that sends a stock price lower.
Friday's measures are subject to public consultation. Last year, retail investors aggressively purchased shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) which resulted in a ""short squeeze"" that caused heavy losses for hedge funds that had shorted the company.
Following the GameStop saga, SEC chief Gary Gensler told Congress he would step up scrutiny and mandate expanded disclosures. 
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has moved to change its short-interest reporting requirements and the U.S. Justice Department has been probing suspected manipulative trading by short sellers and hedge funds.
The Managed Funds Association said it found the SEC's proposals ""bewildering,"" adding that hedge funds are already highly regulated and urging the regulator to use other methods to increase investor transparency.

The proposals are meant to force investment managers to exercise discretion over short positions and would provide more visibility into their behavior, said Gensler. The SEC would analyze raw data to better understand the role short selling may play in market events before aggregating it for the public's eyes, he added.
""It's important for the public and the Commission to know more about this important market, especially in times of stress or volatility.""

(Reuters) - French car parts maker  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) said on Friday it expected to report lower core profit margin this year amid geopolitical tensions and inflationary pressures, after 2021 margin missed the group's target.
""Overall, Valeo's H2/21 results were consistent with the Jan 26 pre-announce, but 2022 guidance was well below consensus expectations,"" RBC analyst Tom Narayan said in a note.
He added this was in line with what  Renault  (PA:RENA),  Michelin  (PA:MICP), Faurecia and Stellantis had earlier said, suggesting companies remain cautious amid the global chip shortage.
Shares in Valeo were down 10% in midday trade, as the stock heads for its worst day since March 2020. 
Semiconductor suppliers, car parts producers and carmakers have said they expect to see some improvement this year in the component shortages, as chipmakers boost production capacity to meet demand.
Valeo, which specialises in the design, production and sale of components and services for the automotive sector, forecast annual core profit (EBITDA) margin in a range of 11.8% to 12.3%, compared with 13.4% last year.
It sees 2022 sales between 19.2 billion and 20.0 billion euros, a growth of 11-16% from a year earlier.
Valeo said the outlook excluded possible effects from the Ukraine-Russia crisis, which could drag production volumes and hike energy or raw material prices, but included a negative impact from the integration of Valeo Siemens eAutomotive.
The direct impact of the crisis should be minimal, CEO Christophe Perillat told a press conference, saying the company has no sales in Ukraine while those in Russia account for less than 1% of its total sales.
Valeo said it planned to increase its original equipment sales by around 13% in the medium term to reach a revenue of 27.5 billion euros ($30.73 billion) in 2025, betting on recovery in car production volumes, with further growth to 40 billion euros expected by 2030.

726,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2022 12:36PM ET</span>",European shares surge 3% after Ukraine-driven rout,"By Sruthi Shankar and Susan Mathew
(Reuters) -Europe's main stocks index roared back on Friday, lifting off nine-month lows with banks leading a broad-based rally as investors hunted for bargains following a bruising sell-off after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Hopes for diplomacy aided sentiment after the Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to send a delegation to Minsk for negotiations with representatives of Ukraine. This come after missiles pounded Kyiv as Russian forces pressed their advance.
The STOXX 600 ended the day up 3.3%, after dropping to May lows on Thursday. All major indices jumped more than 3%, with London's FTSE 100 up almost 4%. 
The rally made back all of Thursday's steep losses, but was not enough to pull the benchmark pan-European STOXX 600 index up for the week as the geopolitical tensions sent investors fleeing from riskier assets. The index marked its second week in the red, down 1.6%, and is off about 8% from its peak in January.
""We don't think this is a time to be outright negative on equities — sentiment is already poor, at least some of the risks have been priced in,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. 
Banks jumped 4.3% to regain half of the previous session's dive. But they braced for impact from likely new sanctions from the West on Russia that could halt Russian banks' access to European financial markets.
The possibility of the conflict slowing the hawkish pace of central banks have also weighed on lenders. The European Central Bank affirmed its commitment to ensure price and financial stability on Thursday.
The mood remained fragile going into the weekend as was evident by defensive buying. Industrial stocks, utilities, healthcare and consumer staples were among the biggest boost to the STOXX 600. 
""As long as uncertainty persists we expect (European equities) to remain volatile and defensive,"" said HSBC analysts in a note. 
""Commodity sensitive sectors such as energy and basic materials may also perform strongly, thereby reversing the value rally... The scale of action taken by NATO countries is likely to determine how markets react.""
With oil and gas prices soaring in the wake of the Ukraine crisis, investors fear inflation will run even hotter and disrupt economic recovery in the euro zone due to its heavy reliance on Russia for gas supplies.
The Ukraine conflict may reduce the euro zone's economic output by 0.3%-0.4% this year, the ECB's chief economist said.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) cut its 12-month target for STOXX 600 to 490 - about 8% higher from current levels - from 530.

Among individual stock, Porsche SE and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) gained 3.8% and 5.2% respectively after the carmakers fleshed out details of a possible Porsche listing.
French car parts maker  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) dropped 10.5% after warning on core profit margin.

Nike will account for about 60% of total purchases for 2022, down from 70% in the past year and 75% in 2020, the company said on a post-earnings call.
This change reflects Nike's shift in strategy to direct-to-consumer (DTC) business and Foot Locker's ongoing efforts to diversify its offerings, the company said.
""We always thought that Foot Locker's position as a 'strategic partner' would insulate them somewhat from Nike's DTC push... but this is a dramatic change,"" said Wedbush analyst Tom Nikic. 
""We don't really see a silver lining here.""
Nike, battling supply chain issues and production facility closures over the last year, has been increasingly moving toward directly selling to consumers instead of wholesalers.
In its latest quarter, DTC sales rose to $4.7 billion, accounting for about 40% of Nike's total sales.
""We still have access to all of those products. We'll just see different quantities flowing our way,"" Foot Locker's Chief Executive Richard Johnson said on the call.
Foot Locker has been leaning on other brands including Adidas (OTC:ADDYY), Puma and Timberland to mitigate the risks from Nike's new strategy, while also expanding its apparel offerings and launching its private label brands to diversify.

The company said it expects comparable sales to fall 8% to 10% in fiscal 2022, while estimating adjusted profit between $4.25 and $4.60 per share. Analysts on average were expecting $6.49 per share, according to Refinitiv estimates.
Foot Locker's shares were down 35% at $26.85 in afternoon trading. If the losses hold, the stock was set for its worst day ever.

""Honestly, if it goes beyond 2023, and it goes on for another year, we probably cancel the program,"" Tim Clark told industry publication AirlineRatings.
""What else can we do? We can’t continue the way we are. Boeing really needs to get their act together and get this aircraft sorted."" 
Emirates is the world's largest international carrier, according to industry data, and largest user of wide-body jets.
""Don’t forget the aircraft was originally designed for delivery in April 2020; it’s now 2024 if we are lucky. You’ve now got a four-year delay with the programme. If they got another year on it, we are going to question if this is fit for purpose or not, what’s the problem with it?""
A Boeing spokesperson said it ""remains focused on executing the comprehensive series of tests and conditions to demonstrate the safety and reliability of the airplane’s design"". Boeing will continue to work closely with customers, the company said.
Emirates is the largest customer for the upgraded version of Boeing's 777 mini-jumbo. The upgrade is facing additional scrutiny and certification delays in the wake of a safety crisis over the 737 MAX.
The plane is due to be certified in mid-2023 but Clark, who has voiced frustration over delays in the past, told AirlineRatings Boeing had only given a conditional response when he had asked whether that certification date remained on track.
He was also reported by AirlineRatings saying Boeing had built 12 of Emirates' 777X and placed them in storage without their engines.
Emirates originally ordered 150 of the twin-engined jets in 2013, becoming by far their biggest customer. It later trimmed the order to 115 jets partly by swapping them for 787s, and has previously suggested it could switch more of the order to 787s.

However, Clark also criticised a separate issue of production delays of the 787, of which Emirates has 30 on order.
""The total of 30 787s in there look very marginal now as they are so far behind in production,"" he was quoted as saying by AirlineRatings.

Investing.com -- Daiwa analyst Jairam Nathan upgraded Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares to outperform from neutral Friday, telling investors in a note that renewed supply chain concerns and higher oil prices will enhance the company's competitive advantage over legacy internal combustion engines.
Tesla shares are up over 1% Friday around the $812 mark. In his note, Nathan also lowered his price target on Tesla to $900 from $980. 
Nathan said rising energy prices will likely “accelerate the shift to EVs and Tesla is best positioned to satisfy higher demand with capacity expansion in China and the US.”
He added that the company's ability to export out of ""cost-efficient"" China and its record of better managing chip shortages in 2021 could strengthen its position under the current Russia/Ukraine situation.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Irish insurers' association Insurance Ireland has offered to open up its data sharing platform to non-members and apply fair criteria to access it in an attempt to end a near-three EU antitrust investigation and stave off a possible hefty fine.
The European Commission last year charged the industry body, which covers over 90% of the Irish motor vehicle insurance market with restricting certain insurers and their agents' access to its data system called Insurance Link.
The EU competition enforcer said this gave Insurance Ireland's members an unfair advantage, reduced the possibility of more competitive prices and restricted the number of choices for car owners.
Insurance Ireland has proposed to allow insurers access to Insurance Link regardless of whether they are members or not, the commission said in a statement on Friday.
It will also change the criteria for accessing the platform to make them fair, objective, transparent and non-discriminatory that will be applicable to both Irish and non-Irish applicants.
Its offer also includes appointing an independent Application Officer to handle applications, and adopting a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory fee for users.
The pledge would be valid for 10 years. The EU antitrust regulator said interested parties have a month to provide feedback.
""If the market test indicates that the commitments address the competition concerns, the Commission may adopt a decision making them legally binding on the association. Such a decision would not conclude that there is an infringement of EU antitrust rules,"" the commission said.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Pre-tax profits for the world's largest copper producer Codelco surged to $7.4 billion in 2021 from $2.1 billion a year earlier, boosted by high global prices for the widely used metal, the Chilean state mining company said on Friday.
Copper prices jumped last year and some analysts see a new supercycle for the red metal as demand rises for its use in electric vehicles.
Codelco, which turns over its profits to government coffers, reported that it produced 1.618 million tonnes of copper at its own mines in 2021, in line with output a year earlier.
Adding production from its stakes in Freeport's El Abra and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Sur, total copper production rose to 1.728 million tonnes.
Cash costs increased 2.6% to $1.327 per pound of the metal, Codelco Chief Executive Octavio Araneda said during a virtual press conference.
""This was mainly due to external effects, higher input prices that towards the end of 2021 began to put pressure on the industry's operating costs,"" he said.
Araneda said fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine is not expected to significantly affect Codelco's sales as those countries are not important buyers of the company's copper.
Chief Financial Officer Alejandro Rivera forecast global prices for copper should remain near current levels this year barring a major escalation of the conflict.

Important maintenance work at Codelco's Chuquicamata smelter is not expected to hit overall production, but it will affect cathode output, Araneda said.
He added that 2022 total copper production should be similar to 2020 and 2021 output.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Infopulse, one of Ukraine's biggest IT companies, had been planning to relocate hundreds of its staff to Poland for weeks, preparing for what was seen only as a worst-case scenario. Then came the invasion.
Some 70 employees with families managed to settle in Poland before Russia attacked Ukraine on Thursday. Initially, Infopulse planned to move as many as 500-700 people, up to 35% of its staff.
On Thursday, Infopulse employees with families headed for the border, but only a little more than a dozen crossed over before Ukraine banned all Ukrainian men between the ages of 18 and 60 from leaving, so that they can fight for their country.
Men in Ukraine can face up to 12 years in prison for failing to report for military conscription.
The company says that the initial decision about employee relocation was partly dictated by customer concerns about continuity of service and partly a response to calls from staff.
""We have not urged anyone, neither to move nor to stay, because every decision involves risk,"" Lukasz Olechnowicz, Infopulse's Polish CEO, told Reuters, adding that those willing to stay and fight could count on keeping their jobs and their salaries.
Olechnowicz said that three of his employees stayed at his home in Gdansk overnight, as the war came while they were on holiday.
Adam Brzostowski, Director of Business Development and International Relations Bureau at city hall in the Polish industrial city of Lodz, said Infopulse was one of a few companies that had correctly assessed the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
For nearly a year he had been trying to convince companies from Ukraine and Belarus to open their offices in Lodz, over 130 km south of Warsaw, but only four decided to move around 500 people.
Now, after the invasion, companies have been calling, asking him for help.
Sławomir Szymusiak, Director General of the Polish-Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce, said that several hundred people had called the chamber asking for help with relocation.
Romanian software automation powerhouse UiPath said on Friday it was providing financial and logistical assistance to its Ukrainian staff.
The company, valued at nearly $20 billion since going public on the New York Stock Exchange last April, opened an office in Ukraine in 2019 when it acquired Lviv-based startup StepShot. It currently employs 30 people in Lviv, some of whom have chosen to stay and others to relocate, it said. UiPath is helping both.
Back in Poland, Yanina Krymova, country HR for Infopulse, is still working on helping her colleagues with relocations, and also waiting for her mother, sister and nephew to join her in Warsaw.
""I believe in my army, I believe in God, that he is on the Ukrainian side,"" she said this week, adding that she was regularly donating some of her income to the Ukrainian army.

TORONTO (Reuters) -Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) and National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF) both comfortably beat analysts' estimates for quarterly earnings on Friday, driven by loan and fee growth, as well as strength in their capital markets businesses. 
The lenders join Royal Bank of Canada in posting positive earnings surprises in a quarter in which analysts had expected some challenges, particularly higher expenses and a lower contribution from trading businesses following a record quarter a year earlier. 
CIBC shares jumped 4% to C$161.09, while National Bank added 1.5% to C$102.27 in early trading, compared with 0.2% rise in the benchmark Toronto stock benchmark.
CIBC, Canada's No. 5 lender, announced a two-for-one share split, subject to approval at its annual shareholder meeting scheduled for April. It reported adjusted profit that rose 14% from a year earlier in the three months to Jan. 31, better than analysts had expected.
About two-thirds of CIBC's revenue beat was due to trading activities and the rest due to ""core banking outperformance,"" Gabriel Dechaine, an analyst at National Bank Financial, wrote in a note.
CIBC posted a 11% jump in expenses during the quarter, the same increase as revenue growth, from a year ago, although they were down from the previous quarter, when the bank saw the increase in costs outpace revenue expansion. National Bank had expense growth of 8% versus revenue that grew 11% from a year earlier 
CIBC expects expense growth in the high single digits percentage wise if revenues keep rising, but remains confident the latter will outpace cost expansion, executives said on an analyst call.
National Bank, the smallest of the country's Big Six banks, said net income excluding one-off items increased to C$2.65 per share from C$2.15 a year earlier, beating estimates of C$2.23. 
Both banks saw 11% growth in their capital markets revenues from a year earlier. They also reported strength in their Canadian commercial loan books, highlighting the return of business borrowers who had pulled back for most of the pandemic, although deposits have also continued to climb. 
About 40% of CIBC's loan growth came from new clients, and the bank's pipeline for future increases is the strongest it has been since 2019, executives said on an analyst call. 

Higher loan volumes overall helped mitigate declines in net interest margins across both banks' lending units. 
Separately, National Bank said it had appointed Marie Chantal Gringas chief financial officer.

The public prosecutor's office had asked the court to overturn an earlier conviction in the case. The detailed reasons for the decision will be released only in three months' time, the sources added. 
Truzzoli had initially opted for a separate fast-track trial behind closed doors which resulted in a sentence of one year imprisonment in November 2020, against which she appealed.
The main trial involving 20 defendants, including two former senior BT executives and the Italian subsidiary itself, started in January of 2021 before a Milan court and is ongoing.
Milan prosecutors allege that a network of BT Italy employees inflated revenues, faked contract renewals and invoices and invented bogus supplier transactions in order to disguise the unit's true financial performance.
BT took a 530 million pound ($725 million) charge in its accounts in 2017 relating to the alleged false accounting.

All the defendants have always denied any wrongdoing.
The next hearing in the main trial is scheduled for March 16.

Investing.com –  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) stock plummeted 35% Friday after the company issued a disappointing outlook, indicating Nike's (NYSE:NKE) share in the company’s business will continue to shrink.
A 33% increase in quarterly dividend and the announcement of a $1.2 billion share repurchase program did nothing to arrest the slide in the shares.
Without naming  Nike  in its earnings statement Friday, the retailer said no single vendor should contribute more than 60% of total purchases this financial year, down from 70% in 2021 and 75% in the year before.
“This change reflects the accelerated strategic shift to DTC by one of the company's vendors and Foot Locker's ongoing brand and category diversification efforts,” the company said in a statement.
Foot Locker had, in its most recent annual filing, identified Nike as its largest supplier. Nike is reportedly investing in direct-to-consumer sales to rely less on third parties.
For the current year, Foot Locker is forecasting sales to fall by 4% to 6% while comparable sales could fall as much as 10%. On the lower side, comparable sales are seen down by 8%. Adjusted profit per share is seen between $4.25 and $4.6. Adjusted earnings per share in 2021 were $7.7 on total sales of $9 billion. 
Sales in the fourth quarter rose 7% to $2.34 billion. Adjusted profit per share rose by 12 cents to $1.67 and beat estimates."

The world's most indebted property developer is struggling to complete projects and homes - deemed a priority by China's policymakers to ensure social stability - while weighed down by its more than $300 billion in liabilities.
Evergrande said it sold its stake and right to debt in a residential development in Chongqing and Dongguan to Everbright Trust for 1.03 billion yuan, as well as those in a housing project in Foshan and a theme park development in Guangzhou to Minmetals Trust for 1.1 billion yuan.
The right to debt means the buyers take on debt linked to the project. The trust firms are part of China's so-called shadow banking sector.
The trust firms will be responsible for the construction and the delivery of properties to homebuyers, and any surplus from property sales will be used to repay the initial capital contributed by Evergrande. 
Through the deals, Evergrande can recover around 1.95 billion yuan of the initial capital contributed, and settle around 7 billion yuan of liabilities in the projects. 
""The contribution amount recovered will have a positive impact on the group’s efforts in both debt settlement and guarantee of property delivery of other projects,"" Evergrande said.
The deal also gives Evergrande the right to repurchase the equity interest in the projects.
State-owned enterprises are expected to acquire more assets from cash-strapped private developers, analysts said, as Beijing steps up efforts to stabilise and tighten control over the crisis-hit property sector that accounts for a quarter of its economy.

Minmetals Trust last month already bought all the equity in at least one project from Evergrande in the southern city of Kunming for 50 million yuan, official filings showed, in a rare case where a trust company took over assets from a distressed developer.

The United States, Britain and the European Union imposed more severe sanctions on Russia on Thursday after it invaded Ukraine and the EU said on Friday it was planning a third round of measures. 
The exchange, the world's oldest and largest market for industrial metals, said in a statement that it believed that a small number of members had positions with individuals or entities which have become subject to sanctions. 
""Where this is the case, the member must ensure that it takes immediate action to achieve sanctions compliance, including ensuring that no payments are made to any sanctioned person,"" it added.
So far the LME, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd., has not had to suspend any of its brands due to sanctions, but the exchange said it was ready to take action if necessary.
The LME added that one aluminium alloy brand produced by TPK Urksplav was subject to sanctions because it was located in one of two separatist breakaway regions in Ukraine.
The brand was already suspended, however, and there were no inventories of the metal in LME warehouses, the statement said.
A brand can be suspended if the firm no longer produces metal.

The LME in 2018 suspended from its list of approved brands aluminium produced by Russia's Rusal after it was sanctioned by the United States.
The LME said it would continue to update a webpage with its comments about the impact on LME metals from sanctions.

BARCELONA (Reuters) -Cellnex remains interested in expanding into Germany Europe's largest mobile phone tower operator said on Friday after it reported a 63% rise in adjusted core earnings in 2021 to 1.92 billion euros ($2.15 billion).
Telecom towers have been the target of several big takeovers in the past few years and Cellnex is vying with U.S.-based American Tower Corp (NYSE:AMT) to increase its European footprint ahead of the roll out of 5G.
By 2030, Barcelona-based Cellnex aims to control around 130,000 masts in 12 European countries. It could spend up to 9 billion euros on acquisitions this year.
Chief executive Tobias Martinez said Cellnex would carefully consider a push into Germany - the only big Western European country where it is not present.
""We would love to be in Germany but after six years (existing as a company) and being present in 12 countries this company does not depend on being in Germany.""
His comments came a day after Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) Chief Executive Tim Hoettges, speaking during a news conference after the company's results, said that the group was ready to deconsolidate its tower business in Germany but had ""no time pressure.""
Cellnex reported a 58% surge in revenue in 2021, beating its own target and Refinitiv estimates.
But costs related to its European expansion, an early retirement plan in Spain and a tax hike in Britain meant its net loss widened to 351 million euros from 133 million the previous year.
In 2022, Cellnex expects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to grow to between 2.65 billion euros and 2.7 billion euros, while revenues are estimated to reach 3.46 billion euros to 3.51 billion euros. 
Cellnex entered Poland in 2021 and built its presence in four other countries. It invested 1.09 billion euros in increasing stakes in companies in France and Poland, fulfilling purchase rights for Iliad and Play.
The company said it is likely to offset the spending with 1.1 billion euros it may raise from antitrust sales required by France and potentially in Britain, where it hopes to get approval in March for a planned 10 billion euro deal to buy towers from Hong Kong's CK Hutchinson.
It could also sell stakes in its different units to minority shareholders but there have been no advanced conversations on that front, Martinez said. 

Given its presence in Poland, Cellnex has contingency plans related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, he said.

Shares of the miner were falling 1.5% in Sao Paulo after the company posted fourth-quarter results that beat expectations, although analysts were disappointed by a weaker operating income and low cash flow generation amid higher provisions related to two dam disasters that killed hundreds. 
""The sequential deterioration in (operating income) was mainly driven by lower realized iron ore prices, which more than offset strong iron ore sales and lower cash costs,"" said analysts at Itau BBA in a note. 
Vale was once the world's No. 1 iron ore producer and remains a top player for the steel ingredient, although prices have fallen in recent months. 
The price of nickel, however, has risen about 40% so far this year and Vale executives said in a call to discuss earnings results that they expect demand for the metal to double in the next decade as automakers transition onto electric vehicles. 
They added they expect copper demand to rise by 30% in the same period. 

Russia and Ukraine are significant producers of iron ore pellets and the company expects the conflict could impact prices, said executive Marcello Spinelli.

BARCELONA/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - There will be no Russian pavilion at the telecoms industry's biggest annual gathering and a ""handful"" of Russian firms will be barred from it because of sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, the event's organizer said on Friday. 
The organizers of the Mobile World Congress condemned Moscow's actions, but have no plans to cancel or postpone the gathering scheduled between Feb. 28 and March 3 in Barcelona, John Hoffman, the chief executive of event organizer GSMA, told Reuters. 
""As we see the situation today, we don't see any need or requirement to do that. Of course it's an evolving situation and we will continue to monitor it,"" Hoffman said.
He said ""a handful, a few"" Russian companies and their executives would be banned but did not name them, saying the sanctions lists were evolving.
""We are guided by the international sanctions and there are some companies that are identified on the sanction list and those will be barred from participating,"" he said, adding GSMA would strictly follow U.S. sanctions as well as others.
Conference organisers expect between 40,000 and 60,000 people at the show, making it one of the biggest in-person events since the start of the pandemic, though still below 2019's numbers.
Hoffman said the figure would probably be closer to 60,000 and attendance would be very high among top executives. 
Constanti Serrallonga, general manager of Fira de Barcelona, the event's venue, spoke of a good build-up to the gathering.
""We are expecting to see an edition that will almost look like a pre-pandemic event."" 
The Ukraine invasion has not led to any significant hotel cancellations in Barcelona related to the event with the exception of some representatives from eastern Europe, tourism website Hosteltur reported.

For Barcelona's Nobu Hotel the return of a large-format conference meant it could reopen after it remained shut for two years because of the pandemic. 
""We expect the Mobile World Congress to meet our expectations ... we are setting the tone that Barcelona is back"", manager Laurence Dubey said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) will suspend some operations at its car assembly plants in Russia next week due to logistics bottlenecks that have caused component shortages, its local units said on Friday.
The move comes after Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine on Thursday although Renault, which has three car assembly plants in Russia, did not specify whether its supply chain had been affected by the conflict. 
Renault, which returned to profit in 2021 after two years of losses, is among Western companies most exposed to Russia, where it makes 8% of its core earnings, according to Citibank.
In a statement, the French carmaker's Russian unit said its Moscow production would stop from Feb 28-March 5 amid ""some interruptions in supplies of components."" 
""Interruptions are primarily caused by tighter border controls in transit countries and the forced need to change a number of established logistics routes,"" the unit said, without naming any countries. 
Separately, a car plant in Togliatti, central Russia, may stop some assembly lines on Monday, Russia's top carmaker Avtovaz - which is controlled by Renault - said, citing persisting global shortage of electronic components. It said the plant should be fully operational on Tuesday. 
The United States announced sweeping export restrictions against Russia on Thursday, hammering its access to global exports of goods from commercial electronics and computers to semiconductors and aircraft parts. 
U.S. sanctions do not cover Renault or Avtovaz and target supplies of specific components. Avtovaz CEO Nicolas Maure said this week his firm would seek alternative supplies of electronic chips in case U.S. sanctions curb deliveries. 

Neither Renault's unit nor Avtovaz mentioned the invasion of Ukraine in their statements. 
Even without the sanctions, sales of new cars in Russia are forecast to slow to 3.3% this year from 4.3% in 2021, because of the shortage of electronic components, logistics challenges and higher costs, according to the Association of European Business.

ADESA U.S., a wholly-owned subsidiary of KAR Global, is the second largest provider of wholesale vehicle auction solutions in the U.S. with 56 sites. It brought $800 million in revenue and over $100 million EBITDA in 2021.
Carvana was an unexpected winner last year as the pandemic-induced shortage of new vehicles made potential buyers prefer used cars. Low interest rates and high prices of new vehicles were other motivations fueling purchases of used vehicles.
As the pandemic wanes and shortages ease, Carvana is looking at new business to keep its growth going.
""Carvana and ADESA U.S.'s footprints are highly complementary and combining them extends the collective reach of the two businesses,"" the used-car seller said.
It added that when fully utilized, ADESA's reconditioning operations can add about 2 million units to its annual production.
Carvana has secured the financing for the deal from J.P. Morgan and Citi.

Power and LMC Automotive said in a joint forecast on Friday.
The consultants cut their forecast for global light-vehicle sales by 400,000 to 85.8 million units, also due to rising oil and aluminum prices that could discourage buyers from spending on new cars and trucks.
The supply and prices of vehicles across the globe will be under added pressure based on the severity and duration of the conflict in Ukraine, said Jeff Schuster, president of Americas operations and global vehicle forecasts, at LMC Automotive.
Russia's attack on Ukraine caused oil prices to surge to more than $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014 on Thursday, with Brent touching $105.
The auto industry is still grappling with a global chip shortage that has forced them to cut back production, although high car prices have offset that impact to an extent.
February U.S. retail sales of new vehicles are expected to fall 5.7% to 922,100 units, although average transaction prices are set to hit a monthly record of $44,460, an 18.5% jump.

""Ongoing supply chain disruptions, along with near-term announcements of production outages by several manufacturers, mean that the aggregate inventory situation is unlikely to change in March,"" said Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power. 
However, the volume of global light-vehicle sales is expected to rise 5% in 2022, according to the report.

Investing.com – Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) stock slumped 7.3% in premarket trading Friday after citing tough market conditions due to shortage of parts.
That lack of availability of components led it to a disappointing forecast of $1.25-$1.50 in adjusted profit per share for the period ending in April, lower sequentially.
The company expects PC backlog to grow in the current quarter as chips and other key components remain in short supply. It shipped 17.2 million PCs in the fourth quarter, up 9%.
Shortage of parts has been a recurring grouse of makers of laptops, mobiles, and other gadgets for more than a year. While large players like Dell would be expected to overcome the challenges by now, it doesn’t seem to be happening.

Dell continues to tackle the flare-up in commodity and logistics costs with price hikes. Booming demand for its machines and price increases took its annual revenue past $101 billion, a lifetime record.
Revenue of Client Solutions Group, which houses its hardware business, surged 26% to top $17 billion as demand came from both corporates and retail consumers. The company said its PC business has gained market share in 32 of the last 36 quarters.

LONDON (Reuters) -British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) cancelled flights to Moscow and pledged to avoid Russian airspace on Friday as the invasion of Ukraine and surging oil prices threatened its post-pandemic return to profitability. 
With passenger numbers edging nearer to 2019 levels, the group which also owns Aer Lingus, Iberia and Vueling vowed to bring an end to two straight years of multi-billion-dollar losses with a return to profitability from the second quarter. 
But as it published results it said the British flag carrier had suspended flights to Moscow and would not use Russian airspace, a move that can add significant costs to the industry as diverted planes fly south to avoid areas of tension in the Middle East. 
Russia banned British airlines from using its airspace on Friday, a day after London barred Russian flag carrier Aeroflot. Other airlines are avoiding Russia, including Virgin Atlantic, on routes between Europe and Asia. 
For BA, the diversions will currently affect around 1% of its operations as the airline is still not flying to many destinations in Asia, including China and Hong Kong. 
With oil prices back above $100 a barrel, IAG Chief Executive Luis Gallego said the company was hedged against volatile crude prices for two years, with the first year around 60% hedged. He said the conflict in Ukraine could knock general customer confidence, particularly for Americans.
""The point of sale in the U.S. can be affected because the people can be concerned that there is a war in Europe,"" he said, adding the company had not seen any impact on bookings. 
SIGNS OF RECOVERY
The renewed gloom around an industry that has battled two years of travel restrictions that left planes grounded around the world threatened to overshadow the signs of recovery at one of the biggest airline groups. 
IAG said on Friday it expected passenger capacity to reach 85% of pre-pandemic levels this year, following a collapse to just 36% in 2021. And while the Omicron coronavirus variant affected bookings in January and February, it had only had a minimal impact on bookings for Easter and summer 2022.
The group reported a 2.97 billion euro ($3.33 billion) net loss in 2021, versus a 4.39 billion euro loss in 2020. 
""We are confident that a strong recovery is underway,"" Gallego said, adding business travel had started to pick up, especially on transatlantic routes. 
The group's forecast for a return to profitability assumes no further setbacks related to COVID-19 and travel restrictions or material impact from ""recent geopolitical developments.""
Shares in IAG are down 19% over the last year. They fell 6% on Thursday after Russia's full invasion of Ukraine forced oil prices to jump back to 2014 levels on fears of supply disruption. They opened up on Friday before sliding back 1%.
IAG, which operates 533 aircraft, has been slower than some of its peers to recover from the pandemic, due to its exposure to the slow-to-open UK market, the long-shut UK-U.S. route and smaller cargo unit. 

Passenger capacity in the fourth quarter was 58% of 2019 levels, up from 43% in the third.

Gas in a section of the pipeline has been flowing eastward since December 21 as buyers in Poland drew on stored supply from Germany rather than buying more Russian gas at high spot prices. [NG/EU] 
Capacity of 6.4 million kilowatt-hour per hour (kWh/h) has been allocated for Russian gas producer Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) via the Kondratki transit point from 1500 local time (1400 GMT) on Friday until Saturday morning, according to data from Polish system operator Gaz-System.
Data from German operator Gascade showed bids for the same volume via the Mallnow transit point to Germany from Poland.
There is no guarantee that westbound deliveries will resume, however, as Gazprom also booked capacity in early February but did not use it.
The pipeline usually accounts for about 15% of Russia's westbound supply of gas to Europe and Turkey.
UKRAINE
Russia has also boosted supply to Europe via Ukraine, a data showed.
Bids for supply to Slovakia from Ukraine via the Velke Kapusany border point stood at 796,815 MWh, up from 622,676 MWh on Thursday.
A spike in prices has made it cheaper to buy Russian pipeline gas than buy it on the spot market, Refinitiv analysts noted.
The Dutch TTF hub contract for March was down 27.43 euros but still high at 108.57 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) on Friday afternoon.
Eastbound supply to Poland from Germany via the Mallnow metering point stood at 2.92 million kilowatt hours per hour (kWh/h) on Friday morning, up from around 700,000 kWh/h hours earlier.
Bids for gas from Germany to Poland are expected to stay at that level until Saturday morning unless the pipeline returns to its normal westbound mode.

Gazprom, which can book pipeline capacity at daily auctions, has not ordered any transit capacity for February and March via the route.
It did not book capacity for the second and third quarters of the year and has no plans to hold spot gas sales at its electronic platform this week.

763,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2022 08:15AM ET</span>","Exclusive-Italy eyes bourse rules shake-up to boost Milan's allure, document shows","By Giuseppe Fonte and Valentina Za
ROME (Reuters) - Italy is looking at overhauling listing, voting and other rules to address the ""chronic delays"" holding back the country's capital markets and boost Milan's ability to compete with European peers, a Treasury document seen by Reuters showed.
With an overall capitalisation of 800 billion euros ($890 billion), the value of companies listed on Milan's bourse lags far behind Paris, which boasts a market capitalistion of 3.7 trillion euros and even Amsterdam, with 1.4 trillion euros.
""Italy's capital market is chronically behind those of other advanced economies, partly due to the weaknesses of the country's ecosystem and partly due to regulatory hurdles,"" the document said.
Italy is looking at enhancing voting rights, among other measures, to encourage owners to list their businesses in Milan without worrying about losing control to other shareholders, the Treasury suggested in the document.
As policymakers globally debate extending differentiated voting rights to promote investments, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, has said it felt necessary to reiterate its support for the ""one share, one vote"" principle.
A regulatory set-up that helps leading shareholders preserve a tight grip on companies has driven a number of top Italian companies in recent years to opt for a Dutch legal domicile - while remaining listed in Milan.
Car makers Stellantis and Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), drinks group Campari, and MFE, the broadcaster controlled by the family of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, have all moved their registered offices to the Netherlands where they now hold their shareholder meetings.
""The effectiveness of rules that enhance voting rights - loyalty share schemes and multiple voting shares - is being reconsidered to see whether it could make sense to boost them in order to make Italy a more attractive location for companies to set up base and list,"" the document said.
In particular, the Treasury suggested that companies which are planning to list could be allowed to issue special shares that give existing investors a right to cast more than three votes for each share owned at shareholder meetings, surpassing the current limit of three.
EPIC IPO DOCUMENTS
Another step to boost initial public offerings (IPOs) in Milan, according to the paper, could be to simplify the listing process, which current rules make costly and cumbersome for companies to provide adequate risk disclosure for investors.
The result is that prospectus documents can often run into several hundred pages.
""Excessive information risks, at the end of the day, producing the same negative effects of a lack of information,"" the document said, suggesting a limit of 300 pages.
A discussion paper by Italian market regulator Consob dubbed ""The long and winding road"" put the average number of pages in an equity prospectus approved by Consob at 406 versus 298 in Germany, the country with the second highest average.
The Treasury also suggested scrapping a provision designed to protect savers that holds staff of institutions such as the Bank of Italy and Consob liable for damages in case of serious misconduct, while in other countries those staff would only be liable in cases of wilful misconduct.
""The possibility is being considered to introduce a rule that would limit legal action for damages only to institutions but not their top executives and staff,"" the document said.
Shielding employees could speed up the approval process which in Italy, according to Chiomenti law firm partner Enrico Giordano, is estimated to take from six to 10 weeks from the formal filing of the IPO prospectus, longer than elsewhere.
The document also mentioned the possibility of bypassing the formal IPO process through a so-called direct listing, which sees a company sell existing shares directly on the open market, saving the money required to line up underwriters as middlemen.
The London Stock Exchange, which in 2020 sold the Milan bourse to pan-European rival Euronext, offers direct listing to companies as does the New York Stock Exchange.

Investing.com – Stock of British Airways owner, IAG (LON:ICAG), traded 3.61% higher in London trading Friday after the group forecast a return to profitability by the end of the next quarter.
IAG said on Friday, it expected passenger capacity to reach 85% of pre-pandemic levels this year, following a collapse to just 36% in 2021. And while the Omicron coronavirus variant affected bookings in January and February, it has had a minimal impact on bookings for Easter and summer 2022, it said.

U.K. flights to and over Russia have been banned by the country's civil aviation authority in retaliation for a ban on Aeroflot in U.K. airspace.
The airline group has earmarked 3.9 billion euros in capital expenditure, reflecting the need to rebuild capacity towards pre-pandemic levels and certain pre-delivery payments deferred from previous years.
IAG’s 2021 net loss more than halved to 2.93 billion euros ($3.72 billion) from 6.93 billion euros in 2020. Total revenue in the year rose 8.3% to 8.45 billion euros."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The sweeping restrictions imposed on Russia to block its access to global exports of goods from chips to computers and electronics are likely to accelerate China's own push for self-reliance in the semiconductor industry, analysts said.
Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, Washington - as part of a package of measures - announced export restrictions which will force companies making high- and low-tech items overseas with U.S. tools to seek a licence from the United States before shipping to Russia.
China, like Russia, lacks advanced chip manufacturing capacity but one of its top long-term policy goals is to establish independence and self-reliance in the semiconductor industry. 
The importance of such self-sufficiency became apparent when Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's smartphone business collapsed following sanctions on the company imposed by the U.S. in 2019 that cut off much of its overseas chip supply and effectively barred it from building its own.
One chip consultant in China, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the topic, said China will likely ""watch and learn"" from the sanctions and their impact on Russia.
""The Russians have a failed chip industry and rely on global semiconductors. So if there are technology issues that come out during the 'non-invasion' from sanctions, it reinforces Beijing's desire to own the technology for itself.""
Washington further hobbled China's plans for tech supremacy by expanding sanctions to include the country's top chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) in 2020.
SMIC was forced to abandon plans to manufacture some types of advanced chips when the U.S. revoked an export license for Dutch lithography machine maker ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) NV.
Over the past ten years, China, the world's largest importer of chips, has poured funding into semiconductor projects as part of the ""Made in China 2025"" initiative, which calls for 70% self-sufficiency in core components for critical technologies by the middle of the decade.
Its chip industry is growing fast, thanks to venture capital funding and political incentives. But the country's global share of chip exports remains marginal - its fabless chipmakers occupy about 16% of global market share, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.
That also limits how much China can do to aid a heavily-sanctioned Russia.
""China alone can't supply all of Russia's critical needs for the military,"" a senior U.S. administration official said.
""China doesn't have any production of the most advanced technology nodes. So Russia and China are both reliant on other supplier countries and of course U.S. technology to meet their needs.""
China shipped approximately $10 billion worth of electronics to Russia in 2020, according to U.N. Comtrade data, accounting for roughly 20% of its total exports.
Smartphone shipments account for a large chunk of that as Chinese brands such as Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp and Realme are among top-sellers in Russia.

""Russia's chip consumption is not big and more than half is probably from China already,"" said Doug Fuller, who researches China's technology policy at the City University of Hong Kong.
""China may pick up an extra $200 million in exports approximately if chips from elsewhere are completely cut off, and some of the chips Russia needs China can't make anyway.""

Investing.com – Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) stock fell 2.4% in premarket Friday after the crypto exchange warned of trading volumes declining in January-March, a reversal from the surge it experienced in its most recent quarter.
“And so we expect Q1 to have lower monthly transacting users and lower trading volume than Q4 2021,” Coinbase wrote in a letter to shareholders.
With crypto asset prices declining, it expects current quarter subscription and services revenue also to be lower sequentially.
“This is not unusual, as we have seen historical crypto market patterns where all-time high periods have been followed by softer periods,” it said in the letter.
Trading volumes jumped more than 67% to $547 billion sequentially in December quarter, with retail trading accounting for 32% of volumes and crypto assets contributing 68% to total trading. Retail trading alone rose 90%.
While crypto assets remain a subject of debate for reasons of utility and legality, new investors have continued to flock to them while the exchange also attempts to create new revenue streams like custody and a marketplace for non-fungible tokens.
So-called altcoins -- tokens other than Bitcoin (BTC/USD) and Ethereum (ETH/USD) -- made up 68% of the exchange’s trading volume in the fourth quarter, the highest reported yet.
Total revenue in the quarter was $2.5 billion compared to about $1.3 billion July-September.
For the full year, Coinbase expects average transaction revenue per user to fall to “pre-2021 levels.” It forecasts a wide range of annual average retail monthly transacting users of 5 million to 15 million."

Investing.com - VMware, Inc. (NYSE:VMW) shares dropped 5.6% in pre-market trading as the server software provider beat on earnings and revenue for their latest quarter, but provided a muted outlook for next quarter's and next year's revenues amid a shift in revenue models.
The company posted fiscal year Q4 2022 earnings of $1.39/share and non-GAAP earnings of $2.02/share, vs. analyst expectations of $1.98/share. VMware's revenue for the quarter was $3.53 billion, just ahead of estimates of $3.52 billion.
Revenue growth was up 7% year-over-year for Q4 and up 9% for the full year. VMware is transitioning to a more subscription and software as a service (SaaS) based model and saw that type of revenue grow 23% in Q4 and 24% for the year. That segment comprises 25% of VMware's total revenue.
“The growth in customer demand for our multi-cloud solutions was reflected in our Q4 results. We are at an exciting time in our industry, as enterprises large and small transform and modernize to become software-based, digital enterprises,” said Raghu Raghuram, CEO, VMware.
Guidance appears to be what is weighing on the stock, however. VMware guided for revenue of $3.185 billion in the quarter ending in April, and for non-GAAP earnings of $1.56/share, vs. estimates of $3.23 billion in revenue and $1.64/share in earnings. For the year, VMware guided for $13.75 billion in revenue, or 7% year-over-year growth, and non-GAAP earnings of $6.97/share. The company is forecasting an acceleration in subscription and SaaS revenue growth to 26% year over year, but the market appears to be waiting for proof that this will lead to accelerated growth, as most sell-side analysts have lowered their price targets on the stock in the wake of the report.
One, Mizuho's Gregg Moskovitz, wrote, ""VMW reported slight revenue upside for F4Q, although billings growth was less than expected, and F1Q/FY23 guidance was below Street expectations. Over time, we expect that a growing contribution from SaaS and hybrid cloud subscriptions should improve VMW's positioning, but we're not confident that VMW will execute smoothly going forward...the company also has much to prove here.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian tech giant  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX) has started warning Russian users looking for news about Ukraine on its search engine of unreliable information on the internet, after Moscow threatened Russian media over what they publish. 
Authorities on Thursday threatened to block media reports that contain what Moscow described as ""false information"" regarding its military operation in Ukraine, an offensive that has seen Ukrainian forces battle Russian invaders on three sides and missiles pound the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. 
""Some material on the internet may contain inaccurate information. Please be attentive,"" read a message under the Yandex search bar when looking for the latest news about Ukraine. The message was only displayed to users searching in Russian. 
Yandex said the banner message automatically appears on search queries for which there is an abnormal spike in growth or rapid updates in the news. 
""The banner is not linked to any demands,"" Yandex said. 
The company said the banner had first appeared on Thursday evening. 
Earlier on Thursday, Russia's state communications regulator Roskomnadzor said the amount of unverified and unreliable information appearing online had increased significantly, and reminded editors that they must establish whether information is truthful before it is published. 
There was no indication that Roskomnadzor had started blocking reports for Russian users. Earlier this month, the regulator ordered some outlets to remove reports from their websites about corruption allegations aired by jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny.
""They must use information and data received only from official Russian sources,"" Roskomnadzor said of reports about Russia's ""special operation"". Those spreading what it termed ""false information"" could be fined or have their reports blocked. 
'MILITARY CENSORSHIP'
""Roskomnadzor is trying to establish military censorship in Russia,"" said Tikhon Dzyadko, editor in chief of TV Rain (Dozhd), a media outlet that last year fell victim to a crackdown on media outlets that Russia considers ""foreign agents"".
The media regulator has also taken umbrage with U.S. firms in recent days, demanding that Meta Platforms stop restricting Russian media including the RIA news agency and the defence ministry's Zvezda TV channel on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
Roskomnadzor wants Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google to remove restrictions blocking the YouTube channel of Denis Pushilin, leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine that Moscow recognised as independent this week. 

""In connection with regular blocking by Western internet services, Roskomnadzor urges users to create accounts on Russian resources and to use Russian social networks,"" the regulator said. 
Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Investing.com – Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) stock soared 17% in premarket trading Friday after the online marketplace for craft and vintage items easily surpassed sales and profit estimates in the fourth quarter.
Consolidated gross merchandise sales (GMS) were a record $4.2 billion, up over 16%. CEO Josh Silverman attributed this to the company’s business model that connects buyers and small and large sellers of unique and creative goods. GMS is the total value of goods and services sold on an online platform.
“During the holiday season, our sellers — most businesses of one and insulated from widespread supply shortages or complex fulfillment processes — brought the benefits of shopping small to scale,” he said in a statement.
In comparison, extended and complex supply chains have troubled large online platforms like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), particularly last year.
Etsy marketplace acquired around 10 million new buyers in the fourth quarter, while reactivating 6.8 million. Habitual buyers grew 26%. It closed December at 90 million active buyers.
Several holiday records were set on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the company said. GMS per active buyer thus rose 16% on a trailing 12 months basis. Higher spending on marketing drove buyer retention and frequency.
The company is now guiding for GMS of $3.3 billion at midpoint of its guidance range and revenue of $565 million-$590 million in the current quarter.
Etsy said it has optimized Reverb for online searches, resulting in significant increases in Google Search traffic. The company had acquired the musical instrument marketplace in September quarter of 2019.

(Reuters) -The United States, Britain and other Western nations have hit Russia with new sanctions following Russian's invasion of Ukraine on Thursday.
The European Union broadly agreed new measures, details of which were to be discussed by EU foreign ministers at an emergency session on Friday.
Japan said on Friday it would strengthen its sanctions to include financial institutions and military equipment exports, and Australia imposed more curbs.
Below are details on the measures proposed so far and what other sanctions could target Russia: 
BANKS & FINANCIAL FIRMS 
The United States and Britain announced restrictions that, combined with previous sanctions, would in effect kick the vast majority of Russian banking assets out of both countries. New targets included Sberbank and VTB Bank, Russia's two largest lenders. [L1N2UZ2UK]
EU leaders have agreed sanctions targeting 70% of the Russian banking market and important state-owned companies, including in defence. 
Russia's large banks are deeply integrated into the global financial system, meaning sanctions could be felt far beyond its borders. Data from the Bank for International Settlements showed European lenders hold the lion's share of the around $120 billion in foreign banks' exposure to Russia.
According to data from Russia's central bank, total Russian banking foreign assets and liabilities stood at $200.6 billion and $134.5 billion, respectively, with the U.S.-dollar share amounting to around 53% of both, down from 76%-81% two decades ago. 
SOVEREIGN DEBT & CAPITAL MARKETS
Britain announced it would ban Russian sovereign debt sales in London. Russia has issued 4.1 billion pounds of sovereign debt in London since the beginning of 2020.
The coming package of EU measures EU will ""target the ability of the Russian state and government to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services, to limit the financing of escalatory and aggressive policies,"" the bloc said. It will ban EU investors from trading in Russian state bonds. 
Washington announced new restrictions on dealings in Russia sovereign debt on Tuesday. Americans - already barred from investing in Russian sovereign debt directly - will be banned from purchasing it in the secondary market after March 1.
Even before the latest events, access to Russian bonds had become increasingly restricted. 
U.S. sanctions imposed in 2015 made future Russian dollar debt ineligible for many investors and key indexes. In April 2021, Biden barred U.S. investors from buying new Russian rouble bonds over accusations of Russian election meddling. 
The curbs have cut Russia's external debt by 33% since early 2014 - from $733 billion to $489 billion in the third quarter of 2021. 
INDIVIDUALS
The United States, the EU and Britain have already imposed asset freezes, travel bans and other curbs on Russian individuals. 
Britain announced sanctions on more than 100 Russian individuals and entities, including an asset freeze and travel ban on Yelena Georgieva, chair of the board of Novikombank; Pyotr Fradkov, Promsvyazbank chairman; Denis Bortnikov, VTB deputy president; Kirill Shamalov, President Vladimir Putin's former son-in-law; and United Aircraft's Yury Slyusar.
Britain will also introduce legislation to limit deposits that Russian nationals can hold in UK bank accounts. The limit will be 50,000 pounds ($66,860) at British banks.
The United States sanctioned Fradkov and Bortnikov on Tuesday, as well as Vladimir Kiriyenko, the son of a former prime minister. 
On Thursday, Washington targeted others close to Putin, including Sergei Ivanov, CEO of Russian state-owned diamond mining company Alrosa; Andrey Patrushev, who has served in leadership roles at Russian state-owned gas company Gazprom (MCX:GAZP); and Ivan Sechin, reportedly a deputy head of a department at energy company Rosneft. 
Biden said on Thursday he would consider personal sanctions on Putin, a move Moscow has said would not harm the president personally but would prove ""politically destructive"". 
The EU has already imposed sanctions on five people who were involved in a Russian parliamentary election in annexed Crimea last September, and said it would blacklist all lawmakers who voted to recognise two regions controlled by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, freeze any assets they have in the EU and ban them from travelling to the bloc. 
ENERGY CORPORATES & NORD STREAM 2
The United States and the EU already have sanctions in place on Russia's energy and defence sectors, with state-owned gas company Gazprom, its oil arm Gazpromneft and oil producers Lukoil, Rosneft and Surgutneftegaz facing various types of curbs on exports/imports and debt-raising. 
Sanctions could be deepened, with one possible option being to prevent companies settling in U.S. dollars. 
Nord Stream 2, a recently completed pipeline from Russia to Germany, was awaiting regulatory approval by EU and German authorities before Berlin put its certification on ice. 
The U.S. on Wednesday imposed sanctions on the company in charge of building Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
CURBING TECHNOLOGY
The EU has vowed to introduce measures to crimp Russia's technological position in key areas - from high-tech components to cutting-edge software.
The U.S. Commerce Department said on Thursday it was implementing export controls that will severely restrict Russia’s access to semiconductors, computers, telecommunications, information security equipment, lasers, and sensors that it needs to sustain its military capabilities. 
Similar measures were deployed during the Cold War, when sanctions kept the Soviet Union technologically backward and crimped economic growth.
SWITCHING OFF SWIFT
One of the harshest potential measures would be to disconnect the Russian financial system from international payments system SWIFT, used by more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries.

Ukraine wants Russia removed from the system and the move is under discussion as the EU considers sanctions but leaders have been at odds over this.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for Russia’s exclusion from SWIFT, but German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it should not be part of the second EU sanctions package. Biden said on Thursday Washington was not imposing a ban for now.

778,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2022 06:06AM ET</span>",India explores setting up rupee trade accounts with Russia to soften sanctions blow - sources,"By Rajendra Jadhav, Nupur Anand and Aftab Ahmed
MUMBAI (Reuters) - India is exploring ways to set up a rupee payment mechanism for trade with Russia to soften the blow on New Delhi of Western sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, government and banking sources said.
Indian officials are concerned that vital supplies of fertilizer from Russia could be disrupted as sanctions intensify, threatening India's vast farm sector.
India has called for an end to violence in Ukraine but refrained from outright condemnation of Russia, with which it has long-standing political and security ties.
Russia invaded Ukraine by land, air and sea on Thursday in the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two, prompting tens of thousands of people to flee their homes.
Russian forces pressed their advance on Friday and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy pleaded with the international community to do more, saying sanctions announced so far were not enough.
Officials said the plan was to get Russian banks and companies to open accounts with a few state-run banks in India for trade settlement, a banking source involved in the discussions said. 
""This is a proactive move assuming that the conflict escalates and there could be a slew of sanctions in place,"" the source said.
""In this case we would not be able to settle the transaction in dollars and so an arrangement has been proposed to set up a rupee account, which is being considered.""
Funds in such accounts act as a guarantee of payment for trade exchanged between two countries, while the parties barter commodities from each other to offset the sum, the source said.
A similar arrangement, in which part of the settlement with Russia is in foreign currency and rest is through local rupee accounts, was also being explored, said the banking and the government source. 
Such mechanisms are often used by countries to shield themselves from the blow of sanctions and India also used it with Iran after it came under Western sanctions for its nuclear weapons programme, the source said. 
The programme was introduced in 2012 and worked well for several years.
The discussions on Russia were still at an early stage and formal talks had not yet begun between the two sides, an Indian government official said. 
EU leaders agreed on Thursday to impose new economic sanctions on Russia, joining the United States and Britain in trying to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin and his allies for the attack.
The sanctions impede Russia's ability to do business in major currencies and target individual banks and state-owned enterprises.
The finance ministry did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment. None of the sources wanted to be identified as the discussions are private. 
Russia's exports to India stood at $6.9 billion in 2021, mainly mineral oils, fertilisers and rough diamonds, while India exported $3.33 billion worth of goods to Russia in 2021, mainly pharmaceutical products, tea and coffee.

Russia and Belarus usually account for nearly a third of India's total potash imports. It would not be feasible to replace them amid a rally in fertilizer prices to a record high, a senior industry official told Reuters.
New Delhi is also holding a meeting with fertilizer industry officials on Friday to explore ways to secure supplies from Russia and Belarus, said a senior fertilizer industry official, who declined to be identified.

779,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2022 06:06AM ET</span>",U.S. companies grapple with surging costs as supply chain problems persist,"By Timothy Aeppel
(Reuters) - Dave Petratis boosted wages for his U.S. factory workforce in December - six months ahead of schedule for normal annual increases.
It wasn't enough.
The CEO of Allegion (NYSE:ALLE) PLC, a maker of locks and security doors with 10 factories dotted across the country - including a lock factory in the appropriately named town of Security, Colorado - said 'we’ve got our finger on the trigger"" for another pay hike in coming months.
The multiple increases are necessary amid a fight for talent that has become a central feature of the supply chain crisis, Petratis told Reuters.
""When labor becomes a problem in the middle of something like this - it creates a lot of disruption,"" he said, adding that it's not just the companies that supply him with parts like metal castings that can't find enough workers to fill all the orders. ""It's truck drivers, it's people leaving the workforce to retire with heavy experience.""
Surging prices for steel and other raw materials have dogged Allegion and other manufacturers through most of the pandemic, in part because of the stop-and-start nature of the crisis.
After initially shutting down factories and stores, the pandemic sparked demand for goods as home-bound consumers funneled stimulus money into shopping sprees rather than trips and dining out.
But supply snarls continue to hamper producers. Earlier this week, the world's No.4 carmaker Stellantis told investors that raw materials like metals would remain a problem for the industry this year. But the company said the semi-conductor shortage, which cost the company about 20% of its planned production last year, peaked in the third quarter.
A key question for economists now is to what degree inflation coursing through the economy is becoming a circular force, with higher prices at gas pumps and grocery stores fueling demands from workers for higher wages, adding again to pressure for more price hikes. U.S. consumer prices rose at their fastest annual rate in four decades in January.
For now, it remains unclear whether a spiral will be averted, though most Federal Reserve policymakers remain optimistic that inflation will ease as supply chains untangle later this year and into next, although Russia's invasion of Ukraine may complicate the central bank's efforts to rein in inflation this year.
AN INFLATION 'ICEBERG' 
 Cummins Inc  (NYSE:CMI) gave bigger-than-normal wage increases to its factory workers in 2021 to account for heavy inflation pressures, said Jennifer Rumsey, the Columbus, Indiana-based engine maker's president and chief operating officer. But she noted that prices of some commodities like metals have moderated.
""As a business leader, we don't want to see inflation spiral out of control, because that would dampen the economy,"" she said. ""We're not seeing that at this point.""
There are wider signs that bottlenecks and shortages in supply chains will start easing by the end of this year. The Port of Los Angeles just reported its busiest January in its history and the backlog of ships waiting to unload there is declining.
But U.S. ports have a narrow window to clear the existing backlog before another surge of imports begins in the middle of the year - a cycle that occurs as retailers stock up, first for back-to-school sales and then the year-end holidays. The good news is that the big West Coast ports have said they are making steady progress at moving out containers and fewer workers are off the job for illness or quarantines.
The crisis is prompting some businesses to get creative in how they move their products - changes that should make it easier to deal with future setbacks, such as another twist in the pandemic.
Lazaro Escandel, who co-leads the manufacturing practice at accounting and business advisory firm Kaufman Rossin in Miami, said he has one client who has begun using 20-foot shipping containers and smaller vessels, which can access more ports on the U.S. east coast. Traditional 40-foot containers are more cost effective, but there are fewer ports that can handle them.
Changes like that are driving up costs, adding to inflation pressures, said Escandel. Though not everyone is complaining about that.
""We have clients who are moving less product, less pounds, but they're getting more revenue for it,"" said Escandel. ""Some of them like that.""
But inflationary pressures remain a headache for most businesses. Petratis, the Allegion CEO, said he sees an ""iceberg"" of inflation that still needs to move through the economy. And he noted that tight labor markets won't go away once trains and trucks again deliver goods on time. The labor shortage ""will continue to drive inflationary pressure, until disrupted by some type of slowdown or normalizing demand,"" he said.
LONG ROAD TO NORMAL 
Meanwhile, many businesses wonder whether demand will in fact continue to be supercharged once supply chains normalize.
David Foulkes, CEO of Brunswick (NYSE:BC) Corp, a producer of boats and engines, has squeezed as much as possible out of the company's existing factories to meet pandemic-fueled demand. In 2021, the company's engine business produced 108% of the units they had targeted in their planning at the start of the year.
Brunswick's boat business has faced more challenges, but even so ended up making 95% of the units they planned for the year. ""That 5% is totally attributable to supply chain,"" said Foulkes.

Foulkes said Brunswick is ""carefully"" adding capacity to deal with what he sees as a long-term increase in demand. The company added 60% to the capacity of a plant in Reynosa, Mexico, and made a similar expansion to a plant in Portugal that serves the European market, he said. It also reopened a mothballed boat factory in Florida.
With those additions and eventually normalization of supply chains, Foulkes projects inventories will be back to ""healthy levels"" by 2025. ""Unless something significant happens, it'll take two or more likely three years to get inventory levels back to where they should be.""

780,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2022 05:45AM ET</span>",BASF ready to push Wintershall Dea IPO against co-owner's opposition,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -BASF, co-owner of Nord Stream 2 backer Wintershall Dea, said it was prepared to push through an initial public offering of the oil and gas business next year even as markets are roiled by Russia's attack on Ukraine.
The dispute over the IPO timing erupted last month when Wintershall Dea co-investor LetterOne came out opposing the market flotation - which the joint venture partners had already agreed on - for the time being.
""Given the significant strategic relevance of the IPO (of Wintershall Dea) for BASF and our stakeholders, we will use all available means to protect our rights and interests, including legal remedies and the right to unilaterally pursue an IPO in 2023,"" BASF finance chief Hans-Ulrich Engel said in speech on the chemical group's full-year results.
The reaffirmed goal comes after Russia, on which Wintershall Dea relies for nearly half of its oil and gas production, attacked Ukraine in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two, drawing international condemnation.
German chemicals giant BASF on Friday also forecast lower 2022 operating earnings due to slower economic growth, also citing a supply chain that is vulnerable to disruptions.
The company said earnings before interest, tax and special items will likely be between 6.6 billion euros ($7.4 billion) and 7.2 billion euros this year, down from 7.77 billion euros in 2021.
It added any fallout of the Ukraine invasion on its business could currently not be quantified.
Wintershall Dea's operations, however, were for now not affected by new Western government economic sanctions against Russia.
Despite a very strong start to the year, ""BASF expects global economic growth of 3.8% to be somewhat more moderate in 2022 following the very strong recovery in 2021"". Last year, it saw a rebound in industrial demand from initial pandemic woes.
The forecast takes into account the risk of supply chain disruptions, more pandemic headwinds and potentially higher energy prices, BASF said.
Wintershall said on Thursday a ""politically motivated"" cancellation of Gazprom (MCX:GAZP)'s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which Wintershall co-funded, would enable its operator to lodge compensation claims.
Germany has effectively halted a ramp-up in preparations on the pipeline following a first wave of sanctions on Russia, where Wintershall has been active for more than three decades.
BASF holds 67% of the ordinary voting shares in Wintershall, DEA or a total of 72.7% taking into account non-voting preference shares. 
Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman's investment firm LetterOne, which owns the rest, last month said an IPO could lead to excessive dividends as well as an unjust discount on its value because investors were shunning Russia-linked assets.
BASF's group EBIT, adjusted for one-off items, rose more than 10% to 1.23 billion euros in the three months through December, missing a company-compiled estimate of 1.35 billion euros.

The shares fell 4.8% to 58.12 euros for a decline of more than 13% this week, as Stiefel analyst Andreas Heine described the results a ""disappointing outcome across the board"".
The German company proposed an annual dividend of 3.40 euros per share, slightly above expectations of 3.39 euros.

PARIS (Reuters) -Casino shares slumped on Friday after the supermarket group reported a 12% drop in operating profit on lower sales last year and reignited investor concerns over high debts and low cash flows.
The French retailer, which has been selling assets to cut debt, said the pandemic had slowed the pace of its disposal plan and it now aimed to complete the final 1.3 billion euro part of the 4.5 billion euro plan by the end of 2023.
It was confident sales momentum in France would recover this year and vowed to improve cash flow generation while maintaining a ""high level of profitability.""
But the forecasts did little to reassure investors. At 0924 GMT, Casino shares were down 14% at 15.66 euros, at the bottom of France's SBF 120 index <.SBF 20>.
""The underlying cash burn of the French business is and should remain the real concern ... we can't be sure that 2022 will be really easier and that cash-burn will stop in France,"" said Bryan Garnier analyst Clement Genelot.
Jefferies analysts said the desire to improve cash flows would be ""challenged by a tough domestic context of accelerating input pressures."" 
Casino, which ended 2021 with 562 million euros in cash and cash equivalents, said it would not pay a dividend for 2021 in order to prioritise debt reduction.
At end-2021, consolidated net debt stood at 5.9 billion euros, against 4.6 billion a year earlier.
Group operating profit fell 12% to 1.19 billion euros in 2021. That reflected a 14% decline in core profit in France, where same-store sales fell 5.4%, notably due to the impact of the pandemic on the Paris region and on tourist flows. Sales remained robust in Brazil, Casino's No.2 market.
Casino, which controls Brazil's Grupo Pao de Acucar, said total group sales were 30.55 billion euros, down 0.8% on a same-store basis. 
To boost sales growth, Chief Executive Jean-Charles Naouri is banking on an accelerated expansion in convenience stores such as Monoprix, Franprix and Naturalia, targeting the opening of over 800 such stores in 2022, mainly under franchise.
To boost profitability, the group is looking to monetise client data, make savings from purchasing deals - notably with France's Intermarche - and to focus more on e-commerce, organic food, convenience stores and energy services.
Casino has a partnership with online British grocer Ocado (LON:OCDO), which they extended this month to develop e-commerce logistics centres for retailers in France.

Casino's Monoprix supermarket arm has a deal with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Casino also recently sealed a partnership with German quick commerce group Gorillas.

Investing.com – Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) stock plunged 9% in premarket trading Friday after the maker of faux meat posted disappointing numbers for the fourth quarter.
Revenue fell short and net loss more than tripled. Loss was wider than analysts’ expectations, driven by higher costs related to marketing, manufacturing, and wage bill during the pandemic.
The company was an investor darling at the time of its May 2019 public listing but has since run into tough competition, higher costs, and supply chain issues. Consumer acceptance of its plant-based food has been muted after the initial euphoria, mainly due to taste and texture reasons.
Sales to U.S. grocers, convenience stores, and other retailers declined by almost a fifth in the fourth quarter. The company attributed this to softer demand, fewer days this time, increased discounting, and “to a lesser extent, loss of market share.” President and CEO Ethan Brown called it a “temporary disruption.”
U.S. retail sales in the plant-based meat category fell 0.4% last year versus 45% growth in 2020, Reuters quoted Brown as saying.
The company is now expecting revenue to be $560 million-$620 million in 2022, up 21-33%, but less than market expectations. The company the results “could differ materially” if assumptions related to the pandemic do not materialize.

The promise means the employee-owned John Lewis matches prices on like-for-like branded products with national retailers that sell both online and in shops. However, it is not applicable to online-only retailers.
“Never Knowingly Undersold has been a cherished sign of trust for John Lewis for a century but it doesn't fit with how customers shop today as more purchases are made online,"" said executive director Pippa Wicks.

Investing.com – Pearson ADRs (NYSE:PSO) surged 7.4% in premarket trading Friday after the education services provider said it will buy back shares worth 350 million pound ($470 million).
The intention to repurchase shares follows the company achieving its 2021 targets, which indicates the company now has a grip on the business. The company’s textbooks publishing business has been in doldrums for more than six years now, thanks to the booming demand for online education amid the ample supply of discounted offers.
While the pandemic aggravated the distress at its traditional business, the company has also gone about playing the ‘digital first’ game, selling directly to consumers via its Pearson+ app and to businesses looking to train staff.
The company closed December with 2.75 million registered users on its app including 133,000 paid subscriptions. It has now acquired Clutch Prep, an online video-based learning service to fuel Pearson+ with original video tutorials.
Demand for assessment and qualification services grew 19% in the year. Growth in the IT sector led to a 19% growth in professional certification. US student assessment and English language learning rose 17% each, the latter benefiting from the recovery in both international courseware and Pearson Test of English.
The British company reported 2021 adjusted operating profit of 385 million pounds on sales of 3.42 billion pounds. It expects 2022 revenue to be higher.
The company is confident of getting 416 million pounds in adjusted operating profit in 2022, in line with current market expectations. The higher education business will continue being a drag on operations although the revenue decline should slow this year, according to the company.

However, the new measures stopped short of disconnecting Russia from the SWIFT international banking system or targeting its oil and gas exports, moves which could have had severe repercussions on Western economies just as they are recovering from the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Helping Friday’s positive tone was the release of the latest reading of German growth data. This showed the Eurozone’s largest economy shrank less than initially reported at the end of last year, as output declined 0.3% in the fourth quarter, compared with a preliminary reading of -0.7%. 
In the corporate sector, the travel stocks rebounded after Thursday’s strong selloff, with British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) stock up 2.2% as the group expects to return to profit this year. CEO Luis Gallego confirmed the airline is now avoiding Russian airspace and has canceled its flight to Moscow.
German chemicals giant BASF (DE:BASFN) stock down 4.1% after it forecast a decline in 2022 operating earnings as its supply chain remains vulnerable to disruptions.
 Swiss Re  (SIX:SRENH) stock slumped 5.7% after the reinsurer reported a smaller-than-expected full-year profit in 2021, suffering from big claims from natural disasters, while  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) stock fell 4% after the French car parts maker warned its business continued to be impacted by chip shortages.
 Pearson  (LON:PSON) stock soared over 8% after the education group said it would launch a 350 million pound ($470 million) share buyback after hitting 2021 targets.
 Holcim  (SIX:HOLN) stock rose 2.1% after the world's biggest cement maker reported better-than-expected fourth quarter operating profit, expecting growth momentum to continue in all regions this year.
Oil prices climbed Friday with the new sanctions on Russia, levied by the U.S. and Western allies after its invasion of Ukraine, raising fears that global energy supplies will be disrupted.
Although an U.S. official was quoted as saying its measures ""are not targeting and will not target oil and gas flows,"" the sanctions on Russia’s banks and state-owned enterprises are likely to impede the country’s ability to do business in major currencies.
By 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% higher at $94.12 a barrel, while the Brent Oil Futures rose 1.6% to $96.94, after having surged to more than $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014 on Thursday.
Additionally, Gold Futures fell 0.6% to $1,914.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1178."
794,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2022 03:52AM ET</span>","Cutting Russia off SWIFT is ""very last resort"" -France's Le Maire","PARIS (Reuters) -French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Friday the option of cutting off Russia from the SWIFT global interbank payments system remained open, but that he viewed this only as a last resort.
The United States and the European Union opted not to cut Russia off from SWIFT as part of toughened sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine. But they could revisit that issue, U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday.
""This is the very last resort, SWIFT, but this is one of the options that remains on the table,"" Le Maire, speaking in English, told reporters ahead of a meeting in Paris with his counterparts from euro zone countries.
Ahead of the same meeting, Germany's finance minister Christian Lindner said ""all options are on the table"" in addition to those already agreed.
""The first sanctions have been placed on Russia and they harm the Russian people and will block the Russian economy seriously,"" he said.
The finance ministers are likely to discuss the consequences of the conflict and the resultant sanctions for the European economy. Economists say it has the potential both to add to inflationary pressures and to dampen economic growth.
European Central Bank policymakers also met in Paris on Thursday. ECB President Christine Lagarde is due to hold a news conference later on Friday.
The European Union agreed on Thursday to freeze Russian assets in the bloc and halt its banks' access to European financial markets as part of what EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell described as ""the harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented"".
The sanctions will also target Russia's energy and transport sectors among others and seek to stifle its trade and manufacturing with export controls.

Britain on Friday reiterated its call to exclude Russia from SWIFT. There is reluctance in a number of capitals to do that because, while it would hit Russian banks hard, it would make it tough for creditors to get their money back.
Observers have also suggested it could complicate payments to Russia for those countries which import energy from it.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Stellantis' Jeep will launch two new sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) in India this year to boost sales in a market where it has struggled to establish a meaningful presence. 
Jeep will launch the Meridian, a mid-size, three-row SUV, that will be made in India, and the Grand Cherokee, which it will assemble in the country - a move the company expects will allow it to price its vehicles more competitively.
""We need to grow in India, we need to put all the focus in India,"" Christian Meunier, chief executive at Jeep, told reporters in Mumbai. 
Jeep, which has less than a 1% share of India's car market, said last year it would invest $250 million to launch four SUVs in a country where rivals Hyundai Motor and Kia Motor dominate the segment with more affordable vehicles.
Meunier said he was ""not happy with the volumes in India"" but would not reduce the price of vehicles just to increase the company's market share. 
He said he wanted Brazil to be the benchmark for sales in India - Jeep sells 15,000 SUVs a month in the South American country across three models versus less than 1,000 SUVs a month in India where it sells the Compass and Wrangler SUVs.
""We're not investing all this money in India for not getting success. We're not here to lose, we're here to win,"" he said.

While Jeep is working on electrifying its portfolio by 2025, Meunier says it will bring electric vehicles to India only when the country is ready. 
India is pushing automakers to build clean fuel vehicles in an effort to reduce its oil import bill and cut pollution, but sales of electric cars have been slow to take off. This is mainly because of the high price of batteries and inadequate public charging infrastructure.

However, the EU bloc held back from taking the harshest measures sought by Ukraine and split over just how far to take the sanctions, leaving details to be worked out in the coming days.

804,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2022 02:28AM ET</span>",Analysis-Shocks and missteps: how Sri Lanka's economy ended in crisis,"By Uditha Jayasinghe and Devjyot Ghoshal
COLOMBO (Reuters) - In late November 2019, after winning Sri Lanka's presidential election and months ahead of a parliamentary ballot that would again test his popularity, Gotabaya Rajapaksa gathered his cabinet and made good on a campaign promise to slash taxes.
    The move, which included a near-halving of value added tax, blindsided some top central bank executives.
""The tax cuts just after the elections came as a surprise,"" P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka's (CBSL) Senior Deputy Governor until September 2020, recalled.
    ""There was not any kind of a consultative process,"" added Weerasinghe, who spent 29 years at the CBSL before retiring.
    The economic argument for the cuts was simple - to free up spending and boost Sri Lanka's ailing finances.
A similar move by an administration led by Gotabaya's older brother Mahinda had helped drive the country's economic recovery after a decades-long civil war ended in 2009, a ruling party member close to the Rajapaksas said.
""That is why they made this promise ... Then, the pandemic came,"" said Milinda Rajapaksha.
    The case against was that reducing potential revenues when obligations were high was risky and undermined a 2019 debt management plan that hinged on a narrowing fiscal deficit.
""That was a mistake,"" W.D. Lakshman, the CBSL's governor between December 2019 and September 2021, said of the cuts, in his first interview since leaving office.
    Not long after the move, the pandemic struck, crippling an economy heavily reliant on tourism.
While the hit to Sri Lanka's coffers was all but inevitable, three former CBSL officials and some analysts said policies before COVID-19 struck and since have exacerbated the problems, leaving the country in a vulnerable financial position.
The government did not respond to a request for comment on the state of the economy and whether policy errors were made.
The CBSL said in a statement that the economy was in better shape than some reports suggested, with the key tourism industry already showing signs of revival and the stock market performing ""reasonably well"".
Yet foreign exchange reserves have shrunk almost 70% in two years to $2.36 billion, short of $4 billion or so in debt repayments due in 2022.
Inflation has surged, key imports have been held up at Colombo port due to the lack of cash and the conflict in Ukraine has pushed energy bills higher. There is only enough fuel for a few days; national power cuts have begun.
'NEVER DAUNTED'
At a time when Sri Lanka badly needed access to international capital markets to keep its debt management programme on track, a series of downgrades by rating agencies in the wake of the pandemic in 2020 effectively locked it out.
In the past when times were tough, Sri Lanka has turned to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for help.
But potential discussions with the IMF on restructuring Sri Lanka's foreign debt were effectively shot down by the government and CBSL leadership as early as April 2020, Lakshman said, including by himself as governor.
With the IMF out of play, the government still could have moved towards fiscal consolidation and provided a credible recovery plan, Weerasinghe said, adding that it failed to do so.
""What was presented and in the 2021 budget was completely not consistent with what would have been accepted by international investors or international creditors,"" he said.
The budget banked on a strong rebound in economic growth of around 5.5% in 2021, which failed to materialise in part due to the Delta variant that led to island-wide lockdowns.
Sri Lanka overshot its fiscal deficit target by more than two percentage points in 2021, and the trade deficit widened to $8.1 billion in December 2021 from $6 billion a year before.
Foreign workers' remittances slumped 22.7% to $5.5 billion in 2021.
The government, led by Rajapaksa and his brothers, has raised swaps and credit lines worth $1.9 billion from India, and two more are under negotiation with Pakistan and Australia.
Sri Lanka also received a $1.5 billion Yuan swap in December and the last tranche of a $1.3 billion syndicated loan from China arrived in September 2021.
Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa - brother of the president and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa - has struck a bullish tone since taking up the post last July.
""The Rajapaksas have a history of never being daunted by challenges,"" he said last November in his first budget speech. The plan envisages a budget deficit of around 8.8% of GDP and raising some taxes.
The CBSL said in its statement that it was committed to meeting all debt obligations and that suggestions Sri Lanka was close to default were wrong.
""The Sri Lankan authorities are pursuing a carefully thought-out plan which will ensure Sri Lanka's debt sustainability and economic revival.""
FEARS OF DEFAULT
Some analysts and opposition politicians, however, fear Sri Lanka may default this year if it does not restructure its debt in the coming months.
""This prevarication, and somehow imagining there is another solution, I think, is a delay that the country can ill afford,"" said Nishan de Mel, Executive Director of the Verité Research think-tank, adding that the 2022 budget did not go far enough.
""Muddling along is the path to failure. Restructuring is the path to success.""
Sri Lanka's 10-year bond yield stood at 13% on Wednesday, compared with 8.13% on Feb. 23 last year.
Some opposition politicians and economists have urged the government to seek assistance from the IMF and other lenders, a move they say would help it tap capital markets again and ease the debt crunch.
IMF loans are likely to come with conditions, however, including austerity measures potentially unpopular with the population of 22 million to try to balance the books.
Basil Rajapaksa wants to focus on getting the domestic economy up and running again before contemplating loan programmes, aide Milinda Rajapaksha told Reuters this month, and the CBSL said there was no need for an IMF programme.
Masahiro Nozaki, IMF mission chief for Sri Lanka, told Reuters that the body had not received a recent request for financial support from Sri Lanka, but stood ready to discuss options.

In a further challenge, soaring oil prices on any war in Ukraine would ""really hurt"" Sri Lanka, cabinet spokesman and Plantation Minister Ramesh Pathirana warned on Tuesday. 
The Russian invasion has begun and on Thursday crude prices peaked at $105 a barrel for the first time since 2014.

Ukraine closed its airspace as Russian forces attacked in the early hours, leaving budget airline Wizz Air trying to evacuate its Ukrainian-based crew, their families and four planes stuck in Kyiv and Lviv.
Many companies with exposure to Russia are waiting for more clarity on Western sanctions and assessing the impact of those already announced.
Washington on Thursday announced a wave of measures that impede Russia's ability to do business in major currencies along with sanctions against banks and state-owned enterprises. It has imposed sanctions on the company behind the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline while European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said Brussels would block Russian access to key technologies and markets.
Denmark's Carlsberg, which has a 31% share of Ukraine's beer market, suspended production at all three of its breweries in the country, while Coca-Cola HBC said it had triggered contingency plans which included shutting its bottling plant.
Japan Tobacco shut a cigarette plant in Kremenchuck, central Ukraine.
Japanese auto supplier Sumitomo Electric Industries, which employs some 6,000 people in Ukraine to make wire harnesses, said it suspended operations at its factories there from Friday. A spokesperson told Reuters the company was talking to clients about potentially substituting supplies from other places.
Global shipping giant Maersk halted port calls in Ukraine until the end of February and closed its main office in Odessa on the Black Sea coast while Danish freight forwarder DSV said it had shut its operations in the country.
Europe's aviation regulator expanded a safety warning triggered by the attack, advising airlines to ""exercise caution"" when flying through parts of Russian airspace controlled by regional centres in Moscow and Rostov.
TITANIUM AND NEON
Shares in German utility Uniper, which has significant interests in Russia and a $1 billion exposure to the recently suspended Nord Stream 2 project, plunged on Thursday and its controlling shareholder, Finland's Fortum, also took a knock.
Fortum said the two companies together owned 12 power plants in Russia and employed 7,000 people there but because energy production had not been sanctioned, their operations had not been directly hit.
Another of Nord Stream 2's financial backers, Wintershall Dea, said the fact that project's suspension was on political grounds meant its operator could seek compensation.
Shares in German chemical company BASF, which co-owns Wintershall with Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman's LetterOne investor group, and other Nord Stream 2 backers OMV and Engie were also hit. 
Britain's biggest domestic bank, Lloyds (LON:LLOY), warned it was on heightened alert for cyberattacks from Russia while some companies said supplies of key raw materials could suffer.
Jet engine makers Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) and  Safran  (PA:SAF) said on Thursday they had been ramping up supplies of titanium. The use of titanium, much of it supplied by Russia, has soared in recent years as planemakers try to make jets lighter.
""We have been watching this situation for several weeks and have decided since the start of the year to increase our stocks of titanium especially through distributors in Germany,"" Safran Chief Executive Olivier Andries told reporters.
The French company is also looking to diversify its sources of the metal, as is Britain's Rolls-Royce, which said 20% of its titanium came from Russia.

Large chip companies said they expect limited supply chain disruption from the conflict for now thanks to stockpiling and diversified procurement, but some industry sources said there could be an impact longer term.
Ukraine supplies more than 90% of U.S. semiconductor-grade neon, critical for lasers used in chipmaking.

Analysts on average had expected revenue of 246.37 billion yuan, according to Refinitiv data.
Customer management revenue, a key metric which tracks how much money merchants spend on ads and promotions on Alibaba's sites, fell 1% year-on-year.
That marks the first time revenue for the segment, which made up 41% of Alibaba's total revenue, has decreased since the company's IPO.
Speaking on an investor call, deputy CFO Toby Xu said the drop was caused in part by lowering merchant fees amid the slowing economy.
During China's annual Singles' Day promotional event last November, the company recorded gross merchandise value growth of 8.5%, a record low.
Alibaba's shares were down about 3% in New York before the opening bell. They fell about 7% after the results were announced, tracking losses in global shares after Russia launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine.
Alibaba is also facing intensifying pressure from rivals like ByteDance-owned Douyin and Kuaishou, which have capitalized on the booming trend of livestreaming e-commerce.
""Merchants now have to allocate their advertising dollars to different platforms,"" said Vinci Zhang, who tracks China's e-commerce sector at research firm Pacific Epoch.
""In the past, if you were an apparel merchant, maybe you would allocate 100% to Alibaba, but now a percentage of that goes to the short video players.""
Ant Group, Alibaba's fintech affiliate, reported a profit of about 17.6 billion yuan for the quarter ended September, according to Alibaba's filings on Thursday, compared with 15 billion yuan a year ago. 
Alibaba reports its profit from Ant one quarter in arrears.
Ant has been subjected to a sweeping restructuring by China, which derailed its $37 billion initial public offering in late 2020. 
For the nine months ending in December, the company purchased roughly $7.7 billion worth of shares.
Fiscal third quarter revenue for the company's cloud business grew 20% year-on-year to hit 19.5 billion yuan ($3.08 billion), but adjusted core earnings (EBITDA) for the unit declined 66% sequentially from the previous quarter.
""It seems like Alibaba is finding it difficult to maintain the growth trajectory in most markets including the cloud business,"" said Oshadhi Kumarasiri, an analyst at Lightstream Research
Quarterly net income attributable to shareholders slumped to 20.43 billion yuan from 79.43 billion a year earlier.
Once Asia's biggest listed company, Alibaba has long given up its crown to Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC, and even fallen behind local rival Tencent and beverage maker Kweichow Moutai. 
The company's U.S.-listed shares have lost roughly half their value in the past 12 months amid Beijing's regulatory crackdown on certain industries.

U.S. President Joe Biden hit Moscow with a wave of sanctions on Thursday after Russia invaded Ukraine, measures that impede Russia's ability to do business in major currencies.
Guizhou Chanhen Chemical Corp, for example, told an investor relations platform on Thursday that its business in Ukraine and Russia is small, so there's almost no impact.
Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Reclamation and Development Co, which announced earlier it would invest 33 million yuan ($5.22 million) to set up a subsidiary in Ukraine, told the China Securities Journal that the plan has been on hold due to political instability.
Early this month, China and Russia declared a ""no limits"" partnership, vowing to collaborate more against the West. But despite closer ties driven by geopolitics, economic and financial integration between the two neighbours is limited. 
""My impression is that the Chinese investor community looks at Russia as a pretty risky and hard destination to invest ... a lot of corruption risks, a lot of regulation, volatility, and sanction risk,"" said Alexander Gabuev, senior fellow and chair of the Russia in the Asia-Pacific Program at the Carnegie Moscow Center.
Most Chinese investments in Russia are by state-owned firms, and centred around energy, he added. 
Sanchuan Wisdom Technology Co, a Chinese maker of water meters, told investors that it has limited export business with Russia through a subsidiary, while Medical System Biotechnology Co said its Ukraine business accounted for a small portion of its revenue. 
Some companies even hint they could benefit from the geopolitical tensions. 
Beijing Highlander Digital Technology Co, which makes marine electronic technology systems, said its product can monitor maritime activities at times of war, ""so as to avoid the situation during the Russia-Ukraine conflict, where the seaport city of Odessa was quickly overwhelmed.""

Shenzhen Forms Syntron Information Co, in response to an investor's question about the impact of financial sanctions against Russia, said that it was exploring the use of China's digital yuan in cross-border transactions.

The congressional committee is attempting to determine who may have organized or coordinated the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, the day Congress gathered to certify that Joe Biden defeated the incumbent Trump in the November 2020 presidential election.
Stone says in his lawsuit he played no role in the riot of Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol building in an attempt to overturn the election results and reinstate Trump, and that the committee's actions constitute an invasion of privacy.
""The data sought is not pertinent to the investigation and sweeps up privileged communications,"" the suit alleges.
The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and names lawmakers who have been leading the investigation including Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, Jamie Raskin and the two Republicans on the committee, Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger.
It also names AT&T (NYSE:T) Mobility Inc., the telecommunications company that the committee has asked to provide the data.

Stone, a longtime ally of Trump and a self-proclaimed ""dirty trickster"" in political matters going back decades, was convicted of lying to Congress during its previous investigation into Russia's support of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. But Trump first commuted his sentence and later pardoned Stone, clearing him of criminal liability.
Representatives of the committee could not be reached for comment. The New York Times reported that a spokeswoman for the committee declined to comment on the suit.

814,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 09:45PM ET</span>",Biden hits Russia with new sanctions for 'premeditated' Ukraine attack,"By Steve Holland, Jeff Mason and Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden hit Russia with a wave of sanctions on Thursday after Moscow invaded Ukraine, measures that impede Russia's ability to do business in major currencies along with sanctions against banks and state-owned enterprises.
Biden described Russian President Vladimir Putin as an aggressor with a ""sinister vision of the world"" and a misguided dream of recreating the Soviet Union. 
But he held back from imposing sanctions on Putin himself and from disconnecting Russia from the SWIFT international banking system, amid differences with Western allies over how far to go at this juncture and criticism from Republicans that he should have done more. 
Ukrainian forces battled Russian invaders on three sides on Thursday, prompting tens of thousands of people to flee their homes.
""This is a premeditated attack,"" Biden told reporters at the White House. ""Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences.""
Biden said the sanctions were designed to have a long-term impact on Russia and to minimize the impact on the United States and its allies. And he said Washington was prepared to do more.
The sanctions are aimed at limiting Russia's ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen. Among the targets were five major banks, including state-backed Sberbank and VTB, as well as members of the Russian elite and their families. Sberbank, Russia's largest lender, will no longer be able to transfer money with the assistance of U.S. banks.
The White House also announced export restrictions aimed at curbing Russia's access to everything from commercial electronics and computers to semiconductors and aircraft parts.
'DANGEROUS MOMENT' 
Biden said NATO would meet on Friday to map out further measures and reiterated that the United States would not engage in war with Russia. But he said the United States would meet its Article 5 commitments, in which NATO members agree an armed attack against one of them in Europe or North America will be considered an attack against them all. Since Ukraine is not a NATO member, those protections do not apply.
Biden said this was ""a dangerous moment for all of Europe,"" and that he had authorized troops that had been placed on standby to deploy to Germany. He declined to comment on whether he would urge China to join the West's drive to isolate Russia. 
U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said the world was watching how Washington responds. 
He said Congress would support ""truly devastating sanctions"" against the Kremlin, but he said Biden should have imposed tough sanctions early enough to deter an invasion and weaken Russia. 
""Sadly, deterrence after the fact is not deterrence at all,"" McConnell said in a statement. 
Biden met with his counterparts from the Group of Seven allies and his National Security Council on Thursday, after speaking with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy late on Wednesday.
His announcement represented the second major tranche of sanctions against Russia since Putin earlier this week declared two breakaway regions of Ukraine independent and sent troops there. 
The United States had warned it would initiate waves of sanctions against Moscow if it further invaded Ukraine, and Russia's full-on military assault launched on Thursday led to the latest round of Western penalties. 
White House press secretary Jen Psaki later told reporters the Biden administration believes Putin has ""grander ambitions than Ukraine"" without offering further details.
On Wednesday Washington imposed sanctions on the company in charge of building Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, and on Tuesday it sanctioned two large Russian financial institutions and Russian sovereign debt along with some members of the Russian elite and their family members.
The moves are aimed at pushing up inflation and interest rates in Russia, lowering purchasing power, investment, growth and living standards, White House economic adviser Daleep Singh told reporters on Thursday. 
Biden has become the face of the Western response to Russian aggression at a time when he is battling low poll numbers at home, rising inflation that could be exacerbated by the Ukraine conflict, and looming midterm elections that could hand control of the Senate and House of Representatives from his fellow Democrats to Republicans.
Officials said he briefed leaders in the U.S. Congress about the Ukraine crisis during a secure call on Thursday.

The White House has warned Americans that the conflict could lead to higher fuel prices in the United States, though it is taking measures to help soften that blow. U.S. officials have been working with counterparts in other countries on a combined release of additional oil from global strategic crude reserves, two sources said on Thursday.
Biden warned oil and gas companies not to ""exploit"" this moment to raise prices.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Friday morning, while U.S. equity futures wavered. However, investors continue to calculate the economic and monetary-policy impact of Thursday’s Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Western sanctions on Russia that followed.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 climbed 1.56% by 9:08 PM ET (2:08 AM GMT). Data released earlier in the day showed that the Tokyo core consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.5% year-on-year in February 2022. The Tokyo CPI grew 1% year-on-year, while the CPI Tokyo Ex Food and Energy index grew 0.2% month-on-month.
South Korea’s KOSPI rose 1.04% and in Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.38%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.35%.
China’s Shanghai Composite rose 1.28% and the Shenzhen Component rose 1.18%.
U.S. shares fell after Thursday’s volatile session that saw the S&P 500 gain 1.5% and the Nasdaq 100 briefly fall into a bear market before climbing 3.4%. U.S. Treasuries were mixed, with the benchmark 10-year yield moving upward. In Asia Pacific, bonds in Australia and New Zealand fell.
U.S. President Joe Biden swiftly slapped stiffer penalties on Russia after the latter’s forces moved towards the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv. The measures include sanctions against five major Russian banks to block their access to foreign currency.
With Russia and Ukraine both major grain exporters, investors are weighing the potential impact of the invasion. These include possible inflation and the impact of Western sanctions. With almost $200 billion in stock-market value, and roughly a third of the sovereign debt’s value wiped out in Russia, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (Bank of Russia) took emergency action.
Biden’s announcement leaves markets “looking at some additional sanctions being added but certainly not as bad as it possibly could have been,”  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT). macro strategist Emily Weis told Bloomberg. That contributed to the Wall Street “risk rally,” she added.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to hike interest rates in March 2022 despite the uncertain situation in Ukraine. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said that “barring an unexpected turn in the economy, I believe it will be appropriate to move the funds rate up in March and follow with further increases in the coming months.”
Although expectations of central bank interest rate hikes have slightly decreased, the Fed is widely expected to implement around six hikes. Across the Atlantic, the European Central Bank said the repercussions of the Russian invasion of Ukraine could delay, but not stop, asset tapering in 2022.
“How is the Fed going to react to this geopolitical risk?” Optimal Capital Advisors director of strategy Frances Stacy told Bloomberg. “That’s where we’re seeing spikes, where we start to try and reprice speculation around that.”
U.S. data, including durable goods, the PCE price index (PCE deflator), and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment, is due later in the day."

""CalSTRS will follow any relevant financial sanctions levied by the United States Government,"" a spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
CalSTRS had exposure to nine Russian local sovereign bonds, so-called OFZs, with a market value of nearly $32 million as of June, according to its website.
Its holdings of Russian roubles had a market value of about $1.5 million at that time.
Earlier this week, before Russia's invasion, U.S. President Joe Biden had broadened restrictions on trading of Russian government debt and on Thursday he unveiled new sanctions aimed at limiting Russia's ability to access global financial markets.
Canada's second-biggest pension fund, Caisse de depot, said on Thursday it had sold positions in Russia.

A spokesperson for the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), which manages the largest U.S. public pension fund, said late on Thursday that the fund had around $900 million of exposure to Russia but no Russian debt.
The spokesperson did not elaborate on the breakdown of the Russian assets and declined to comment on potential plans to trim those allocations.

According to the report, the investigation began last year after Kimbal sold shares of the electric carmaker valued at $108 million, a day before Musk polled Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) users asking whether he should offload 10% of his stake in Tesla.
Kimbal Musk did not know about the Twitter poll ahead of it, Elon Musk told the Financial Times in an email, adding that his lawyers were ""aware"" of the poll.
An earlier settlement with the SEC required his public statements about the company's finances and other topics to be vetted by its legal counsel.
The SEC issued a subpoena on Nov. 16, ten days after Musk's poll, seeking information related to some financial data.
The potential probe would escalate Musk's battle with regulators as they scrutinize his social media posts and Tesla's treatment of workers, including accusations of discrimination.
Last week, Musk accused the SEC of harassing him and Tesla with an ""endless"" and ""unrelenting"" investigation to punish him for being an outspoken critic of the government.
Elon Musk's share sales in November were automatically executed according to a trading plan he had created on Sept. 14, showed a filing disclosing share sales, including stock options that were supposed to expire in 2022.

Tesla's stock has fallen about 33% since Musk began selling billions of dollars worth of shares on Nov. 8, few days after the poll where 58% of voters asked him to sell.
Tesla and Kimbal Musk did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. A spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment.

(Reuters) - General Motors (NYSE:GM) aims to turbocharge its non-vehicle revenue by introducing dozens of new fee-based digital features by 2026, including one enabling a car to predict when it will need maintenance, a top executive said on Thursday.
""We have 50-some value-added products and services that we'll be rolling out over the next 36 to 48 months,"" Steve Carlisle, president of GM North America, said at an investor conference.
Carlysle said GM's OnStar unit, which now offers insurance in addition to concierge services to drivers, generates about $32 a month per customer, and its enhanced Super Cruise driver assist feature will further bolster that.
The new digital products, including in-vehicle subscriptions, will be supported by GM's Ultifi software and connectivity platform. Ultifi also will enable over-the-air software updates, and help drivers and passengers with tasks such as online shopping. 
Carlysle said some of the digital features are designed to take advantage of larger displays that GM is installing on the GMC Hummer EV, Chevrolet Silverado EV, Cadillac Lyriq and other future electric vehicles.
""The bigger screens on our EVs will enable us to bring more of the data-oriented software products to the customers,"" he said.

He also said GM is considering flexible pricing options for a number of those digital features, including monthly, annual and lifetime subscriptions.
The introduction of more data-driven services and products is part of CEO Mary Barra's plan, announced last October, to double GM's annual revenue to around $280 billion by 2030.

(Reuters) -A group of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) workers seeking to form a union in New York filed a charge with U.S. labor regulators on Thursday after a high-profile organizer and a pair of employees were arrested outside a company warehouse, according to documents obtained by Reuters.
Amazon organizer Christian Smalls told Reuters on Wednesday he was arrested when he delivered warehouse workers food as part of the union campaign he is leading.
His quest to make Amazon's JFK8 Staten Island warehouse a unionized facility will come to a head when workers vote starting March 25. The unfair labor practice charge filed on Thursday by a group of workers known as the Amazon Labor Union claims Amazon violated a settlement reached with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in December. 
As part of the settlement, Amazon pledged not to limit workers’ ability to engage with their colleagues in non-work areas during non-work time. 
“Amazon.com Services has violated the National Settlement agreement,” the Amazon Labor Union stated in the charge. “Accordingly, we request an expedited investigation and immediate … relief in light of the upcoming election.” 
In the charge, Amazon Labor Union alleges Amazon had employees Brett Daniels and Jason Anthony arrested on Wednesday in retaliation for their involvement with the union. Smalls previously worked at the warehouse and was fired in 2020 for allegedly violating company safety policies. 
Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said ""the settlement pertains to the rights of employees to solicit on (the company’s) property, and we did nothing to stop employees from soliciting."" Amazon called the police on Smalls, and not the other two workers, Nantel said.
""Mr. Smalls - who is not employed by Amazon - has repeatedly trespassed despite multiple warnings. Yesterday, when police officers asked Mr. Smalls to leave, he instead chose to escalate the situation and the police made their own decision on how to respond,"" Nantel said.

A second closely watched election is occurring at Amazon's Bessemer, Alabama warehouse, with vote-by-mail being accepted until March 25 and the vote count starting March 28.
Earlier this week, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) accusing Amazon of unlawfully interfering in the election.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Brazilian miner Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) on Thursday said it maintained ""positive"" expectations for the price of iron ore and nickel in the long term, two of its key products, after reporting quarterly earnings that beat analyst expectations. 
""Our outlook for iron ore remains positive, given the recovery of the global economy,"" Vale said after iron ore prices plunged in late November, hit by over-supply concerns and weaker steel demand. They have since recouped some of those losses. 
The company, once the world's top producer of the steel ingredient, said its fourth-quarter net profit nearly doubled to $5.4 billion. The growth was mainly due to the impact of a reclassification of cumulative foreign exchange gains, the company said. 
The financial gains were partially offset by higher expenses related to the Brumadinho dam disaster, such as an additional provision of $1.7 billion related to upstream dams.
Vale's earnings sustained an impact from last year's iron ore price drop, but nickel has been on the rise for the past few years and the miner is betting that demand for the metal used in electric vehicles will continue to grow. 
""This growth will favour high nickel-content batteries chemistry due to its higher energy density,"" the miner said. ""The North American supply chain is particularly dependent on this market dynamic.""
The company also said it expects a ""slight surplus"" in copper supply in the short term. 
Vale reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) of $6.96 billion, down 24% from the same quarter of 2020 and also below the $7.10 billion reported in the previous quarter.

That reflects a lower realisation price for iron ore, its main product, the company said. In the quarter, Vale realised $106.8 per tonne of iron ore fines, down from the $126.7 reported in the third quarter. 
In a separate filing also on Thursday, Vale announced the distribution of dividends to shareholders of 3.7018 reais per share, which would be equivalent to $3.5 billion, to be paid on March 16.

PARIS (Reuters) -French jet engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) said on Thursday it had enough titanium reserves for several months after increasing stocks of the metal since the start of the year as Western aerospace companies brace for fallout from the Ukraine crisis.
Safran, which uses titanium to make landing gear for long-haul jetliners as well as some aero engine parts, depends on Russia for less than half its requirements, although Russia's VSMPO-AVISMA corporation remains its largest single supplier.
""We have been watching this situation for several weeks and have decided since the start of the year to increase our stocks of titanium especially through distributors in Germany,"" Chief Executive Olivier Andries told reporters.
The French company - which together with  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) co-owns the world's largest jet engine manufacturer by units sold, CFM International - is also looking to diversify its sources of the metal.
Separately, Boston-based General Electric said it is not concerned about titanium supplies as its current inventory levels are comfortable. The company is also counting on a diversified supply base to address any shortfall. 
""We have a lot of diversity in our sourcing across metals, including titanium,"" a GE spokesperson said.
British engine maker Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) said it was ramping up titanium supplies from outside Russia.
Western aerospace companies that rely heavily on long-term supply contracts with VSMPO-AVISMA have been increasing buffer stocks in case the metal is thrust into a potential trade war between Russia and the West, experts have said.
STRATEGIC SUPPLIER 
Industry dependence on Russian supplies of the lightweight but strong metal adds a new strategic dimension to problems already clogging the global supply chain in the wake of the pandemic.
Safran's boss spelled out the security implications of its decision to buy French supplier Aubert & Duval from mining firm Eramet, in a joint move with Airbus and investment firm Tikehau Ace Capital this week.
The superalloys group is the only Western supplier outside the United States capable of ""elaborating"" or developing new alloys needed to operate at ever-higher temperatures in an engine for a future Franco-German-led fighter, Andries said.
""For us it was fundamental to preserve these capabilities,"" he said.
A&D also represents an alternative source of metal forgings which are currently in short supply. Output of the parts is dominated by companies in the United States where Andries said the aerospace industry's supply chain pressures are ""most acute"".

The A&D purchase does not mean Safran is shifting its overall strategy towards greater vertical integration in which manufacturers buy their own suppliers, but Safran stands ready to step in when strategic interests are at stake, Andries added.
Announcing 2021 results earlier, Safran said it did not exclude further bolt-on acquisitions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended sharply higher on Thursday, led by a 3% gain in the Nasdaq, in a dramatic market reversal as U.S. President Joe Biden unveiled harsh new sanctions against Russia after Moscow began an all-out invasion of Ukraine.
The S&P 500 rose more than 1%, ending a four-day slide amid worries over the escalating crisis. The Dow also ended in positive territory.
After consulting counterparts from the Group of Seven nations, Biden announced measures to impede Russia's ability to do business in the world's major currencies, along with sanctions against banks and state-owned enterprises.
The White House has warned Americans that the conflict could lead to higher fuel prices in the United States, but U.S. officials have been working with counterparts in other countries on a combined release of additional oil from global strategic crude reserves.
All three major indexes sold off early in the day on news of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the Nasdaq down more than 3% at the open. They hit session highs in the wake of Biden's comments and rallied heading into the close.
""The tough stand the U.S. and Europe is taking is sending a loud message to the financial markets that they're going to try to cripple as much as they can the Russian economy,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. 
""From one perspective that's positive,"" he said, adding that the selling in the market may not be over. ""Going forward, we're still subject to probably higher oil prices, probably higher commodity prices.""
Investors have been worried about how increasing inflation will affect the outlook for the Federal Reserve and higher interest rates.
Ukrainian forces battled Russian invaders on three sides on Thursday after Moscow mounted an assault by land, sea and air in the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.
The information technology sector rose 3.5% and gave the S&P 500 its biggest boost, in a reversal from recent action.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 92.07 points, or 0.28%, to 33,223.83, the S&P 500 gained 63.2 points, or 1.50%, to 4,288.7 and the Nasdaq Composite added 436.10 points, or 3.34%, to 13,473.59.
Early in the session, the Nasdaq was down more than 20% from its November closing record high. If it had closed at that level, it would have confirmed it was in a bear market. 
""Tech had the most technical damage, so it's good to see tech pick up the pieces,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner of Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia. 
The S&P 500 earlier this week confirmed that it was in a correction. A correction is confirmed when an index closes 10% or more below its record closing level.
The CBOE Volatility index, known as Wall Street's fear gauge, ended lower on the day.
""You had a lot of the uncertainty priced in to the market,"" said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services in Atlanta.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.14-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.53-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 2 new 52-week highs and 64 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 19 new highs and 974 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 17.52 billion shares, compared with the 12.1 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

The deal for ADESA's U.S. unit announced on Thursday gives Carvana access to a business that brought in over $800 million in revenue last year and has 56 physical sites. 
Carvana posted strong sales early on in the pandemic as a thin supply of new cars drove up prices of used vehicles, but its growth has slowed in the past few quarters.
It said on Thursday that revenue jumped 105% in the fourth quarter to $3.75 billion, compared with a 125% rise in the previous three months. 
""Carvana and ADESA U.S.'s footprints are highly complementary and combining them extends the collective reach of the two businesses,"" the used-car seller said.
It added that when fully utilized, ADESA's reconditioning operations can add about 2 million units to its annual production.
KAR Global's shares were 76% higher in extended trading, while Carvana fell 4%.

About half of U.S. consumers are preferring used vehicles as the global semiconductor shortage and other supply chain issues make new vehicles more expensive and harder to get, according to industry research firm Supplyframe. 
Citi and J.P. Morgan Securities served as Carvana's financial advisors, while Kirkland & Ellis LLP was its legal advisor.

The disclosure in a regulatory filing follows reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is probing whether financial executives may have broken rules by tipping off hedge funds ahead of large sales of shares, known as ""block trades"".
The SEC is investigating Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), along with the U.S. Department of Justice, Reuters reported last week, citing a source with knowledge of the matter.
The bank said on Thursday that since June 2019, it has been responding to requests for information from the SEC related to the investigation of various aspects of the its block trading business.
Morgan Stanley also said since August last year it has been responding to requests for information from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York in connection with its investigation.

Broker-dealers frequently buy and sell blocks of shares, either on behalf of clients or as part of a hedging strategy, which are large enough to move a company's share price.
Block trading tends to increase during times of volatility, as institutional investors rebalance their portfolios.

828,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 06:51PM ET</span>",U.S. hits major Russian banks with sanctions over invasion of Ukraine,"By Daphne Psaledakis, Simon Lewis and Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on Russia in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine, targeting its two biggest banks and members of the elite in new measures as Washington warned more action could come. 
Among the targets were five major Russian banks, including state-backed Sberbank and VTB, the country's two largest lenders, as well as wealthy individuals and their families. The United States also announced new export control measures. 
Washington imposed the new sanctions after Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Thursday, assaulting by land, sea and air in the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two.
The U.S. Treasury Department said U.S. banks must sever their correspondent banking ties - which allow banks to make payments between one another and move money around the globe - with Russia's largest lender, Sberbank, and 25 of its subsidiaries within 30 days.
The restrictions aim to hurt the Russian economy by blocking Sberbank from processing and settling payments within the U.S. financial system. 
But Washington stopped short of wielding the U.S. government's most powerful sanctioning tool against the bank and did not add it to the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, which would freeze any of its U.S. assets.
But a senior U.S. administration official warned that the United States could further tighten sanctions against Russia if it escalates its aggression against Ukraine.
""We still have all options on the table. We have room to further escalate as Russia's aggression escalates,"" the official said.
Sberbank said it was operating normally but was studying the implications of sanctions imposed against it.
Reuters first reported correspondent banking restrictions were part of the U.S. sanctions package on Sunday.
Daniel Alter, a former general counsel at New York's Department of Financial Services, said: ""The power of the sanction comes from the fact that most of the world trade at some point is conducted in dollars.""
Washington also added Russia's second-largest bank, VTB, as well as three others - Otkritie, Novikombank and Sovcombank - to SDN list.
The move effectively kicks the banks out of the U.S. financial system, bans their trade with Americans and freezes their U.S. assets.
Every day Russian banks conduct about $46 billion worth of foreign exchange transactions globally, 80% of which are in U.S. dollars, the Treasury said, adding that ""the vast majority of those transactions will now be disrupted."" The Treasury authorized certain transactions related to energy.
VTB said the imposition of Western sanctions on its operations would limit the use of its cards outside Russia.
The other banks did not immediately reply to requests for comment. The Russian embassy in the United States also did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
RUSSIAN ELITES
The Treasury said it was also imposing sanctions on what it called ""Russian elites."" 
These included Alexander Vedyakhin, First Deputy Chairman of the Executive Board of Sberbank; Andrey Puchkov and Yuriy Soloviev, high-ranking VTB Bank executives; and Igor Sechin, chief executive officer of oil giant Rosneft and a former deputy prime minister, and his son, deputy head of a department at Rosneft. 
After the U.S. government on Tuesday announced it would broaden restrictions on trading of Russian sovereign debt, Washington on Thursday expanded the scope of existing curbs on U.S. persons dealing in the debt and equity of Russian state-owned enterprises.
The debt and equity restrictions will apply to 13 firms, including Sberbank, Gazprombank, and the Russian Agricultural Bank.
The Treasury in Thursday's move issued eight general licenses related to COVID-19, energy and international organizations, among others, to ensure that the latest sanctions hit their targets and minimize unintended consequences.

""The sanctions and license package has been constructed to account for the challenges high energy prices pose to average citizens"" and does not bar energy-related transactions involving certain banks until June 24, the Treasury said.
The Biden administration also leveled sanctions against 24 banks, defense companies and individuals in Belarus, a staging ground from which Russian forces advanced south toward Kyiv after conducting what were cast as military exercises.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Grupo Televisa, Mexico's largest broadcaster, on Thursday reported an 8.6% dip in net profit in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier due to lower operating segment income and fewer customers who renew prepaid packages. 
The company posted a fourth-quarter net profit of 3 billion pesos ($148 million), compared with 3.3 billion pesos in the same period in 2020. 
Fourth-quarter sales decreased 4.4%. The company said in a filing with the Mexican stock exchange there had been fewer recharges of prepaid packages for Sky, its direct-to-home satellite television unit, as students and workers return to in-person classes and offices. 
Meanwhile, operating segment income decreased 13.9% to 1.8 billion pesos a year earlier.
Televisa's revenue increased 3.7% to 28.8 billion pesos from the year-earlier period.
The company's advertising revenue jumped 7.2% to 7.1 billion pesos, the company said, boosted by private-sector clients seeking to position their brands and products in front of customers.
But the COVID-19 pandemic continued to negatively impact business, Televisa said, partly because sporting and entertainment events for which it has transmission rights are operating with restrictions. 
""The deteriorating conditions of global economies as a result of the pandemic could ultimately reduce the demand for the company's products through its segments as its customers and users reduce or postpone their spending,"" the company said. 
Televisa and U.S. broadcaster Univision last month closed a deal to create new Spanish language media company TelevisaUnivision.
""As a result, in the first quarter of 2022, Televisa expects to increase its cash and cash equivalents in the amount of approximately $3.2 billion,"" the company said. 

TelevisaUnivision's global streaming platform, ViX, which will take on established rivals including Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney Plus, will launch in March, executives said.

A pandemic-fueled demand for PCs helped the company draw in billions of dollars in sales over the past year. However, an ongoing global chip shortage and supply chain issues are pinching Dell as longer lead times and parts shortages have led to higher component and freight costs. 
The company earned $1.72 per share on an adjusted basis, below Wall Street's estimate of $1.95, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Shares of Texas-based Dell closed down 1% on Thursday. They were trading at $51.89 in extended trading. 
""We expect opex (operating expense) as a percentage of revenue to be slightly higher than FY22 as we invest in the business,"" finance chief Tom Sweet said. 
Still, revenue surged 16% to $27.99 billion in the fourth quarter to beat analysts' expectations and the first-quarter forecasts for revenue and profit were above estimates. 

In the three months to Jan. 28, revenue jumped by a quarter at Dell's client solutions group - the business that includes desktop PCs, notebooks and tablets.
In November, the company completed the spin-off of its cloud computing unit VMware (NYSE:VMW) Inc in which it owned an 81% stake. Dell had said VMWare would become a standalone public firm.

(Reuters) -The Biden's administration's sale of offshore wind development rights off the coasts of New York and New Jersey surged past all expectations on Thursday to reach more than $3.3 billion, with bidding still not complete.
The auction, which began on Wednesday and is due to resume on Friday morning, is the first offshore wind lease sale under President Joe Biden, who sees expansion of offshore wind as a way to tackle climate change and create thousands of new jobs.
The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), which oversees energy development in federal waters, is offering six leases across 488,201 acres (197,568 hectares) between New York's Long Island and New Jersey, an area known as the New York Bight. 
The sale is the largest U.S. offshore wind auction ever. The energy generated from the newly offered areas could one day power nearly 2 million homes, the administration has said.
Combined live bids at the end of the day on Thursday -- following 46 rounds of bidding -- stood at $3.35 billion, according to BOEM's website. That total was more than double the combined high bids from the last five years of government offshore oil and gas auctions in the Gulf of Mexico.
""It's safe to say - based on what we know today - the end results of this lease sale will blow our expectations out of the water,"" Heather Zichal, chief executive of the American Clean Power Association, a clean energy trade group, said in an emailed statement.
There were 12 bidders participating in the auction on Thursday, which BOEM said would resume on Friday at 9:00 a.m. local time (14:00 GMT). 
Bidding on the wind lease with the most potential for energy development had soared to $900 million, with the remaining five ranging between $140 million and $720 million.
The previous U.S. offshore wind auction record, set in 2018, was $405 million, and the most ever paid for a single lease was $135.1 million.

The website did not identify the companies competing for the leases, but approved bidders included entities controlled by Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR), Avangrid (NYSE:AGR) Inc, BP (NYSE:BP) Plc and Eletricite de France SA, among others, according to government documents published last month.
Under the rules of the auction, each company can only win one lease.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday sued to stop UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH)'s $8 billion acquisition of Change Healthcare (NASDAQ:CHNG), saying the deal would give the largest U.S. health insurer access to its competitors' data and ultimately push up healthcare costs.
UnitedHealth announced the all-cash deal in January 2021, saying it would help streamline administrative and payment processes.
UnitedHealth and Change Healthcare offer competing software for processing healthcare claims and together serve 38 of the top-40 health insurers in the country, the Justice Department said in the complaint. They would have at least 75% of that market, it said.
The Justice Department said UnitedHealth knew that access to claims would give it a view into rival health plans at  Humana Inc  (NYSE:HUM), Anthem Inc, CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS)'s Aetna and  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI).
""Unless the deal is blocked, United stands to see and potentially use its health insurance rivals’ competitively sensitive information for its own business purposes and control these competitors’ access to innovations in vital healthcare technology,"" Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Doha Mekki of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division said in a statement.
UnitedHealth said it would fight the lawsuit.
""The Department's deeply flawed position is based on highly speculative theories that do not reflect the realities of the healthcare system. We will defend our case vigorously,"" it said in a statement.
The lawsuit is a continuation of a tougher approach to antitrust by the Biden administration, which has killed a planned deal by Aon (NYSE:AON) Plc and Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WTW) Plc, and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT)'s plan to buy engine maker Aerojet Rocketdyne.
Healthcare was among the markets listed as an antitrust priority in a White House executive order issued last summer.
The tougher stance casts a shadow on several other recently struck multibillion-dollar deals.
Citi analyst Daniel Grosslight said the companies are unlikely to want to take part in a protracted lawsuit for an asset Citi views as ""nice to have"" for UnitedHealth.
Change Healthcare's shares rose about 3% to $20.84, below United's Jan. 5, 2021 offer price of $25.75 per share. UnitedHealth closed off less than 1% to $455.89.
The Justice Department said the deal would give UnitedHealth access to large amounts of sensitive information from its rivals. It said in the complaint, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, that it would impact cost of health insurance by employers and their employees.
The case was assigned to Judge Carl Nichols, a former clerk to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Nichols was nominated to the court by President Donald Trump. 
Seth Bloom, a veteran of the Justice Department now in private practice, called the filing ""a strong and non-frivolous complaint.""
Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat and advocate of tougher antitrust enforcement, said he was ""glad to see"" the Justice Department challenge the deal, which he said would ""raise healthcare costs and expand a corporate giant."" 
An official with United's Optum business, which would absorb Change if the deal goes through, told Reuters it has for years had access to and safeguarded the very same information that the Justice Department is concerned about. UnitedHealth has not had access to this information, the official said.

The American Hospital Association has been critical of the deal, arguing that combining healthcare data from Change with UnitedHealth's Optum would reduce competition for the sale of healthcare information technology services for hospitals.
Other critics have included the American Medical Association and two groups of independent pharmacists.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said on Thursday it was seeking public comment on how pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) affect smaller pharmacies and consumers, after commissioners could not agree this month on whether to approve a study of the plans.
The request for comment includes questions around the impact of PBM rebates and fees on drug prices, whether patients are forced to substitute drugs in order to maximize PBM rebates and fees, conflicts of interest and other issues.

The agency said in a statement that it was inviting public comment on the big PBMs, which include CVS Caremark, UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH)'s OptumRx and  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI)'s Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX).
FTC Chair Lina Khan failed to win needed Republican support last week for an indepth study of PBMs, which serve as intermediaries between drug manufacturers, health insurance plans and pharmacies to negotiate prescription drug prices. The two Democrats on the commission voted yes while the two Republicans voted no. A tie vote means the study cannot go forward.

The U.S. Treasury on Thursday said U.S. banks must sever their correspondent banking ties with Sberbank within 30 days, and Britain said it would impose asset freezes against all major Russian banks.
Russia's central bank said it would provide any support needed for sanctions-hit banks and was ready to use additional tools to maintain their stability and protect clients.
Sberbank said it was studying the implications of the sanctions but there were no restrictions on withdrawing or depositing roubles and foreign currencies.
Gazprombank issued a similar statement saying it was serving retail and corporate clients as normal and they would have continuous access to funds and services.

It said a U.S. move to ban it from raising debt of more than 14 days maturity on the U.S. capital market was ""non-blocking"" and did not affect current operations.
Alfa-Bank, the country's biggest private bank, said it was blocked from issuing new eurobonds or placing share issues, but the share restriction had no practical effect because it is not a public company.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Rivian Automotive is ""making progress"" in the increase of production for electric vehicles at its Normal, Illinois, assembly plant and is aiming to take 10% share in the EV market by 2030, Chief Executive Officer R.J. Scaringe said on Thursday.
""We're absolutely making progress,"" he said during a Wolfe Research conference of the push to increase vehicle production. ""The plant is starting to ramp nicely."" 
Scaringe said Rivian, whose shares closed up 10.7% at $63.71, idled the plant for the first 10 days of January to make changes on the production lines in a move to boost output.
Scaringe, responding to a question about how big Rivian could become by 2030, said the company had the brand position ""to build out a portfolio ... to allow us to really work toward building a position of 10% market share within the EV space.""
He called the global semiconductor chip shortage the ""most painful"" constraint in the push to build production. The California-based startup produced 1,015 vehicles last year, coming up short of its target of 1,200 due to supply-chain constraints.
Scaringe said Rivian had replaced some chipsets in certain parts with other chipsets that are easier to get. He said the global shortage would be a factor through the rest of the year. 
Rivian's stock slumped after it outlined during its first quarterly earnings report as a public company its struggles with the manufacturing of its R1T pickup and R1S SUV. It also has a contract to build 100,000 electric delivery vans by 2025 for Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has a 20% stake in Rivian. 
Back in December, Scaringe pegged production challenges to global supply-chain constraints, the COVID-19 pandemic, a tight labor market and short-term issues around building electric battery modules.

Scaringe said Thursday Rivian was building a pilot line for in-house production of battery cell production and also plans to co-invest with a supplier on production as well. Rivian's cells are currently supplied by Samsung (KS:005930) SDI.He also said automakers will need to work on securing critical battery materials like lithium and nickel.
""It's not a choice. It's a requirement,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) bankers concocted a scheme involving their wives to conceal kickbacks they received for helping to loot Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund, one of the bankers testified on Thursday at the corruption trial of the other, Roger Ng.
Tim Leissner, who had been Ng's supervisor at Goldman before becoming the star government witness against him, said he received kickback payments from a Malaysian intermediary, Jho Low, for helping embezzle funds Goldman raised for 1MDB through three bond sales. 
Leissner testified after pleading guilty to money laundering and corruption charges, while Ng has pleaded not guilty to conspiring to commit money laundering and violating an anti-corruption law.
The charges stem from one of the biggest financial scandals in history, in which U.S. prosecutors say $4.5 billion of the $6.5 billion Goldman raised for 1MDB was diverted to government officials bankers and their associates through bribes and kickbacks. 
Leissner, 52, said that after the first bond sale in 2012, he received $35 million from Low, and transferred half of it to Ng.
Both then discussed crafting a ""cover story"" to explain the payments so the banks processing the funds would not grow suspicious, Leissner said. 
""His wife's family had previously made an investment in my wife Judy's business in China, and this was return of that investment,"" Leissner told the jury in Brooklyn federal court, referring to his former wife Judy Chan. 
Leissner said the story was untrue, and that he did not know if Ng, 49, relayed it to his bank. 
The statement could be problematic for Ng.
His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, has denied the payment was a kickback, and said the men's wives had a legitimate business together.
Agnifilo has said he plans to call Ng's wife, Hwee Bin Lim, to testify in her husband's defense.
He may question Leissner about the payment during cross-examination, which will not take place until next week because the U.S. Department of Justice delayed disclosing about 15,500 documents related to Leissner to the defense.
Agnifilo signaled in his opening statement that he will challenge Leissner's credibility by asking about his infidelity.

Leissner testified on Thursday that in 2013, while separated from Chan, he forged divorce papers in order to marry Kimora Lee Simmons, the American model and former wife of U.S. music producer Russell Simmons.
Goldman in 2020 paid a nearly $3 billion fine and arranged for its Malaysian unit to plead guilty in U.S. court.
U.S. prosecutors indicted Low in 2018, but he has not been arrested by American or Malaysian authorities. Malaysia has said Low is in China, which Beijing denies. "

FRANKFURT/LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financial firms from Frankfurt to Wall Street suffered heavy share price falls on Thursday as they grappled with the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, digested newly-imposed sanctions and rushed to advise clients on how to respond.
While many bankers have played down the importance of Russia to their operations, it is the European Union's fifth-largest trading partner, with a 5% share of trade, data shows. U.S. trade with Russia is less than 1% of its total. 
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Germany's largest lender, said it had contingency plans in place as U.S. and European officials imposed further sanctions on Moscow.
British bank Lloyds (LON:LLOY) said it was on ""heightened alert"" for cyberattacks, while German insurance and asset management giant Allianz (DE:ALVG) said that it had frozen its Russian government bond exposure.
While U.S. banks were well-prepared for the measures announced so far over Russia's aggression towards Ukraine, they worried that new measures could increase the cost and complexity of enforcing them. Financial institutions are the primary enforcers of sanctions.
""Anytime there is any type of financial strain across borders, financial companies, particularly banks, tend to be in the center of it because they have businesses in all those areas,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia. 
The United States imposed fresh sanctions against major Russian banks, including the country's two largest lenders, Sberbank and VTB, aimed at limiting Russian access to the U.S. financial system.
Shares in Sberbank and VTB fell by 37% and 41% respectively.
""These sanctions target Russia's domestic financial system, causing bank runs and forcing Russia's central bank to continue hiking rates,"" said Clay Lowery, executive vice president at the Institute of International Finance (IIF), the largest international banking group.
Shares of leading banks plunged with the European banking sector closed down 8%, steeper than a 3.3% fall for the Euro Stoxx index.
In the United States, the S&P 500 banking index, closed down 2.5%.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), which has the biggest Russian exposure among U.S. banks, fell 4%. 
Some banks organised calls for clients with experts to analyze the situation, invitations seen by Reuters showed, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) scheduling one with Michael Singh, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) ran a call for its private wealth clients hosted by Alex Younger, a former chief of British foreign intelligence service MI6, who is now an employee of the firm.
CONTINGENCY PLANNING 
European banks are most exposed to Russia, especially in France, Italy and Germany, far outstripping U.S. banks' exposure, data from the Bank for International Settlements shows.
And those banks with significant operations in Russia were hardest hit after its forces invaded Ukraine by land, air and sea, with the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two.
Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International fell 23%, while shares in Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) lost 12%, although the French bank it said its Russian unit Rosbank continued to operate normally.
UniCredit shares fell 13.5% and triggered an automatic trading suspension, although the Italian bank said its Russia ""exposures are highly covered"".
Shares in Deutsche Bank, which like many lenders in recent years has reduced its presence in Russia as sanctions have expanded, were down 11%, the biggest decline among German blue chips.
""We have contingency plans in place,"" the bank said in a statement. A spokesperson declined to elaborate, but said ""risks are well contained"".

German financial regulator BaFin said it was keeping a watchful eye on the crisis.
FRESH SANCTIONS 
European Union leaders will impose new sanctions on Russia, freezing its assets, halting access of its banks to the European financial market and targeting ""Kremlin interests"" over its ""barbaric attack"", senior officials said. 
But in what will be a relief to Europe's banks, the EU is unlikely at this stage to take steps to cut off Russia from the SWIFT global interbank payments system, several EU sources said.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled a package of ""severe"" sanctions against Russia on Thursday, targeting banks, members of President Vladimir Putin's closest circle and the extremely wealthy who enjoy high-rolling London lifestyles. [L8N2UZ366]
Both Deutsche Bank and Allianz, two of Europe's most important financial businesses and both with operations in Russia, said they were ready to comply with sanctions. 
Allianz, one of the world's biggest asset managers, said that the share of Russian government bonds in its portfolio was ""very low"" and that it had implemented a freeze on them.
RBI this month said it had earmarked 115 million euros ($129 million) in provisions for possible sanctions on Russia. As its shares dropped sharply on Thursday, the bank said that it was ""premature to assess"" the impact of sanctions on its business.

Demand for neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr), one of the most important minerals that Lynas mines, has soared in recent years as countries and companies try to tackle climate change. 
The mineral is used by automakers to make magnets for electric vehicles. Rare earths are also used in a wide range of everyday goods such as iPhones and laptops. 
The result reflected the continued strength of the market and robust customer demand for rare earths, Chief Executive Officer Amanda Lacaze said in a statement. 
""Our customers expect demand will grow strongly as we move further into FY22,"" she added. 
The world's largest producer of rare earths outside China said net profit after tax for the six months ended Dec. 31 came in at A$156.9 million ($113 million), a near four-fold jump from the A$40.6 million recorded a year ago.

Sales revenue was A$314.8 million, compared with A$202.5 million from a year earlier. The company did not declare an interim dividend.

(Reuters) - Online message board platform Reddit Inc said on Thursday it is launching a new Discover tab that will feature photos and videos from across the site to make its mobile app more visually appealing.
The new feature comes after Reddit confidentially filed for an initial public offering in December. The company is aiming for at least a $15 billion valuation, Reuters has previously reported.
Reddit has 52 million daily users and is a popular online platform for people to gather in communities, or subreddits, to discuss interests such as finance, gardening and fitness. 
The Discover tab will let users scroll through photos and videos from subreddits that are similar to ones they are already a part of. It is the first new tab on the app that the company has launched in nearly two years, Reddit said.

During testing, one in five users joined at least one new subreddit after using the Discover tab, Reddit said in a blog post.
Social media companies have been increasingly gravitating toward video over the past year due to the viral popularity of short-form video app TikTok. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms Inc on Tuesday rolled out its TikTok-like feature Reels to users in more than 150 countries.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Investors rediscovered much of their appetite for riskier bets by Thursday afternoon with the MSCI global index finishing well above its session low and the U.S. dollar paring gains while oil futures pulled back from multi-year records after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and responses from other countries.
After falling sharply earlier in the day, U.S. Treasury yields pared most of their declines and Russia's rouble recouped much of its losses against the dollar while safe-haven gold was in the red after earlier rising as much as 3.5%.
While the S&P had steadily regained lost ground after hitting its session low around the open, a noticeable improvement in risk appetite followed U.S. President Joe Biden's unveiling of new sanctions against Russia. He said the United States is working with oil producers to secure global energy supplies.
While Biden insisted that U.S. forces will not fight in Ukraine he said additional forces would be authorized to go to Germany. Sanctions cited involved Russian banks and technology imports but did not involve oil and gas or the SWIFT international banking system.
Investors, who are most concerned about inflation in areas such as energy, were relieved by what the sanctions did not include, according to Jack Janasiewicz is portfolio manager at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions.
""Historically speaking whenever you get military incursions, the blueprint has been to sell in the run up to the incursion and once tanks start rolling in across borders, you're supposed to buy it,"" said Janasiewicz. 
He noted that investors were buying assets such as technology stocks, which had been selling off ahead of the invasion. 
""You're selling your winners to buy the losers right now. That's the rotation we're seeing,"" he said. 
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe closed down 0.46% after earlier falling more than 3% to touch its lowest level since March 2021. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 92.07 points, or 0.28%, at 33,223.83 while the S&P 500 gained 63.2 points, or 1.50%, to 4,288.7 and the Nasdaq Composite added 436.10 points, or 3.34%, to close at 13,473.59.
U.S. crude settled up 0.77% at $92.81 per barrel, but well below its session high of $100.54 and Brent settled up 2.3% at $99.08 compared with its session high of $105.79.
The dollar index was up 0.91%, with the euro down 1.01% at $1.1195. Earlier the greenback had risen to a two-year high and as much as 1.62% against a basket of major currencies. (FRX)
The Russian rouble RUB= weakened 4.51% versus the greenback to 84.96 per dollar after softening to a record low of 89.986 per dollar.

845,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 05:22PM ET</span>",Sanctions could complicate Citigroup sale of Russian consumer bank -sources,"By David Henry and Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The sale of  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s Russian consumer bank could be complicated by U.S. sanctions on Russian state bank VTB, the only publicly confirmed bidder, banking sources said on Thursday.
Although the Russian business is small for Citigroup, it presents an unwelcome headache for the bank's Chief Executive Jane Fraser as she prepares for an investor day next week which could determine the bank's future.
Citigroup put the business up for sale last April as part of a broader exit from its international retail operations which it said would take 18 months to complete. VTB board member Dmitry Pyanov said last September that his bank had bid, adding that it was not the only party in the running.
Citigroup declined to comment on the sale. VTB did not respond to requests for comment.
Washington imposed new sanctions after Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Thursday and targeted its two biggest banks, including VTB.
The sanctions throw doubt over whether VTB could be a buyer, according to the banking sources, raising the question of whether Citigroup could attract other bidders. 
If not, it could be left having to hold on to the business, request an exemption from the sanctions or write off its value.
Odeon Capital analyst Dick Bove anticipates a write-down, saying Citigroup will struggle to find a buyer. 
""Nobody needs it,"" he said. 
According to regulatory filings, Citigroup had assets worth $5.5 billion in Russia at the end of September 2021, equivalent to 0.3% of its overall assets. That included $700 million in consumer loans.
Although still small, Citigroup has the most exposure to Russia of all major U.S. lenders and is the 19th biggest bank in Russia by assets, according to research published by JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) last month.
""Citigroup could be negatively impacted,"" said Bove.

Citigroup declined to respond to Bove's comments.
Shares in Citigroup led U.S. banks lower Thursday, ending down 4%, having earlier fallen as much as 7%.

846,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 05:11PM ET</span>",Explainer-Russian banks face exclusion in new round of sanctions,"By Tommy Wilkes and John McCrank
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Britain and the United States targeted Russian banks on Thursday as part of a new package of sanctions following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. 
The European Union is expected to follow suit.
Here is a rundown of how sanctions announced impact banks and investors:
WHAT HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED SO FAR?
The U.S. Treasury Department said it was targeting the ""core infrastructure"" of the Russian financial system, sanctioning two of the country's largest banks - state-backed Sberbank and VTB. Also on the list of sanctions are Otkritie, Sovcombank and Novikombank and some senior executives at state-owned banks. 
U.S. banks must sever their correspondent banking ties - which allow banks to make payments between one another and move money around the globe - with Russia's largest lender, Sberbank, within 30 days.
Officials in Washington also wielded the U.S. government's most powerful sanctioning tool, adding VTB, Otkritie, Novikombank and Sovcombank to the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. The move effectively kicks the banks out of the U.S. financial system, bans their trade with Americans, and freezes their U.S. assets.
The U.S. sanctions also target two Belarusian state-owned banks -- Belinvestbank and Bank Dabrabyt -- over that country's support for Moscow's attack. 
The U.S. sanctions came soon after the British government said it would impose an asset freeze on all major Russian banks, including VTB, and stop major Russian companies from raising finance in Britain. 
Russian banks would be cut off from sterling markets and clearing payments, Johnson said.
Britain also announced asset freezes and travel bans on members of Russia's political and financial elite -- including those who have long enjoyed high-rolling lifestyles in London. 
More than 100 individuals, entities and subsidiaries will ultimately be sanctioned, the government said. 
Britain had earlier imposed sanctions on just three billionaires with close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin and five relatively small lenders.
European foreign ministers earlier in the week agreed to sanction 27 individuals and entities, including banks financing Russian decision-makers and operations in the breakaway territories in Ukraine, but not the biggest lenders.
Washington had imposed sanctions on Promsvyazbank and VEB bank.
The United States had also ramped up prohibitions on Russian sovereign debt, which U.S. President Joe Biden said would cut the Russian government off from Western financing. 
WHAT MIGHT COME NEXT?
Russia's large banks are deeply integrated into the global financial system, meaning any sanctions on the biggest institutions could be felt far beyond its borders. 
The U.S. Treasury said Thursday's sanctions would disrupt billions of dollars worth of daily foreign exchange transactions conducted by Russian financial institutions. Overall, these institutions conduct about $46 billion worth of forex transactions, 80% of which are in dollars. ""The vast majority of those transactions will now be disrupted,"" it said.
The sanctions target nearly 80% of all banking assets in Russia. 
Sberbank said that it was prepared for any developments.
VTB said it had prepared for the most severe scenario. ""We have worked through several plans to counter the sanctions in ways which minimize the negative consequences for our clients,"" it said in a statement.
Sovcombank, Otkritie and Novikombank did not immediately reply to requests for comment. The Russian embassy in the United States also did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The new sanctions European Union leaders are preparing include freezing Russia's assets, halting its banks' access to financial markets and targeting ""Kremlin interests"".
WHAT WOULD HIT HARDEST?
What banks and Western creditors fear most is that Russia is banned from the global payment system, SWIFT, which is used by more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries.
Such a move would hit Russian banks hard but the consequences are complex. Banning SWIFT would make it tough for European creditors to get their money back.
Britain's Johnson said he intended to work with allies to shut off Russia's access to SWIFT.
But several EU sources earlier on Thursday said that locking Russia out of SWIFT was unlikely to be agreed at this stage.
Analysts said Russian institutions are better able to cope with sanctions than eight years earlier, although that does not mean they would not hurt.
The Institute of International Finance, the largest international banking group, said U.S. sanctions on Russia will have a sizeable impact on Russia's economy and citizens and could cause a recession.
WHICH FOREIGN BANKS ARE MOST EXPOSED?
Many foreign banks have significantly reduced their exposure to Russia since 2014 but several Western banks have been involved in deals and have other relationships.
There were big falls in shares of European banks on Thursday, with an index of European banking stocks closing down 8.1%. 
Banks with significant operations in Russia were particularly hard hit, with Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International down 23% and France's Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) losing 12%.
Italian and French banks each had outstanding claims of some $25 billion on Russia in the third quarter of 2021, based on Bank of International Settlement figures.

Austrian banks had $17.5 billion. That compares with $14.7 billion for the United States.

Rare earths are a group of 17 metals that, after processing, are used to make magnets found in electric vehicles, weaponry and electronics. Prices for these metals have been surging in recent months due to strong demand for electric vehicles and supply constraints.
MP said its realized price for rare earth oxides (REO) soared 148% to $10,101 per metric tonne square in the quarter. Production of REOs rose to 10,261 metric tonnes from 4,070 metric tonnes a year ago.
The company, which relies on China to process rare earth oxides from its California mining complex, reported net income of $49 million, or 26 cents per share, for the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with $24.1 million, or 20 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Currently, MP lightly processes rare earths it extracts from California's Mountain Pass mine and ships the material to China for separation into various rare earth metals because there are no U.S.-based options.
The U.S. government has funded the Las Vegas-based company in part to help bring processing back to the country, where the rare earths industry had its genesis in the mid-20th Century.

Investing.com – Stocks staged a remarkable comeback on Thursday, plunging at the open after Russia invaded Ukraine and then turning around to end strongly higher after President Joe Biden announced new sanctions.
Russian forces invaded Ukraine in a massed assault by land, sea and air, the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since the outbreak of the Second World War, Reuters reported.
Oil spiked to over $100 a barrel but sank back to the low $90 a barrel range. Weekly jobless claims, meanwhile, fell by more than expected and economic growth rose more quickly than forecast.
Earnings season has mostly wound down, but there are some economic reports due out Friday, including a gauge of inflation the Federal Reserve uses in its deliberations on interest rates.
The outbreak of war in Ukraine could prompt the Fed to take a less aggressive stance toward raising rates, which it is expected to begin doing when it meets in March.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Oil prices
U.S. oil stockpiles rose more than expected in the latest week, the Energy Information Administration said on Thursday. Crude inventories jumped 4.515 million barrels last week.
The last time Brent traded at or above $100 a barrel, was on Sept. 9, 2014. In Thursday’s session, the global benchmark for oil rose to as high as $102.23 after Vladimir Putin directed the full force of Russia’s invasive power at his neighbor.
2. Personal spending
The U.S. is set to report personal spending for January, the month after the holiday season. Analysts tracked by Investing.com are forecasting personal spending to grow 1.6% from the prior month, beating December’s reading of negative 0.6%.
3. Personal income
The personal income also comes out on Friday, both at 8:30 AM ET. Personal Income is predicted to be down 0.3%, below the previously reported 0.3%.

Russia launched an invasion on Ukraine, triggering condemnation from world leaders and ratcheting up geopolitical tensions. The U.S. responded with fresh sanctions on Russia aimed at further crippling Moscow’s ability to raise funds and to import key technology.
“Commodities prices moving higher against the backdrop of a market already in correction territory and facing the prospect of rising rates, points to a bleak market outlook,"" Phillip Toews, CEO & portfolio manager of Toews Asset Management, told Investing.com on Thursday.
The weakness that followed in stocks, however, triggered dip-buying, with battered tech stocks in demand.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  were higher.
The rebound in big tech comes as some on Wall Street urged investors to act with caution, and focus on higher tech quality stocks with healthy level of cash flows.
“[W]e view these geopolitical shock events as times not to panic … but instead selectively focus on the defensive tech stocks with significant free cash flow,” Wedbush said in a note.
The quarterly earnings season also prove to be a bright spot.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) rallied 15% after raising its full-year guidance on Covid-19 vaccine sales following fourth-quarter results that beat on both the top and bottom lines.
Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) also reported better-than-expected quarterly results, but said it was still wary of future Covid-19 related travel restrictions holding back growth. Its shares fell more than 7%.
Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV), meanwhile, rose more than 9% after reporting a healthy outlook for 2022 ticket sales and better-than-expected quarterly revenue.
With the broader market in correction, some investors flagged higher-paying dividend stocks in sectors including health care and communications services as potential areas of interest that can somewhat blunt the impact of a market crash.
“In falling markets, it's not about having the best gain, but having the least loss,” Toews said. “Higher dividend stocks provide a sort of natural rebound because as the price of the stocks fall, a relatively reliable stable dividend in places like health care and communication services as well as other categories are unlikely to be immediately effected by a downturn in financial markets and are able to recover quicker from losses."""

Investing.com -- Shares for  Universal Display  (NASDAQ:OLED) rallied 22% on Thursday after the company announced its fourth-quarter earnings.
The manufacturer of light-emitting technologies reported revenue of $146.25 million for the fourth quarter, beating the consensus of $144.47 million. The revenue beat was driven by demand for OLED products. However, the company's earnings per share were 96 cents, missing estimates by 5 cents and decreasing 15% year over year.
Full-year revenue was $553.5 million compared to $428.9 million for 2020. The improved revenue was helped by the extension of the company's agreements with LG Display (NYSE:LPL), Visionox Technology and Tianma Micro-electronics.
""2021 was a year of growth, R&D milestone achievements, new customer agreements, continued market recognition, and diversification and expansion of our global manufacturing footprint with PPG,"" said Sidney Rosenblatt, executive vice president and CFO of Universal Display.

The company's 2022 revenue is predicted to be between $625 million and $650 million.

Bombardier Chief Executive Eric Martel, who spoke after laying out the business jet maker's 2025 financial objectives to investors, said the company's supply chain is not impacted by the crisis, but about 5% or 6% of deliveries traditionally come from customers in the region.
Martel said he did not know of any customers who are now facing sanctions, but acknowledged there are developments ""every hour.""
""We'll see what are the sanctions, and we may have, I don't know, to terminate some of these agreements if there are sanctions on some of our customers,"" Martel told reporters after the company's investor day.
Corporate planemakers are capitalizing on a pandemic-fueled boom in demand for private aircraft, with global business jet flight sectors up 12% so far this year compared with pre-pandemic January and February 2019, according to data research and consulting company WINGX. 
But the Russian crisis has rapidly displaced the pandemic as the most significant destabilizing factor in the European region, WINGX said, with European Union leaders saying they will impose wide-ranging, new sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
Earlier in the day Bombardier said it is aiming to build up to $600 million per year for use toward special projects, such as a possible new plane or debt repayment, as part of a 2025 target.

The pure-play corporate planemaker, which has shed assets in recent years after facing a cash crunch in 2015, is separately targeting more than $500 million in free cash flow in 2025.
Bombardier is targeting the biggest ever expansion of its aftermarket division to nearly double revenues from such services to $2 billion in 2025 compared with 2021.

(Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) said on Thursday it will eliminate all overdraft, returned item and overdraft protection fees by this summer, the first big U.S. retail bank to take the step at a time when regulators are scrutinizing the charges.
The bank said that customers who overdraft their accounts can bring their balance above zero by setting up free, automatic transfers from a savings accounts or, in approved cases, accessing a line of credit from the bank. 
For customers who do not have these options set up, the bank said it will reject charges at ATMs and point-of-sale that overdraft an account.
Banks are facing increased scrutiny from regulators over overdraft and non-sufficient funds (NSF) fees, which result when an automatic debit from a checking account cannot be funded, like a bounced check. 
The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is exploring issuing new guidance aimed at curbing banks' reliance on the fees, and is seeking information from customers about overdraft and other ""junk fees.""
Several big banks have changed their overdraft policies since the CFPB said it was targeting the charges.

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co said they will give customers extra time to bring their account balances above zero, and they are rolling out new short-term lines of credit for customers to access if they cannot come up with the money.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said it would stop charging NFS fees and reduce its overdraft fees to $10 from $35 beginning in May.

Most luxury groups have recovered fast from the fallout of the coronavirus outbreak, helped by strong demand for high-end apparel. Moncler is the latest in the industry to top market estimates for holiday-quarter revenue.

Stone Island, included in Moncler's accounts since April, contributed 66 million euros to sales during that period.

Investing.com – Norwegian Cruise stock (NYSE:NCLH) fell 5.2% Thursday after the operator’s fourth-quarter revenue came in behind estimates.
The loss was worse than expected as cruise operations remained disrupted due to Omicron while costs stayed elevated. The losses in the stock were aggravated because of the escalating crisis in Europe arising out of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Cruise operators were the worst hit in the pandemic as the fear of the virus and strict Covid-19 protocols kept guests away. Adhering to the guidelines also meant higher operating expenses for the cruise operators. Sporadic cases of infection being found on ships hurt operations further. So did booking cancellations.  
As a result of Omicron-related disruptions, the company expects to have 85% of its capacity operating by end-March with its 28-ship fleet expected to be back in operation during the early part of the second quarter. It closed December with around 70% capacity in operation.
Strong ticket pricing and onboard revenue drove positive contribution from the fleet that operated in the quarter. Occupancy in the fourth quarter was just over 51%.
Based on the current booked position and trajectory, the company expects to make a profit on an adjusted basis in the second half of the year.
Revenue in the fourth quarter climbed past $487 million on the resumption of voyages.
The adjusted net loss in the quarter widened to $765 million from $684 million a year ago.
The company expects the monthly cash burn to be around $390 million in the current quarter, higher sequentially. It currently has nine premium yielding vessels on order through 2027, accounting for around 24,000 berths.

Stock markets around the world slumped. The S&P 500 was off 1.2%, and the Nasdaq was off 0.35%. Investors shifted money into safe havens like U.S. Treasuries and gold. Wall Street's fear gauge, the VIX, jumped to its highest in a month.

“In the near-term uncertainty will reign. You will see volatility in the market that will result in a back-and-forth flight to quality, safe-haven trade that should, as we’ve seen so far, benefit Treasuries. But a lot depends upon where this goes. I would tend to think that is contained to Ukraine and there's not a spillover into any of the NATO-related countries. 
“The tension will shift, especially here in the U.S., more to the domestic fundamentals. For us here in the U.S., it's more of an energy-related development. Does the argument shift back to the inflation aspect of energy or is it a tax on the consumer? Could it serve as a restraining influence on the economy? Only time will tell.
“This is certainly a whole new scale of what we saw in 2014 (with Crimea) and I would argue that right now it's more of a Euro-centric issue. If you're looking at ECB policy, that’s different. How does the ECB respond to this and you would think they will probably take a more cautious approach because this is right in their backyard.”

“The fear is that if the West, the U.S. and Europe, continue to impose stricter sanctions, there is potential for him to weaponize his commodities, so energy, what, corn. He can put China in his back pocket by promising them he can now lock in their food supply, wheat and corn, as long as China supports his move. Wink, wink, he would support China’s move into Taiwan, that is potentially the real risk here. The West is in a very, very tough spot here.”
“We have certainly broken through the Jan 24 (S&P 500) lows of 4,222. We closed at them last night. I thought it was going to hold but now this changes that whole story, so now I think we trade down to 4,150-ish,. That would take us back to April-June of 2021 where it seems the market should find some support. It feels like it did but I don’t think it is going to trade there and bounce and suddenly go higher here. We are going to churn here for a while, we are going to have very volatile days and weeks ahead.”
“Look at gold, that is really the safety hedge as well as Treasuries. Bitcoin though continues to get killed because when push comes to shove people are going to gold and not bitcoin. In the end, if you want to talk about the safety trade, as much as everyone likes to say bitcoin is great, push comes to shove people want gold. Who knows what is going to happen in this environment. Bitcoin may survive this. I think it will, but right now the first reaction is 'I am going where I feel the safest' and that is gold or silver.” 
JOHN VAIL, CHIEF GLOBAL STRATEGIST, NIKKO AM (by email)
“The Ukraine situation complicates the policy outlook for the Fed as energy and some grains prices would likely rise further if the attack deepens. Meanwhile, domestic demand and corporate pricing power remain strong, so it is not easy for the Fed to support financial conditions by becoming a bit more dovish. However, the silver lining is that the decline in risk markets has helped prevent bond yields from rising to new yearly highs.”
  ""We can be reasonably sure that the rise of bond yields in the major developed markets has climaxed. Accordingly, the pressure on the universe of defensive growth is being lifted. Europe’s Banks are the losers here. The out-performance of Financials in Europe has climaxed. This said, it is not clear that Europe has the resolve to shut Russia out of the SWIFT money transfer system."" 
CLIFF HODGE, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CORNERSTONE WEALTH, CHARLOTTE, NC 
“The world just became a more dangerous place. From a market perspective, most geopolitical events are sharp, but short-lived with volatility creating opportunity. Oil prices are a problem, as they act like a tax and will certainly have an impact on economic growth, especially if financial conditions tighten further.” 
“Higher energy prices will also support sticky inflation which may keep pressure on the Fed to stay on course. Energy companies are the immediate beneficiaries, and more of the speculative areas of the markets will likely continue to be stressed. The conversation on bitcoin and crypto as a store of value, inflation hedge, or digital gold is dead, as it’s proven to be nothing more than another momentum product in the liquidity lottery.”
“While there may be some additional volatility in the short term, these dislocation events historically present opportunities, as long as recession doesn’t follow. At this stage recession is not a concern. We’re most interested in high quality technology companies that are now on sale. The risk reward in the market at these levels is compelling, especially when compared to interest rates.”

“This has been the most telegraphed war in history, and yet we still seem surprised that it happened. We’re completely oversold at this point. It's not just the highly priced growth stocks that are suffering, it's now all stocks.”“The biggest risk factor that the economies of the world are going to see is the price of oil. But commodities are beautiful things because they have a supply and demand pricing and so I'm expecting more supply to come in the next few months but let's see what the other OPEC nations and non OPEC nations do.”“The Fed is now going to be looking for diminished economic activity and may still hike rates, but not at the rate that everyone had forecast.”
“Nasdaq nearing bear territory is a huge driver, especially among retail investors because they've piled into all the hot stocks and now, if they haven’t gotten out, are looking at the ruin that is their portfolio. For better or worse, most retail investors buy too late and sell too late…. All is not lost though, there are a lot of companies that are making good products on Nasdaq that are really in demand and the price of the stock is cheap now. So institutional investors may come in later and buy as a kind of balancing act.”
“Stocks exposed to Russia are falling because people are worried that these companies might be taken off NASDAQ as a punishment or they fear that these companies won't be allowed to sell their products in the developed world as a punishment.”

“It's a gut check market, kind of sell-off knee jerk reaction. There's a lot of uncertainty in what might happen. It's all about near-term fear driving the market. We just don't know what's going to play out over the next few days. It's going to be tough. You don't know when the low is going to come. There's just so much uncertainty right now about how far the west could go with this. It's a confidence knocker. And when that happens, it’s tough for the market to really scramble higher.”
“I do not think many investors have dealt with the combination of surging inflation which was last really seen in the early 80s, combined with full scale military operation in Europe, which again, the last time that happened was second world war. So this is sort of uncharted territory for a lot of people.”
“The only upside you're going to see is bond yields come down, and we're already seeing bond yields really flatten and that's going to give some lift to some of the beaten-down oversold tech. Tech can get a bit of a lift and can drive some leadership for the broader market.”
“Demand is going to take a hit versus what we thought maybe a couple months ago demand. Oil prices, where they're at now, is destructive for demand. You're going to see tightening, but maybe not as much tightening as had been priced. The (central banks) can go a little bit softer.”

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -The sale of  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s Mexican business Citibanamex could be done directly or through an initial public offering (IPO), the head of the Mexican business said on Thursday, adding there has been interest from banks and non-banks, both local and foreign.
Citibanamex's Chief Executive Manuel Romo ruled out selling the bank piecemeal and said the process could take up to two years, with executives analyzing all potential buyers. 
""We're not taking anyone out of the running,"" Romo said on a conference call with the press to discuss company results.
Analysts have estimated Citibanamex could go for anywhere from $4 billion to $8 billion, though Romo declined to name a price.
Since the sale was announced in January, analysts have argued that selling the business in parts will be easier as some potential buyers already have large market shares in Mexico.
Groups like Banorte and Santander (MC:SAN) have said they are analyzing the sale, along with homegrown billionaire Ricardo Salinas, who controls Mexico's Banco Azteca.
Romo said a buyer could be announced by the end of the year.

The executive said Citigroup will act as an adviser on the sale and there has been ""extraordinary cooperation"" from the Mexican government so far. 
In line with the American bank's recent strategy of selling off international operations, Citigroup announced in January that it was selling its Mexican consumer business.

FRANKFURT/HELSINKI (Reuters) -Shares in German utility Uniper and largest shareholder  Fortum  (HE:FORTUM), which both run substantial businesses in Russia, plummeted on Thursday following Moscow's move to invade Ukraine.
Between them, the companies employ 7,000 staff in Russia, where they operate a dozen power plants, many fuelled by gas, to supply local communities and industries.
Shares in Uniper fell as much as a fifth to their lowest level in more than 15 months, while Fortum, which owns 76% in Uniper, fell up to 10.4% to a 14-month low.
Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Thursday in a massed assault by land, sea and air, the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two.
""Energy production in Russia has not been sanctioned, and therefore our operations there have not been directly impacted,"" Fortum said in a statement. It said it was monitoring decisions on sanctions and counter-sanctions.
Uniper owns a majority in Russian utility Unipro and is one of the financial backers of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project whose certification German Chancellor Olaf Scholz put on hold on Tuesday in response to the Ukraine crisis.
Uniper said on Wednesday it was assessing whether Berlin's suspension of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline would cause impairments on its 1 billion euro ($1.1 billion) exposure to the project.
""We very much regret the escalation of the situation with Russia's attack on Ukraine and are following the situation with utmost concern,"" Uniper said in a statement.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global fund managers have been cutting back their Russian investments as they braced for the country's invasion of Ukraine. Now hopes of any respite have also been dashed.
The rouble weakened nearly 7% to historic lows and there were record 30% falls on the Moscow stock exchange after Russian forces invaded Ukraine in a massed assault by land, sea and air on Thursday.
Allianz (DE:ALVG), Europe's biggest insurer and one of the globe's biggest investors, said on Thursday it had frozen its exposure to Russian government bonds.
Two Danish pension funds this week also said they were pulling back from Russia, while BlueBay Asset Management has cut its holdings.
“We took the warnings in November from Western governments seriously as to risks of a Russian attack on Ukraine and reduced exposure across all our funds,"" Tim Ash, senior emerging market sovereign strategist at BlueBay, said.
Benjamin Melman, Global CIO of Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management, said he was reviewing the firm's Russia-exposed debt and equity portfolios. 
It has invested in European companies that have some exposure to Russia and has Russia companies in its emerging market portfolio, as well as some Russian corporate bonds.
""We need to consider how the invasion reshuffles the economics scenario,"" Melman said.
Russia, once a darling of emerging markets in the BRICs cohort of Brazil, Russia, India and China, was falling out of favour long before the threat of war with Ukraine emerged in recent months.
International asset management investment in Russia has weakened in recent years and it has never recovered to levels seen before Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, according to Copley Fund Research, after investors suffered the pain of sanctions.
Emerging market equity managers have around 4% of their allocations in Russia, compared with more than 10% after the global financial crisis, Copley said.
Western powers imposed sanctions on Russia earlier this week after it recognised Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine as independent, and have promised tougher measures.
""LET'S GET THROUGH THE WEEKEND""
Several investors told Reuters their Russian holdings were small.
Principal Global Investors has an underweight position in emerging market assets, including Russia, chief strategist Seema Shah said.
""In the run-up to this conflict we already had limited exposure, so we won't change that,"" she said.
Alain Zeitouni, head of multi-asset, EMEA at Russell Investments, said the fund manager's exposure to Russia and Ukraine was ""very modest"" and the firm had not made any changes so far.
British asset manager M&G, France's AXA Investment Managers and Swiss insurer Zurich also said their Russian holdings were limited. 
However, some fund managers cautioned against making hasty decisions about off-loading Russian assets.
Dan Kemp, global CIO at $260 billion Morningstar Investment Management, said the asset manager held Russian local currency debt and was not planning to sell so far.
""The key is to not have a kneejerk reaction to what's happening, but to step back and understand how it's likely to affect bonds and how it's priced in,"" he said.
Russian local currency debt yields have shot up to 19% from around 7.5% in October.
 Schroders  (LON:SDR) was assessing the consequences of the invasion, ""stock by stock, bond by bond"", but the situation remained very uncertain, said Johanna Kyrklund, group chief investment officer at the UK asset manager, adding it was hard to say how far the market could fall.
""Let's at least get through the weekend first."" 

Copley analysts said in a note written earlier this week that, based on the events of 2014, the impact on Russian assets was likely to be prolonged.
""It took a full two years for investor sentiment to regain a semblance of positivity in Russia, and even then it never returned to pre-Crimea levels.""

Investing.com – Live Nation stock (NYSE:LYV) surged 7% Thursday after concerts and other live events returned to the stage, helping the organizer beat fourth-quarter revenue estimates.
Several operational parameters are now ahead of their pandemic-free 2019 comparisons.
“Ticket sales were at a record pace across every metric with October, November and December being our top three months ever for ticketing gross transaction value, excluding refunded tickets,” the company said in a statement.
According to the company, in the final five months of the year, it had over 15 million fans at its outdoor events in U.S. and U.K. – festivals, stadiums, and amphitheaters had nearly 25% higher attendance than during the same period in 2019.
Sponsorship and advertising followed the fans. The company attracted new brand partners like Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) and Disney’s Hulu in the fourth quarter, Live Nation said.
Revenue climbed more than eleven times to $2.7 billion, helped by higher ticket prices.
Through mid-February, the company said it has sold 45 million tickets for shows this year, up 45% from 2019.
“We already have eight artists who have sold over 500 thousand tickets for their tours this year, including Bad Bunny, Dua Lipa and Billie Eilish,” it said.
The company’s event-related deferred revenue for 2022 stands at $2.3 billion —almost double year-end 2019 level. Confirmed show bookings and ticket sales are up double-digits across major venues while sponsorship commitments are also up double-digits relative to 2019 with over 80% sold of the space for the year, it said.
Operating income topped $160 million in the quarter.

Investing.com -- Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) shares are trading 3% above Wednesday's close after a note from Jefferies analyst Brent Thill.
According to TheFly, the analyst said in a note to clients that in his survey of Salesforce partners, they found 54% of respondents expect a stabilization in growth in 2022, with 46% expecting an acceleration.
Furthermore, 88% expect their Salesforce practices to grow in 2022.
As a result, the analyst believes expectations are low for the company ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings, despite what he describes as a ""tough set up"" heading into the report.
A sell-off in software stocks and demand worries has seen Salesforce shares slide significantly since Q3. However, he considers the stock to have an attractive risk-reward. As a result, the analyst kept a Buy rating and a $360 price target on the shares.
In contrast, Wells Fargo lowered their price target on Salesforce shares to $265 from $340. Nevertheless, they still have an overweight rating on the stock."

MADRID (Reuters) -Spain's Santander (MC:SAN) on Thursday said its Chief Executive Officer Jose Antonio Alvarez will report exclusively to the bank's board as part of a change in its corporate governance structure while accelerating its digital transformation.
Until now, Alvarez also reported to Chairman Ana Botin, who will keep her executive role.
At many Spanish lenders the chairman holds executive powers and is in control of strategy while the CEO handles day-to-day business.
Supervisors of euro area banks favour a division of roles between the chairman and the CEO, with sound governance one of their key priorities.
Santander also announced changes to its operational structure to accelerate its digital transformation as lenders try to fend off competition from new internet-based entrants while still grappling with ultra-low interest rates. 
The bank said new tech units, PagoNxt and Digital Consumer Bank, would be supervised by Botin, while Santander's regions, countries and global businesses would continue to report to Alvarez.
The lender also said it would propose German de la Fuente, who previously worked for consultancy Deloitte, as an independent director at a shareholder meeting on April 1.
The bank plans to pay a final cash dividend of 5.15 euro cents per share and will launch a share buyback of 865 million euros ($962 million) against 2021 earnings, on top of an already paid cash dividend of 4.85 euro cents per share and a buyback of 841 million euros, it said.
As a result, the total capital distributed to shareholders would be around 3.4 billion euros.

Shareholders would also be asked to approve a reduction of the group's outstanding share capital of up to 10% by cancelling shares it may acquire, including under potential repurchase programmes in the future.

Poland is consuming about 20 billion cubic meters of gas annually. PGNiG's long-term contract with Gazprom is for 10.2 billion of cubic meters per year and expires this year. The rest comes from LNG, imports from the EU markets and domestic output.

(Reuters) -More frequent shareholder revolts at companies like Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) show corporate directors should hesitate to hike CEO pay during tough times, according to a new report.
Proxy votes against executive pay at S&P 500 companies became more common last year and were often sparked by ""questionable practices and metrics"" like when companies eased performance targets during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a report by As You Sow, a shareholder advocacy group focused on environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters.
As companies begin to issue their proxy statements showing compensation details in coming months, some will have gotten the message they should not tweak formulas to leaders' advantage even if a crisis looms, said Rosanna Landis Weaver, one of the report's authors. 
""Last year we could tell starkly when companies were doing these things, and shareholders responded,"" she said. But the unique circumstances of the pandemic mean it could be harder for investors to spot bad pay practices in the future, she added.
Among the S&P 500, a record 16 companies had the pay of their CEOs and other top leaders rejected by more than half of investors last year, up from ten in 2020 and seven in 2019, according to the report, which also used data from sustainable ratings agency HIP Investor.
In one case cited in the report, Norwegian Cruise Line paid CEO Frank Del Rio $36.4 million for 2020, more than twice the level of 2019, even as the company's business fell off during the pandemic. In May, 83% of votes cast were against the pay, a filing shows.
Via e-mail, Norwegian said the 2020 pay was meant to keep its management intact, and that it will ""carefully consider"" shareholder opinions as it reviews pay policies going forward.

In another case, General Electric granted CEO Larry Culp new shares tied to lower financial targets that made up the bulk of the $73 million he earned in 2020. In May, 58% of advisory votes cast were against Culp's pay, a filing shows.
In a statement e-mailed by a representative, Thomas Horton, GE lead director and chair of the Management Development and Compensation Committee, said ""GE’s Board of Directors strongly believes the actions taken in 2020 to secure several additional years of Larry Culp’s leadership was, and remains, in the very best interest of GE and our shareholders.""

(Reuters) -Moderna Inc executives said on Thursday they believe a fourth COVID-19 vaccine shot will be needed late this year due to waning protection from earlier doses, which could push up sales in the second half of 2022.
Chief Executive Stephane Bancel stressed that the company's current sales projections for its Spikevax COVID-19 shot - $19 billion in 2022, up from its prior estimate of $18.5 billion - does not include any additional sales to the United States this year.
“What is not clear today is what will the U.S. government decide to do for 2022. Will it be a private market, or a mix of private and free vaccines,” Bancel said.
The company said it was in talks with countries for more vaccine orders this year. 
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) shares jumped 11% to $150.80 amid a fall in the broader markets on Thursday. The stock was down over 70% from its August peak over lackluster flu vaccine data and questions of long-term sustainability of COVID vaccine sales.
However, the company sees a need for seasonal boosters to shore up immunity in people at high-risk of severe illness as the virus continues to circulate while putting less of a strain on healthcare systems.
""We do believe that we are transitioning into an endemic phase, marked by a period of stability in case counts, hospitalizations and death, at least in the Northern Hemisphere,"" said Moderna's Chief Medical Officer Paul Burton.
Moderna said it expects immunity, even with a booster shot, will decline after six to nine months. It hopes a seasonal booster will help generate virus-neutralizing antibodies for at least six months. 
While Moderna cited studies that showed neutralizing antibody levels wane nine months after a booster shot, other researchers believe protection from a third dose could be more durable, especially for younger, healthy people.
U.S. health officials have said they are carefully monitoring the data and have not yet made a decision about whether a fourth shot will be necessary. 
Moderna said it was working on a new ""bivalent"" vaccine that combines a booster designed to tackle the now dominant Omicron variant of the virus with its original COVID-19 vaccine.

Moderna sales soared to $18.5 billion in 2021 from $803 million in 2020, and the company said it would buy back $3 billion in stock. The COVID vaccine is its lone commercial product.

Nikola, which has yet to report any revenue from truck sales, said it expects revenue between $90 million and $150 million this year. Its current quarter will not record any revenue, it added.
The company, which is working on expanding its plant in Coolidge, Arizona, delivered its first two electric trucks in December to a southern Californian port trucking company TTSI as part of a three-month pilot program.

A representative for Milton declined to comment.
The U.S. regulators had charged Milton for using social media to repeatedly mislead investors about the electric-truck maker's technology and capabilities, reaping ""tens of millions of dollars"" as a result of his misconduct.

The Phoenix, Arizona-based startup, which has been trying to close this chapter and focus on ramping up production, said it expected to complete the expansion works at its Coolidge, Arizona facility in the first quarter of 2023.

TORONTO (Reuters) -Royal Bank of Canada kicked off Canadian lenders' first-quarter results with a stronger-than-expected 6% rise in adjusted earnings, driven by wealth management and loan growth.
RBC executives expect mortgage growth to slow to the high single digits by year-end, and to low- to mid-single digits by the end of 2023, as the central bank prepares to raise interest rates as early as next week. Mortgages grew about 11% in the first quarter and outpaced business loans and credit card balances.
However, Royal Bank is set to benefit from rate hikes, with a 25-basis-point rise in short-term rates resulting in over C$175 million ($136 million) of additional revenue over 12 months, the executives said.
Analysts and investors had been bracing for a somewhat more muted first quarter for Canada's major banks, following several periods of better-than-expected results, particularly due to expectations of higher expenses and declines in capital markets revenues.
Canada's biggest lender by market capitalization reported adjusted earnings of C$2.87 per share, up from C$2.69 a year earlier, versus analysts' estimates of C$2.73 a share.
The earnings beat was also driven by capital markets profits, which beat expectations even though the unit's earnings fell from a year ago as lower fixed-income trading revenues offset record corporate and investment banking performance.
""The results were quite clean and set the bank up for a solid run for the remainder of the year as anticipated rate increases should fuel further revenue growth, offsetting any potential easing in volumes,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Analyst John Aiken wrote in a note.
RBC shares fell 2% to C$137.60 in early trading in Toronto, compared with a 1.5% decline in the Toronto stock benchmark. Markets globally were roiled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Royal Bank's non-interest expenses saw little change from both a year and a quarter ago, but costs excluding variable compensation are set to increase at the higher end of the bank's forecast low-single-digit range, executives said on an analyst call.
Earnings from Royal Bank's personal and commercial banking unit climbed 10% from a year earlier and wealth management profit jumped 24%, driven by higher loan volumes in Canada and increased assets and the release of provisions at the latter's U.S. unit.

The positive numbers offset an 11-basis-point year-on-year decline in net interest margins and a 3% drop in profit from its capital markets unit, which posted record earnings a year earlier.

UniCredit's Russian subsidiary is the country's 12th largest bank, with 7.8 billion euros in customer loans at the end of last year.
UniCredit's overall credit exposure to Russia totalled 14.21 billion euros in mid-2021, a figure which takes into account also 6.3 billion euros in loans that were not granted locally.
In a bid to reassure investors, UniCredit said that provisions against possible losses covered 84% of its Russian subsidiary's non-performing exposures.
""Our equity in the Russian subsidiary is less than 4% of the group's total equity and if you look at loans and total assets it's even less than that,"" UniCredit said, adding it was closely following the developments. 

UniCredit in January dropped a potential deal that would have seen it exchange its local arm for a controlling stake in Russian lender Otkritie which the country's central bank is looking to list after rescuing it in 2017.
UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel said at the time that geopolitical risks had made it impossible to proceed though the group was generally happy with its Russian business, whose returns had always covered its local cost of its capital.

Investing.com –  Moderna , Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock surged 11.2% Thursday after the company forecast higher vaccine sales for the second half of the year, pinning its estimates on COVID-19 becoming a flu-like endemic illness that will lead people to take shots on a regular basis.
The gains have been helped by the company’s plan to buy back shares worth $3 billion, following a similar exercise of $1 billion that concluded last month.
The biotech firm expects $19 billion in sales of its Spikevax vaccine this year compared to $18.5 billion it had forecast earlier. But the company also said that options for 2022 orders were $3 billion, down from its last month’s announcement of $3.5 billion.
Full-year revenue was $18.5 billion. Just over three months back, the company had cut the forecast for 2021 vaccine sales to $15 billion-$18 billion after it claimed to have signed agreements for $20 billion.
In the past year, the company delivered 807 million doses of the only product it sells; a fourth of those went to low- and middle-income countries.
The company’s life-saving vaccine is priced below value while the pandemic lasts, and the company aims to change that pricing strategy when COVID-19 begins to subside. Proceeds from those sales are going into funding the company’s research in developing mRNA vaccines and treatments for other diseases like cancer and tuberculosis.
The company said it is working on a new bivalent booster vaccine, which combines an Omicron-specific booster and the original Spikevax vaccine.

Purchases of new single-family homes decreased 4.5% to a 801,000 annualized pace following a revised 839,000 in December, government data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for an 803,000 rate. 
While underlying demand for new homes remains solid, fueled in part by record low inventory in the resale market, the highest mortgage rates since mid-2019 represent a headwind. Higher materials costs are also contributing to housing inflation and sidelining many prospective buyers.
A further moderation in sales may help builders chip away at construction backlogs that are still elevated due to supply and transportation delays.
Supply-side challenges “were compounded by additional pressure from the omicron wave” last month, Doug Yearley, chief executive officer at  Toll Brothers  (NYSE:TOL) Inc. said Wednesday on the homebuilder’s earnings call. “It is taking us approximately two months longer to deliver a home today versus one year ago.”
Still, the company reported better-than-expected orders amid robust demand for large and high-end houses in the suburbs. 
The new-home sales report, produced by the Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, showed the median sales price of a new home rose 13.4% from a year earlier to $423,300.
There were 406,000 new homes for sale as of the end of January the most since 2008 -- though about 26% of those houses were not yet started. At the current sales pace, it would take 6.1 months to exhaust the supply of new homes. That compares with 3.6 months a year ago.
The number of homes sold in January and awaiting the start of construction -- a measure of backlogs – rose from a month earlier to 237,000. The total number of homes sold with construction under way eased to 368,000.
Sales declined in three of four in U.S. regions. Purchases slumped 10.7% in the Northeast, fell 7.4% in the South and dropped 3.7% in the Midwest.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Autonomous vehicle venture Motional and ride services company Via said they will launch on Thursday a robo-taxi service in Las Vegas, the latest step by Motional toward commercial deployment of its autonomous vehicle systems.
Via will use vehicles outfitted with Motional autonomous driving systems to offer free rides between several locations in downtown Las Vegas. Motional is a joint venture of Hyundai Motor Co and automotive technology supplier Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) PLC. 
Motional CEO Karl Iagnemma told Reuters the company is on track to launch fully driverless rides late next year using Hyundai electric vehicles on  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT)'s network in Las Vegas in a separate initiative.
Motional is one of several autonomous driving technology companies pushing to start revenue-generating services in the United States using driverless vehicles over the next one to two years.
“Everything in this industry has accelerated,"" Iagnemma said. ""Now the question is how quickly can you scale?""
Motional's co-parent Hyundai plans to begin assembling Hyundai Ioniq 5 electric vehicles with sensors and software engineered by Motional for use as driverless people carriers or driverless food delivery vehicles. The Motional Ioniqs will be assembled on the same production line as conventional Ioniqs.

Motional and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) have agreed to deploy Motional autonomous Ioniq 5 vehicles to deliver goods to Uber Eats customers in Santa Monica. The vehicles will have operators on board at first, with the goal to take human drivers out, Iagnemma said.

Investing.com –  Alibaba  ADRs (NYSE:BABA) slumped 8% in premarket trading Thursday after a 10% rise in third quarter revenue marked the slowest growth for the internet giant since going public in September 2014.
It is a sharp reversal in fortunes for a company used to a 40%-plus growth and underscores the impact of the crackdown on its operations by the Chinese government. Consumer spending slowed too while competition grew.
Net income tumbled 74% to 20.4 billion yuan ($3.2 billion) after the company took a big hit from losses in its global investment portfolio. Some warnings were in place for this at the time of the 11-day China’s Single’s Day online sales fest held in November.
For Alibaba, which first started the practice as a single-day event in 2009, gross merchandise volume grew 8.5% to $84.5 billion, the first time in history that growth slowed below 10%. Sales from the extravaganza at rival JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) had grown 29%.
The company closed December with 1.28 billion active customers, adding 43 million in the December quarter. Cloud revenue jumped 20%.
The Chinese government forced Alibaba’s finance affiliate Ant Group to call off what would have been the world’s largest initial public offering in 2020. It went on to create more challenges for the company’s businesses.
According to a Bloomberg report this week, the authorities have asked the state-owned firms and banks to start a fresh round of checks on their financial exposure and other links to Ant Group."
913,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 08:21AM ET</span>",Exclusive-Quantum Energy offers $2.25 billion debt fund with fossil fuel opt-out -sources,"By David French
(Reuters) - Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) Energy Partners is raising a $2.25 billion fund that will lend to U.S. oil and gas firms as well as energy companies transitioning away from fossil fuels, allowing investors to pick whether they back activities that lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions, according to people familiar with the matter.
Founded in 1998, Quantum continues to be one of the most active private equity firms in the oil and gas sector but, like others which have traditionally invested in hydrocarbons, it is spending more time focused on cleaner forms of energy.
Quantum's fundraise comes as U.S. crude prices near $100 per barrel for the first time since 2014, driven by supply constraints and geopolitical concerns such as Russia's claims over Ukraine. 
Many banks are still not comfortable lending to small and medium-sized U.S. oil and gas exploration and production companies because they are nursing losses from previous energy price plunges, ceding market share to private equity firms such as Quantum that are willing to step up and provide credit.
Concerns over the impact of the energy industry on climate change has also given some banks pause.
While private equity firms still find eager investors for their energy credit funds among sovereign wealth funds and insurance companies, investors, including some public pension funds, have become wary of supporting the production of fossil fuels that lead to greenhouse gas emissions. 
Heeding these concerns, Quantum decided that its new fund will have two sleeves: a $1.5 billion tranche for lending to oil and gas producers and a further $750 million for companies supporting the transition away from fossil fuels, the sources said. Investors can choose if they want to invest in one or both.
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information. Quantum declined to comment. 

The cash deployed will be in senior secured and direct lending, as opposed to the type of mezzanine loans extended using Quantum's previous debt fund, the sources said. Senior secured debt is paid out before mezzanine in a bankruptcy, making it a safer bet for Quantum.
It is the second energy debt fund for Quantum. The Houston-headquartered investment firm raised a $1.6 billion fund in 2019 that was used to provide structured credit and mezzanine finance to oil and gas companies, including  Devon Energy  Corp (NYSE:DVN) and Antero Resources (NYSE:AR) Corp.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Blackstone Inc has never approached Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp about a potential buyout, the two companies said on Thursday, denying a media report.
Nikkei Business Publications reported on Thursday that U.S. private equity firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX) had made a buyout offer for the Japanese conglomerate, citing multiple unidentified sources. It said executives of both companies met in January. 
""Blackstone has never approached Toshiba about a take-private,"" a Blackstone spokesperson said. 
""Blackstone has never submitted an informal or formal proposal, verbally or in writing, and has no plans to do so,"" the spokesperson added.
Toshiba said in a statement there was ""no such"" fact that any specific proposals, ""including preliminary and initial ones were brought to Toshiba, including those from Blackstone, to take Toshiba private"". 
The troubled $18 billion conglomerate was once one of corporate Japan's mightiest companies before being weakened by scandal. Yet it retains a number of attractive businesses from defence equipment to semiconductors.
Toshiba has announced a revised restructuring plan that would see it split off its devices business. Previously it planned to also break off its flash memory chip unit and its energy and infrastructure business. Some investors are calling on it to resume a strategic review and solicit buyout bids.

Some shareholders, particularly foreign activist funds, have been opposed to Toshiba's plan to split, seeing greater returns in a buyout. A deal to go private would also allow shareholders to exit their investment relatively quickly, as opposed to having to wait out a break-up that could take some years.
Management has said the break-up would be the best option to maximise value.

(Reuters) -Discovery Inc. beat Wall Street's revenue expectations for its fourth-quarter, buoyed by live sports and higher advertising revenue, as it moves closer to completing its acquisition of AT&T (NYSE:T)'s WarnerMedia unit.
Revenue rose 10% to $3.19 billion for the quarter ending in December, slightly above Wall Street's consensus estimate of $3.12 billion, according to Refinitiv. Net income fell to $38 million, or 8 cents a share, from $271 million, or 42 cents per share, a year earlier. 
Total paid streaming subscribers including those from Discovery+ reached 22 million at the end of December, up from 20 million in the third quarter, the company said.
Advertising revenue continued to recover from the pandemic pullback, up 10% internationally from the same time a year earlier. Domestic distribution revenue was also up from a year ago.
Investors are focused on Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA)'s $43 billion acquisition of WarnerMedia that is expected to close in the second quarter, creating one of the world's largest media companies. The deal will combine Discovery's thousands of hours of reality programming with the Warner Bros. film and television studios, HBO and the former Turner Broadcasting networks.
Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav has been christened ""America's King of Content"" by Vanity Fair, but he will be inheriting the challenges that come with that crown. 
The abrupt exit of WarnerMedia's CNN chief Jeff Zucker after nine years at the helm of newsroom leaves the network without its seasoned leader as it prepares to launch a high-stakes streaming service.
The recent tumble in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s stock, after it forecast slowing subscriber growth for its first quarter, reflects Wall Street's gathering concerns about the economics of streaming. 

That is likely to put pressure on the new Warner Bros. Discovery and its marquee streaming service, HBO Max, to deliver bottom-line results in addition to subscriber gains.
Discovery said it ended the year with nearly $4 billion in cash on hand.

MILAN (Reuters) - European defence stocks were among the rare gainers in a falling market on Thursday on bets of bigger spending after Russian forces invaded Ukraine in the biggest attack in Europe since World War Two.
Shares in Britain's biggest defence company BAE Systems (OTC:BAESF) rose 4.8% to a one-year high and Germany's Rheinmetall gained more than 2%. France's Thales added 1% in late morning trading.
Shares in major U.S. defense contractors gained in premarket trading, with  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) and  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) rallying between 3% and 6%.
Investors expect defence companies to benefit from rising geopolitical tensions, with European and U.S. defence contractors well positioned, especially if NATO member states boost spending. 
""Invasion will likely result in NATO military involvement, initially benefiting short cycle product spending (weapons and ammunitions) and putting significant upward pressure on NATO defence budgets over the medium term,"" said Law Ross, analyst at Berenberg in London. 
Rheinmetall and BAE have the largest exposure to weapons and ammunition, while UK contractor Chemring along with BAE are most exposed to cyber security and electronic warfare, according to the German investment banks. Chemring rose 1%.
BAE said on Thursday that Russia's invasion of Ukraine would place a sharper focus on security, anticipating growth over the coming years across all sectors, with cyber intelligence also becoming globally relevant. 
Traders also highlighted that the industry's stock market valuations remain cheap, which could make it attractive for investors seeking to diversify away from pricey tech stocks. 
The European defence sector, which has been hit by ESG concerns and worries over budget cuts, trades at around a 20% discount to the market, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimates. 
Among other companies with defence exposure, shares in Ultra Electronics were little changed, while QinetiQ and  Meggitt  (LON:MGGT) fell slightly but still outperformed the steep market falls. European shares fell almost 4%.

The majority of NATO members including Germany spends in defence less than the targeted 2% of GDP. If all countries were to reach the target that would result in 73 billion euros in incremental defence spending, per Berenberg. 
In an unusual public rant a few hours after Russia invaded Ukraine, the chief of the German army vented his frustration over what he saw as the long-running neglect of military readiness in his country.

Sales rose 9.7% for the three months ending in December, far below the 40%-plus growth that was common before the government scrutiny began, as consumer spending slows and competition intensifies. Net income tumbled 74% to 20.4 billion yuan ($3.2 billion), after the company took a big hit from losses in its global investment portfolio.
Once the most valuable company in China, Alibaba has struggled since Beijing launched a sweeping crackdown on the private sector more than a year ago. The Chinese government forced Alibaba’s finance affiliate, Ant Group Co., to call off what would have been the world’s largest initial public offering in 2020, and then instituted a series of reforms that have undercut Alibaba’s business model.
Alibaba’s shares climbed less than 1% in pre-market trade. Annual active consumers rose 43 million to a better-than-expected 1.28 billion while cloud revenue jumped 20%.
Some analysts had expected the Chinese internet giant to again reduce its forecast for annual revenue, given weakening consumption and an uncertain regulatory environment.
The company warned in November that revenue growth for the fiscal 2022 year would be 20% to 23%, compared with the 27% that analysts had been projecting. Its valuation has dropped from a high of about $860 billion to $291 billion. In a sign of the times, liquor maker Kweichow Moutai Co. is now worth more than Alibaba.
Beijing’s crackdown isn’t over. Bloomberg News reported this week that Chinese authorities are asking the nation’s biggest state-owned firms and banks to start a fresh round of checks on their financial exposure and other links to Ant Group, according to people familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, market volatility has eclipsed Alibaba’s efforts to seek growth outside China. The company recently called off a fund-raising plan for its Southeast Asian retail arm after failing to secure an envisioned valuation.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Mercedes-Benz will focus on its most luxurious vehicles and bring more software in-house to tackle higher costs and supply chain bottlenecks which are likely to continue to weigh on returns, the company said on Thursday.
The carmaker saw sales drop 5% in 2021 as supply chain shortages constrained production and it continues to widen its source base for semiconductors and develop safety stock to protect against continued bottlenecks, CFO Harald Wilhelm said.
Despite supply constraints, the carmaker expects top-end vehicle sales to rise 10% this year as it prioritises delivery of its most expensive models over maximising unit sales, a strategy CEO Ola Kaellenius hopes will solidify Mercedes-Benz' image as a luxury company.
The cost of bringing software in-house was no more than bringing in different components from various partners, Kaellenius said, adding that it was a better way to control spending.
""Do you continue the path we have been on for the last 20-30 years, purchasing a patchwork of software... or do you take destiny in your own hands and make sure you have the core stack controlled by you?"" Kaellenius said.
The Mercedes-Benz Cars & Vans division more than doubled its annual adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to 13.9 billion euros ($15.61 billion) from 6.8 billion euros last year, lifted by revenue from top-end vehicle sales and electric passenger cars, which grew 30% and 64% respectively.
The company will propose a dividend of 5 euros per share for the year, a significant jump from last year's 1.35 euros. Around 0.7 euros of this will represent the Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) Truck dividend, as the truckmaker will not make a separate payout this year, the company said.

Revenue is expected to rise slightly this year compared with 2021 as supply chain bottlenecks ease but it was too soon to predict an end to the global semiconductor shortage, the company said.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China's Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd plans to achieve carbon neutrality in its operations and supply chain by the end of the decade, the firm said on Thursday.
The company, whose businesses range from messaging app WeChat to games and cloud-based services, is also committing to using green power for all its electricity by 2030. 
Tencent said it aimed to reduce energy consumption per unit of output in its operations and beef up use of renewable energy.
It will engage in green power trading and explore investments in renewable energy projects, as well as adopt carbon offsets for some business segments, while promoting a low-carbon ethos to its consumers and businesses. 
An internal review found the company's total greenhouse gas emissions were equivalent to 5.111 million tonnes of carbon dioxide last year, it said.
In comparison, fellow tech giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd said its greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 were 9.514 million tonnes. 
""Tencent itself wants to achieve carbon neutrality,"" said Xu Hao, a vice president of the firm's sustainable social value organisation, who leads its green initiatives.
""And ... we also hope to be able to support the country's overall tranformation to become carbon neutral."" 
Last year China said it aimed to become carbon neutral by around 2060, a goal that has put pressure on its biggest firms to prepare their own roadmaps to reach ""net zero"".
But China's big tech firms remain hugely dependent on its coal-dominated energy system and only a few have committed to switching to renewable sources of electricity.
In December, Alibaba said it was targeting the end of the decade to attain carbon neutrality in its operations while slashing supply chain and transport emissions.
In June, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) said it aimed for carbon neutral operations by 2030, but gave no specific goals.

On Thursday, Ye Ruiqi, project leader of environmental group Greenpeace, said Tencent was now stronger on supply chain commitments than Alibaba and Baidu.
However it hoped for more disclosures on financed emissions, as the firm was a major corporate investor worldwide.

The sum is the firm's largest fundraise to date and is more than twice the size of its previous flagship fund, which closed at $9.5 billion in April 2020.
Insight Partners, which now has more than $90 billion in regulatory assets under management, has also closed a co-invest fund that will participate in certain investments alongside the flagship fund. 
The fundraise comes after a banner 2021 for U.S. private equity, with dealmaking and exit activity posting its fastest pace in at least two decades, according to data from Pitchbook. 
High growth, technology companies drove much of that activity as demand for their services soared and valuations boomed. Insight Partners also invested more than $2 billion in European startups last year.
But fears of looming U.S. interest rate hikes to tame unruly inflation and geopolitical worries have weighed on technology stocks this year. 
Insight Partners, however, sees no cause for concern.

""Software as a basic model has been extremely resilient. We don't see any particular worries and we aim to be consistent in backing high-growth software companies,"" said Managing Director Teddie Wardi.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Anheuser-Busch InBev forecast on Thursday its profit would increase this year as consumers have more opportunities to drink outside of their homes after ending 2021 with stronger results than expected due to higher prices.
The world's largest brewer that makes Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) would rise by between 4% and 8% this year, in line with its medium-term growth target.
The Belgium-based brewer, with a large presence in the Americas, said this would be based on both higher volumes and prices, noting the forecast reflected its current view of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Unlike rivals Heineken (OTC:HEINY) and Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY), which warned spiralling price hikes could curb beer consumption, AB InBev's outlook did not mention global inflation or increased input costs.
Chief Executive Michel Doukeris told Reuters that inflation would definitely have an impact on consumers, but was not the only factor for 2022.
""There is a balance to that, which is occasions that were not part of last year that will be back in play this year,"" he said.
Doukeris gave the example of Chinese New Year, which was a much more normal celebration in 2022, and the reopening of venues and events in Europe.
In the United States, the company's biggest market, easing of restrictions meant 35% more beer was sold in bars and restaurants in the week of Super Bowl than in 2021, exceeding by 6% the pre-pandemic levels.
AB InBev shares gained shortly after trading opened, but were down 3.6% at 1130 GMT, in line with a general market sell-off triggeed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, neither of which are significant markets for the company. 

The group reported a 5% like-for-like increase in fourth-quarter EBITDA to $4.88 billion, above the 4% average forecast in a company-compiled poll.
The brewer sold more beer in 2021, but the major gain was from price hikes and a consumer shift towards its higher-priced ""premium"" brands, whose revenues grew by more than 20%. EBITDA for the year was up 11.8%, at the top end of the company's previous outlook of 10-12%.

The escalating crisis in Europe due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine adds further pressure on BBWI stock. 
The company plans to incur a capital expenditure of $400 million in the current year, almost double the amount ($205 million) it spent in 2021. There will be separate selling, general and administrative expenses with additional inflationary costs. All this will pressure margins, as it goes about setting up its own IT function and a new fulfillment center as well as new stores, the company said.
“In 2022, we are investing in the business to support long-term growth, and there are macro factors such as inflation that will impact our results,” the maker of fragrances and sanitizers said in its fourth quarter commentary.
The company is facing increased inflationary costs in raw materials, transportation, and wage rates and is countering that with price increases and “carefully managing promotional activity” but said it is going to be “thoughtful” about the former.
Gross margins in 2022 could thus be 3 to 4 percentage points lower than the recent year’s 49%. Sales are seen flat to 4% up on 2021 revenue of $7.9 billion.

937,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 06:44AM ET</span>",Exclusive-Tesla plans new Shanghai plant to more than double China capacity - sources,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc plans to start work on a new plant in Shanghai as soon as next month as part of a plan to more than double production capacity in China to meet growing demand for its cars in the country and export markets, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Once the new plant is fully operational, Tesla will have the capacity to produce up to 2 million cars per year at its expanded Shanghai facility, the company's main export hub, according to the people, who asked not to be identified in discussing still-private plans.
The new plant will be located in the vicinity of its existing production base in Lingang, Pudong New Area. 
Tesla declined to comment. 
The expansion, if it goes ahead, would give Tesla EV-dedicated production capacity in the world's largest auto market on a par with more established brands in China. 
In comparison,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp produced 1.6 million vehicles in China in 2021. General Motors (NYSE:GM) produced 1.4 million with its major Chinese partner SAIC Motor Corp . Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) plans to have capacity to make 1 million EVs in China by 2023.
The cost of the planned expansion and Tesla's timetable for completion were not immediately known.
Tesla started production at its Shanghai plant - also known as the Gigafactory 3 - less than a year after breaking ground. The plant makes the Tesla Model 3 sedan and the Model Y crossover.
Expansion plans for the existing plant aim to put Tesla on track to produce around 1 million vehicles this year, two sources familiar with the expansion plans told Reuters, though one said this also depended on the availability of parts. 
Tesla has projected to take its weekly production to about 22,000 vehicles at the plant in the coming months, one of the sources said. 
That production rate would amount to about 1.1 million vehicles over a year, more than double the plant's original projected capacity.
Reuters previously reported that Tesla could expand its capacity on the existing site. 
The Shanghai city government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Shanghai has been a supporter of Tesla's establishment of a wholly-owned factory in China - the first foreign auto plant not required to form a joint venture with a Chinese partner. 
In a regulatory filing with Shanghai earlier this week, Tesla said it planned to expand parts production at its Shanghai factory, hiring additional workers and running its factory for longer in a day, to meet growing export demand.
Tesla sales have surged in China and its Shanghai factory has become a crucial export hub to markets such as Germany and Japan. Last year, Tesla's China-made cars accounted for around half of the 936,000 vehicles it delivered globally, based on Reuters calculations using China Passenger Car Association data. 

Earlier this month, Tesla said its China revenue more than doubled in 2021 to $13.8 billion from the previous year. Elon Musk also said in October that Shanghai had surpassed its Fremont, California factory -- the company's first plant -- in output.
Tesla has faced delays in opening a plant in Germany. Musk had originally aimed to open a Berlin plant in July last year. Approval for the plant has been complicated by a court case challenging a licence granted to its water supplier.

Russia’s military attack on Ukraine has effectively shut Europe’s initial public offering market for now, just as bankers were gearing up for a busier March after a slow start to the year. 
Among the large IPOs set to kick off in the coming months were Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) electrolysis plant business Nucera, Eni SpA's (OTC:EIPAF) renewables division Plenitude and Olam International Ltd.’s food unit. 
But companies were already struggling to sell shares given the heightened market volatility triggered by tightening monetary policy. Now the escalating conflict in Ukraine adds to the darkening backdrop, making it unlikely big offerings can go ahead in the next few weeks.
“Timing is everything for an IPO,” said Susannah Streeter, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Plc. “Given the invasion in Ukraine has added to fuel to the volatility we have seen on financial markets since the start of the year, plans for fresh offerings are likely to be shelved until calm returns.”
About $3 billion worth of IPOs have priced on European exchanges this year, an 80% drop from the same period in 2021, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Several listing plans were scrapped, while those that braved volatile markets had to temper their valuation expectations to appease cautious investors.
“I would be surprised if many IPOs proceeded in the current tense environment,” said Gavin Launder, a fund manager at Legal & General Investment Management. “Europe will be more worried than the rest of the world due to proximity.”
The near-term calendar in Europe was already threadbare, with Italian green hydrogen specialist Industrie De Nora SpA the only notable deal in the market.
No market maker likes uncertainty when pricing an IPO, said Paul Go, global IPO leader at EY. “In the very short term, some of the bigger deals looking for a certain minimum valuation will be put on hold until the situation becomes clearer and stabilizes.”
It’s not just Europe’s IPOs that will be curtailed. Offerings in Asia, which have suffered from valuation mismatches between buyers and sellers this year, are likely to be affected.
The outlook for March IPOs in Asia “is not great,” said Brian Freitas, an Auckland-based analyst for independent research platform Smartkarma. “There could be more IPO plans shelved until the Ukraine situation settles down.”

OTTAWA (Reuters) - A three-week long protest in Canada against pandemic measures that snarled trade and shuttered Ottawa's core likely cost billions in trade delays, tens of millions in lost sales for businesses, and left behind a hefty policing and clean-up tab.
Hundreds of trucks and vehicles rolled into Ottawa's sleepy downtown on Jan. 28, blocking off key roadways as convoy members expressed their anger at government with loud, persistent horn honking before police cleared them on Sunday.
The biggest hit came from the multi-day blockades of three border crossings between Canada and the United States, which snarled an estimated C$3.64 billion ($2.86 billion) worth of goods.
The Ottawa occupation also shutdown Canada's fourth-busiest mall, the Rideau Centre, for 24 days, costing an estimated C$70 million in lost sales, according to the Retail Council of Canada. The closure also left scores of mall staff out of work.
With roads blocked off and protesters unwilling to follow basic public health order like masking indoors, many downtown stores and restaurants were also forced to close their doors.
Downtown residents and businesses have filed a C$306 million class action lawsuit against the ""Freedom Convoy"" for disrupting their lives and livelihoods.
For Happy Goat Coffee, which was forced to shutter three locations, the worst part was the timing. They were on the verge of reopening to in-person dining after being restricted to takeout for weeks due to the Omicron variant. 
""The employees, us, everybody was really looking forward to it. And all of a sudden, we get this. So it's really more damaging than just financially,"" said owner Henry Assad, who temporarily laid off 14 workers and estimates the three-week closure cost his business up to C$70,000 in lost sales.
Lost wages for downtown workers unable to pivot to remote work likely added up to about C$264 million, said economist Armine Yalnizyan in a Wednesday column for the Toronto Star newspaper.
The total bill for Ottawa tallied up to about C$30 million, the city's manager said on Wednesday, which included hefty policing costs. Ottawa Police said they spent more than C$14 million over the first 18 days alone. 
TRADE DELAYS
While the Ottawa occupation was disruptive for residents and local businesses, the impact to the broader economy was limited, Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Timothy Lane said last week, adding the border closures were more worrying.
The six-day closure of the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ontario, the busiest crossing between Canada and the United States, delayed roughly C$2.34 billion in trade, according to official estimates. 
Separate blockades at crossings in Emerson (NYSE:EMR), Manitoba, and at Coutts, Alberta, which ran for six and 18 days respectively, would have held up another C$1.3 billion in trade. 
GRAPHIC-Canada-U.S. trade snarled by trucker protests - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/TRUCKERS/zdpxokorxvx/chart.png 
Those closures forced some automakers and auto parts makers to temporarily halt production, and froze the transport of some agricultural products.
With Ottawa now cleared and traffic flowing at the borders, analysts do not expect a significant hit to economic activity for the month. 
Royce Mendes, head of macro strategy at Desjardins Group, estimates the impact at about a quarter of a percentage point of GDP in February, easily offset by the reopening rebound.

""The month was marked by a tailwind from reopening, so should reveal a solid economic rebound from January,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) -Rolls-Royce Chief Executive Warren East will step down by the end of the year after steering the aero-engine maker through the worst of the pandemic, though fresh challenges loom following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
Shares in the British group, which also has defence and energy businesses, dropped 16% to a seven month low in early Thursday trade as weaker-than-expected 2021 earnings, East's upcoming departure and geopolitical risks spooked investors. 
Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) burned through 5.5 billion pounds ($7.4 billion) of cash during the pandemic as its airline customers stopped or cut back flights. 
But East, who took the helm in 2015, delivered cost cuts of 1.4 billion pounds a year ahead of schedule. 
That, along with a recovery in civil aviation, helped cash flows turn positive in the third quarter of last year, and the CEO forecast 2022 as a whole would be modestly positive.
Still, East warned geopolitical uncertainty after Russia's invasion of Ukraine was ""fundamentally bad.""
From a Rolls-Royce perspective, Russia is less than 2% of total revenue, he said, but about 20% of its titanium comes from the country. ""We have been prudently building stocks as the situation has been developing over months,"" he told reporters.
After the cost cuts, East said a more efficient civil aerospace business was well placed for recovery. 
""It's poised for future growth as international travel rises. And it is rising: large engine flying hours rose 57% year-on-year in the second half of 2021,"" he said.
The end of 2022 was the ""right time"" to hand over to someone else, he said, adding he would leave Rolls-Royce operationally and strategically in a ""much better place"".
Underlying operating profit of 414 million pounds contrasted with a restated loss of 2 billion pounds in 2020, but fell short of analyst' expectations of 597 million pounds.

Free cash outflow of 1.44 billion pounds beat market expectations, however, and was also well ahead of the outflow of 4.18 billion pounds in 2020.

Investing.com – eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) stock plunged 9.92% in premarket trading Thursday, after its fourth quarter results and the annual outlook both proved the worst fears true, indicating that people are logging out from e-commerce websites to go out to shop.
E-commerce was the biggest winner of the pandemic as stuck-at-home consumers preferred online platforms to order clothes, groceries, and electronic items. With the gradual containment of the pandemic and users being tired of online activities, consumers are returning to stores.
Fourth quarter gross merchandise volume (GMV), a key benchmark defining the total value of goods and services sold on an online platform, fell 10% to go below $21 billion. The e-commerce firms’ revenue is derived from a percentage of GMV.  
Annual active buyers on the platform also declined 9% to 147 million in the quarter. The company expects more headwinds as costs weigh on margins.
“The second quarter should mark the low point for margins during the year as we lap difficult comps (comparisons) and ramp up our pace of investment,"" Reuters quoted Finance Chief Stephen Priest as saying.
Revenue in the fourth quarter rose 5% to $2.6 billion, just about matching expectations. Adjusted profit per share was $1.05 and beat estimates.
As the company’s core operations remain under pressure, CEO Jamie Iannone is banking on advertising and payments businesses to make up for it. The company's advertising offerings surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the year. With the complete transition of all sellers to a new payments platform, the company expects the shift to contribute to profits. 
The retailer is forecasting annual revenue of $10.4 billion and adjusted profit per share of $4.3 at the midpoint of its guidance range. GMV is seen between $78.3 billion and $80.5 billion.
In the current quarter, eBay expects adjusted profit of $1.01-$1.05 per share on revenue of $2.43 billion-$2.48 billion, both lower from a year ago."

LSEG said its LCH arm in the French capital was now connected to rival trading platforms Cboe Europe in Amsterdam and Aquis Exchange in Paris to clear their share trades.
Clearing ensures transactions are completed even if one side of a trade goes bust.
The EU has said market participants based in the bloc will not be allowed to use clearing houses like LCH's UK operation in London after June 2025 as it seeks to build up clearing capacity inside the bloc.
Connecting with two trading platforms inside the bloc will help bring in more volume to LCH in Paris as it faces a loss of business from pan-European exchange Euronext.

Euronext has said it will ditch LCH in Paris for clearing its trades by 2024, instead using its Italian clearing house acquired when it bought Borsa Italiana group from LSEG.
Euronext said it no longer wanted to rely LCH in Paris given LCH is owned by a group based outside the EU.

952,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 05:50AM ET</span>",Marketmind: War in Europe,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Sujata Rao
This is it. Putin has invaded Ukraine.
Markets are displaying all the predictable reactions, selling stocks and buying safe-havens. Treasury yields are down 10 basis points, while the Swiss franc and Japanese yen are up as is the dollar index. Gold has surged 2% and oil has jumped over $100 a barrel.
So what next? Economic recession? Central banks forced to stay their hand with interest rate rises? Market bets on a 50 basis-point Federal Reserve rate rise for March are fading and at least one ECB policymaker has already urging the bank to maintain its stimulus programme until year-end at least.
The obvious question that arises from the oil price effect is how much this aggravates inflation. And whether in that situation bonds will really prove the best safe-havens. Watch those central banks. 
It will also test the view that geopolitics are a buying opportunity. Will that hold true even as a situation described as the worst since the Cuban missile crisis unfolds? 
In the meantime, anyone who dismissed Western sanctions as toothless should glance at Russian asset prices. A country with a $640 billion warchest and debt ratios around 20% now carries a 5 percentage point yield premium on its dollar bonds relative to U.S. Treasuries. 
That's more than what's demanded of countries such as Iraq and Bolivia. 
But it's less about the sanctions that have been announced and more about the ones that may now rain down, including cutting Moscow off from international payment systems and banning holding any of its bonds. A firesale of Russian assets has accelerated and the rouble has slumped more than 7% against the dollar. 
All this of course will inflict pain on those doing the sanctioning too, above all, Europe where the euro has slipped to one-month lows. And don't forget the country under attack, Ukraine, whose dollar bonds now price a default on debt.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Thursday: 
-EU to launch new sanctions against Russia
- South Korea's central bank kept interest rates steady
-ECB board member Isabel Schnabel speaks
-Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic
-U.S. second estimate Q4 GDP/new home sales

-U.S. 7-year note sale

955,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 05:47AM ET</span>",Meta's Zuckerberg unveils AI projects aimed at building metaverse future,"By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) -Facebook-owner Meta is working on artificial intelligence research to generate worlds through speech, improve how people chat to voice assistants and translate between languages, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Wednesday, as he sketched out key steps to building the metaverse. 
Zuckerberg is betting that the metaverse, a futuristic idea of virtual environments where users can work, socialize and play, will be the successor to the mobile internet. 
""The key to unlocking a lot of these advances is AI,"" he said, speaking at the company's live-streamed ""Inside the Lab"" event. 
Zuckerberg said Meta was working on a new class of generative AI models that will allow people to describe a world and generate aspects of it. In a prerecorded demo, Zuckerberg showcased an AI concept called Builder Bot, where he appeared as a legless 3D avatar on an island and gave speech commands to create a beach and then add clouds, trees and even a picnic blanket.
""As we advance this technology further, you'll be able to create nuanced worlds to explore and share experiences with others, with just your voice,"" said Zuckerberg. He did not set a timeline for these advancements or give more details on how Builder Bot works.
He said Meta was working on AI research to allow people to have more natural conversations with voice assistants, a step towards how people will communicate with AI in the metaverse. He said the company's Project CAIRaoke was ""a fully end-to-end neural model for building on-device assistants."" 
A demonstration of the Project CAIRaoke tech showed a family using it to help cook a stew, with the voice assistant chiming in to warn that salt had already been added to the pot. The assistant also noticed they were running low on salt and ordered more.
Meta said it was using the model within its video-calling Portal device and aimed to integrate it into devices with augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). In an interview with Reuters, Meta's vice president for AI Jérôme Pesenti said it was tightly restricting the responses of its new CAIRaoke-based assistant until it could ensure that the system did not generate offensive language.
""These language models are very powerful ... so we are making a lot of effort to be able to control them,"" said Pesenti.
Zuckerberg also announced that Meta was working on a universal speech translator, aiming to provide instant speech-to-speech translation across all languages. The company previously set a goal for its AI system to translate all written languages.
The social media company, which recently lost a third of its market value after a dismal earnings report, has invested heavily in its new focus on building the metaverse and changed its name to reflect this ambition. This month Meta reported a 2021 net loss of $10.2 billion from its Reality Labs, the company's augmented and virtual reality business.
DIFFERENT BEAST 
Meta is exploring how artificial intelligence can be used to moderate content and activity in the metaverse, its AI head Pesenti told Reuters.
""We use a lot of AI for moderation on our main platforms ... the metaverse is a bit of a different beast, it's a lot more real-time,"" said Pesenti, who said this was ""evolving work"" and that Meta was still figuring out the policies for metaverse activity.
At the AI event, Zuckerberg said Meta was preparing for how AI could interpret and predict the types of interactions that would occur in the metaverse, by working on ""self-supervised learning"" - where AI is given raw data rather than being trained on lots of labeled data.
Zuckerberg said Meta was also working on egocentric data, which involves seeing worlds from a first-person perspective. He said it had brought together a global consortium of 13 universities and labs to work on the largest ever egocentric dataset, called Ego4D. 
Meta also said it would expand free education initiatives aimed at bringing more racial minorities into tech, which researchers say is critical to create AI systems free of bias. About 80% of data analytics and AI executives identify as men and 65% as white, according to a recent survey across the United States and Europe by recruiter Heidrick & Struggles (NASDAQ:HSII). 
In a nod toward transparency, Meta plans to make open source the recommendations library TorchRec that is uses to personalize products like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s news feed, said Pesenti in another event session. The company also will publish a feed ranking prototype to show how its algorithms prioritize which content it displays to users on Instagram, he said. 

Some of the projects Meta announced on Wednesday, such as Project CAIRaoke and the algorithm transparency effort, follow similar innovations announced in recent years by rivals such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google.
Meta also recently announced its research team has built a new artificial intelligence supercomputer that it thinks will be the fastest in the world when completed in mid-2022.

(Reuters) -Europe's biggest hotel group  Accor  (PA:ACCP) said on Thursday it was ""well on the way"" to more normal levels of activity this year after its core earnings swung back to profit in 2021, helped by higher absorption of fixed costs.
The travel and hospitality industry is still recovering from the pandemic while European countries make plans to ease COVID-19 restrictions due to a drop in coronavirus infections.
Accor, which runs high-end chains Sofitel and Pullman, as well as budget brands such as Ibis, said its business had started to recover in April despite the impact from the pandemic, leading to a significant pick up in activity.
The rebound paused in January due to the Omicron variant outbreak, but the month of February represented ""a turning point"", the French hotelier said.
By the end of 2021, average room rates came close to or even exceeded pre-COVID-19 levels thanks to an improvement in demand, Accor said. 
It flagged an impressive recovery in the Middle East region, which has benefitted from the world's fair Expo 2020 in Dubai.
TO HELP EMPLOYEES IN UKRAINE AND RUSSIA
Deputy CEO Jean-Jacques Morin told journalists the group owned seven hotels in Ukraine and about 55 in Russia, when asked about the ongoing crisis.
""We will follow last night's situation but the direct impact is very limited,"" Morin said.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sebastien Bazin said on a call with analysts that the group will provide help to its employees in Ukraine and Russia.
""I am putting aside that Ukraine and Russia is less than 1% of the net worth, because that is absolutely irrelevant. What’s relevant is that we have 2000 people in Russia, we have a couple hundred people in Ukraine and we care for them"", Bazin said.
""The most important thing for me and the teams of Accor is to make sure the people are safe, to make sure you talk to them, to make sure you provide whatever they need and to make sure they know that you are there,"" he added.
SHARES DROP
The group posted full-year earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 22 million euros ($24.69 million), bouncing back from a loss of 391 million a year earlier.
The group's revenue per available room (RevPAR), a key gauge of performance for the hotel industry, was down 46% in 2021 compared with the pre-pandemic level in 2019, reflecting the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic.
For 2022, the group forecast a 3.5% net growth in its hotels network against a 3% growth last year.
""By the end of the first quarter we will be back to pre-Omicron levels that we had at year-end,"", deputy CEO and Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Morin said referring to fourth-quarter numbers.
Morin added that the health situation is now significantly relaxed and said the company might provide new guidance with is first-half results.

Accor shares fell 7.4% to around 29 euros at 1012 GMT while France's SBF 120 index dropped 3.5%.

MILAN (Reuters) -Telecom Italia (TIM) is considering selling its stake in mobile tower group INWIT to French investment fund Ardian as part of its efforts to shore up its finances, a source close to the matter said on Wednesday.
Under such a potential deal, debt-laden TIM could raise 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) from the sale of its 15.4% indirect stake in Milan-listed INWIT, based on current market value.
 Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) and Ardian, which already owns a 15% indirect holding in INWIT, declined to comment. 
The potential INWIT sale, first reported by Italian daily La Repubblica, comes as new TIM boss Pietro Labriola is working on a standalone plan to be presented to investors next week as an alternative to a 10.8 billion euro takeover approach from U.S. group KKR.
Thousands of TIM workers who fear for their jobs in the upheaval at Italy's largest telecoms group went on strike on Wednesday.
""People working in customer care operations are the most exposed to jobs cuts if the management decide to break-up the group and sell its parts,"" said Isabella Marotta, 43, a Telecom Italia employee since 2005, who was protesting in Milan. 
Under Labriola's draft plans, TIM's domestic business would be split between a network business and a services arm in a bid to unlock value through M&A deals and assets disposals.
Under such a plan, the service arm would initially absorb some 15,000 out of about 42,000 Telecom Italia domestic workers while the remainder would be transferred to the network company, another source familiar with the matter said.
Underperforming a flat Italian blue chip index, TIM shares ended 3.3% down at 0.38 euros on Wednesday, below KKR's 0.505 euros a share proposal, which was billed as too low by Telecom Italia's top investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY). 
RESULTS LOOM
La Repubblica also reported on Wednesday that TIM is thinking about a balance sheet clean-up as its 2021 results will be worse then expected when they are published next week.
In December, TIM said it expected a “low-teens decrease” in 2021 organic earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation after leases (EBITDA-AL) for its domestic business.
TIM, which issued three profit warnings last year, is set to book new one-off provisions and asset impairments as part of 2021 results and will also scrap dividends on ordinary shares, another source said, confirming La Repubblica's report.

Analysts have also warned that TIM 2021 results are expected to be negatively impacted from a change in a tax scheme it had tapped in 2020, heightening the risk of a significant one-off hit to the bottom line.

959,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 05:42AM ET</span>",White House unveils more steps to strengthen U.S. supply chains,"By Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Thursday announced 10 new steps as part of its year-long drive to strengthen U.S. supply chains against climate shocks and geopolitical tensions, and ensure that China or others cannot weaponize supply chains against the United States.
Senior administration officials said the United States had made good progress since President Joe Biden signed an executive order one year ago that kicked off efforts to bolster domestic production of semiconductor chips, batteries for electric vehicles, rare earth minerals, and pharmaceuticals.
But they said more work was needed to address lingering supply chain challenges and strengthen the domestic industrial base - a process they said would yield some short-term gains but was also focused on longer-term structural changes.
Biden has been personally focused on rebuilding U.S. supply chains after acute supply shortages at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic squeezed the availability of masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment, and a dearth of semiconductors jacked up the cost of cars and sent inflation to 40-year highs.
While the push is aimed at yanking back from China the production of technology and other goods once dominated by the United States, it is also meant to make U.S. supply chains more resilient to climate change and other disruptions, natural or manmade, one of the officials said.
Seven Cabinet agencies were due to publish six reports mapping out plans to address weaknesses in some of the nation's most crucial supply chains, including transportation, health care, defense and food, the White House said.
One common thread is the need to help small and medium-sized businesses compete and break up the domination by a few large corporations of businesses including meatpacking and distribution, the White House said.
Key steps planned include:
- an Export-Import Bank initiative to boost financing for domestic production of semiconductors, biotech and biomedical products, renewable energy, and energy storage.
- expanding access to capital for small manufacturers through new and existing programs at the Department of the Treasury and the Small Business Administration, including $10 billion in American Rescue Plan funds.
- opening a $450 million Department of Transportation program to pay for improvements at U.S. ports, and funding for other transportation infrastructure projects under the bipartisan infrastructure law.

- a new ""Buy American"" rule due out in coming weeks that will offer enhanced price preferences and raise the domestic content threshold for a new category of critical products 
- use of the Defense Production Act to build and expand the health resources industrial base and reduce the current ""critical dependence"" on imports for key pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredients.

Investing.com – Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) stock traded 6% lower in premarket Thursday as the online travel agency lagged on crucial operational parameters even at the end of the fourth quarter.
The stock was under extra pressure due to the developing international crisis arising out of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Gross bookings, which represent all travel services excluding cancellations, increased 160% to $19 billion, Booking said.
While meeting Wall Street expectations, gross bookings are still behind pre-pandemic levels. They rose 160% to $19 billion in the fourth quarter, $1.7 billion short of the figure in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Similarly, room nights booked in October-December came to be 151 million, compared with estimates of nearly 166 million, according to a Bloomberg poll. Room nights booked in the same quarter of 2019 were 191 million.
In comparison, rivals Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) and  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) had beaten expectations while disclosing their recent quarterly results. Airbnb said it was benefiting from people looking to stay at rented properties for longer durations. They were also paying more, it said.
Chief Financial Officer David Goulden told analysts, the company is seeing stronger signs of a recovery underway this month. Room nights for the first half of February were close to 2019 levels, with particularly strong growth in the US, he said.
Booking Holdings’ total revenue in the fourth quarter climbed 141% to $2.98 billion. The company swung back to a net profit of $618 million in the quarter compared to a loss a year ago. On a per share basis, adjusted profit was $15.83; together with revenue, beat estimates."

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization is expected to rise 4-8% this year and annual revenue should expand by a higher percentage due to a “healthy combination of volume and price,” the maker of Hoegaarden and Leffe beers said while disclosing its fourth quarter results.
The company was silent on inflation in its outlook. This compares with rival Heineken's (AS:HEIN) February 16 warning about a significant impact due to inflation and supply chain pressures.
Higher prices were of no deterrence as volumes grew in both beer and non-beer segments. Total revenue in the fourth quarter jumped over 12% to top $14 billion as economies reopened, allowing people access to more places to indulge.
AB InBev said the combined revenue of its global brands, namely Budweiser, Stella Artois, and Corona grew more than 23% outside of their respective home markets in the fourth quarter, riding the price premium they enjoy there.
AB InBev’s ‘Beyond Beer’ business grew by over 20%, contributing $1.6 billion to annual revenue of over $54 billion. Revenue through the year grew nearly 16%.
The company reported a 5% like-for-like increase in fourth quarter EBITDA to $4.88 billion.
Underlying profit fell 8% to $1.48 billion as cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses grew at a faster pace than revenue. For the full year, underlying profit was $5.8 billion, up 15%."

The British company, which hires staff in several specialist sectors including technology, accounting and finance and life science, expects the operating profit for full-year to be between 210 million pounds to 215 million pounds ($283.1-$289.8 million), up from 200 million pounds it forecast in January. 
Hays said pre-tax profit soared to 97.7 million pounds ($131.8 million) for the six months ended Dec. 31, from 21.1 million pounds a year earlier on strong hiring in Germany and the UK, with higher demand from technology and Life Sciences sectors. It also rose 2.2% from pre-pandemic levels. 
""Performance in all regions was excellent, and our actions to capitalise on strong market conditions helped drive record half-year Group fees, including 21 country records, and the highest profit growth in our history,"" Chief Executive Officer Alistair Cox said in a statement. 
Recruiters across the globe are hurrying to fill up vacancies, as COVID-19-related restrictions ease and companies bring back employees to work from office. Last year, hiring firms struggled with a sharp drop in fees, which led some of them to down size their workforce. 
The company, which is largely focused on hiring for white-collar roles, added that its group finance director Paul Venables has decided to retire on Sept. 30 and James Hilton, an insider, will takeover the role.

By 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 3.5% lower, the CAC 40 in France dropped 3.2% while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 fell 2.8%.
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced earlier Thursday a military operation in eastern Ukraine, stating he was supporting separatists in the Donbas region while claiming he did not plan to occupy the country. 
However, the Ukraine government in Kyiv has called it a “full-scale invasion,” with military facilities, including airfields and anti-aircraft systems, targeted, and has declared martial law.
Global stocks have been on tenterhooks for weeks as Russia massed troops on the Ukrainian border, with investors trying to guess the full extent of Putin’s intentions.
The move was roundly condemned by Western leaders, and the market now awaits the full extent of the sanctions on Russia that are certain to follow and the potential impact they will have on global growth.
These geopolitical risks are to the fore of investors’ thinking Thursday, but the earnings season is also progressing with a number of European heavyweights having reported results.
 Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) stock rose 0.8% after the world's largest brewer forecast its profit would increase in 2022, after ending 2021 with stronger results than expected.
AXA (PA:AXAF) stock fell 4% despite Europe’s second biggest insurer more than doubling its profit from last year, amid fears the conflict would prompt additional claims.
Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) stock fell 3.9% despite reporting strength at its U.S. unit, T-Mobile, along with growth in European business.
 Accor  (PA:ACCP) stock fell 4% with the travel and leisure sector hit hard by today’s news, even as Europe's biggest hotel group said its core earnings swung back to profit in 2021.
WPP (LON:WPP) stock fell over 6% despite the world's largest advertising group reporting sales growth of over 12% last year while launching a new $1.1 billion share buyback for 2022.
Elsewhere, Uniper (DE:UN01) stock fell over 10% to a 14-month low as the German utility has substantial business in Russia and is one of the financial backers of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, work on which was halted on Wednesday.
Oil prices surged, with the Brent contract briefly topping $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014, after Russian troops moved into Ukraine, raising fears that global energy supplies will be disrupted.
So far, the Western powers have kept clear of the energy market for their sanctions on Russia, but more severe punishments now look likely. This means European countries are likely to have to look elsewhere for their energy supplies, further straining a tight market.
By 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 6.1% higher at $97.76 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 5.9% to $99.62.
Additionally, gold futures rose 1.8% to $1,945.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.7% lower at 1.1239."

969,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 03:26AM ET</span>",Ad group WPP posts 12.1% sales growth as clients spend on recovery,"By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) -WPP, the world's largest advertising group, said client demand for campaigns to justify price rises and maintain their recovery from the pandemic would enable it to grow above historic levels and return more cash to investors. 
The owner of the Ogilvy, Grey and GroupM agencies surpassed forecasts for its main net sales measurement and expanded its margins in 2021, while cost cuts boosted the balance sheet and enabled it to launch a new $1.1 billion buyback for 2022. 
Advertising holding companies such as WPP (LON:WPP), Omnicom Publicis and IPG have been in the vanguard of a corporate pandemic recovery as clients use their data, creative skills and strategic advice to produce and place new ad campaigns. 
Additional non-communication work has also helped pull the ad sector out of a period of stagnation that pre-dated the pandemic, as clients increasingly use them to build e-commerce platforms or digitise their businesses.
For 2022, the group is also likely to benefit from the global rise in inflation, as clients need to spend on marketing to explain and back their price rises. 
It won $8.7 billion of net new billings in 2021, and has recently benefited from retaining or winning new work from the likes of Unilever (NYSE:UL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). 
Chief Executive Mark Read, who replaced founder Martin Sorrell at the top of WPP in 2018 when the group was on a downward trajectory, said the highly cash-generative business was now outperforming peers and he entered 2022 with confidence. 
Analysts at Citi and Shore Capital described the results as strong but its shares, up 36% in the last year, were down 5% in a FTSE 100 down almost 3% after Russia invaded Ukraine. 
WPP said its main net sales metric - like-for-like revenue less pass-through costs - had risen by 12.1% in 2021, compared to an upgraded October forecast of 11.5% to 12%, driven by demand in the United States, Britain and China. 

For 2022 it forecast growth of around 5%.
""We feel that the company is in a very strong position,"" Read told Reuters.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's largest high street bank Lloyds (LON:LLOY) posted a jump in annual profits on Thursday but was dented by further costs for past misdeeds, as the lender laid out a fresh strategy under new CEO Charlie Nunn.
Lloyds reported a pretax profit of 6.9 billion pounds ($9.31 billion), below the 7.2 billion average analyst forecast compiled by the bank. 
Lloyds made a 1.2 billion pound profit a year earlier.
The bank said it would buy back 2 billion pounds of its own shares and pay a final dividend of 1.33 pence per share.
The profit miss was largely due to huge remediation charges of 1.3 billion pounds, including an additional 600 million for payouts and costs related to historic fraud at its HBOS Reading branch.
Lloyds' higher profit comes after similarly improved results from  Barclays  (LON:BARC), HSBC and NatWest, as Britain's economic rebound and higher central bank interest rates lift lenders' finances.
Thanks to the better outlook, Lloyds increased its key profitability goals, saying it now expects to make a return on tangible equity of more than 10% by 2024 and 12% by 2026.
Lloyds' results were boosted by the release of 1.2 billion pounds of reserves set aside to deal with pandemic loan defaults that did not materialise.
Nunn took over at Lloyds in August to replace Antonio Horta-Osorio, who left for a short-lived, scandal-tainted stint as chairman of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). 
He said the bank's strategy would involve a number of efforts to broaden its sources of income including: expansion in consumer products such as motor finance and home insurance; a new mass affluent wealth management offering; and efforts to digitise its small business banking platform.
Nunn said the bank would also try to boost income from its bigger corporate clients by building its cash management and debt finance business, reversing the trend of recent years where Britain's retail banks have pared back in corporate finance.

The sprawling group - which also includes banking brands Halifax and Bank of Scotland - has tried to ramp up fee income over recent years through insurance and pensions arm Scottish Widows and wealth joint venture  Schroders  (LON:SDR) Personal Wealth.

The construction, telecoms and media group posted a current operating profit of 1.69 billion euros ($1.90 billion), just beating its 2019 figure and analysts' 1.65 billion euro forecast, while its core profit margin rose to 4.5% exceeding its pre-pandemic figure by one percentage point.
Though sales and net profit saw a strong progression from 2020, when pandemic lockdowns put construction works on hold and restricted travel ate into telecom firms' lucrative roaming fees, they did not return to prior levels.
""Bouygues is well-positioned for 2022,"" Chief Executive Olivier Roussat said in a statement, adding that plans to buy energy services unit Equans and merge its TV arm with M6 should make the group more resilient and further expand its reach.
Bouygues aims to seal its acquisition of Equans - its largest ever - in the second half of 2022, while its subsidiary TF1, already France's top private TV operator, is planning to buy its next-biggest rival by the end of the year.
It said the 7 billion-euro Equans acquisition should make the group the world's No. 2 player in multi-technical services, poised to benefit from the transition to digital services and green energy.
Nevertheless, the firm said it had whittled down its net debt to a historically low level of 941 million euros, from 1.98 billion at the end of 2020, helped by a sale of shares it held in leading trainmaker  Alstom  (PA:ALSO).
The group proposed a dividend of 1.80 euros per share.

977,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 02:18AM ET</span>",Explainer-Why Europe’s mobile telecom market is ripe for consolidation,"By Supantha Mukherjee and Elvira Pollina
STOCKHOLM/MILAN (Reuters) - Talk of consolidation among European mobile carriers has grown louder with several executives voicing support as cut-throat price wars drive up debt and limit funds for 5G network upgrades. 
While Spain's Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) has been raising the topic of mergers for years, it has been joined only recently by the likes of Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) and Norway's Telenor.
The subject is likely to be high on the agenda when top telecom executives gather later this month at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, with Britain's Vodafone noting that the need for fast, reliable networks highlighted by the pandemic had helped regulators realise the value of investment.
WHY CONSOLIDATION?
The European telecoms market is highly fragmented with even small countries hosting as many as four mobile operators, many of which are saddled with debt and wary of upgrading their networks to 5G without a clear path to recouping the investment.
In contrast, in the United States for example, the three main operators have large customer bases and have been able to bring new services such as 5G to market faster.
At the end of 2021, 5G accounted for just 6% of all subscriptions in western Europe compared with a fifth in North America, according to the Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) Mobility Report. 
Analysts say that in smaller countries, fewer operators would make the market more lucrative.
WHAT IS THE MAIN CHALLENGE?
Mergers would reduce the number of operators and regulators are concerned that could lead to higher prices, less choice and a reduction in quality for consumers, particularly if two local players join forces in one market. 
ING analysts said companies should show any merger is beneficial to consumers and that cost savings could be used to fund network investment.
The European Commission, which in 2016 blocked CK Hutchison's purchase of Telefonica's British mobile unit O2 for $12.6 billion, said in November that it was reviewing its competition policy guidelines. 
""Regulators are not showing any particular willingness,"" said independent TMT adviser Massimo Comito, pointing to the billions of euros the European Union is making available for digitalisation and digital network upgrades. ""They remain keen to safeguard competition."" 
Telefonica later formed a joint venture with Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA) in Britain bringing together O2 and Virgin Media. 
WHAT ARE TELCOS DOING TO RAISE MONEY?
From major pan-European players to Sweden's Telia and South-east Europe's United Group, telecom operators have realised the value of their masts to infrastructure investors.
Telefonica sold its towers business for 7.7 billion euros, Vodafone raised billions by floating its infrastructure unit and Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) plans to sell its radio business soon. 
Ditching non-core assets is another option. 
WILL PRIVATE INVESTORS STEP IN?
Private investors have been at the forefront of recent European telco deal making, with Franco Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi taking Altice Europe private and then amassing a 18% holding in BT. 
Iliad's founder Xavier Niel last year completed a 3 billion euro bid to delist the firm, which is now circling Vodafone's Italian unit.
Providence, KKR and Cinven snapped up Spain's MasMovil for 5 billion euros in 2020 and Apax Partners and Warburg Pincus bought T-Mobile Netherlands from Deutsche Telekom for 5.1 billion euros last year.
While private equity firms don't face the same competition issues as established telco operators, they also don't have the same cost-saving opportunities that another local player could take advantage of in the event of a merger, said Nikos Stathopoulos, a partner at BC Partners and chairman United Group. 
WILL IT HAPPEN?
Vodafone Chief Executive Nick Read said the company was pursuing deals with rivals in multiple European markets, naming Britain, Spain, Italy and Portugal, while Orange has said France will ""inevitably"" see the number of operators fall from four to three.
Countries such as Germany, the UK, Spain and Sweden have four mobile operators but others such as Norway and Belgium have three.

Stathopoulos said it was ""very natural"" for four players to become three. 
""The bigger question is will the regulators be happy to go from three to two in some markets and will they still maintain that competitive tension?""

978,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 02:11AM ET</span>",Vodafone under pressure to test Europe's appetite for telecom takeovers,"By Paul Sandle and Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) boss Nick Read believes competition regulators have eased their opposition to takeovers; all that remains is to test the theory by triggering a deal that could lead to a wave of European consolidation and appease long-suffering investors.
Read said this month he was pro-competition, but that ""hyper competition"" in some European mobile markets was crippling the industry's ability to build the digital networks needed to keep pace with the United States and Asia.
Two decades ago, Vodafone set the benchmark for huge merger deals by buying German mobile operator Mannesmann for more than 100 billion pounds ($135 billion). But after years lagging its rivals, the company is under pressure to simplify its portfolio and improve returns.
Takeovers and joint ventures, say Vodafone and rivals including Orange, Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) and Telefonica (NYSE:TEF), would help fix a fragmented market in which returns often do not cover the cost of capital. 
That is something that must change as Europe recovers from the pandemic and it's a topic likely to be high on the agenda when top telco executives meet at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next week.
A mininum of four operators in major markets has long been a core tenet for regulators, particularly Europe's Margrethe Vestager. But as the political focus shifts to the need for investment, the competition supremo is sending mixed signals. 
""It's going to take a brave CEO to go and test them and Nick is revving himself up to go and test Vestager for sure,"" the chief executive of one European telecoms group told Reuters. 
The arrival of Europe's biggest activist investor Cevian has added to the impetus for change at Vodafone, which has 44.3 billion euros of net debt and has suffered a 17% drop in its share price since Read took over in 2018.
Vodafone's regulatory chief Joakim Reiter said policymakers had recognised the need to support the sector, for example by designing spectrum auctions to encourage investment.
Consolidation was the next step, he said. 
""Just three years ago, four players (in a market) seemed almost a religion,"" he said in an interview. ""But actually everyone is now saying let's be factual about it, we will look at it, we will see the impact it will have.""
The person who will decide is Vestager, the European commissioner for competition who has not been afraid to take on the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). 
She told Reuters Breakingviews this month that she did not do ""magic numbers"", preferring ""market analysis"".
But before companies and bankers become too excited, she added: ""So far our experience still holds true that it is competition that pushes for investment rather than consolidation.""
Britain's telecoms regulator said this month it was not wedded to retaining four networks, seven years after it was vocal in opposing Hutchison's acquisition of Telefonica's UK unit O2, which was blocked by Europe.
The block was annulled last year, and although the ruling came too late for that deal, analysts say a review this year will give more clarity on the legal position around mergers.
SPANISH EXIT
Out of Vodafone's 21 operating countries, Read has identified four - Italy, Spain, Britain and Portugal - that would benefit from consolidation, and said he was in talks with ""multiple players in multiple markets"".
Portugal has three network operators, the others have four.
Bankers and one Vodafone source said it made sense to first strike a deal in Spain, where Orange, Vodafone and MasMovil have all looked at combining in different ways. 
One Vodafone investor, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the company had no option but to sell Spain. Top 10 investor Abrdn said it backed Vodafone's plan to strike deals and create value in general. 
A quick fix in Spain would buy Vodafone time in Italy, where it recently rejected an 11 billion euro offer from Xavier Niel's challenger Iliad and Apax Partners.
Cut-throat competition has defined both markets with telecoms sector revenue in Italy down almost a third between 2010 and 2020, and Spain losing 26%, according to Italian industry group Asstel.
A joint venture or other tie-up in Italy would allow Vodafone to participate in a more rational three-player market after eight straight quarters of falling earnings in the country. However, it would not reduce the complexity of the overall group nor deliver the cash lump sum that would come with a sale of the local business. 
""You're basically cutting your losses and moving on with no upside,"" the telecoms CEO said. ""It's a tough choice, but I think he's going to have to do one of the deals quickly.""
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Jakob Bluestone said that from an antitrust point of view, some combinations would probably still be challenging.
""The only way Vodafone and the rest of the industry will ever find out if there has actually been a change or not, is to bring a case to Brussels,"" he said. ""If you don't play, you can't win."" 
In his defence, Vodafone would argue Read, the company's 58-year-old former finance director, has already simplified the portfolio, grouping African assets in one entity and listing the company's towers business. 
Last year an analyst asked Read whether Vodafone, the company that spread its red logo around the world through some of the biggest corporate transactions in history, still had the confidence to reshape the industry once again. 

""We're a brave telco,"" Read replied.

980,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 01:46AM ET</span>","Cash in hand, Getlink beats expectations but stays quiet on guidance","(Reuters) - Getlink's annual revenues and core profit slightly beat market expectations on Thursday due to cost control though the operator of the Channel Tunnel stayed mute on its guidance.
The group, which has not provided an outlook since October 2020, said it would share full-year targets when coronavirus trends, which it qualified as ""currently positive"", were confirmed.
""Only the possibility of a sixth COVID-19 wave keeps us very attentive to the health situation,"" Chief Executive Officer Yann Leriche told journalists in a call.
Getlink, which serves high-speed trains between London and mainland Europe, saw on-and-off restrictions dent traffic in the past two years, and it got caught in the crossfire of a post-Brexit tug-of-war between France and Britain.
""In 2021, we didn't burn any cash on the core business, which is a remarkable performance in view of the year we have experienced,"" Leriche said as the company posted a positive free cash flow of 21 million euros.
For the year ended December, Getlink reported revenues of 774 million euros ($875.32 million), against a forecast of 770 million by analysts in a company-compiled consensus.
The group said traffic recovered significantly in the first weeks of 2022, which it attributed to a gradual lifting of travel curbs and smooth reintroduction of EU-UK customs controls. 
Getlink's annual net loss however widened to 229 million euros, from 113 million euros a year earlier.

981,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 01:41AM ET</span>","'Contrarian' quant giant Dimensional focuses on U.S. curve short end, corporate debt","By Davide Barbuscia
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dimensional Fund Advisors, a pioneer of quantitative investment with $680 billion in assets under management, has increased exposure to the short end of the U.S. Treasury curve and to corporate debt, an executive said, seeing opportunities in parts of the debt market that have broadly sold off this year.
U.S. Treasuries yields, which move inversely to prices, have been rising fast this year as unrelenting inflation has fueled expectations of interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Corporate bond spreads, or the interest rate premium that investors demand to hold corporate debt over safer Treasuries, have widened amid uncertainty over how aggressive the Fed will be in tightening financial conditions.
But for Dave Plecha, global head of fixed income at Austin, Texas-based Dimensional Fund Advisors, the shift of the U.S. central bank toward less accommodative monetary policy has been fully priced in.
""We are big believers in market prices, and the market is setting a price on what they think the Fed is going to do, and we accept that,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
Dimensional's investment strategy is based on the application of the efficient market hypothesis, which posits that asset prices reflect all the available information about expected returns. A member of its board of directors is economist Eugene Fama, a Nobel laureate whose research gave birth to quantitative investing - an approach that relies on complex mathematical models and algorithms based on historical data.
Plecha said shorter-dated U.S. government bonds are now expected to provide better returns than long-dated ones, and he has therefore in recent weeks increased exposure to Treasuries with tenors of around three years.
""We have a systematic approach that says when curves are steep, we're going to go out. ... There are decades worth of data that show that on average, when yield curves are steep, you collect higher average returns for being farther out than being shorter,"" he said. ""When curves are flat there is no evidence that supports a higher expected return by moving out a flat curve or an inverted, downwards yield curve.""
The shape of the Treasury yield curve has been generally flattening this year. A closely watched part of the curve measuring the spread between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes shows the gap at roughly 38 basis points, nearly 40 points lower than where it ended 2021.
Dimensional has also increased exposure this year to corporate debt with various risk profiles, despite corporate bonds having dropped in price significantly year-to-date.
""When we see widening spreads, we're not running from that market, we're heading towards it,"" Plecha said.
As spreads widened this year, Dimensional increased allocations to single-A and triple-B credits, as well as, in some cases, to riskier double-B-rated debt, he said.
""Some people say that feels a little contrarian, and I get that comment because they're widening out because on average people are reducing or getting out of credit. ... And we're saying, this is now when we want to go in.""

(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc labor organizer Christian Smalls was arrested on Wednesday, accused of trespassing when he delivered warehouse workers food as part of a high-profile union campaign he is leading.
Smalls, a former Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) employee, and two other individuals have been charged with obstructing governmental administration, said Lt. John Grimpel of the New York City Police Department, adding that Smalls was also charged with resisting arrest and trespassing.
The other two individuals were Amazon workers, an advocacy group said. Smalls said all three were later released, adding that he disputed the charges and would continue his battle in court.
Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said Smalls has ""repeatedly trespassed despite multiple warnings."" The company had not contacted the police about its own employees.
Thirty-three year-old Smalls' quest to make Amazon's JFK8 Staten Island warehouse a unionized facility will come to a head when workers vote starting March 25.
A second closely watched election is currently occurring at Amazon's Bessemer, Alabama warehouse, with vote-by-mail being accepted until March 25 and the vote count starting March 28. Last year, workers at that warehouse voted against unionizing.
A majority vote to unionize at either facility would mark Amazon's first organized workplace in the United States and a milestone for those seeking to invigorate the American labor movement.
Reached by phone, Smalls said he brought food on Wednesday afternoon for current employees to distribute, something he has done for months. The break-room meals are the ALU's chance to share literature and build relationships with workers, he said.
But this time, Smalls said the Amazon manager who had fired him two years ago told him to leave, later calling the police.
""I'm literally a visitor. Do y'all call police on taxi drivers and Uber (NYSE:UBER) drivers who wait for associates?"" Smalls said, adding Amazon wanted to ""increase the intimidation factor"" through his arrest. Amazon had no immediate comment on Smalls' claim.
His clashes with Amazon date back to March 2020 when the company terminated him for protesting at JFK8 despite being on a paid quarantine. Smalls then sued Amazon, alleging it fired him because he is Black and had opposed discriminatory COVID-19 policies. A federal judge dismissed the complaint this month.
Sienna Fontaine, general counsel for advocacy organization Make the Road New York, said: ""The people that Amazon is throwing in jail are fighting for better working conditions and should be treated with respect and dignity.""

Smalls said the arrest would not stop him from organizing at the warehouse.
""I’m on my way there now,"" he said, shortly before 10 p.m. Eastern Time. ""I’m going to bring more food for the night shift.""

""Based on current conditions in the Bay Area, we're pleased that our employees who choose to come in now have the ability to access more onsite spaces and services to work and connect with colleagues,"" the company's spokesperson said in a statement.
Google and other big tech companies have said they expect offices to be a major part of its workplaces even as they allow remote working for many staff, and in-office perks long associated with the tech industry could be a key way to draw people back.
Those who enter Google's work sites will be required to be fully vaccinated or have an approved exemption, the company said, adding that wearing masks will be required in its Santa Clara County offices due to local regulations.
Google also said it is lifting its temporary weekly COVID-19 testing policy for those accessing its offices in the United States that was implemented in January.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Thursday morning, with the focus squarely on the crisis in Eastern Europe. Separatists in eastern Ukraine have asked Russian President Vladimir Putin for help, which could mean Russian troop deployments.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.89% by 9:49 PM ET (2:49 AM GMT)
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 1.71%, with the Bank of Korea keeping its interest rate unchanged at 1.25% as it handed down its policy decision earlier in the day.
In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 slid 2.42%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.87%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.26% and the Shenzhen Component edged down 0.17%.
Separatist leaders from Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions, or Donbass (Donbas)), have sought Russian help to repel Ukrainian forces. Russia's upper house, the Federation Council, recently gave Putin unanimous approval to deploy ""peacekeepers"" to the Donbas and potentially into other parts of Ukraine. However, Russia continues to deny U.S. warnings that it plans to invade Ukraine.
The West has also expanded sanctions against Russia, with the U.S. joining German sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline linking Russia and Germany.
Worries that commodity prices will be impacted by the situation in Ukraine continue to drive high inflation and could force central banks to tighten monetary policy further.
Oil was up on Thursday, with investors calculating the potential risks to Russian energy exports against the potential release of some strategic reserves to restrain prices.
“Expect volatility to really persist in the next few months,” BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) Investment Management senior market strategist Lale Akoner told Bloomberg. Geopolitical risks are flaring at a “very inopportune time” since markets are grappling with receding stimulus support, she added.
Although Putin remains open to “diplomatic solutions”, Russia’s interests and security must be guaranteed, he insisted. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his country poses no threat to Russia but would defend itself if attacked in an address to the nation.
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said she is monitoring the situation but has not yet seen anything that would prevent her from backing an interest-rate hike in March 2022.
“Policy mistakes at this point in time are almost guaranteed,” Banríon Capital Management president Shana Sissel told Bloomberg. “The question isn’t, is there going to be a policy mistake, but how bad will it be? Will the Fed hike too much too fast, will they front-load everything?”
Daly’s Fed colleagues, Loretta Mester and Raphael Bostic, will speak later in the day.
On the data front, U.S data, including the GDP and new home sales, is due later in the day. Further data, including durable goods orders, the PCE price index (PCE deflator), and University of Michigan consumer sentiment is due a day later.

Despite dire-sounding language in the FAA airworthiness directive issued on Wednesday about potential effects on 737 landings, it does not apply to aircraft flying into areas where the 5G environment has been rendered safe for aviation, which the FAA said includes nearly all airports.
The overwhelming majority of commercial airports have either established 5G wireless buffer zones around them or lack 5G operations altogether, meaning that planes landing there are protected from radio interference warned about in the FAA directive, agency officials said on Wednesday.
The FAA said the directive posted on Wednesday for most of Boeing's 737 aircraft is very similar to notices issued previously for 737 MAX aircraft, as well as 747, 757, 767 and 777 jetliners.
However unlikely as a practical matter, Wednesday's directive warns that certain airplane systems may not properly function ""during approach, landings, and go-arounds"" due to interference with radio altimeters from wireless broadband operations in the 3.7-3.98 GHz frequency band (5G C-Band).
This in turn could lead to ""increased flight crew workload while on approach with the flight director, autothrottle, or autopilot engaged, which could result in reduced ability of the flight crew to maintain safe flight and landing of the airplane,"" the directive said.
The notice affects some 2,400 airplanes in the United States and about 8,300 worldwide, the FAA said.
A Boeing spokesman said in a statement: ""we support the Airworthiness Directive, as it mandates the same guidance that Boeing provided to operators back in January"".
Telecommunications networks are rolling out next-generation 5G systems that the FAA has previously warned could impact sensitive airplane electronics such as radio altimeters.

The Federal Communications Commission and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NITA) have vowed to improve coordination on spectrum management after a dispute over 5G aviation. 
The spectrum rolled out in January, but only after  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) agreed to delay deploying 5G wireless towers near airports.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - South Africa's biggest construction firm Wilson Bayly Holmes - Ovcon Ltd (WBHO) said it is pulling out of Australia, saying the country's ""hardline"" COVID-19 response had impacted its property market and created business uncertainty.
The move amounts to one of Australia's most visible corporate casualties linked to the pandemic and undercuts government claims that stimulus programs through two years of stop-start lockdowns saved businesses and jobs.
In a Johannesburg Stock Exchange filing, WBHO said it pulled financial support for Australian unit Probuild and put it into external administration because ""project delivery capability ... has been negatively affected by unforeseen and severe COVID-19 restrictions"" and risk outweighed reward.
WBHO said it expected to post a loss for July-December because of trading losses, an impairment charge and unrecoverable ""tax assets"" in Australia. Its shares fell 27% on the news, their biggest decline since 1998.
The builder in a separate statement said the government's ""hardline"" COVID-19 response of border closures, lockdowns and enforced work-from-home had ""a considerable impact on property markets as well as other industries such as the leisure industry"".
Restrictions had ""created high levels of business uncertainty in Australia and have significantly reduced demand and delayed the award of new projects in these key sectors of the construction industry,"" it said.
Probuild, which was started in 1987, has been working on several high-profile commercial projects including new headquarters for biopharmaceutical giant CSL (OTC:CSLLY) Ltd, having built a police headquarters in the second-most populous state, Victoria.
A year ago, the government blocked a A$300 million ($217 million) buyout of Probuild by China State Construction Engineering Corp Ltd on national security grounds.
A spokesperson for Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who blocked the sale, declined to comment.

Probuild's administrator Sal Algeri, of Deloitte Turnaround & Restructing, in a statement said he would assess the builder's financial position and begin work on finding a new owner.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on the company in charge of building Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, expanding penalties on Moscow after it recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.
The sanctions, which target the Nord Stream 2 AG company and its CEO, Matthias Warnig, add to pressure on the Baltic Sea project that was designed to double the gas flow capacity from Russia to Germany.
Europe's most divisive energy project, Nord Stream 2 has not begun operations pending certification by Germany and the European Union.
Germany on Tuesday halted the pipeline, worth $11 billion, citing Russia's actions toward Ukraine. The United States and the EU worry the pipeline will increase Europe's dependence on Russian energy supplies and deny transit fees to Ukraine, host to another Russian gas pipeline.
In a statement on Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden said his administration had been closely coordinating Nord Stream 2 action with Germany, adding: ""Today, I have directed my administration to impose sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG and its corporate officers.""
Biden added: ""These steps are another piece of our initial tranche of sanctions in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine. As I have made clear, we will not hesitate to take further steps if Russia continues to escalate.""
The U.S. Treasury Department issued a general license authorizing the ""wind down"" of transactions with Nord Stream 2 AG until March 2.

The sanctions did not affect Gerhard Schroeder, a former German chancellor and a close friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin's who has headed the shareholders committee of Nord Stream since 2005.
Nord Stream 2 AG is a registered Swiss firm whose parent company is the Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP). Gazprom owns the entire pipeline but paid half the costs, with the rest shared by Shell (LON:RDSa), Austria's OMV, France's Engie and Germany's Uniper and Wintershall DEA.

DETROIT (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co has no plans to spin off its electric vehicle or gasoline-powered vehicle businesses, Chief Executive Jim Farley said on Wednesday.
""We have no plans to spin off our electric business or our ICE (NYSE:ICE) business,"" Farley said at a Wolfe Research conference appearance that was webcast, using an acronym for internal-combustion engine.
""We know our competition is Nio (NYSE:NIO) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and we have to beat them, not match them,"" he added. ""And we also have to beat the best of the ICE players.""
Some investors have pushed Ford and rival General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) to spin off their EV operations as a way to better tap into the full value of those businesses. EV leader Tesla Inc is the most valuable automaker in the world.
Ford previously denied reports it was considering spinning off its EV or internal-combustion engine operations. The U.S. automaker said last month it will have the annual capacity to build 600,000 EVs globally within 24 months. 
Farley said on Wednesday that his management team believes the U.S. automaker's EV and ICE businesses are underperforming on an earnings basis. 
The CEO also said Ford believes it can drive a lot more cost out of its traditional ICE business through better quality, lower structural costs and reduced vehicle complexity. 
""We have too many people, we have too much investment, we have too much complexity and we don't have expertise in transitioning our assets,"" Farley said of the internal-combustion business. ""That's the simple answer. There's waste.""
""To get the margins (on electric vehicles) ... that we see at a company like Tesla, we need to have real experts that can drive that scale,"" he said, adding that Ford needed to hire more people who work in the areas of electrical components, advanced electrical architectures and the digital customer experience. 

On the EV side of the business, Farley said Ford is working on deals to secure supply of key raw materials for batteries such as lithium, nickel, rare earths and copper to minimize risk. 
On the vehicle distribution side, he said Ford needs to eliminate ""ungodly expensive"" inventory from the system and make it easier for consumers to reserve and track the assembly of a vehicle before its delivery.

A correction is confirmed when an index closes 10% or more below its record closing level.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - IKEA said on Thursday it would invest £1 billion ($1.4 bln) in London over three years, as it opened the doors to its first high street IKEA store in Britain, anchoring its first-ever inner-city mall, in the capital's Hammersmith district.
IKEA, known for its giant out-of town warehouse stores, is in the midst of a strategy shift towards smaller inner-city locations and more digital and other services as it adapts to new shopping habits. 
Ingka Group, the owner of most IKEA stores world-wide, and also of IKEA store-anchored shopping malls across Europe, Russia and China, opened the first of its new, smaller inner-city store formats in Paris in 2019. 
The planned investments in London would be in existing and new stores, distribution and delivery services as well as various pilot trials, it said on Thursday as it inaugurated the Hammersmith store and mall. 
""Using London as a test-bed for innovation, the retailer will trial and develop new formats and initiatives,"" it said in a statement. 
The next inner-city IKEA store in London is due to open in the autumn of 2023, Ingka Group said, on Oxford Circus where it bought an iconic building in 2021.
Cindy Andersen, head of malls subsidiary Ingka Centres, said the mall in Hammersmith was now fully let, against a 25% vacancy when Ingka bought it in late 2019, defying a commercial property market downturn. 
She predicted the redeveloped mall - or ""meeting place"" as Ingka itself calls its malls - to double annual footfall, compared with 2019 figures, to 6 million. 
""Fundamentally, our belief is still that people want to be with other people, to experience exciting spaces, to gather"", she said, adding that the aim was to create places that people would visit every day rather than once a week.
Ingka Centres' second inner-city location to open was now expected to be in San Francisco, where it is redeveloping an ailing mall bought in 2020 despite deeply depressed retail markets and uncertainty caused by the pandemic.

Ingka Group's malls, as well as its IKEA stores, are recovering well from the depths of the pandemic. Andersen told Reuters tenant sales in November-December, the important festive period, were up 25% globally from a year earlier, and up 8% from pre-pandemic 2019, to 1.3 billion euros.

Pent-up demand and easing COVID curbs have in recent months sparked a surge in flight and hotel room reservations despite a temporary setback from the winter surge of the Omicron variant. 
""We are still in a potentially volatile environment with high COVID infection rates in some part of the world and geopolitical uncertainty that could impact our business, especially in Europe,"" said David Goulden, chief financial officer of Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG). 
Online travel agency Bookings said it continues to grow its alternative accommodation supply with people still working remotely and workplaces moving to a more hybrid environment. 
""The segment is a new one, which is called many different names such as 'bleisure' - business and leisure. We're going to see a lot more of it in the future,"" Glenn Fogel, chief executive officer of Booking, told Reuters. 
Gross travel bookings soared 160% to $19 billion from the prior quarter. Gross bookings for the summer are higher than 2019 levels, led by strong bookings in Western Europe, the company said. 
Excluding items, profit came in at $15.83 per share, compared with analysts' estimates of $13.64, according to Refinitiv data. Revenue of $2.98 billion also beat estimates of 13.64 billion.

Net income was $618 million, or $14.94 per share, in the three months to Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $165 million, or $4.02 per share, a year earlier. 
Shares of the Norwalk, Connecticut-based company were down 4.3% to $2,363 after the bell, amid a weaker broader market as Ukraine declared a state of emergency and the U.S. State Department said a Russian invasion of Ukraine remains potentially imminent.

The failed proposal highlights an uphill battle for Brazil's beef industry, the world's No. 1 exporter, to overcome concerns that it is contributing to deforestation of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest through its opaque and poorly regulated network of suppliers.
In a statement, IDB said it had carried out due diligence last year on Marfrig's ""Verde+"" program, which is designed to improve sustainability of its Brazilian beef supply chain. 
IDB said as part of its internal review process, Marfrig and the lender came to ""a mutual agreement that the conditions were not ideal to move forward with the loan."" 
Marfrig said the suspension of the talks regarding the IDB loan was due to ""a disagreement between the parties on the proposed financial conditions.""

Brazil has one of the world's biggest cattle herds, which has grown dramatically in the Amazon region in recent years as ranchers expand on illegally deforested land, enabled by weaker environmental enforcement under President Jair Bolsonaro.
Meatpackers such as Marfrig have stepped up vetting of their direct suppliers to be sure they comply with environmental laws, but it has proven harder to track the status of the ""indirect suppliers"" providing cattle to those ranches.

1001,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 07:26PM ET</span>","Irish regulator could halt Facebook, Instagram EU-US data flows in May","By Padraic Halpin
DUBLIN (Reuters) - EU-U.S. data transfers by Meta owned Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram could be halted as soon as May but the move would not immediately hit other big tech companies, Ireland's data privacy regulator said in an interview. 
Europe's highest court ruled in 2020 that an EU-U.S. data transfer pact was invalid due to concerns that U.S. government surveillance may not respect the privacy rights of EU citizens.
That prompted Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), Meta's lead regulator in Europe, to issue a provisional order that the mechanism Facebook and Instagram uses to transfer data from European Union users to the United States ""cannot in practice be used.""
The order, which does not apply to WhatsApp as it has a different data controller within the Meta group, was frozen following a legal challenge but resumed last May when the Irish High Court dismissed Meta's claims.
An updated decision could be shared with fellow EU regulators in April and if none of them lodge an objection, ""the earliest time we could have a final decision could be the end of May,"" Helen Dixon told Reuters. Any objection could add some months to the timeline.
""If there were a scenario where data flows were deemed illegal and required a halt, obviously the impacts would be huge,"" she said. 
But there is no way that the probe could lead to an automatic halt of similar data flows at Meta's large rivals, many of whom also have their European headquarters in Ireland. 
""The decision that the DPC will ultimately make in relation to Facebook will be specific to Facebook and addressed only to Facebook,"" Dixon said. 
""The consequence of the CJEU (Court of Justice of the European Union) decision is that we can't make a broader and more sweeping finding. We have to go company by company by company,"" she said.
There are ""hundreds of thousands of entities"" that would potentially have to be looked at, Dixon added, starting with other large internet platforms.
Meta has warned a stoppage will likely leave it unable to offer significant services such as Facebook and Instagram in Europe without a new transatlantic data transfer framework.
There is a parallel political process between the U.S. Commerce Department and the EU Commission on such remedies, but the Irish regulator has not been informed of progress. 
Dixon's office has so far completed just two investigations of multinationals under new EU privacy rules introduced in 2018, including hitting WhatsApp with a 225 million euro fine last year. 

In 2022 the DPC is likely to complete nine or 10 of the 30 open probes, Dixon said, an acceleration she attributed to the near doubling of its staff in three years and would act as an answer to critics who say her office is under-resourced to deal with the huge work flow. 
Staffing is set to increase to 260 by the end of 2022 from 195 currently and just 27 in 2014 but will have to continue to rise for ""years to come"", Dixon said.

1003,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 07:18PM ET</span>",Prosecutors leading New York criminal probe into Trump resign,"NEW YORK (Reuters) -Two prosecutors who had been leading the Manhattan district attorney's criminal probe into former U.S. President Donald Trump and his business practices have resigned, the district attorney's office said on Wednesday.
The departures of Special Counsel Carey Dunne and Mark Pomerantz came less than two months after District Attorney Alvin Bragg assumed office, taking over a probe into Trump and his family business, the Trump Organization.
""We are grateful for their service,"" said Danielle Filson, a spokeswoman for Bragg, referring to Dunne and Pomerantz. She added that the investigation was ongoing.
Bragg had indicated to the pair that he had doubts about pursuing a case against Trump, the New York Times said, citing people with knowledge of the matter.
Dunne and Pomerantz could not immediately be reached for comment. Pomerantz had been brought in from an outside law firm to work on the probe.
Ron Fischetti, a lawyer for Trump, called the departures a sign that Bragg would not bring criminal charges against the former president, though nothing was official.
""In my mind the case is over,"" Fischetti said. ""There's no question in my mind that they did it because there wasn't a case that they could prove, and there was no purpose in them staying there any longer.""
Neither the Trump Organization nor its lawyer Alan Futerfas immediately responded to requests for comment. 
The resignations come as New York Attorney General Letitia James ramps up her civil probe into Trump and his namesake company.
Last week, a state judge directed the former president and two of his adult children, Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump, to answer questions in that probe under oath in depositions.
The Trump family will appeal that ruling, Fischetti said. 
James joined Bragg's criminal probe last May.
Trump, a Republican, has previously denied wrongdoing and said the state and city investigations were politically motivated.
James and Bragg are Democrats, as is Bragg's predecessor Cyrus Vance, who began the criminal probe and did not seek reelection.
In a statement referring to that probe, a James spokeswoman said: ""The investigation is ongoing and there is a robust team in place that is working on it.""
Both probes focus on whether Trump misrepresented the value of his real estate properties.
Investigators are looking into whether values were inflated to obtain bank loans and reduced to lower tax bills.
The criminal probe resulted last July in tax fraud charges against the Trump Organization and its longtime chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg.
In what Dunne called at the time a ""sweeping and audacious illegal payments scheme,"" Weisselberg allegedly received millions in ""off the books"" payments from the company that were not disclosed to tax authorities. 
Weisselberg pleaded not guilty, as did the company. Both are seeking dismissals. Fischetti described the accusations against Weisselberg as ""minimal charges."" 
A new grand jury was convened in September to examine how the Trump Organization valued its assets.
Fischetti said that grand jury's term would expire in April.
Donald Trump faces multiple criminal and civil probes, including in Georgia where a prosecutor won permission to convene a grand jury to look into the then-president's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results there.
Dunne, Vance's former general counsel, led the office's successful push to obtain Trump's tax returns.

Pomerantz, a former federal prosecutor, had been on leave from the law firm Paul Weiss while working on the Trump probe.
Trump is also among those being investigated by a U.S. House of Representatives select committee looking into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) -Brazilian state-run oil company Petrobras smashed its all-time record for annual profits and dividend payouts in 2021, as sky-high Brent prices and a laser focus on the firm's exploration and production business continued to bear fruit.
In a Wednesday evening securities filing, the firm, formally Petroleo Brasileiro SA, posted a yearly net income of 106.7 billion reais ($21.3 billion). That was more than double Petrobras' previous record, set in 2019, when the firm posted a profit of 40.1 billion reais, which was about $9.2 billion at the contemporaneous exchange rate.
It was also well above the Refinitiv consensus estimate of 74.3 billion reais, thanks in part to significant one-off boosts, including asset divestments, impairment reversions and a victory in a major tax dispute. ""Recurring"" annual profit came in at 83.3 billion reais.
Shortly before releasing its results, Petrobras also announced that it was proposing a supplementary dividend of 2.861 reais per share at the next shareholders' meeting in April. If approved as expected, dividends relative to the company's 2021 performance will come to 7.773 reais per share, or 101.4 billion reais in total, a figure the company described as an all-time record.
The dividends in particular are likely to please the market. Analysts and investors have begun to pay close attention to the firm's dividend payouts, which were paused for years as the company worked to whittle down its debt load.
Yet there are clouds ahead, and Petrobras' results may speed the arrival of the storm.

Brazil is gearing up for a contentious presidential election in October. Current President Jair Bolsonaro has occasionally complained of high domestic fuel prices and expressed displeasure at dividend payouts. But over the last year, tangible political interference at the firm has been more subdued than many market observers had anticipated.
His main rival, leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has promised a shake-up if elected, saying it is Brazilians, rather than international investors, who should be benefiting from Petrobras' performance.

1005,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 06:36PM ET</span>",Allbirds revenue growth powered by robust holiday demand,"(Reuters) -Allbirds Inc topped market estimates for quarterly revenue on Wednesday as consumers splurged on its eco-friendly shoes and athletic wear during the holiday season.
People returning to pre-pandemic routines after staying at home for months have been spending heavily on sneakers for running and hiking, driving up sales of shoemakers. 
Allbirds, a favorite of Silicon Valley workers, has also benefited from a shift towards environmentally-friendly brands among Gen Z and millennial shoppers. The company uses wool and other plant-based alternatives in its products.
Sales rose 23% in the last three months of 2021 to $97.2 million, beating analysts' expectations of $91.76 million, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 
The company's view for first-quarter sales of between $60 million and $62 million was below estimates, but its full-year forecast was more positive and came in above expectations.
The annual sales growth is likely to benefit by about 1% to 3% from the price hikes planned for 2022, Allbirds executives said on a post-earnings call.
Companies across sectors have been trying to preserve margins by passing on the pandemic-led inflation across the supply chain to customers, but demand has remained resilient despite the higher prices. 
The logistics expenses and costs related to opening more retail stores weighed on Allbirds' margins in the fourth quarter. 

It lost $10.4 million, or 9 cents per share, in the period, compared with a loss of $9.35 million, or 18 cents per share, a year earlier. The figure was in line with analysts' estimates.
Shares of the company, which counts actor Leonardo DiCaprio among its backers, were down 7% in extended trading amid broader market weakness.

(Reuters) -Hertz Global Holdings Inc on Wednesday said it posted a new record adjusted profit in the fourth quarter as demand for rental cars remained strong, but post-bankruptcy restructuring costs yielded a large net loss.
Shares initially tumbled 8% in after-hours trading after closing the regular session down 4.3%. They later pared those losses and were down 1%.
As the pandemic subsides, rental companies are seeing a resurgence of consumers wanting cars for travel. This coincides with a need to restock tighter vehicle fleets that have been hurt by global auto production shortages due to a chip crunch.
Hertz interim Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields said the company's goal was to grow its vehicle fleet profitably.
""We'll only increase our fleet to the extent that travel increases,"" Fields said in an interview with Reuters. 
The Florida-based rental car company said adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the three months ended Dec. 31 came in at $628 million, ahead of an analyst estimate for $595 million, according to Refintiv data.
But on a net basis, Hertz recorded a $260 million loss, driven by charges related to its post-bankruptcy restructuring. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had not anticipated a net loss. 
Average monthly revenue per vehicle - a core industry metric that represents pricing and vehicle utilization - was up some 30% compared to the fourth quarter in 2019, pre-pandemic. 
The higher revenue is the result of an industry-wide drastic increase in prices as customer demand outstrips vehicle supply with consumers returning to the rental counter for leisure and business travel.
It reported fourth-quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, in line with Wall Street expectations.
Hertz made a stock market return last year after exiting U.S. bankruptcy proceedings and is raising debt to refinance expensive preferred stock it issued as part of the restructuring.
Fields, who will be replaced by former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) finance chief Stephen Scherr on Feb. 28, mapped out an ambitious plan to lead the rental industry in electric vehicles. In November, the company said it placed an order for 100,000 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc vehicles to be delivered by the end of 2022.
The announcement led to confusion when Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said the companies had not signed an agreement, adding Hertz was not receiving any discounts.

Tesla has been struggling with extended delivery timelines for its Model 3 sedan, putting Hertz's year-end delivery goal into question.
Fields declined to say how many Tesla deliveries Hertz had received or whether it would meet its year-end target, but said Teslas were currently available in over 30 cities and customer satisfaction was very strong.

E-commerce companies raked in large profits as online shopping boomed last year during the pandemic, but vaccine rollouts could spell trouble as people return to brick-and-mortar shopping. 
Biggest rival and online retail giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has also forecast disappointing first-quarter sales estimates.
EBay, which is already grappling with declining active users, expects a further hit as ramping up investments put pressure on its margins. 
""The second quarter should mark the low point for margins during the year as we lap difficult comps and ramp up our pace of investment,"" finance chief Stephen Priest said in a post-earnings conference call.
Shares of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), which started as a site where people would auction their collectibles, fell to $50.28 in extended trading on Wednesday. They declined 18% so far this year, while the broader S&P Index slipped 11%.
EBay expects first-quarter adjusted profit in the range of $1.01 to $1.05 on revenue of $2.43 billion to $2.48 billion; both estimates came in below Wall Street's expectations. 
The company's 2022 revenue and profit forecasts were also below expectations. 
Meanwhile, eBay posted an adjusted profit of $1.05 per share on revenue of $2.61 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, above analysts' average estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Part of eBay's revenue comes from advertising on its platform which crossed $1 billion last year, the company said. 

However, gross merchandise volume, the total dollar value of sales on eBay from which the company takes a percentage, fell 10% to $20.7 billion.
Annual active buyers on eBay also declined 9% to 147 million in the quarter, the company said.

BOGOTA (Reuters) -Colombian industrial conglomerate Grupo Argos on Wednesday reported a 248 billion peso ($63 million) quarterly net profit, reversing a 12 billion peso net loss in the year-ago period.
Consolidated revenue for the company - made up of Cementos Argos, energy producer Celsia and road and airport concession company Odinsa - jumped 24% to 4.4 trillion pesos, while EBITDA climbed 17% to 923 billion pesos.
For the full year, net profit soared eightfold to 1.2 trillion pesos ($305 million), boosted by record sales figures in its cement and energy businesses.
The company said it is considering the distribution of a dividend of 500 pesos per share to its shareholders, up 30% from the one announced the year before, amid the strong 2021 results.
The conglomerate reported annual revenue rose 16.6% to 16.3 trillion pesos. 
Annual EBITDA increased 29.2% to 4.3 trillion pesos.
Grupo Argos announced in December that it would list Cementos Argos' U.S. assets on the New York Stock Exchange in the second half.

The conglomerate will also consolidate its investments in road and airport concessions and energy and real estate rentals into a single vehicle, with an eye to another potential NYSE listing.

The U.S. government broadened restrictions on trading of Russian government debt on Tuesday in a bid to punish Moscow for ratcheting up its conflict with Ukraine.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is a major provider of emerging market indexes for local currency and hard currency bonds.
The indexes are key performance benchmarks for international investors in emerging market debt, so membership can help a country sell bonds and reduce its borrowing costs.
The U.S. Treasury said on Tuesday it was prohibiting participation in the secondary market for Russian government bonds that will be issued after March 1, in a move aimed at curbing Russia's ability to access external funding.
U.S. investors have been banned from buying new dollar-denominated Russian debt since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea.
U.S. banks have been barred from taking part in the primary market for non-rouble sovereign bonds since 2019 and last year U.S. President Joe Biden also barred U.S. financial institutions from taking part in the primary market for rouble-denominated Russian sovereign bonds.

JPMorgan's emerging market strategists said in a note to clients on Wednesday that the new U.S. sanctions on Russian sovereign debt were likely to have limited implications for the international investors that already hold Russian paper.
With total foreign ownership of Russian debt at about $64 billion, and Russia’s reserves in excess of $630 billion, sanctions on sovereign debt are likely to have a limited economic impact, said Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A federal labor board postponed a scheduled vote count that was to have taken place on Wednesday that would determine whether three more  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) locations in Buffalo, New York, will join a union.
Because the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had not ruled on an outstanding appeal by Starbucks' by the time votes were to be tallied, the board impounded the ballots to be counted in the future. 
Even so, momentum to unionize more of the company's locations in the United States continues to build. 
In just the last six months, employees at more than 100 stores in at least 26 states have petitioned the NLRB to hold union elections in their locations – including flagship Reserve Roastery locations in New York and Seattle, Starbucks' hometown.
The union is also winning its legal arguments. On Wednesday, the NLRB rejected an appeal by Starbucks to alter election procedures for a cafe in Mesa, Arizona - a ruling that could point to speedier elections going forward.
In the Arizona case, Starbucks asked the NLRB to hold elections for all stores in the area, rather than one store at a time as the union wanted.
The coffee company had made the same argument - and lost - for two other Buffalo locations that in December became the first company-owned stores in the United States to join a union.
With its latest ruling in Arizona, the board is sending a message that if Starbucks makes the same argument in yet more cases, it must provide new evidence or else the board may ""dismiss (these appeals) quickly and proceed with the vote count,"" said John Logan, a labor professor at San Francisco State University.
Ballots from the Arizona store are now set to be counted on Friday afternoon.
Starbucks said in a statement Wednesday that ""all partners in a market or district deserve the right to vote on a decision that will impact them.""

In Buffalo, the employees seeking to join Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union, said they were disappointed with the delay but optimistic.
""It's not a matter of if we'll win but when we'll win,"" said employee Daniel Rojas.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Qantas Airways Ltd on Thursday posted a steeper A$1.28 billion ($925.57 million) first-half underlying loss before tax during a period hard-hit by domestic and international border closures but said the outlook was improving as restrictions eased.
The underlying loss before tax in the six months ended Dec. 31, the airline's most closely watched financial measure, was bigger than a A$1.03 billion loss a year earlier. 
The airline also reported a loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of A$245 million, slightly better than its December forecast of a A$250 million to A$300 million loss.
Qantas had to scale back domestic and international capacity plans by around one-third after the Omicron variant of COVID-19 emerged, leading to record case numbers in Australia and lower than expected travel demand.
The airline said demand had strengthened in recent weeks, but it forecast a A$650 million hit to second-half earnings before interest and tax due to Omicron.
Qantas said it would run 68% of its pre-COVID-19 domestic capacity in the third quarter, rising to 90% to 100% in the fourth quarter. International capacity would be around 22% of pre-COVID-19 levels in the third quarter, doubling to 44% in the fourth quarter, the airline added.
""Demand has started to recover as Australia adjusts to truly living with COVID,"" Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said in a statement. ""We're seeing good leisure demand into the fourth quarter. We've also seen a sharp uptick in international ticket sales in the past few weeks.""

Australia on Monday opened its borders to fully vaccinated travellers from all countries, the last step in a staged border opening that began in November.

1016,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 05:07PM ET</span>",Equities tumble and U.S. dollar rises as Russia/ Ukraine fears escalate,"By Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Investors around the world lost their appetite for risk on Wednesday, with stocks selling off and the U.S. dollar gaining some ground as Ukraine declared a state of emergency amid intensifying fears of a full-scale Russian invasion. 
Trading in many asset classes has been volatile since Russian President Vladimir Putin's dispatch of troops earlier this week into parts of Ukraine. This triggered sanctions from Western countries and threats of more if Moscow advances further.
Oil futures, which were whipsawed during the day, settled well below their session highs and U.S. Treasury yields, while staying above Tuesday's close, were also volatile. 
Ukraine declared a state of emergency and told its citizens to flee Russia, while Moscow began evacuating its Kyiv embassy. The Russian-backed separatist leader of a Ukrainian breakaway region said Ukrainian government forces should withdraw from territory that his self-proclaimed state has claimed and take their weapons with them.
A senior U.S. official said on Wednesday that Russia is as ready as it can be to launch what could be a full-scale invasion, with 80 percent of troops assembled around Ukraine in attack positions. 
After rising as much as 0.7% earlier on Wednesday the MSCI World Index, a leading gauge of equity markets globally, reversed course in morning trading and deepened losses as the day wore on to finish off 1.2%, registering its lowest level since April 2021. After falling as much as 1% and rising almost 2% during the day, Brent crude settled unchanged from Tuesday's close at $96.84, while West Texas Intermediate settled up 0.21% at $92.10 per barrel after earlier falling as much as 1.9% and rising 1.7% all in the same day.

Investors have also been grappling with the prospects of a U.S. Federal Reserve policy tightening aimed at combating surging inflation. But these worries have ""been somewhat superseded by events in eastern Europe and in Russia,"" said Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Spouting Rock Asset Management.
""So in the very short term, markets will go up or down based on whether (Putin) marches to Kyiv,"" said Williams, adding that investors had appeared to accept Russia's move into the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in Ukraine. 
But if Putin ""goes to Kyiv and there is a regime change and potentially a guerrilla war for the next two generations, that's a more difficult scenario and there is frankly only one person who can decide this.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 464.85 points, or 1.38%, to 33,131.76, barely above the 33,119.685 level that would have confirmed a correction. 
The S&P 500 lost 79.26 points, or 1.84%, to end at 4,225.5 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 344.03 points, or 2.57%, to 13,037.49.
Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, said there was currently ""very little positive validation for buying anything."" 
""If anything, President Putin is digging his heels in despite the increased sanctions,"" said James. ""That's really adding to elevated nervousness about further aggressive actions and what that will mean for commodities and inflation overall as well as potentially lower market prices as overall equity sentiment continues to worsen."" 
Treasury yields were higher as investors monitored Russia-Ukraine events and remained concerned about inflation and a potential Federal Reserve policy mistake.
Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 13/32 in price to yield 1.9912%, up from 1.948% late on Tuesday. The 30-year bond last fell 30/32 in price to yield 2.2963% up from 2.253% while the 2-year note last fell 1/32 in price to yield 1.6016%, up from 1.587%.
Trading was also choppy in currencies with the dollar index last up 0.127% and the euro down 0.18% at $1.1305.
The U.S. dollar strengthened sharply and was last up 3.2% against the Russian rouble, more than reversing its losses on Tuesday against the Russian currency.
The New Zealand dollar NZD= jumped after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised interest rates and said more tightening could be necessary. The kiwi last was up 0.71% versus the greenback at $0.678. 

Palladium rose 4.5% to a near six-month peak driven by fears of a hit to supply from top producer Russia. Gold added 0.6% to trade at $1,908.62 an ounce.
Russia is the world's third-largest producer of gold, while the country's Nornickel is also a major producer of palladium and platinum, both of which are used in catalytic converters to clean car exhaust fumes.

1017,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 04:57PM ET</span>",Air New Zealand heading for worst annual result since 2001 after tripling H1 loss,"(Reuters) -Air New Zealand Ltd on Thursday flagged it was heading for the worst annual loss since 2001 due to a combination of an Auckland lockdown, expiring government relief schemes, rising fuel prices and an ongoing international border closure.
As other airlines globally recover from the worst of the pandemic, Air New Zealand forecast it would report an annual underlying loss before tax and significant items of more than NZ$800 million ($541 million) in the financial year ending June 30, around double last year's figure of NZ$440 million.
The forecast came after the airline reported its first-half statutory loss before tax more than tripled to NZ$367 million, from NZ$105 million a year earlier.
Air New Zealand Chairman Therese Walsh said its performance in the 2021 financial year had been better because the domestic network had largely kept flying and travel bubbles with Australia and the Cook Islands had boosted the second half.
""The 2022 financial year has and will continue to be much more heavily impacted, both by continued suppressed demand and rising costs,"" she said in a statement.
Air New Zealand also said on Thursday it plans to raise equity by the end of March or shortly thereafter to replace a NZ$2 billion liquidity package from its largest shareholder, the New Zealand government.
The airline had drawn down NZ$760 million of a government loan by Wednesday, it said. 
The carrier's domestic business was hit hard in the first half by a lockdown in Auckland, the country's largest city, at a time when international borders remained closed. 
The government has announced plans for a phased border opening this year, but travel bodies say rules requiring self-isolation on arrival need to be removed to revive the struggling tourism sector.

Air New Zealand added that there was still ""a large degree of uncertainty"" over the impact of the Omicron variant on demand for domestic travel for the rest of the financial year and self-isolation rules would have a significant impact on international demand.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) -South Africa's labour department is negotiating a possible out-of-court settlement with a subsidiary of China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, which it accuses of failing to comply with local hiring quotas, Huawei and a government official told Reuters.
South Africa is facing its highest unemployment levels since the end of white minority rule in 1994. Authorities took Huawei Technologies South Africa to court this month, stating it had not met a requirement that 60% of workers must be South African.
Fikiswa Mncanca-Bede, a lawyer at the labour department, told Reuters its officials met with Huawei Technologies South Africa's representatives on Monday.
""We are still negotiating a settlement out of court with some conditions,"" she said. ""(The) case has been stayed until we reach an agreement or not."" 
Mncanca-Bede said the department was aiming to conclude negotiations by Friday. 
Huawei's Shenzhen-based parent company referred a Reuters request for comment on the allegations and talks with the labour department to its local subsidiary. 
Huawei Technologies South Africa confirmed it had ""entered into talks to reach a settlement agreement"" and that the court case had been stayed pending an outcome.
""Discussions are ongoing, Huawei is committed to being fully cooperative with the Department and we are positive that this matter will be concluded shortly,"" it said via email in response to questions.
During the Monday meeting, Huawei ""demonstrated its ""extensive ICT skills transfer and training programs that are aimed at reducing the ICT skills gap and fostering a strong digital talent ecosystem for South Africa to further embrace 5G, Cloud, AI and other 4IR technologies,"" the company said in a separate statement, referring to information and communications technology.
This was acknowledged by the department of labour, which advised Huawei to expand this further in its employment equity plan, it added. 
The company declined to address the allegations, stating it could not comment on an ongoing legal matter. 
Citing a 2020 audit, the labour department says foreign nationals make up nearly 90% of Huawei Technologies South Africa's workforce. 
It had been seeking a fine of 1.5 million rand ($99,547) or 2% of the local firm's annual 2020 turnover for the alleged rule breaches.
Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763) Corporation, another Chinese company partially owned by the state, have built the bulk of Africa's existing telecommunications infrastructure. Experts generally agree they will play a critical role in the continent's future digital transformation.
'NON-COMPLIANT'
Court papers seen by Reuters showed the authorities filed their case after accusing the company of failing to take steps required to bring it into compliance with local employment rules.
In December 2020 and January 2021, the court filings show the labour department requested that Huawei Technologies South Africa develop a plan to address the under-representation of locals and groups discriminated against under apartheid. 
Despite securing an extension to ensure that plan met the labour department's requirements, the company was ""still found to be non-compliant,"" according to a final notice from the department dated May 18, 2021, and attached to court papers.
The labour department submitted to the court what it said was the revised 2020 to 2022 hiring plan Huawei Technologies South Africa was required to draft. 
The document showed the company planned to hire 44 South Africans, roughly 60% of the projected hires for that period. That would result in a workforce comprised of 652 foreign nationals and 112 locals by September 2022.
The plan stated the company would ""ensure that effective recruitment is done"" and added it would seek to train and promote South Africans and members of previously disadvantaged groups to senior positions. 
In a separate letter sent to the department in February 2021, Huawei Technologies South Africa explained its foreign workers were needed to ensure the rollout of ""cutting edge technologies,"" including 5G, artificial intelligence and robotic process automation.
It reiterated their ""skills will be transferred to the designated groups through the company's skills transfer plan,"" according to a copy of the letter included in the department's court filings.

The company had not filed any papers in court in response to the lawsuit before settlement talks began.

PARIS (Reuters) -Airlines group IAG (LON:ICAG) is in advanced talks with planemakers on a medium-haul fleet shake-up that may see the British Airways parent opt for Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus jets to update a European fleet of Airbus narrowbodies, industry sources said.
IAG stunned the industry nearly three years ago when it unveiled a tentative order worth $24 billion at list prices for 200 Boeing 737 MAX at the Paris Airshow in 2019, at a time when the jet was grounded worldwide in the wake of two fatal crashes.
The global outbreak of COVID-19 early the following year caused that deal - intended as a show of confidence in troubled Boeing by then IAG boss Willie Walsh - to lapse, and the airline group later started a formal contest between Boeing and Airbus.
The sources said Boeing looked likely to keep a slimmed-down version of the order, potentially involving closer to 50 jets than the original blockbuster quantity of 200.
The multi-national airline group also owns narrowbody operators Aer Lingus of Ireland and Spain's Iberia and Vueling.
If a deal is confirmed in ongoing negotiations, Boeing's MAX is seen most likely to be deployed at Vueling and future low-cost operations at London Gatwick.
IAG also has options to order additional Airbus narrowbody aircraft, inherited from earlier purchases.
But firming up new Airbus orders has hit a hurdle as the European planemaker struggles to find available production slots after taking a lead over Boeing in the market for single-aisle jets.
Further Airbus orders may also depend on progress in negotiations over undelivered A350 aircraft, the sources said.
Airbus, Boeing and IAG all declined to comment. 

IAG Chief Financial Officer Steve Gunning told analysts in November that the airline group would need some additional short-haul aircraft towards 2024 or 2025 and hinted that any order would include the 737 MAX.
""We think it's important to have strong competition between Airbus and Boeing. And we think the MAX is a very good aircraft,"" he told analysts.

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Co was hit with a proposed class action lawsuit on Wednesday accusing the bank of routinely requiring hourly employees in Florida to work overtime without pay.
The complaint filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida claims Wells Fargo expected registered client associates, or RCAs, to work more than 40 hours per week but failed to pay them overtime premiums required by federal wage law.
Plaintiff David Brandt, who worked at a Wells Fargo branch in Orlando for eight years, says the company systematically deprived RCAs of overtime pay ""knowingly, willingly or with reckless disregard"" for its legal obligations.
Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Brandt's lawyers at the firm Morgan & Morgan said in a statement that their aim was ""to hold the bank accountable for these alleged violations to ensure this practice ends and never happens again.""

Class actions alleging unpaid overtime are common, particularly against banks, and can be costly. Last year, Wells Fargo paid about $96 million to settle claims that its home mortgage consultants in California were not paid properly under a commission-based pay structure. 
In 2020, the bank settled overtime pay claims by a nationwide class of nearly 9,000 employees for $35 million. Wells Fargo denied wrongdoing in both cases.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German utility Uniper is assessing whether the suspension of Gazprom (MCX:GAZP)'s Nord Stream 2 will trigger impairments on its 1 billion euro ($1.1 billion) exposure to the gas pipeline, the company said on Wednesday, sending its shares to a 7-month low.
Uniper, majority-owned by Finland's Fortum, said the worsening of the Ukraine crisis meant that Nord Stream 2 ""could delay further or be affected otherwise"", adding that it was constantly monitoring the situation.
Berlin on Tuesday halted Nord Stream 2, which would double Russian gas flows to Germany, after Moscow formally recognised two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.
Uniper is one of five companies that have each pumped 950 million euros into the pipeline and has in the past warned it may have to impair the loan provided to Nord Stream 2 if the project cannot be completed.
""We are evaluating the impact of yesterday's decision on our claims towards Nord Stream 2 including potential impairment implications,"" Uniper CEO Klaus-Dieter Maubach told reporters after presenting full-year results.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz pulled the plug on the 9.5 billion euro pipeline, saying that in light of recent events Germany's Economy Ministry had to make a new assessment on whether it was putting energy supply at risk.
That means that a key requirement in the certification process is lacking, effectively translating into an indefinite hiatus of the pipeline, which would bypass Ukraine.
Shares in Uniper, which is one of the biggest foreign investors in Russia's energy sector and owns a majority in local utility Unipro, fell as much as 12.6% on the news to their lowest level since July 22.
Austria's OMV said on Tuesday it currently saw no need for write-downs over its involvement in Nord Stream 2.
Maubach said that Uniper was not currently looking at any legal steps in relation to the suspension, hoping that the pipeline will eventually be certified on the back of a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis.

The other co-investors in the pipeline are Shell (LON:RDSa), France's Engie and Germany's Wintershall Dea, which is due to hold its annual press briefing on Thursday.

Investing.com – The Dow closed in correction territory on Wednesday after reversing intraday gains on signs that Ukraine is preparing for conflict with Russia as tensions continued to escalate. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4%, or 464 points, taking losses since its recent move above 10% into correction territory.  The S&P 500 fell 1.8% the  Nasdaq fell 2.6%.
Ukraine declared a state of emergency on Wednesday, as intensifying fears that Russia could step up its invasion weighed on sentiment.
Reuters reported that Russia military equipment was on the move toward Eastern Ukraine, marking a blow to hopes of a diplomatic resolution just as Kyiv appears to be preparing for potential conflict. Reports of cyber attacks that took Ukrainian government and bank websites offline also added to tensions.
Ukraine urged its citizens to leave Russia and called up all men of fighting age for compulsory military service.
The U.S. rolled out further sanctions, targeting Nord Stream 2 AG, the company tasked with of building Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. The move follows the first tranche of sanctions, announced a day earlier, aimed at restricting Russia’s ability to raise funding from the West.
The Europe Union, meanwhile, is set for an emergency summit on Thursday to discuss next steps following Russia’s move into Ukraine.
The rising tensions continued to underpinned oil prices, boosting energy stocks.
Beyond the geopolitical tensions, a slew of quarterly earnings from consumer discretionary companies including TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW) and Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) were in focus.
TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) fell 5% after reporting fourth-quarter results that missed on top and bottom lines as a pandemic-induced rise in costs and supply chain disruptions weighed on growth.
Lowe’s, meanwhile, pared some gains but was up about 1% after it delivered better-than-expected guidance as strong demand for home-improvement tools and building materials bolstered fourth-quarter results.
Caesars Entertainment reported a narrower quarterly loss, supported by surge in revenue as demand rebounded following the easing of pandemic restrictions. Its shares rose more than 3%. 
Big tech gave up early-day gains with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) leading to the downside.
Chip stocks also gave up its intraday gains pressured by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), but Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was relative out performer. 
Intel gave up gains to close flat after Raymond James upgraded the stock to market perform from underperform, citing limited downside potential.
The “prevailing bull case on Intel now is that it will finally make some incremental progress on its roadmap, which will arrest and reverse AMD’s share gains,” Raymond James Analyst Christopher Caso said.
The S&P 500's trend lower into correction territory has pushed it into oversold territory, and to levels that could trigger support.
“The trading chart above shows the S&P 500 closing in on 4200 support once again- but in doing so, is pressing into oversold territory,” Janney Montgomery Scott said in a note. “This implies we are likely to see another rally as the index approaches the 4200 range in sessions ahead.”"

The dairy giant said high feed costs in the United States and the European Union had impacted milk production and these conditions were expected to continue in the coming months.
""Global demand for dairy remains firm, while global milk supply growth continues to track below average levels. These demand and supply dynamics are supporting the increase in prices,"" Chief Executive Miles Hurrell said in a statement.
‍Fonterra lifted its forecast for 2021/22 farmgate milk price to between NZ$9.30 and NZ$$9.90 per kilogram of milk solid (kgMS) from NZ$8.90 to NZ$9.50 per kgMS. It increased the midpoint of the range by 40 NZ cents to NZ$9.60 per kgMS. 

The company also slashed its projection for New Zealand milk collection in the period by 3.8% to 1.48 billion kgMS as challenging weather conditions have continued to impact grass growing conditions in the country.

Staff will be working from the office for at least two days a week, the memo said. 
""Although COVID-19 may never fully go away, we are seeing promising developments,"" Citi's head of human resources Sara Wechter said in the memo.
The move builds on Citi's previous U.S. return to office efforts, which started last September. The bank's staff last year returned to the office at its New York City headquarters and other offices in the tri-state area, among others. 
The decision also highlights a growing inclination among employers and politicians to treat the virus as part of everyday life. Earlier this month, officials in several states including New York, New Jersey and California eased mask mandates.

Wall Street banks and investment firms have been more proactive than other sectors in requiring that employees return to offices. 
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) said in January unvaccinated staff would be placed on unpaid leave and fired at the end of the month unless they were granted an exemption. As of January-end, about 99% of the bank's U.S. employees had complied with the vaccine mandate.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday permanently barred former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli from serving as an officer or director of publicly traded companies, and ordered him to pay a $1.39 million fine for violating securities law between 2009 and 2014.
U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in Brooklyn issued her ruling in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's civil case alleging Shkreli defrauded investors in his hedge funds and raided his biotechnology company, Retrophin (NASDAQ:TVTX) Inc, for funds to settle with investors.
Shkreli had proposed a 10-year officer and director ban, arguing that his seven-year prison sentence and $7.8 million in forfeiture and penalties in his related criminal case were sufficient punishment.
A lawyer for Shkreli did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Shkreli became notorious and known as ""Pharma Bro"" in 2015, when he raised the price of the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim overnight to $750 per tablet from $17.50 while serving as chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, later renamed Vyera Pharmaceuticals.
He was arrested that year on fraud and conspiracy charges connected to Retrophin and his MSMB Capital Management and MSMB Healthcare Management hedge funds.
In her decision, Matsumoto called Shkreli a ""chaotic, dishonest, and untrustworthy corporate leader"" who would likely violate the law again if allowed to run a public company.
Shkreli is serving his sentence at a low-security prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania, and will be eligible for release in November.

Last month, a federal judge in Manhattan barred Shkreli from the drug industry for life and ordered him to pay $64.6 million.
That followed a nonjury trial where federal and state regulators claimed Shkreli tried to maintain an illegal monopoly over Daraprim and keep generic rivals off the market.

Investing.com -- Stocks showed wild swings on Wednesday, rising and then reversing gains to sink in afternoon trading amid rising tensions about the Ukraine conflict.
Reports of cyberattacks on Ukrainian government sites spread on Wednesday as the White House announced sanctions on the Russian-controlled Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, specifically its construction company.
Ukraine announced a state of emergency and urged citizens in Russia to leave, Reuters reported. The world continued to await Russia’s next military move after backing the independence of two separatist groups in Ukraine earlier this week and sending in troops.
Wednesday’s market swoon caught several big tech names in the downdraft, including Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), down 4%, as well as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).
Investors are still wary about how much the Federal Reserve will raise short-term rates when it meets next month, though many have recently expected it to make a 50 point move to fight inflation.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Economic output
The U.S. is set to release its fourth quarter quarterly GDP figure Thursday morning at 8:30 AM ET, with forecasts anticipating a 0.1% move higher to 7% from 6.9%.
2.  Alibaba  earnings
Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd ADR (NYSE:BABA)reports earnings before the opening bell Thursday. Analysts are expecting quarterly profit to fall 60% from last year, to net income of $5 billion or so.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 fell Wednesday, and remained in correction territory as ongoing Ukraine-Russia tensions forced the broader market to give up its intraday gains.
The S&P 500 fell 1.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.2%, or 396 points, the Nasdaq fell 2.2%.
Ukraine declared a state of emergency on Wednesday, as intensifying fears that Russia could step up its invasion weighed on sentiment.
Reuters reported that Russia military equipment was on the move toward Eastern Ukraine, marking a blow to hopes of a diplomatic resolution just as Kyiv appears to be preparing for potential conflict. Reports of cyber attacks that took Ukrainian government and bank websites offline also added to tensions.
Ukraine urged its citizens to leave Russia and calling up all men of fighting age for compulsory military service.
The U.S. rolled out further sanctions, targeting Nord Stream 2 AG, the company tasked with of building Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. The move follows the first tranche of sanctions, announced a day earlier, aimed at restricting Russia’s ability to raise funding from the West.
The Europe Union, meanwhile, is set for an emergency summit on Thursday to discuss next steps following Russia’s move into Ukraine.
The rising tensions continued to underpinned oil prices, boosting energy stocks.
Beyond the geopolitical tensions, a slew of quarterly earnings from consumer discretionary companies including TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW) and Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) were in focus.
TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) fell 5% after reporting fourth-quarter results that missed on top and bottom lines as a pandemic-induced rise in costs and supply chain disruptions weighed on growth.
Lowe’s, meanwhile, pared some gains but was up about 1% after it delivered better-than-expected guidance as strong demand for home-improvement tools and building materials bolstered fourth-quarter results.
Caesars Entertainment reported a narrower quarterly loss, supported by surge in revenue as demand rebounded following the easing of pandemic restrictions. Its shares rose more than 4%. 
Big tech gave up early-day gains with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) leading to the downside.
Chip stocks also gave up its intraday gains pressured by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), but Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) bucked the trend.
Intel was marginally higher after Raymond James upgraded the stock to market perform from underperform, citing limited downside potential.
The “prevailing bull case on Intel now is that it will finally make some incremental progress on its roadmap, which will arrest and reverse AMD’s share gains,” Raymond James Analyst Christopher Caso said.
The S&P 500's trend lower into correction territory has pushed it into oversold territory, and to levels that could trigger support.
“The trading chart above shows the S&P 500 closing in on 4200 support once again- but in doing so, is pressing into oversold territory,” Janney Montgomery Scott said in a note. “This implies we are likely to see another rally as the index approaches the 4200 range in sessions ahead.”"
1038,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 03:11PM ET</span>","Rio Tinto rides iron ore gains to post record profit, pay $17 billion dividend","By Praveen Menon
(Reuters) - Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) posted on Wednesday its best ever annual profit and a record full-year dividend of $16.8 billion, boosted by higher iron ore prices and strong demand from top consumer China.
The stellar results cap a mixed year for the world's biggest iron ore producer, in which demand for its main product picked up as the global economy slowly recovered from the coronavirus but inflation and Chinese scrutiny of prices created headwinds.
Rio's reputation suffered from a scandal over poor workplace culture, while Serbia shut down a lithium project, a promising growth area. On the plus side, it resolved a long-running dispute over a massive Mongolian copper-gold mining project.
The Anglo-Australian miner reported underlying earnings of $21.38 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, up 72% from a year earlier. Analysts had expected underlying earnings of $21.63 billion, according to Visible Alpha.
""Our balance sheet is the strongest it's been for at least 15 years,"" Chief Executive Jakob Stausholm told reporters after the results.
Rio Tinto declared a final special dividend of 62 cents a share and a final dividend of $4.17, higher than the year earlier final dividend of $3.09, taking its total 2021 dividend to a record $10.40 a share.
Its shares closed up 1.2% on the Australia Stock Exchange ahead of the results. But share prices were down 0.3% in London by 1042 GMT, underperforming other miners. 
Rival BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) also declared a record dividend payout after reporting an estimate-beating first-half profit last week.
Labour shortages due to COVID-19 curbs have hit Australian miners, with Rio previously forecasting weaker-than-expected iron ore shipments for 2022.
""The going gets a little harder from here, with inflation starting to push costs higher,"" said Steve Clayton, fund manager at HL Select.
""We expect the payout to be lower in FY2022, reflecting less favourable operating conditions, but to still represent an attractive yield to shareholders."" 
China, which accounts for more than half of Rio's revenue, said it would prevent ""excessive hoarding"" of iron ore, a move analysts have said could affect the industry, though implementation details were still unclear.
Stausholm declined to comment on China's move, saying nothing had officially been communicated yet.
Asked by analysts about big M&A opportunities, Stausholm said he would ""be very cautious right now"".
He added, ""...Because we are pretty high up in the cycle and I would dream about looking back one day and say that we invested counter-cyclically and making acquisitions right now could be very much pro-cyclical."" 
REVIEWING OPTIONS
In the results statement Rio said it was committed to exploring all options in Serbia, which shut down its $2.4-billion Jadar lithium project.
It was ""reviewing the legal basis of the decision"", it added, and the implications for its activities in Serbia.
""Ultimately, it is for the government of Serbia to decide whether they want to see this opportunity happening,"" Stausholm told reporters. ""Right now what we are offering is to have meaningful engagement with stakeholders.""
Stausholm took over the top job in the wake of a widespread backlash against the company after it blasted the 46,000-year-old Juukan Gorge rock shelters to expand an iron ore mine.

An external review of the miner's workplace culture released this month outlined a culture of bullying, harassment and racism, including 21 complaints of actual or attempted rape or sexual assault over the last five years.
""We have become more humble and better listeners, both internally and externally, as we extract the full learnings from Juukan Gorge,"" Stausholm said.

With teams unable to board the Felicity Ace, heavy tug boats sprayed water to cool the vessel, which is carrying around 4,000 vehicles including Porsches, Audis and Bentleys.
The 22 crew members were evacuated last Wednesday, the day the fire began. 
Some of the vehicles are electric and their lithium-ion batteries have made the fire very difficult to extinguish, port officials have said.
João Mendes Cabeças, the captain of the nearest port on the Azorean island of Faial, said the blaze had lost its intensity, probably because there was little left to burn.
Salvage teams hoped to board the ship, which is is adrift around 170 km southwest of the Portuguese islands of Azores, to assess its condition and start preparing it for towing, the navy said in a statement on Tuesday. 
It is unclear if the vessel will be towed to the Bahamas or Europe.
Cabeças told Reuters bad weather prevented the team from boarding the ship. Waves as high as 2.5 meters battered the coast of Faial on Wednesday, Portugal's weather agency IPMA said. 
The salvage team was expected to be flown to the ship on a helicopter belonging to the Portuguese air force, which will decide on Thursday if the operation can proceed, Cabeças said.

Ship manager Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd (MOL) said in a statement on Tuesday the vessel was still on fire but stable, and that no oil leak had been reported so far. It did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the cause of the fire. 
Insurance experts said the incident could result in losses of $155 million.

Wrestling like peers with rising costs for raw materials, energy, labour and logistics, Pirelli trimmed the top of its operating profit margin outlook for 2022.
""Pirelli will respond to a challenging 2022 by strengthening the levers already foreseen in the industrial plan,"" it said.
The group said it would take ""an even more selective approach ... in original equipment"" and focus ""on bigger rims sizes and specialties, particularly electric"".
The manufacturer of tyres for Formula One and high-end carmakers such as BMW and Audi lifted its revenue outlook for 2022 to between around 5.6-5.7 billion euros ($6.34-$6.45 billion) from a previous range of between 5.1-5.3 billion.
However, it said its adjusted operating profit margin would be between around 16% and 16.5%.
That compares with between around 16% and 17%, previously.
Pirelli forecast a net cash generation before dividends of between around 450 million and 480 million euros. 
Pirelli, which manufactures in Russia 10% of its global tyres output, said it had analysed the potential impact on local operations linked to import and export to and from Russia of raw materials and finished goods.
""Assuming that the cost of oil and energy will remain at current levels from March 2022 to the end of the year ... it is estimated that the guidance for profitability and cash generation will be positioned in the lower part of the range,"" it said.
That would entail an adjusted operating profit of around 890 million euros and cash generation before dividends of around 450 million euro, it said.
Milan-based Pirelli runs the Kirov and Voronezh plants in Russia, with its business in the country accounting for about 3-4% of the overall turnover. 

The company posted a 2021 operating profit of 815.8 million euros, up 62.8% compared with 2020 and slightly higher than a company-provided analyst consensus of 807 million euros thanks to an improvement of price/mix and cost cuts.

(Reuters) -Lowe's Cos Inc on Wednesday raised its full-year sales and profit forecasts and offered an optimistic outlook for home improvement demand in the United States in the face of rising mortgage rates.
A strong U.S. housing market since the pandemic began propelled sales at Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) and rival  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) to record levels, but analysts warn higher mortgage rates and prices could make customers wary of investing in their homes.
Lowe's on Wednesday sounded upbeat about its prospects.
""We are confident that home improvement demand will remain strong despite an uptick in interest rates,"" Chief Financial Officer David Denton said on an earnings call.
Executives said the trend of more millennials buying suburban houses and the extension of remote work policies would support a step-up in home upgrade jobs.
Earlier this month, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate jumped above 4% for the first time since 2019, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
Lowe's shares rose 5.1% in early trading. They fell nearly 4% on Tuesday following a profit margin warning from Home Depot.
Lowe's, in contrast, said it expects gross profit margins this year to be up slightly from 2021, compared to a prior forecast of them being roughly flat. 
In the fourth quarter, Lowe's gross margins expanded by 115 basis points to 32.9%, while Home Depot's margins fell 35 basis points to 33.2%. 
The numbers provide proof that Lowe's is closing the gap with Home Depot, as its strategy of raising prices and offering smaller discounts pays off, D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Michael Baker said.

Lowe's expects total sales of $97 billion to $99 billion for its fiscal 2022, compared to a previous forecast of $94 billion to $97 billion. 
The company raised full-year earnings per share expectations to $13.10 to $13.60, from the $12.25 to $13 it previously estimated.

Sierra Wireless stock rose 17.87%, to $17.15, on Wednesday. 
The wireless communications equipment designer reported fourth-quarter revenue of $149.9 million, representing a 24.4% rise compared to the same quarter of 2020.
The revenue growth came after more robust demand, previous investments in inventory, and improved manufacturing flexibility amongst production.
Earnings per share reached 3 cents per share, well above the 19 cents per share loss in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated a loss per share of 12 cents on revenue of $126.48 million.
The company said full-year earnings were boosted by the growth of IoT connectivity services, with total revenue increasing by 5.5% to $473.2 million. However, revenue was slightly impacted by capacity constraints in Vietnam during the third quarter.
""We worked closely with our customers, partners and suppliers to deliver strong sequential and year-over-year revenue growth in the Fourth Quarter,"" said Phil Brace, president and CEO of Sierra Wireless.
With the continuation of Covid-19 and the numerous variants, Sierra said it remains uncertain regarding the impact on its global business. However, it sees Q1 2022 revenue between $135 million and $150 million.
Following the report, B. Riley analyst Josh Nichols raised the firm's price target on Sierra shares to $24 from $21.50. The analyst told investors in a note that the shares are attractive with the company having passed through a key inflection point.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The trial of a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker accused of helping loot Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund will be paused due to late disclosure of some evidence by prosecutors to the defense, the judge in the case ruled on Wednesday.
Roger Ng, Goldman's former head of investment banking in Malaysia, has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiring to launder money and to violate an anti-bribery law. Prosecutors say Ng received millions of dollars in kickbacks for helping embezzle funds from 1MDB.
Prosecutors said in a Wednesday morning court filing - more than a week after opening statements in Ng's trial began - that they learned late on Tuesday that one U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) division did not share with them or Ng some 15,500 documents related to Tim Leissner, Ng's former boss.
""The government absolutely, absolutely, and admittedly at this point did not live up to its obligations,"" Marc Agnifilo, a defense attorney for Ng, told U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie in Brooklyn federal court outside the jury's presence.
""Evidence is coming in drips and drabs.""
Agnifilo said the documents could be critical for the defense. Brodie called the late disclosure ""troubling,"" noting that she had previously asked prosecutors to make sure all disclosures were made. 
Leissner, who pleaded guilty to similar charges in 2018, is testifying against Ng, 49, as the government's star witness. Brodie said she would allow prosecutors to finish questioning Leissner, then pause the trial before cross-examination to give Agnifilo time to review the new documents.
""I will give you as much time as you need,"" Brodie said, though she noted that the trial could not be delayed indefinitely.
Agnifilo argues that $35 million Ng received, that the government calls ill-gotten gains, was actually derived from an unrelated business venture between Ng's wife and Leissner's ex-wife.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Alixandra Smith said the delayed disclosure was an ""inexcusable error"" and did not object to pausing the trial.

The trial stems from one of the biggest financial scandals in history. Between 2009 and 2014, Goldman reaped some $600 million in fees for helping 1MDB sell $6.5 billion in bonds, but around $4.5 billion of that was diverted, and Goldman bankers bribed officials to win business for the bank, U.S. prosecutors say.
Goldman in 2020 paid a nearly $3 billion fine and arranged for its Malaysian unit to plead guilty in U.S. court.

HAVANA (Reuters) - The Cuban sugar industry is barreling again toward its worst season ever, according to official media reports and sources, threatening to dent both national pride and economic growth. 
The 2022 harvest is set to fall well short of last year's record low, according to official data and two local sugar experts. It is currently running at least 30% shy of the communist-run government's goal of 900,000 tonnes.
Last year's crop of 800,000 tonnes was the worst since 1908, just 10% of a high of 8 million tonnes in 1989. 
Sugar was once the pride of Cuba, critical to its rum production and driving foreign exchange and employment in the island's vast countryside.
The government has not been able to finance the sector's needs - including inputs, irrigation and spare parts - due to tough new U.S. sanctions and the coronavirus pandemic.
“The government will have to import and maybe cut the sugar quota on the monthly food ration. The bakeries will have to scramble to make sweets,” said one sugar expert consulted by Reuters, who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak with foreign journalists.
The government had banked on a small increase in sugar output to meet its goal of 4% growth this year after the economy shrank more than 11% in 2020 and grew 2% last year, reducing resources available to mills and plantations.
In a bid to revive the once iconic sector, Vice President Salvador Valdes Mesa in February crisscrossed the country urging mill workers, farmers and cane cutters to produce more. 
The harvest usually begins in November and runs into May, but this year most mills opened in December and early January due to a lack of spare parts and cane. 
""They will not recover the lost tonnage and the most likely scenario is they will fall further behind as the problems are structural and long standing,"" the local sugar expert said.
Several reports in the official Communist Party daily Granma showed key sugar-producing provinces, including Villa Clara, Las Tunas and Cienfuegos, well behind production goals. 

Other reports and local sources indicated output at all 35 of Cuba's sugar mills was behind schedule. 
Cuba had earmarked 500,000 tonnes of sugar this year for domestic consumption and planned to sell China 400,000 tonnes, part of a standing agreement with the Asian nation.

1050,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 12:48PM ET</span>",Boots in store for $10-billion sale as bid deadline looms,"By Pamela Barbaglia
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's largest drugstore chain Boots has set a Feb. 24 deadline to receive indicative bids from a series of deep-pocketed investors that could value the 173-year-old firm at up to 8 billion pounds ($10.88 billion), two sources told Reuters.
The sale will see U.S. drugstore giant Walgreens, which has backed Nottingham-based Boots since 2012, cashing out from one of Britain's best-known retailers which operates more than 2,200 stores and employs about 51,000 people.
It will also lead to the dismantling of the Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), which was set up in 2014 when Walgreens took full control of the health and beauty chain, creating a global behemoth with overall revenues of $132.5 billion in 2021.
WBA declined to comment.
A spokesperson said on Jan. 11 that the company was undertaking a strategic review primarily focused on Boots, but also including skincare and cosmetics brand No7 which was launched by Boots in 1935. 
""While the process is at an exploratory stage, we do expect to move quickly,"" WBA's Chief Executive Officer Rosalind Brewer said on Jan. 11.
Valued at 6 billion to 8 billion pounds, Boots is being sold as part of an auction process led by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and targeting financial investors with a track record of turning around high street retailers, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the matter is confidential.
Private equity firm TDR Capital, which owns supermarket chain Asda, is working on a bid plan to secure control of Boots and integrate it into Asda's stores, which already operate a limited network of UK pharmacies, the sources said.
But TDR, led by co-founders Manjit Dale and Stephen Robertson in 2002, faces competition from a consortium of CVC Capital Partners and Bain Capital as well as U.S. investment firms Sycamore Partners and Apollo, which are all lining up bids for Boots, the sources said.
U.S. buyout firm CD&R, which sources said had initially looked at the possibility of combining Boots with its own supermarket chain Morrisons, had to put its ambitions on hold as Britain's competition regulator is still probing the Morrisons takeover - announced in October - and has banned any move by CD&R to integrate the UK grocer with other portfolio companies.
Sycamore Partners, Bain Capital, Apollo and CD&R declined to comment while TDR and CVC were not immediately available.
Private equity firms hope to extract value from Boots by investing in primary healthcare services and striking partnership deals with Britain's National Health Service (NHS) to turn Boots' stores into medical hubs where services could include blood tests, jabs and physiotherapy, one of the sources said.
WBA's $5.2 billion investment in care provider VillageMD in October is seen as a possible blueprint for Boots' expansion, with WBA running physician-led primary care clinics at its drugstores across the United States.
But to follow the same growth path, Boots will need to work closely with the UK health authorities, one of the sources said, and its turnaround may take time to execute. 
CVC is betting on the expertise of former KKR partner Dominic Murphy who joined CVC in 2019 and previously led KKR's takeover of Alliance Boots for 11.1 billion pounds in 2007. At the time, Murphy had to calm fears of redundancies and store closures as private equity investors were widely perceived as job cutters and asset strippers. 
""Boots remains primarily a turnaround story which implies downsizing their retail network, adding services at its stores and implementing online sales,"" one of the sources said.

""Although many private equity funds are looking at the dossier right now, only those with proven retail expertise and a strategic angle will make it to the final stages of the process.""

According to a joint filing in the U.S. District Court in Washington late on Tuesday, the FTC proposed a Dec. 11, 2023, start date to allow time for discovery, including document and data production. 
Representatives for Meta, which includes Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, called the proposed schedule ""unrealistic as well as unfair to Meta"" and said it needed until Feb. 13, 2024, to complete discovery. 
Last month, a U.S. judge rejected the social media company's bid to dismiss the government's lawsuit and said the FTC had a plausible case that should allow it to proceed. 

In the lawsuit, the U.S. government accuses Meta of crushing or buying rivals and seeks to force the company to sell photo-sharing app Instagram and messaging app WhatsApp. 
The lawsuit is one of the biggest challenges the U.S. government has brought against a technology company as part of a larger effort to tackle Big Tech's extensive market power.

1055,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 12:11PM ET</span>",Citigroup readies wide-ranging plan to win over skeptics,"By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) executives will lay out detailed plans for generating better returns and address concerns over expenses at a shareholder meeting next month which analysts and investors say could determine its future.
The bank will set new targets for return on tangible common equity, a key measure of profitability, people familiar with the plan say. Key to achieving those goals will be a renewed focus on payments, commercial banking and wealth management.
The bank will also attempt to show investors that the cost of employing 4,000 people to comply with regulatory orders will produce cost savings and improved processes that will help drive future growth, according to Paco Ybarra, chief executive of Citigroup's Institutional Clients Group.
The March 2 investor day comes just over a year since 54-year-old Jane Fraser became chief executive at the fourth- biggest U.S. bank by assets. Fraser, a native of Scotland, was tasked with transforming a business whose share price lagged rivals like JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) during her predecessor Michael Corbat's eight years at the helm.
Fraser acted swiftly to simplify the firm, announcing plans last April to exit non-core businesses, including consumer franchises in 13 markets across Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. She doubled down in January - announcing plans to sell or spin off Citi's Mexican retail business, its largest consumer business outside of the United States.
However, investors remain unconvinced.
""People are incredibly skeptical,"" said long-time Citigroup investor Patrick Kaser, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management. 
Citi's stock price is currently trading below the value of its assets, whereas most big banks trade at premiums to their book value. That piles the pressure on Fraser to present a plan that will restore investor confidence.
If she fails, the bank could face calls to be broken up, analysts say.
""This is the most important day of Jane Fraser's professional life,"" said  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Mike Mayo. ""The purpose is to show why Citigroup has a reason to exist. The stock market says that Citigroup is worth more dead than alive.""
Investors want Fraser to present a viable case that the bank can bring its expenses down, accelerate revenue growth and improve returns.
""If they could lay out a credible plan, the stock could move up 10% or more,"" said Kaser.
Executives need to show that, in two to three years, Citigroup can produce a 12% to 13% return on equity, said analyst David Konrad of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. 
That would still trail rivals but would be seen as achievable, he added.
PAYMENTS
Growing the global payments business, known as Treasury and Trade Solutions, is central to Fraser's strategy. It requires relatively little capital for the returns it can produce, and can facilitate cross-selling of other services, executives say.
""That business has significant potential going forward,"" said Ybarra.
Citigroup's payments business already leads rivals in catering to global corporations. The bank wants to expand it to serve commercial banking clients - mid-sized companies with annual revenue between $50 million and $2 billion and which do business internationally. 
It also sees opportunities to grow payments services to governments, financial institutions and fintech companies, people familiar with the plan say.
Executives will explain how growing the payments, commercial and wealth businesses will help the rest of the bank.
""Investing in payments, commercial banking and wealth will strengthen our banking position,"" said Tyler Dickson, global co-head of the banking, capital markets and advisory businesses.
Citigroup's investment banking and trading businesses have not gained as much market share as other U.S. banks from European banks retreating, something executives are determined to change.
""We will invest in parts where we can gain revenue share on U.S. competitors,"" said Dickson. 
A BETTER PLACE
U.S. bank regulators fined Citigroup $400 million in October 2020 for failing to correct ""longstanding deficiencies"" in its risk and control systems, and ordered the lender to upgrade its processes and technology.
The bank saw its annual expenses rise 9% to $48 billion in 2021, partly due to the cost of complying with the orders.
Citigroup executives will make the case that the investment will pay off in the longer term.
""When we succeed in delivering what regulators are asking, we are going to be in a better place,"" said Ybarra, whose businesses in investment banking, trading, corporate banking and services contribute almost two-thirds of Citigroup's core revenue in the re-shaped group. 
""It is forcing us to fix some deeper issues in our infrastructure and data that would have taken more time.""
Citi executives will discuss how they plan to strike a balance between returning capital and investing in growth.
""It is good that we only retain capital that we think is going to produce decent returns,"" said Ybarra. ""That tendency is particularly strong for us because of where our stock price is.""

Fraser's strategy will not deliver immediate results. Completing the sales of the Asia and Mexico consumer businesses, for example, could take two years. Its long-suffering investors are unlikely to show patience.
""They've built up this investor day,"" said Konrad. ""There has to be a pretty big sense of urgency.""

""No, we're not looking to acquire in Mexico,"" Group Chief Executive Noel Quinn said in a call with investors focused on the bank's quarterly earnings and outlook.
Citigroup announced in January it would put Banamex up for sale as part of Chief Executive Jane Fraser's plan to simplify the bank's operations.
Quinn said HSBC Mexico's current operations are strong, and produced ""returns on tangible equity last year of around about 13%.""
However, Quinn said HSBC's focus for the moment was on Asia and wealth management. Over the past two years, Quinn has moved some of the bank's top executives to Asia and has poured billions into the wealth management business.

Analysts say Banamex, which could go for between $4 billion to $8 billion, may see bids from international banks or coalitions of Mexican investors.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said he hopes to see the bank, bought by Citi in 2001, return to Mexican hands.

Investing.com – CoStar stock (NASDAQ:CSGP) plunged more than 10% Wednesday after a proposed tripling of an investment in its residential segment led analysts to cut their price targets.
The provider of online real estate marketplaces disclosed its fourth-quarter numbers Tuesday, and according to StreetInsider, Needham analyst Mayank Tandon believes the outlook came in below consensus estimates “due to a combination of ongoing softness in the multifamily segment and a significant step-up in investments to drive long-term growth in the residential segment”.
Tandon sees the stock at $70 even as he maintained his buy rating. He had a target of $115 for it. The stock touched a low of $49 earlier in the session and later traded at over $56.
The company plans to invest $300 million to $320 million in residential through the year, at least a triple of what it allocated to the segment last year. The year marked its first full 12 months in the residential property space.
CoStar is targeting annual revenue of $2.15 billion at midpoint of its guidance range. Adjusted profit per share is seen between 95 cents and $1.02.
For the ongoing quarter, adjusted EPS is expected to be 27 cents to 28 cents on revenue of $510 million to $515 million.
RBC analyst cut the price to $60 from $85, while Truist Securities too slashed its target to $70 from $110 earlier.
Net sales bookings in the fourth quarter reached an all-time high of $67 million, founder and CEO Andrew C. Florance said.
Revenue in the fourth quarter rose 14%, to $507 million. Adjusted profit per share was 35 cents, higher than 29 cents in the same period a year ago.

Investing.com --  Coinbase Global  Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) shares fell 1.7% on Wednesday after JPMorgan slashed its price target to $345 per share from $447 Wednesday, citing a “meaningful decline in cryptocurrency prices.”
JPMorgan analyst Kenneth Worthington kept an overweight rating on the shares. Ahead of its earnings release, the analyst raised fourth-quarter estimates on “better than previously modeled trading volume yielding increased commissions and transactions fees.” 
Worthington explained that they expect Coinbase's staking revenue will continue to rise, reflecting greater sophistication of Coinbase customers and thus greater use of staking services.
However, full-year 2022 forecasts have been lowered “due to materially lower cryptocurrency prices in 1Q22.”
“While we continue to expect greater development and utilization of the blockchain and FY cryptocurrency technology, we see the lower prices as weighing on Coinbase value traded and thus weighing on revenue and earnings. We are modeling $1.6tr of trading volume in 2022 vs. our prior projection of $1.7tr,"" added Worthington.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co expects to have ""strong"" revenue growth this year despite inflationary and supply-chain challenges, Chief Executive Larry Culp said on Wednesday.
The comments came days after the industrial conglomerate warned that supply and labor shortages, along with inflation, would pressure its profits through the first half of the year.
Culp said while the company was adjusting its prices, it would not be able to fully offset higher costs with price increases. 
""This is a tough operating environment,"" he said at the Citi Industrial conference.
GE's shares were down 1.4% at $92.78 in morning trading.
Last week, the Boston-based company said it was grappling with supply-chain issues across most of its businesses. Raw material and labor shortages, along with soaring costs, were adversely affecting its healthcare, renewable energy and aviation units, it said.
Persistent supply-chain bottlenecks also led to a decline in GE's revenue in the quarter through December.
Culp said the logjam was making it tougher to keep up with demand in healthcare business. 
""We clearly have another six months here, at least, where we have to fight tooth and nail to get products to customers,"" he said.
To mitigate the impact, the company is scouting for new suppliers, sourcing alternative parts and redesigning product configurations.
Culp expects supplies to remain tight for a while. However, he said the price hikes and moves to improve supplies would start showing results in the second half of the year. 

GE has forecast a return to revenue growth this year. It also expects to grow its profit margin by 150 basis points and to generate $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion in free cash flow.
Culp backed those estimates, saying the forecast had factored in supply-chain and inflationary challenges.

PARIS (Reuters) -Danone on Wednesday pledged further productivity gains and price increases this year to offset cost inflation after the French food maker beat fourth-quarter sales forecasts, driving its shares up nearly 4%.
Antoine de Saint-Affrique, who took over as chief executive of the world's largest yoghurt maker in September, told investors that despite a strong end of the year, much remained to be done to turn the company around.
He said he would provide clues on his strategy and outlook for 2022 and the mid-term at a March 8 Capital Market Day.
Areas for improvement included a ""somewhat unbalanced"" growth model that did not allow Danone, owner of the Evian and Activia yoghurt brands to ""fully capture the potential of its markets"". 
There was also a need to improve ""quality of execution"" and to step up investment behind brands, Saint-Affrique said.
Consumer goods companies are grappling with surging costs for commodities, energy, transport and labour, prompting rival Unilever (NYSE:UL) earlier this month to warn of a drop in margins as it struggles to lift prices enough to offset the extra expenses.
Cost inflation of 8% in 2021 was expected to be in a low to mid-teens range in 2022, finance chief Juergen Esser told analysts. He said inflation would be broad-based, driven by raw materials prices, logistics rates, energy prices, with the strongest impact coming from packaging costs.
By 1020 GMT, Danone shares were up 3.7% at 56.60 euros after the sales beat, which was driven largely by a continuing recovery in its bottled water business as countries relaxed COVID restrictions. 
""Q4 is ahead on the top line with FY 21 margins in line. The question remains one of whether new CEO Antoine de Saint-Affrique will take a margin reset, or not,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note.
WATER AND BABY FOOD
Former Danone boss Emmanuel Faber was abruptly ousted as chairman and CEO last year following clashes with some board members over strategy and calls from activist funds for him to resign over the group's lacklustre returns compared with some rivals.
The main challenge for Saint-Affrique is to boost profit margins and sales across the group's three businesses - dairy and plant-based products, infant formula and bottled water - while facing mounting input costs, with the further stress of a conflict in Ukraine.
Danone reported that its 2021 like-for-like sales rose 3.4% to 24.281 billion euros ($27.48 billion), slightly above analysts' estimates in a company-compiled consensus for a 3% rise.
It said this reflected an acceleration in the fourth quarter to 6.7% sales growth, above market expectations of 5.5% growth, with all three businesses contributing.
Most of the sales beat came from the bottled water division, which posted a 17.4% jump in sales. The division, whose sales had been hit by restaurant and bar closures tied to pandemic restrictions continued its recovery with the Mizone and Aqua brands returning to positive growth in Asia.
Infant Nutrition also posted very strong growth in the quarter, driven by China and the rest of the world.

The 2021 operating margin declined by 30 basis points to 13.7% of sales, in line with the company's outlook and analysts' expectations of 13.7%, as accelerating sales growth and strong productivity helped partly offset inflationary pressure.

1063,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 11:32AM ET</span>",Tesla faces day of reckoning on water supply for planned German plant,"By Victoria Waldersee
BERLIN (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) may lose the water supply contract for its long-delayed German plant if environmental groups win a court case challenging a licence granted to its water supplier at a hearing next week.
The Frankfurt Oder administrative court will hear on March 4 a complaint filed by local groups claiming the Brandenburg environmental ministry carried out insufficient checks before granting the licence to the Wasserverband Strausberg-Erkner (WSE) utility.
If the groups win, WSE said it must cancel its contract with Tesla, and negotiations will begin again on where the plant could source its water – likely a lengthy process with no guaranteed solution.
A spokesperson for the court said a decision was expected the day of the hearing. Tesla declined to comment on the case.
A further delay would put another spanner in the works for the facility just as a broader approval process reaches its final stages. 
Elon Musk had hoped to have the plant - key to his ambitions to conquer the European market where Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) currently holds the upper hand with a 25% share of electric vehicle sales to Tesla's 13% - up and running six months ago.
Following delays, he said in October last year that he hoped to have it operational by December. The company has not further updated its timetable for the launch.
The groups bringing the complaint, Gruene Liga and Nabu, fear the 1.4 million cubic metres of water a year Tesla needs for the plant – akin to the usage of a 30,000-person town – will drain the region of drinking water. 
Municipally-run WSE has itself flagged concerns over water supply.
While the Tesla plant does not use a particularly large quantity of water – others such as BASF's battery plant a few hours away use more - the region's reserves are finite, WSE spokesperson Sandra Ponetsky said.
""We are a relatively water-rich country,"" she said. ""But we need help from other regions… Which supplier has the capacity to just magic that much water out of a hat in such a short time period?""
ABILITY TO EXPAND
The dispute adds to a list of challenges faced by Tesla in recent months, from recalls in China and the United States to scrutiny by U.S. regulators of everything from Musk's social media posts to accusations of discrimination towards workers.
The U.S. automaker reported record vehicle deliveries in the last quarter of 2021, but CFO Zach Kirkhorn said last month that ramping up both the Berlin and Austin plants was needed to make up for production lost earlier last year to supply chain and logistics issues.
""We've intentionally set these factories in locations in which they have a quite significant amount of land and ability to expand,"" he said a few months prior in October.
But WSE has made clear that even if the court allows it to extract the water for Tesla's first stage of production, servicing any future expansion to the plant will be impossible without importing water from other regions.
""We knew we were reaching our limits - but we predicted we'd get there in 2050,"" Ponetsky said. ""Through Tesla we were catapulted forward 30 years.""
Elon Musk has expressed his irritation at Germany's complex bureaucracy on multiple occasions, arguing it is at odds with the urgency needed to fight climate change.
But activists in Brandenburg have raised numerous red flags against Musk's factory on environmental grounds, expressing concern about everything from the trees cleared for the plant to an endangered snake species on the site – and now, water.
""The local populace here has been told for years to reduce its water use. Then the richest man in the world comes along and gets everything laid out at his feet,"" Manuela Hoyer, Gruenheide resident and leader of a citizen's initiative opposing the plant, said. ""There's something wrong with the system.""
The local environmental ministry in Brandenburg maintains there is enough water to service the region and the Tesla plant.
""The local government does not see drinking water for the 170,000 people in the region as threatened,"" regional environment minister Axel Vogel said in local parliament in January.
The court case is separate to the wider licensing process Tesla is currently undergoing for the plant.

The ministry is in the final stages of approving Tesla's 13,500-page application to begin commercial production, but will still take ""some time"", a spokesperson said.
""Even if it is positive, the decision will have a three-digit number of pages, and not in the lower end, with many conditions and requirements,"" the spokesperson said.

1064,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 11:31AM ET</span>",Emerging markets drive global debt to record $303 trillion - IIF,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Emerging market borrowing led by China inflated the global debt mountain to a record $303 trillion in 2021, although the global debt-to-GDP ratio improved as developed economies rebounded, the Institute of International Finance said on Wednesday. 
The $10 trillion rise in the global debt pile was down from the $33 trillion increase in 2020 when COVID-19-related expenditure soared. 
Global debt-to-GDP - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/akvezxgblpr/bis%20chart%20one.PNG 
But more than 80% of last year's new debt burden came from emerging markets, where total debt is approaching $100 trillion, the IIF said in its annual global debt monitor report.
That means emerging markets have started 2022 facing record high refinancing needs just as the Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates after years of record low borrowing costs.
""While the pace of accumulation slowed in 2021, EM government debt levels remain elevated,"" the IIF authors wrote.
""This slowdown is in line with the moderation in government budget deficits seen over the past year. Yet, since the onset of the pandemic, some EM governments seem more reliant on off-budget borrowing,"" they said, pointing to rising non-financial corporate debt levels in China, Russia and Saudi Arabia.
Most of the jump in individual country debt-to-GDP ratios occurred in emerging markets. 
Emerging market debt ratios surge - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gdpzybrznvw/BIS%20chart%20two.PNG 
The IIF also noted that the vast majority of additional emerging market debt last year was in local currencies, and its share the highest since 2003. 
This came at a time when the pandemic slashed foreign investors' appetite for local currency assets -- at 18%, foreign participation in local bond markets is at its lowest since 2009. 
Emerging markets rely on local currency debt - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/byvrjeogwve/BIS%20chart%20three.PNG 
Those countries heavily reliant on external borrowing face greater risks from wobbly market sentiment and the rise in U.S. interest rates. 
Global indebtedness soared during 2020 as governments spent huge sums to revive their economies, bail out businesses and keep their citizens employed. 
While global debt levels remain very high by historical standards, economic recoveries and higher inflation helped improve the picture slightly last year.
The global debt-to-GDP ratio fell to 351% in 2021 from an all-time high of more than 360% in 2020, although last year's rate is some 28 percentage points above pre-pandemic levels.
Issuance of debt carrying an environmental, social and governance label boomed as investors piled into sustainable debt markets.
ESG-labelled issuance topped a record $1.4 trillion, nearly double the pace of 2020, although at around $3.4 trillion the ESG debt universe accounts for just 1% of global debt, IIF said.

Demand for ESG products is expected to increase that share. The IIF sees total global ESG debt issuance reaching $1.8 trillion in 2022 and potentially $7.2 trillion by 2025.

1066,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 11:06AM ET</span>",Nigeria takes JP Morgan to court for $1.7 billion over oil deal,"By Julia Payne
LONDON (Reuters) -A London high court began to hear a lawsuit on Wednesday launched by Nigeria against U.S. bank  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM), claiming more than $1.7 billion for its role in a disputed 2011 oilfield deal.
The civil suit filed in the English courts relates to the purchase by energy majors Shell (LON:RDSa) and Eni of the offshore OPL 245 oilfield in Nigeria, which is also at the centre of ongoing legal action in Italy. A panel of judges in Milan acquitted the companies and executives, who all denied any wrongdoing, of bribery last March. Prosecutors have appealed the ruling.
In the court documents pertaining to the London case seen by Reuters, Nigeria alleges JP Morgan was ""grossly negligent"" in its decision to transfer funds paid by the energy majors into an escrow account to a company controlled by the country’s former oil minister Dan Etete instead of into government coffers. 
The trial opened with details of the claim by Nigeria's lawyer, Roger Masefield. JP Morgan will present its defence early next week. The trial will end on April 7 and a judgment will likely take several months.
In court, Masefield said Nigeria's case rested on proving two key points: there was a fraud and JP Morgan was aware of the risk of fraud. He said JP Morgan had breached its duties.
""The evidence of fraud is little short of overwhelming,"" Masefield told the court.
""Under its Quincecare duty, the bank was entitled to refuse to pay for as long as it had reasonable grounds for believing its customer was being defrauded.""
Quincecare is a legal precedent whereby the bank should not pay out if it believes its client will be defrauded by making the payment.
JP Morgan's London offices deal with business for Europe, Middle East and Africa, including Nigeria.
A spokesman for the bank in a statement to Reuters said it was ""confident that it acted appropriately in making these payments"" and said the bank would ""robustly defend against this claim"".
DAMAGES SOUGHT
The damages sought include cash sent to Etete's company Malabu Oil and Gas, around $875 million paid in three instalments in 2011 and 2013, plus interest, taking the total to over $1.7 billion. The Nigerian government at the time asked JP Morgan to make these transfers as part of the oilfield sale, court documents show. 
The London case dates back to 1998 when Nigerian military ruler Sani Abacha awarded the offshore oilfield licence, OPL 245, to a company Etete owned. 
The $20 million price tag - of which Etete paid about $2 million, according to court documents - was widely viewed by industry experts as too low given the block was expected to yield billions of dollars of crude, although it remains undeveloped.
Subsequent Nigerian administrations contested Etete's rights to the field, triggering years of legal wrangling until a deal designed to end the battles was struck in 2011.
Etete's company Malabu Oil and Gas handed the undeveloped OPL 245 back to Nigeria as part of a resolution agreement involving Shell and Eni. 

To complete the deal, Shell and Eni paid a signature bonus of about $200 million directly to the Nigerian government and then deposited $1.1 billion in the Nigerian government's escrow account with JP Morgan, court documents show. 
Etete's lawyers did not comment on the trial as Etete is not a party in this suit. Shell and Eni are also not parties to the London law suit and declined to comment.

1068,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 10:35AM ET</span>","Private equity-backed carbon offset vendors Bluesource, Element to merge","By David French and Timothy Gardner
(Reuters) - Bluesource and Element Markets, two private equity-backed providers of products and services such as carbon credits to companies seeking to take action on climate change, said on Wednesday they had agreed to merge.
The combined entity will be majority-owned by the impact investing arm of alternative asset manager TPG Inc and will be the largest originator and marketer of carbon and environmental credits in North America, the companies said.
The merger underscores the potential for consolidation in the market for environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) consulting services, as providers seek scale to meet growing demand from climate-conscious companies and investors. 
Bluesource, which is backed by investment firm GEF Capital, advises companies on how to reduce their carbon footprint through the use of offsets and projects ranging from reforestation to wastewater treatment. 
Element, in which TPG's impact investing arm currently has a majority stake, helps companies produce renewable natural gas and also provides carbon and other emission credits. Renewable natural gas, generated from manure, landfills and wastewater, cuts emissions of a powerful greenhouse gas because it's burned before it would naturally escape to the atmosphere and is used in lieu of natural gas extracted from the ground.
No financial terms were disclosed. NGP Energy Capital Management, another private equity firm, will also have a stake in the combined company, the parties said. 
""We are seeing the carbon market follow what has happened in the information and data industries, where the model is moving towards providing services, rather than products, to companies to achieve their carbon reduction goals,"" said Element Chief Executive Angela Schwarz, who will also lead the combined company.
Bill Townsend, co-founder of Bluesource, will be chief strategy officer in the combined company, which will employ around 150 people.
""The industry we are in is still evolving, and we hope to shape where it is heading,"" added Townsend.
Bluesource unveiled in October a $500 million joint venture with private equity firm Oak Hill Advisors to purchase timber forests to be used in offset schemes.

Element accounts for 20% of the North American renewable natural gas market and counts Smithfield Foods, the world's largest pork processor, among its clients, according to its website.
""When I look out there, I don't see another pure-play decarbonization business like the one we're creating,"" said Marc Mezvinsky, business unit partner in TPG Rise, the TPG fund behind Element.

Investing.com -- Shares of monday.com (NASDAQ:MNDY), a cloud-based platform and work management software, plunged more than 25% Wednesday after the company reported its fourth quarter earnings.
 The company announced earnings per share of -26 cents on revenue of $95.5 million. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of -51 cents on revenue of $87.8 million. Revenue increased 91% year-over-year.
Furthermore, the net dollar retention rate for customers with more than 10 users was over 135%, while the total number of paid customers was 152,048, up 34% from 113,888 as of December 31, 2020. The number of paid customers with more than $50,000 in annual recurring revenue was 793, up 200% from 264 as of December 31, 2020.
""We had another great quarter at monday.com and finished fiscal year 2021 exceptionally strong. Compared to last year, we delivered 91% revenue growth and 200% enterprise customer growth, while generating record free cash flow in Q4,” said monday.com founder and co-CEO, Roy Mann.
The company sees total revenue of $100 million to $102 million in Q1, representing year-over-year growth of 70% to 73%, with a non-GAAP operating loss of $47 million to $45 million. For the full year 2022, the company expects total revenue between $470 million and $475 million, representing year-over-year growth of 53% to 54%, with a non-GAAP operating loss of $147 million to $142 million and a negative operating margin of 31% to 30%.

The Fed set out rules in October barring officials from buying individual company shares, bonds or derivative contracts, and widened that last week to include sector-specific investment funds and holding foreign currency, cryptocurrencies or commodities.
""Our own rules were relatively strict, but the new Fed rules could be considered to have set a new benchmark,"" the BoE's Court of Directors said in minutes of its Dec. 2 meeting published on Wednesday.
The Fed's sweeping new restrictions come out of a review ordered by its chair Jerome Powell, after Boston Fed chief Eric Rosengren and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan resigned following reports of their active trading during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Both officials said their investment trades were cleared by ethics officers and did not violate Fed policy.
""The focus now was on other central banks,"" the BoE's minutes said. ""Court agreed that we should re-evaluate our policy to ensure we are at best practice.""
In 2017 a newly appointed BoE deputy governor, Charlotte Hogg, resigned after failing to disclose a potential conflict of interest over her brother's role at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and receiving a rare rebuke from a parliament committee which oversees the BoE. 
Existing BoE rules bar staff from using inside information or carrying out short-term speculative trading, with specific bans on trading cryptocurrencies, spread-betting and purchasing shares or bonds from any company regulated by the BoE.
Staff are also generally barred from holding funds that are more than 35% invested in financial services companies.

Advance approval is required for staff arranging a mortgage, buying or selling shares in investment funds or foreign exchange hedging transactions.
The BoE last updated its rules in August 2021.

Maxx owner results miss estimates due to Omicron-led store closures,"(Reuters) -TJX Cos Inc missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly results on Wednesday, hit by temporary store closures and fewer customers visiting its outlets due to a surge in cases of the Omicron variant during the holiday season.
Shares of the company, which owns T.J. Maxx, fell about 6% to $61.43 after the retailer also reported lower profit margins as a result of higher freight costs.
Many U.S. companies, including TJX (NYSE:TJX) and its off-price rivals Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) and Burlington Stores (NYSE:BURL), have been grappling with global supply chains disruptions due to shipping logjams, product shortages and cost inflation.
That has made it hard for retailers to keep their shelves stocked and forced them to spend heavily on transportation and higher wages.
TJX forecast earnings per share to be in the range of 58 cents to 61 cents in the current quarter, largely below analysts' expectations of 60 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 
The company also projects U.S. comparable sales to grow between 1% and 3% in the first quarter.
In the holiday quarter, the company's net sales rose nearly 27% to $13.85 billion, missing estimates of $14.22 billion.
Excluding items, it earned 78 cents per share in the fourth quarter, missing estimates of 91 cents.
TJX said store closures due to COVID-19 restrictions may have resulted in about $1.45 billion to $1.61 billion in lost sales through the past year, although it added that sales during the holiday season were trending higher before the spread of Omicron cases. 

The sales were strong but not as robust as some other apparel retailers from whom TJX has been taking market share for years, Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said.
This month, U.S. department store chain Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) and retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc reported better-than-expected quarterly sales and forecast strong sales for the year.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Some U.S. tech giants may prefer to pay a fine rather than comply with antitrust rules, the European Union's antitrust chief said, and cited Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s fight with the Netherlands' competition authority as an example.
The Dutch Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) imposed a 5-million-euro ($5.7 million) fine on Apple on Monday, the fifth such penalty in successive weeks, linked to claims Apple does allow access to non-Apple payment methods for subscriptions to dating apps.
European Commission Vice President and digital chief Margrethe Vestager said Apple's behaviour could indicate other big companies behave similarly.
""Some gatekeepers may be tempted to play for time or try to circumvent the rules,"" she said in an online speech at a U.S. awards ceremony on Tuesday.
""Apple's conduct in the Netherlands these days may be an example. As we understand it, Apple essentially prefers paying periodic fines, rather than comply with a decision of the Dutch Competition Authority on the terms and conditions for third parties to access its App Store.""
Contacted by Reuters, Apple referred to a Feb. 3 blogpost, which said it is required to make the mandated changes to satisfy its legal obligations in the Netherlands while helping to protect users from increased risks.

Vestager has proposed landmark rules called the Digital Markets Act that targets Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Apple, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and which could come into effect next year.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Third-quarter profit jumped 62% to an all-time high of $640 million at China's Lenovo Group (OTC:LNVGY), the world's biggest maker of personal computers said on Wednesday, as the growing popularity of hybrid work arrangements boosts demand for PCs. 
Revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 31 rose 17% to $20.1 billion, also a record and ahead of an average estimate of $18.4 billion from 10 analysts, according to Refinitiv data.
Lenovo said worldwide demand for commercial PCs, excluding the Chromebook, in the quarter increased at the third-highest rate of growth since 1998. Customers were buying more premium, portable and high-quality PCs due to the growing prominence of remote working. 
""The hybrid work situation will continue even after the pandemic and more and more companies have announced they will have a hybrid working model,"" CEO and Chairman Yang Yuanqing told Reuters. 
""That will help drive PC demand at least to keep current levels of around 340-350 million (a year),"" he added, referring to a forecast consultancy IDC has made for demand through the years 2022-2025. 
While a global shortage of semiconductors, which has affected various industries including automakers, remained a business challenge, there were signs of easing, particularly for the second half of the year, he said. 
Lenovo also said that it was on track to deliver its medium-term target of doubling its net income margin. 

Lenovo is the world's largest PC maker, having captured a 24.6% market share of worldwide PC shipments in the fourth quarter of 2021, followed by HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) and Dell, according to consultancy  Gartner  (NYSE:IT). 
Lenovo had last year applied for a 10 billion yuan ($1.56 billion) share listing in Shanghai but abruptly withdrew it days after the application was accepted by Shanghai's STAR market. Yang said it had currently no plans to resubmit the application.

Investing.com – Stock of T.J. Maxx owner TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) plunged 6.2% Wednesday as the resurgent virus kept customers away from the retailer’s stores.
Fourth quarter net sales rose 27% to near $14 billion but were behind estimates. Delta and Omicron variants of the virus kept stores shut at different times during the fourth quarter in different geographies TJX operates in, although the company said fourth-quarter sales were trending higher before the surge in Omicron cases.
Net income of the HomeGoods owner nearly tripled to 78 cents per share but still fell behind estimates. Margins fell due to investments in expanding distribution capacity and wage increases at the bricks-and-mortar retailer.
The company will pay 13% more in quarterly dividend in June, it said. It also plans to buy back shares worth $3 billion.
For the current year, the company is targeting an increase of 3-4% in U.S. comparable store sales. The company did not provide a forecast for diluted earnings per share guidance, blaming “the current uncertainty around how long elevated expense pressures may persist.”
Current quarter U.S. comparable store sales are expected to be up 1-3%. Adjusted EPS is seen between 58 cents and 61 cents. The company said profitability should improve when the macro environment normalizes even as freight and wage cost pressures remain elevated."

MILAN (Reuters) - Stellantis beat its profitability target in the first year following its creation from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA, boosting hopes the automaker can cope with rising raw material costs and a shortage of semiconductor chips.
Milan-listed shares in the world's No.4 carmaker were up 6.5% in Wednesday afternoon trading.
The company, whose brands include Jeep, Ram, Opel and Maserati, reported an adjusted operating profit margin of 11.8% in 2021, above its target of around 10%. That was thanks to strong progress on synergies from the merger, which generated around 3.2 billion euros ($3.6 billion) in net cash benefits.
In a conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said the results demonstrated that ""we are going to deliver on our commitments.""
The figures come less than a week before Stellantis presents a strategic plan for the next few years, which should among other things address its struggling business in China.
Tavares said he expected Chinese authorities would approve Stellantis' plans to increase its stake in its Chinese joint venture with Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC). 
The carmaker also said it expected to post a double-digit margin again this year. The pro-forma figure for 2020 was 6.9%.
The outlook is ""very vague, but it leaves room"" for Stellantis to beat expectations, Banca Akros analyst Gabriele Gambarova wrote in a client note.
Finance chief Richard Palmer told reporters rising prices for raw materials, such as metals, would remain a problem for the industry this year, but the semiconductor shortage, which cost the group around 20% of planned production in 2021, peaked in the third quarter of last year.
""We think this (Stellantis' 2022) guidance is sensible given the difficulty in assessing volume, price, or mix in FY22, and with other headwinds such as raw materials,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts wrote in a client note.
Margins in North America, where Stellantis sells highly-profitable Jeep and Ram pickup truck models, climbed to a record 16.3% in 2021.
Rival General Motors (NYSE:GM)' comparable margin for 2021 in North America was 10.2%.
Palmer said cash synergies booked last year put the group ahead of schedule to reach 80% of its 5 billion euro cost saving runrate target by 2024.
He added Stellantis did not have a significant direct exposure to Russia, which faces fresh international economic sanctions over its actions in Ukraine.
""We have flexibility in production,"" Palmer said. ""We are confident we can manage the Russia crisis."" 
Tavares has so far mapped out a 30 billion euro electrification strategy, and formed alliances with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and iPhone assembler Foxconn to accelerate development of software and semiconductors for future connected vehicles.
He has also drawn up plans for five battery plants and cut deals with unions to keep streamlining European operations - side-stepping potential labour conflicts and boosting margins.
Palmer said the group had no current plans to create separate entities for electric and combustion engine cars, as is being considered by rivals  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Ford.

1078,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 08:54AM ET</span>",Porsche IPO Prospect Lifts Volkswagen Investors’ Spirts,"(Bloomberg) --
Finally.
This sums up how Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) investors seem to be reacting to Europe’s biggest carmaker announcing it’s preparing an initial public offering of Porsche. Speculation that VW would list its most lucrative asset has been swirling for years, but progress toward this actually taking place sent preference shares rising the most since December. The stock is adding to those gains Wednesday.
The IPO could come as soon as the second half of the year, people familiar with the deliberations told my colleagues Christoph Rauwald and Monica Raymunt. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates Porsche could be worth as much as 85 billion euros ($96 billion), generating significant value for shareholders thanks to top-tier margins and popular electric offerings.
The initiative is code-named “Phoenix,” the people said, a nod to the immortal bird in Greek mythology that regenerates and rises from the ashes of its predecessor. That’s pretty fitting, since the powerful Porsche-Piech family that partly controls VW more than a decade ago tried to have Porsche take over the far-larger manufacturer, only for VW to then turn the tables and gobble up the maker of the 911 sports car.
The move to set Porsche free again is a sign of the upheaval that has gripped the auto industry as it speeds toward electrification. Several carmakers and parts suppliers are considering structural shake-ups to excite investors.
Ford is looking at ways to separate its EV operations from the company’s legacy internal combustion engine business, Bloomberg reported last week. Daimler spun off its trucks business last year to allow Mercedes-Benz to better focus on electrifying its passenger cars. Aptiv has undergone a dramatic reinvention since the auto supplier spun off by pre-bankruptcy General Motors (NYSE:GM) went through its own restructuring. It’s emerged as a Wall Street darling positioned to support electrification and advanced driver assistance systems.
VW Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess has tried for years to untangle the company’s convoluted conglomerate structure, arguing a lack of agility is impeding efforts to catch up with and eventually bypass Tesla on EVs, software and self-driving technology.
Diess created considerable excitement last March by detailing a massive EV and battery-making push, but those efforts have sputtered somewhat. VW has had a tough time sourcing enough semiconductors, which has hampered output. On the electric front, the Tesla Model 3 and Renault Zoe both outsold VW’s ID.3 and ID.4 models in Europe last year. 
On top of that, the IPO of VW’s Traton truckmaking unit fizzled largely due to infighting and a limited free float, while an attempt to separate the Lamborghini supercar and Ducati motorcycle brands didn’t pass muster.
Porsche presents a golden opportunity for Diess to change the narrative. The division sold more cars than ever in 2021, with sales of the fully electric Taycan more than doubling and overtaking the iconic 911 for the first time. The brand will have five versions of the Taycan on offer from mid-March and plans to introduce a battery-powered version of the Macan compact SUV in 2023.
Of course, a Porsche IPO won’t be a walk in the park. VW’s 20-member supervisory board is composed of factions notorious for conflicting interests. Worker representatives, who account for half the seats, are often aligned with two officials from the German state of Lower Saxony who tend to want to protect jobs. Pleasing the powerful Porsche-Piech clan while making sure that losing its prime asset won’t turn VW into a “bad bank” of sorts will be a difficult tightrope for Diess to walk.
For the time being, at least, the advanced negotiations VW and its top investor are having are reason for optimism.
“We think a Porsche IPO, which has been a hot topic of discussion for years, is now more of a possibility of actually happening than ever before,” RBC analyst Tom Narayan said in a note.

1079,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 08:48AM ET</span>",Lowe’s Jumps as People Are Still Looking to Do Up Their Houses,"By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) stock traded 3.7% higher in premarket Wednesday after the home improvement retailer lifted its annual sales and profit forecast, encouraged by the strength in demand for tools and building materials.
The pandemic had led people to upgrade their dwellings or refurbish the new ones they moved to. Reopening of offices was expected to soften the do-it-yourself projects.
While offices are indeed reopening, more people are also choosing to work from home or move away from cities to smaller towns. Therefore, demand for toolboxes, bookshelves, and cotton rugs stayed high.
Total fourth quarter sales rose 5% to top $21 billion. Comparable sales, including that for the U.S. home improvement business, also rose as much.
The retailer also managed to improve its margins in times of high inflation.
Lowe's said it expects 2022 total sales of $97 billion-$99 billion, compared to a previous forecast of $94 billion-$97 billion. It expects gross profit margins to be up slightly compared to prior year, a relief arguably for traders at a time when just about every company, from banks to retailers, is warning about inflationary pressures. It expects annual diluted profit per share to be $13.35 at the center of its guidance range.
Fourth quarter adjusted profit per share rose 35% to $1.78 to come in ahead of estimates, driven by higher margins.

1080,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 08:45AM ET</span>","JPMorgan's Kolanovic Says Stocks Will Rise on Pandemic End, China Stimulus","(Bloomberg) -- There are two things that give Marko Kolanovic confidence in his bullish stocks call for 2022, even after a difficult start to the year for financial markets, with rising inflation and Russia-Ukraine tensions.
The co-head of global research at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has been asserting for some time that investors should buy dips in stocks -- but now he sees the acute pandemic phase of Covid nearing an end and better times ahead from China, which he expects to offset Federal Reserve tightening. And he sees scope for significant rotation within equities as these changes take place.
“Our base case is the end of the pandemic completely,” Kolanovic said in an interview. “During the spring and summer we will have a very strong recovery because omicron is in fast decline and now the immunity rates are really, really high.”
He added that when looking at pandemics in the last century, they lasted about two years and maybe three to four waves, “and then for the next 10 to 20 years nothing. We think we’re basically at that point, two-plus years of pandemic, we’ve had the four major waves. And so we think now maybe we’ll be fine for the next 10 or 20 years.”
Improvement from China should also brighten the global picture in coming months, he said.
“We think China is making a significant inflection point in terms of stimulating their economy, via both monetary and fiscal policy,” Kolanovic said. “We also expect or hope on the regulatory side some easing of regulatory pressure.”
JPMorgan was named top global research firm and number-one equity research team in Institutional Investors’ survey results released last month, after already having been awarded number-one global fixed income research team. Kolanovic was elevated to co-head of global research along with Hussein Malik in September -- and still continues to publish research along with his colleagues frequently. In recent weeks he’s said that bond traders are overpricing a hawkish Fed, and that recession fears are overdone in small-cap stocks, for instance. In December, very early after the detection of omicron, he advocated buying the dip in equities because of data suggesting that variant could be less deadly than other strains.
Still, Kolanovic doesn’t necessarily see an easy path for investors this year.
“You add the geopolitical friction points like Ukraine, and you can really produce some large moves which we think could still play going forward,” he said. “Everyone’s talking about Russia and Ukraine and it’s a very idiosyncratic thing. But it is critically tied to oil, gas and global energy security. We like exposure to energy directly by sector, but also some of the countries. Perhaps Russia is not the right place to invest, but maybe some of the countries that are proxies for commodities, we like that as well.”
About a year ago, Kolanovic said in the interview, he was bearish on the categories of innovation, clean energy, special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), crypto, and Covid beneficiaries -- and said now that they’re now all down by around half from that point, he’s less bearish. 
Read more: ‘SPAC Winter’ Buries Warrants Amid Fruitless Hunt for Takeovers
“I would now be a little bit more neutral in the sense that a lot of damage has been done” in those categories, Kolanovic said. “There’s definitely good and cheap stuff there, like if you look at the biotech or some international ADR tech companies which are down 50% or 60%, solid companies.”
In terms of what he’d recommend, medium-term in the U.S. Kolanovic likes energy, materials, financials, rising rates, and assets tied to the rising commodity cycle and reopening of the economy. He also likes small caps, noting that their forward price-to-earnings ratios are around 20-year lows -- as well as emerging markets, predicated on the China and commodities themes.
Read more: China Small Caps May Stand Out Amid Dim Outlook, BofA Says
He sees opportunity in differentiation at the single-stock level, noting that many things got sold off about the same amount when some should have dropped more, or less.
“Have a little maybe stock-by-stock analysis to pick up the pieces in this indiscriminate high-beta, high-volatility selloff that was triggered by the Fed,” he said. “Maybe international tech stocks or biotech stocks in the U.S. that, as a theme, you could say have sold off too much. Opposite to these on the negative side would be low-volatility defensive stocks that held up really well -- but these stocks will get hurt by interest rates.”
He also expects volatility and market fragility to decrease in coming months.
“We think now we could be bottoming and the cycle can turn, and we do expect volatility to normalize. Our forecast for VIX is averaging 18, and so if we are at 30 or 26 we think the fair value is lower and VIX should eventually decline,” Kolanovic said. “We saw pretty extreme fragility conditions in January, equal to those during December 2018 and March and April 2020, which, again, the market repricing the Fed was the catalyst. But ultimately we don’t think this is as severe as the pandemic or even that December 2018 selloff. So we are somewhat positive that these things will gradually improve.”

1081,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 08:26AM ET</span>",Barclays boosts investor payouts after record annual profit,"By Lawrence White and Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) -Barclays reported a record annual profit for 2021 and returned 2.5 billion pounds to shareholders via dividends and buybacks, as bad loan charges plunged and its investment bank continued its strong recent performance.
The British lender on Wednesday reported a pretax profit of 8.4 billion pounds ($11.42 billion), above analyst expectations and nearly tripled from 3.1 billion pounds a year ago. The bank's shares rose 4% in early trading.
It follows a run of vastly improved results for British lenders, after HSBC reported it had more than doubled its annual profits on Tuesday.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) said it would buy back 1 billion pounds of its own shares and pay out a full-year dividend of 4 pence per share, resulting in a total payout for the year of 2.5 billion pounds when added to earlier payouts.
In his first update to investors since taking over as chief executive following the shock exit of Jes Staley in November, C.S. Venkatakrishnan said he would continue his predecessor's focus on expanding the investment bank.
Staley left after a dispute with British financial regulators over how he described his ties with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Barclays said in its annual report it had suspended all Staley's bonus payments pending the outcome of his dispute with regulators – which it said amounted to nearly 70% of his variable pay since he joined the bank in 2015 - including a long term award that would otherwise have been paid out this year.
Staley still received 2.1 million pounds in fixed pay for 2021.
INVESTMENT BANK RECORD
Venkatakrishnan, who is known inside the bank as Venkat and like Staley is a former employee of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), indicated after his appointment as CEO that the lender's investment banking-focused strategy is ""the right one"".
Barclays said its investment bank delivered its strongest ever profit of 5.8 billion pounds, thanks to a 34% increase in fees from advising on deals such as mergers and fundraising, offsetting a 16% decline in markets income.
Venkat said his other two priorities would be digitisation projects such as a 'buy now, pay later' consumer finance offering with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in Britain and Germany; and focusing on the transition to a low carbon economy.
Despite the improved performance, the lender warned that soaring inflation in its markets would impact its finances. 
Barclays said its adjusted costs would be more than 12 billion pounds this year, partly as a result of higher pay for its bankers. The lender's bonus pool for 2021 increased 23% to 1.9 billion pounds.
However, the improved economic outlook meant it could release 700 million pounds of cash set aside for bad loans, boosting its profits.

The bank confirmed that its long-standing chief financial officer Tushar Morzaria will retire from the lender, with his deputy Anna Cross set to take over from April. Cross is the first woman to take up one of the top three roles at the bank.

Yunnan International Trust Co said in a filing dated Tuesday the assets underpinning the notes had generated less income than expected. 
The trust company said it would hold a meeting with investors on March 2 to vote on an unspecified agenda for the notes due March 17.
Shimao did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Regulatory curbs on borrowing have driven China's property sector into a liquidity crisis, with the struggles of Evergrande, the world's most indebted property firm, to repay its borrowings mirrored at several smaller rivals.
Shimao, which defaulted on a trust loan last month, has been scrambling to extend debt maturities including asset-backed securities and trust loans with creditors.
The Shanghai-based developer and its chairman have also been selling assets in China and overseas to raise funds.
Moody's (NYSE:MCO) downgraded Shimao's corporate family rating (CFR) again on Wednesday to Caa1 from B2, citing the firm's heightened liquidity risks over the next 6-12 months given its slower-than-expected fundraising progress to address its large upcoming debt maturities.
Moody's also changed Shimao's outlook to negative from ratings under review.
Last week, Shimao sought to extend payments of a 6 billion yuan trust loan by two years, and some creditors said they were not happy with the proposal that did not offer any credit enhancement.

Shimao did not pay the 1.3 billion yuan in the trust loan that was due last Thursday, local media Cailianshe reported on Tuesday, and no agreement with creditors have been reached yet.

Investing.com – Mosaic stock (NYSE:MOS) fell 5.2% in premarket trading Wednesday after fourth quarter earnings fell short of estimates.
The company stated that supply chain constraints and impacts related to COVID are impacting the global market for potash and phosphates.
It said labor shortages in North America, rail and truck delays, and weather impacts are slowing the delivery of inputs to facilities and products to end customers. In Brazil, road and port congestion is also slowing deliveries, the company said.
“These issues, combined with the current global supply and demand situation, point to tight markets for both phosphates and potash well into 2022,” it said.
The warning comes as higher prices hurt fourth-quarter volumes for the two key fertilizers.
Net sales of potash were $2.6 billion, up from $2 billion. Phosphate net sales rose to $4.9 billion from $3.1 billion a year ago. Phosphate sales volumes suffered because of the impact of Hurricane Ida in the second half of the year.
The company said its previous plan of buying back shares worth up to $400 million will be initiated this month. Once over, it will be followed by a new $1 billion repurchase program.
Strong agricultural commodity pricing trends are expected to continue driving the demand for fertilizers through 2022.
The company further added that the global demand for grain and oilseeds remains high. Strong global fertilizer demand in 2022 is expected as growers seek to maximize yields.
Total net sales rose over 56% to $3.84 billion and just matched estimates. Fourth-quarter adjusted profit was $1.95 compared to the estimate of $1.97."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Amazon, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other providers of cloud and data processing services will have to set up safeguards to prevent non-EU governments gaining illegal access to EU data, according to draft legislation from the European Commission.
The Data Act, published on Wednesday, lays out rights and obligations on the use of EU consumer and corporate data generated in smart gadgets and machinery as well as consumer goods.
This confirms a Reuters report earlier in February that the Commission aimed to tighten curbs on data transfers.
The draft law is part of a series of rules aimed at curbing the power of U.S. tech giants and to help the EU achieve its digital and green objectives.
""We want to ensure greater fairness in the allocation of value created by data,"" the Commission's digital chief Margrethe Vestager told a news conference.
""We are buying more and more products that generate data from smartwatches to connected cars and currently it's mainly the manufacturer of these products who holds and uses the data,"" she said.
The EU executive said the new rules will free up a huge volume of data for use and which is expected to add 270 billion euros of additional gross domestic product by 2028.
The Data Act also imposes contractual requirements and interoperability standards on cloud and edge services to make it easier for companies to switch to a rival and for data to be used between sectors. 
Users of connected devices will be able to access data generated by them, which typically is only accessible to the device makers, and share it with other companies providing aftermarket or other data-driven innovative services.
Companies will be obliged to provide certain data to governments during public emergencies such as floods or wildfires.
EU concerns about data transfers have grown since former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 revealed mass U.S. surveillance.
This led Europe's top court to outlaw a transatlantic data transfer pact known as the Privacy Shield which thousands of companies depended on for services ranging from cloud infrastructure to payroll and finance.

The United States and the EU have since then been struggling to find a new data agreement. 
The Data Act will need to be thrashed out with EU governments and lawmakers before it can become law.

1088,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 07:45AM ET</span>",FOMO May Lift Megacap Stocks When the Market Turns,"(Bloomberg) -- In this year’s technology stock slump, fund managers have cut their ownership of marquee names such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). to below their weight in benchmark indexes. Bulls couldn’t be happier.
The data is a reason to be slightly more bullish on big tech, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). Stocks with relatively low institutional ownership tend to gain over the next quarter, the firm said. The thinking is that bearishness is a contrarian buy signal: Investors will come rushing back in at the first sign of a stabilization or recovery in share prices, out of fear of underperforming the market.
“Investors have both the means and the opportunity to buy tech today,” said Ben Laidler, global market strategist at brokerage eToro. The strongest tech names are now cheaper and offer stronger than expected profit growth, he said.
In the top 100 actively managed institutional portfolios, five bellwether companies -- Apple, Amazon.com,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. -- are all under-owned relative to their weight in the S&P 500, Morgan Stanley analysts including Katy Huberty found in a review of regulatory filings. Funds on average hold 0.8 percentage point less of the stocks than their weighting in the benchmark, the firm said. 
Morgan Stanley’s findings add to the evidence that investors are sitting on plenty of fuel to drive a rebound in big tech. A Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). survey of fund managers this month found that their allocation to the sector has dropped to its lowest since August 2006.
The sector has been pressured by rising interest rates as investors priced in tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index down 15% this year. While Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent Meta is by far the worst performer among the big names, crashing in the wake of a disappointing earnings report, the weakness has been widespread. Microsoft is down 14% this year, while Alphabet is down more than 10%. 
“Sentiment is clearly negative, but following this across-the-board selloff, we are significantly more upbeat about the opportunities in the group,” said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors. He named Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta as names with strong prospects that look oversold.
Plenty of investors will look at the data and decide it’s still not worth the risk to invest in some of these companies, such as Meta, given the challenges they’re facing. And Morgan Stanley points out that it’s only megacap tech that’s underowned; funds are overweight the rest of big-cap tech by 0.3 percentage points on average.
Getting the timing right might be tricky too. Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at BofA Securities, said this week she’s hesitant about the sector, writing that it was in “growth purgatory,” as opposed to a “dirt cheap, buy everything” environment. 
In a report Tuesday, she posed the question of when investors should buy all of tech, and answered by saying they should wait until “everyone stops asking” when to buy. 
“Before that it might be a falling knife or dead money,” she wrote.
Tech Chart of the Day
The NYSE Fang+ Index, home to the likes of Apple, Amazon and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., is nearing a 10% drop for the month. If losses hold, it will be the biggest monthly decline since March 2020, when Covid-19 wreaked havoc in financial markets.

DUBAI (Reuters) -First Abu Dhabi Bank, the United Arab Emirates' largest lender, is set to sell $500 million in senior unsecured Islamic bonds at 75 basis points over U.S. Treasuries, bank documents showed.
The spread on the sukuk was tightened from initial price guidance of around 85 basis points over UST after FAB drew around $1.4 billion in orders excluding interest from joint lead managers, the documents showed.
The deal is expected to launch later on Wednesday.
Bond sales out of the Gulf have been slow this year as issuers wait out debt markets rattled by a more hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve expected to begin an aggressive tightening cycle next month, while political tensions over Ukraine further cloud the outlook.
Gulf issuance volumes were already expected to be subdued this year as high oil prices reduce government funding needs.
Dubai Islamic Bank, Emirates NBD Capital, First Abu Dhabi Bank, KFH Capital, Saudi National Bank, Sharjah Islamic Bank, Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) and The Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector are arranging FAB's sukuk sale.
The sale will mark only the third international issuance out of the Gulf this month, all by banks. 
Dubai Islamic Bank and Riyad Bank raised $750 million each with senior unsecured and sustainability-linked Additional Tier 1 sukuk, respectively. 
January also saw only three dollar-denominated Gulf bond sales.
Boubyan Bank on Wednesday hired banks to sell five-year senior unsecured sukuk too, while Abu Dhabi National Oil Company has set up a new debt-issuing entity that it said will tap the market for $3-5 billion a year.
Also in the pipeline is a sale of an $800 million green perpetual sukuk from Bahrain's Infracorp.

Vodafone has launched an initial sale of 63.6 million Indus shares and said it was in talks with various parties regarding the sale of its remaining shares.
The company's total stake of 757.8 million shares was worth roughly 190.7 billion rupees ($2.56 billion) as of Friday close, according to Reuters calculations.
The development comes after a challenging period for Vodafone in India, where its local arm, Vodafone Idea, has faced intense competition and lost millions of wireless subscribers to Reliance's Jio and Bharti Airtel.
Vodafone Idea's troubles have been compounded by huge dues owed to the Indian government, which is expected to own a 35.8% stake in the venture through a recent deal.
The British firm said on Wednesday it was in advanced talks with one of Indus's largest shareholders to sell a 4.7% stake in the company.
The company did not provide a name, but Indian media reported Vodafone was in talks to sell a 5% stake in Indus to Bharti Airtel. Bharti Enterprises Ltd, Bharti Airtel's parent, is Indus's largest shareholder, according to Refinitiv data.

Vodafone is also in talks with ""several interested parties"" to potentially sell its remaining shareholding in Indus, the company said.

1091,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 07:06AM ET</span>","Facebook did not label posts from top climate change deniers, report says","By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) did not add labels to half of posts pushing content from top climate change deniers, according to an analysis from the Center for Countering Digital Hate.
The research, released on Wednesday, also follows news that lawyers for Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen have filed a new complaint with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission this month claiming the company misled investors about its efforts to tackle climate change and COVID-19 misinformation.
Facebook, now known as Meta Platforms, has long been under scrutiny over the spread of misinformation on its platforms. The company said https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/connecting-people-with-credible-climate-change-information last year it would add informational labels to some posts about climate change, to direct users to its new Climate Science Information Center hub.
The UK-based Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) in a report last November identified a list of 10 digital publishers whose articles it said accounted for about 69% of Facebook interactions with climate denial articles, dubbed the ""Toxic Ten."" https://www.counterhate.com/toxicten 
This week, CCDH said that in an analysis of 184 posts pushing articles featuring climate denial content from these publishers, 50.5% of posts did not have information labels.
CCDH said it had analyzed posts published between May 2021 and January 2022, after Meta announced its labeling feature had been rolled out to a number of countries including the United States.
""During the time frame of this report, we hadn't completely rolled out our labeling program, which very likely impacted the results,"" said Meta spokesman Kevin McAlister. Meta said the initial phase of its labeling effort was only directed at posts seen by a small subset of users.
However, between Dec. 20 and Jan. 20, five out of 12 posts analyzed by CCDH did not have a label.
Meta said it combats climate change misinformation by ""connecting people to reliable information in many languages from leading organizations through our Climate Science Center"" and also working with independent fact-checkers (of which Reuters is one) to rate content for veracity and accordingly label and reduce its distribution.
One example of an unlabeled post highlighted by CCDH was a NewsBusters article that talked about ""alarmist climate propaganda."" NewsBusters did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""Meta keeps claiming it cares about climate change, but they have failed to stop the spread of misinformation about climate change on their platform,"" said CCDH Chief Executive Imran Ahmed in a statement. 
The CCDH also said it wants Meta to release data on the effectiveness of its labels.
A new SEC complaint filed by Whistleblower Aid, first reported by the Washington Post, recently alleged that Facebook misled investors about its work to deal with climate misinformation. 

It cited leaked discussions on Facebook's internal message board that said awareness of its Climate Science Information Center was ""very low"" for users in western markets or that questioned the transparency around decisions over climate change misinformation. It also referenced leaked discussions which showed staff sparring over how the company should handle climate misinformation and flagging ""prominent"" instances of it on the platform.
""There are no one-size-fits-all solutions to stopping the spread of misinformation, but we're committed to building new tools and policies to combat it,"" said Meta spokesperson McAlister in a statement.

Investing.com -- Virgin Galactic stock (NYSE:SPCE) traded 4.3% higher in premarket Wednesday after the company posted a narrower loss in the fourth quarter and said plans remain on track for a commercial launch of its services later this year.
The company again opened ticket sales last week, priced at $450,000 for a 90-minute excursion to space in July-September. It currently has a backlog of about 750 customers who have placed initial deposits of $150,000 each.
It plans to offer three flights per month by mid-2023 from Spaceport America in New Mexico with two spacecraft, VSS Unity and VSS Imagine, Bloomberg quoted CEO Michael Colglazier as saying.
The company on Tuesday revealed plans to outsource major parts of future spacecraft assembly to help lower costs and speed up production.
The company has sharpened its focus on its Delta class of spaceships. According to Bloomberg, the startup plans to conduct engineering and research work from a new office complex at Tustin in California, while procuring parts of its Delta ships from major aerospace suppliers. That approach will be more cost effective and help the company build its fleet faster.
The first Delta flight is expected in late 2025, with paying passengers the following year. According to Reuters, the spacecraft is expected to make up the bulk of its flight capacity and fly once a week.
Net loss in the fourth quarter narrowed to $81 million from $104 million a year ago.
The company founded by billionaire Richard Branson held about $931 million in cash as of December 31, compared with $679 million a year earlier. The figure excludes the $425 million it raised last month through a debt offering."
1094,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 06:36AM ET</span>","Hedge Funds Slash Tech in Pivot to Other Strategies, Goldman Report Says ","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. hedge funds have been slashing positions in technology stocks, and started 2022 more tilted toward cheaper shares than at any time in over a decade, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
“Filings show hedge funds positioning for a different equity market environment than the one that has characterized most of the last several years,” strategists led by Ben Snider wrote in a note to clients. Funds with $2.6 trillion of gross equity holdings have reduced positions in more expensive growth sectors in favor of energy and financials, he said.
The analysis looked at 13F filings for 788 hedge funds, released on Feb. 15. It showed that while the so-called “FAAMG” group of S&P 500 tech giants including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). still rank as the most popular long positions, hedge funds continued to rotate their portfolios from growth into so-called value shares.
The repositioning as of Dec. 31 -- which has seen hedge funds become more tilted to value than they have been since 2011 -- has been reflected in market moves this year. The benchmark S&P 500 gauge fell into a correction on Tuesday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 has slumped 15% this year amid an increasingly hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve in light of soaring inflation.
Overall, U.S. equity hedge funds have lost 3% on average so far in 2022, according to Goldman.
Contributing to the losses was a ‘VIP list’ of 50 stocks that appear most often in the top 10 holdings of fundamental hedge funds, which has lagged the benchmark by 21 percentage points during the last 12 months. That’s the worst performance in the 20-year history of the basket, which includes Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent Meta Platforms Inc. and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX).
“Sharply falling growth stock valuations, declining hedge fund leverage, retail selling, worsening equity market liquidity, and the underperformance of popular hedge fund long positions have created a vicious cycle,” the strategists said.

Investing.com – Palo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW) stock surged 7.2% in premarket Wednesday as demand for cybersecurity solutions in an increasingly hybrid work environment brought a higher guidance from the company after second quarter earnings.
The company now expects annual revenue of $5.45 billion at the center of its guidance range, up 28% and higher than the guidance of around $5.38 billion given over three months ago. Total billings are seen touching at least $6.8 billion, compared to $6.73 billion at the top end of the range guided earlier. On the higher side, current year billings could touch $6.85 billion, the company said.
Second quarter revenue grew 30% year-on-year to $1.3 billion while billings were up 32% as more companies embrace work from home, creating a need to secure systems at multiple remote locations.
“In Q2, our company continued to benefit from strength across our three security platforms, driven by strong cybersecurity demand, organizations architecting for hybrid work and growing their hyperscale cloud footprints,"" Chairman and CEO Nikesh Arora said in a statement.

LONDON (Reuters) -Aston Martin narrowed its annual loss in 2021 as sales surged and the company said on Wednesday it expected further improvements this year as it launches new, more profitable models and plans to raise prices across its model line-up.
The British luxury carmaker said it expected to see sales rise again in 2022, despite ongoing global supply chain disruptions that have accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The company said last month its core earnings for 2021 were affected by delays in shipments of its limited-edition Valkyrie sports car.
It said on Wednesday it expected to ship between 75 and 90 Valkyries in 2022.
The carmaker added it planned to launch its first fully-electric vehicle in 2025 and that as of 2026 all new car lines would have an electric option.
Fictional secret agent James Bond's car brand of choice has had a tough time since floating in 2018, failing to meet expectations and burning through cash, prompting it to bring in fresh investment from billionaire Lawrence Stroll in 2020, who now serves as the company's executive chairman.
""We have successfully transitioned our operating model to that of an ultra-luxury performance brand, with customer demand well ahead of supply,"" Stroll said in a statement. ""Our core business is strong and delivered to plan, with substantially improved profitability."" 
The first two new vehicles produced by Aston Martin's new management - the DBX707, a luxury SUV, and the V12 Vantage, a powerful sports car - will be launched this year ""with improved profitability compared with prior models,"" the company said.
Aston Martin said it had started incorporating technology from shareholder Mercedes-Benz, which increased its stake in the struggling carmaker in 2020, but added there were ""currently no plans to issue additional shares"" to the German carmaker until early 2023. 
That deal in 2020 expanded an existing supply agreement to give Aston Martin access to key Mercedes' technology, including hybrid and electric drive systems.

Aston Martin reported an operating loss of 76.5 million pounds ($104 million) for 2021, versus 323 million pounds the previous year, as sales jumped 82% to nearly 6,200 units.

Investing.com – ADRs of Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) traded 0.4% higher in premarket Wednesday as high iron ore prices and strong demand from its top consumer China led the miner to its highest ever annual profit.
Economies rebounded last year while commodity prices surged to record highs, creating robust cash flows at companies like Rio, BHP (NYSE:BHP) and Glencore (OTC:GLNCY). Iron ore accounts for around 75% of Rio’s earnings and it hit record prices last year. Copper also did, while aluminum prices are currently at a 13-year high. Price realizations across the three items surged last year.
Net earnings more than doubled from a year earlier to $21 billion, Rio said.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) -The world's No. 1 logistics company,  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS), on Wednesday lost its court fight for a record 1.74-billion euro ($2 billion) compensation claim from EU antitrust regulators for blocking its 2013 bid for Dutch rival TNT.
A win for UPS could encourage other companies to take similar action though EU merger vetoes are rare, with only 10 deals blocked by the EU in the past decade.
The European Commission had stopped UPS' planned 5.2-billion-euro acquisition of TNT because it had not offered enough remedies to allay concerns that the deal would hurt consumers.
UPS subsequently challenged the decision in court, won and then sued the EU executive for compensation for the harm allegedly suffered as a result of the EU veto.
""The General Court dismisses two actions for damages brought by UPS and ASL Aviation Holdings,"" the court said.
""UPS failed to establish that the infringements of its procedural rights in the procedure for the control of the concentration between itself and TNT constituted the determining cause of the types of damage alleged,"" judges said.
The court also turned down compensation claims from ASL Aviation Holdings DA and ASL Airlines (Ireland) Ltd, two UPS subcontractors that had clinched commercial deals with TNT to be performed after the approval of the merger between UPS and TNT.
The ruling can be appealed to the EU Court of Justice, Europe's top court, only on points of law.
The EU watchdog had in 2016 cleared FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX)'s 4.4 billion euro purchase of TNT Express.
The UPS claim is the largest since Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) sued the Commission for around 1.6 billion euros for blocking its bid for Legrand in 2001 and won. Europe's top court however said it should be compensated for only part of its legal fees.

The cases are T-834/17 UPS v Commission and T-540/18 ASL Aviation Holdings and ASL Airlines v Commission.

(Reuters) -Metro Bank said on Wednesday its annual loss narrowed and it has put aside 5.3 million pounds ($7.2 million) to resolve an investigation by Britain's financial regulator into the high street lender's 2019 accounting blunder.
The London-based bank, however, said it was cautious on its outlook due to the cost of living squeeze in Britain driven by higher energy prices, tax hikes and inflation. 
It withheld medium-term guidance but its shares rose nearly 3% after the results which showed net interest margin, a key measure of profitability, rose to 1.4% from 1.22% last year. It looks to further benefit from rising interest rates. 
Metro Bank, which in 2010 became the first lender to be granted a high-street banking licence in Britain in 150 years, has had a tumultuous two years after an accounting scandal in 2019 weighed on its shares and prompted probes by UK regulators.
CEO Daniel Frumkin told a media call that a resolution of the Financial Conduct Authority's investigation into the accounting issues was ""closer"" than previously thought, allowing the group to make the provision. 
The lender also said on Wednesday it was shutting down three branches - Earl's Court, Milton Keynes Midsummer and Windsor. 
The Bank of England in December also fined Metro for the accounting problem after it said the group presented an inaccurate picture of its regulatory capital in regulatory returns between May 2016 and Jan 2019.
Since the accounting scandal, the lender has launched a turnaround plan focussing on cost controls, revenue and margin growth, among others.
Metro reported an underlying pretax loss of 171.3 million pounds ($232.9 million) for the year ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of 271.8 million pounds the prior year. 
Frumkin declined to give a forecast for when the group may return to profitability. 
Analysts at RBC Capital estimates Metro to break even at some point between 2023 and 2024.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Puma said on Wednesday it expected sales to grow at least 10% in 2022 but the German sportswear maker cautioned that a consumer boycott in China and cost pressures would limit profit growth.
Puma expects 2022 operating earnings of 600 million to 700 million euros ($679-$792 million), up from 557 million in 2021 but short of the 692 million expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
Its shares were down 0.9% at 1009 GMT as analysts expressed disappointment about the outlook.
Puma in January had reported stronger-than-expected preliminary sales and core profit, including fourth-quarter sales up a currency-adjusted 14%.
But it said on Wednesday that higher freight costs and raw material prices, as well as COVID-19 constraints, would weigh on profits in 2022.
Factories in Vietnam, a major supplier to the footwear industry, closed for months last year due to COVID-19.
Puma is gradually raising prices to cover higher costs, with the bulk of that to come in the second half of the year, CEO Bjorn Gulden told journalists.
Gulden said he expected sales to fall again in China in the first quarter and that he could not say if they would return to growth again in 2022, noting that Chinese celebrities were still avoiding marketing with Western brands, although athletes were returning.
Puma, along with rivals like  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) , has come under fire in China since last March for saying it would not source cotton from Xinjiang over reports of human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims. Beijing denies any abuses.
Puma's fourth-quarter sales fell 27% in China, while rising in the rest of Asia/Pacific.

Nike said in December it was more confident of easing supply chain issues in the new fiscal year as it beat quarterly revenue and profit estimates despite sales in Greater China falling 20%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Inflation will have the biggest impact on global markets in 2022, traders said, while liquidity was the top daily trading challenge for a sixth year, according to an annual survey of institutional trading clients by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) published on Wednesday.
About 48% of 718 institutional trading clients surveyed at the end of November 2021 highlighted inflation as this year's biggest market mover, displacing the global pandemic, which topped last year's list. 
Market expectations of impending interest rate hikes have been rising since late last year, and hopes that the trend would be transitory have receded in recent weeks as major countries have struggled with soaring inflation readings.
Economic dislocation and the pandemic were the next factors seen as having the biggest impact, each polling at 13%. 
""The expectation is that this focus and concern will likely lead to more market activity and volatility given that inflation has not been a theme for over a decade,"" said Scott Wacker, head of FICC e-Commerce sales at J.P. Morgan, ""This will continue to reinforce the importance of liquidity and consistency of pricing which continues to play into the hands of electronic trading.""
Trading through electronic channels has risen in recent years and traders across all asset classes expect this upward trend to continue for the next two years, the survey found. 
""We’ve had two years of pretty unusual circumstances with the pandemic - a lot of clients moved away from the office and to the home environments during a very volatile market environment, it was the perfect storm for increasing electronic trading,"" JP Morgan's Wacker said. 
Mobile trading applications were seen as the main influence shaping markets in the next year, selected by 29% of traders.
Notably, artificial intelligence and machine learning are soon expected to overtake mobile tech as the main influencers, partly because many traders expect to have mobile tech in place by then, JP Morgan's Wacker said. 
Nearly half of those surveyed said artificial and machine learning will be the most influential factor shaping the future of trading in three years, followed by blockchain with 24% of the vote.
Currency markets beat their fixed income counterparts in terms of proportion of trading through e-channels, which stood at 69%, according to the survey. FX traders expect this to jump to 85% by 2023. 
Rates and credit traders expect increases of 17% in the proportion of trading executed through e-trading channels.

""Credit is a new frontier market for algo trading, a lot of the new technology that is emerging is in credit,"" said Wacker, adding that JP Morgan is trading some corporate bonds using algos across the US, EMEA and EM.
Algo trading or algorithmic trading refers to the business of using fast-paced computing software to trade markets. They have become a powerful tool in volatile markets in recent years.

1112,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 02:31AM ET</span>",Column-Ukraine jolt sees more consensus trades hits the skids :Mike Dolan,"By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - The new year is proving unkind to the global investor consensus yet again and low visibility now becomes a major problem.
As simmering Russia-Ukraine tensions boiled over this week, big bets on emerging market and euro zone stocks look to be going the same way as 2022's other hot tip - the overwhelmingly bullish U.S. dollar view.
And what seemed like a 'no brainer' in avoiding Treasury bonds is being rethought by the day.. Net cash holdings are the highest since pandemic unfolded in the spring of 2020.
Only energy, commodities and precious metals - and commodity-heavy indices like the FTSE 100 - have really performed so far, and mostly for obvious geopolitical reasons.
While a switch to cyclical and beaten-down 'value' stocks has been advised by many asset managers, a dramatic flattening of U.S. Treasury yield curve has turned out to be one of the trades of the year, though it hardly bodes well for growth ahead.
More questions than answers are mounting.
Will the uncertainty of military anxiety in eastern Europe allow the sort of aggressive central bank monetary tightening markets had rapidly priced in during the first six weeks of 2022? And at what point would soaring energy costs crimp demand as much as spur inflation?
Of course, it's early days on all counts. The year is not even two months old and volatile pricing in the short term doesn't mean full-year investment goals won't be met eventually.
A Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) number crunch out this week suggested a lot of the Ukraine crisis may already be discounted in prices.
But as UBS economist Paul Donovan noted again this week: ""Markets are not good at pricing in political risk properly.""
And so with expectations around next month's critical U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank meetings ebbing and flowing in tandem with oil price spikes and rising risk aversion, there's a strong argument for investors to batten down the hatches until the situation becomes clearer.
(Graphic: Major assets so far this year, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/akvezxgokpr/One.PNG)
BATTENED HATCHES
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s strategists note that Wall St equity selloffs around geopolitical shocks of the past century have tended on average to be deep, almost 6%, but only take six weeks overall to recover prior pricing. They caveat that by saying the prevailing economic climate dictates the course thereafter.
Amundi's Emerging Markets head Yerlan Syzdykov reckons there may eventually be opportunities in some of the markets worst affected - but also that global investors may just gravitate to safe havens ""until we get more clarity around the overall security situation"".
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s emerging debt team said the crisis had entered a ""new phase"" and they advised paring back positions more broadly as well as just removing all Russia or Ukraine paper.
""The crisis is now transitioning from a background risk to a significant market driver in coming weeks,"" they told clients. ""More durable fundamental consequences for markets, primarily via higher energy prices, need to be priced.""
(Graphic: Uncertainty vs euro zone and emerging market stocks, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/byvrjeoqgve/Two.PNG)
HOME BY CHRISTMAS?
So just write off the rest of the quarter then?
The Deutsche research hinges on dating these past geopolitical incidents to singular events - and this standoff may struggle to identify that one moment.
With no clarity yet on when or if Russia will mount a full-scale invasion of all of Ukraine, on what military resistance they might meet, or even how draconian the West's escalator of financial sanctions will eventually become, markets could be in for many more months of headline risk at least.
What's more, one of the dominant background economic concerns this time around - the persistence of energy-fueled inflation concerns - is very intertwined with Russia's actions.
And many will also look to see whether growing ties between Moscow and Beijing mean that China also sees this as a moment to face down the West on its regional issues - a standoff that global fund managers and companies far more exposed to China would see as a much bigger market disruption.
The recent summit between Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin saw China give explicit support to Russia's call for an end to NATO expansion while Russia stated its opposition to independence for Taiwan.
None of these scenarios augurs well for some of the big consensus trades of the year - not least European and Emerging Market stocks.
Talk of a euro zone energy crisis may be exaggerated as we head into warmer spring and summer in the Northern Hemisphere, and the Nordstream 2 pipeline, now sanctioned, was not yet functional anyhow.
But, as  Barclays  (LON:BARC) pointed out on Tuesday, current depressed natural gas flows from Russia would still leave euro gas storage at very low levels after a mild winter. ""The crisis could extend, potentially into 2023, if flows remain weak through the summer. Prices are likely to remain high and volatile.""
As for emerging markets, more stiff sanctions on Russia, added tension in eastern Europe, and a new hit for big energy importers such as Turkey are another blow in a year already agitated by high inflation and rising interest rates.
And unknowns surrounding China's next internal and external political shift is a potentially huge swing factor for big emerging equity indices that are dominated by Chinese stocks.
February's Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) fund manager survey saw the biggest net shift in positioning over the month move toward emerging markets. And so this latest jolt will hurt, with MSCI's emerging market equity index's peak to trough drop over the past year now back to 17.5% and flirting with 'bear market' territory of -20% once again.

Marked by devastating hurricanes and cold snaps in the United States, 2021 was one of the costliest ever for the world's insurers.
Nevertheless, Munich Re net profit in 2021 more than doubled to 2.9 billion euros ($3.28 billion), up from 1.2 billion euros a year earlier. The figure is in line with analyst expectations but slightly exceeded the company's own target of 2.8 billion euros.
For the current year, Munich Re forecasts profit of 3.3 billion euros. 
It said that reinsurance contract renewals at the start of the year rose by the overall volume of premiums as well as by price.

1114,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 23, 2022 01:53AM ET</span>",European Stocks Higher; Strong Corporate Earnings Help Sentiment,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com -- European stock markets traded higher Wednesday, helped by generally positive corporate earnings while investors continue to digest the situation in eastern Ukraine.
By 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.6% higher, the CAC 40 in France climbed 0.9% while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.5%.
The West has responded to Russia’s move into two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine by levying sanctions on Russian banks and individuals close to Putin, while Germany has halted the approval of Russia's controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
The sanctions are to punish Russia’s economy but are not intended to hit energy markets, a senior U.S. State Department official said Tuesday.
They are not as aggressive as the market had feared, and leave the room open for diplomacy to continue in an attempt to prevent the Russian troops from taking over the whole of Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv.
In the corporate sector, earnings continue to flow, with  Barclays  (LON:BARC) stock rising 2.8% after the British lender reported a near trebling in its annual profit while returning 2.5 billion pounds ($3.4 billion) to shareholders in 2021 via dividends and buybacks.
 Ted Baker  (LON:TED) stock rose 4.6% after the fashion retailer reported higher fourth quarter sales on Wednesday, up 35% on the quarter, as demand for clothing remained robust even in the face of pandemic-related curbs, while  Aston Martin  (LON:AML) stock climbed 3.9% after the luxury carmaker narrowed its annual loss in 2021 as sales surged.
Stellantis (PA:STLA) stock surged 4.3% after the company was formed by the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY), beat its profitability target in its debut year, thanks to strong execution on synergies.
 Danone  (PA:DANO) stock rose 3.4% after the world’s largest yogurt maker delivered stronger-than-expected sales growth in the last quarter of 2021.
On the flip side,  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) stock edged 0.2% lower despite the world’s top iron ore producer reporting an almost doubling of annual profit while returning almost $8 billion to shareholders in the form of a final dividend.
In economic data news, the March German GfK consumer climate index fell to -8.1, a drop from -6.7 the prior month, while attention will also be on the final Eurozone consumer price index release for January which is expected to confirm the pressure the European Central Bank is under to curb the significant inflationary pressures.
Oil prices stabilized Wednesday after surging to seven highs during the previous session, with energy supplies to western Europe unaffected by the first wave of the U.S. and European sanctions on Russia for sending troops into eastern Ukraine.
Investors now await U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later Wednesday after the holiday weekend. 
By 3:40 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $91.62 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $93.62, having Tuesday climbed to its highest level since September 2014.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.6% to $1,896.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher to 1.1343."

It distributes Mitsubishi Motor vehicles through some 141 dealerships in Russia and has a stake Sakhalin II gas and oil development project that supplies Japan with liquefied natural gas (LNG) and trades coal, aluminium, nickel, coal, methanol, plastics and other material. It also supplies power plant equipment and other machinery. 
A spokesperson for Mitsubishi Corp said its business interests in both Ukraine and Russia were small and declined to comment further.

A spokesperson for the financial conglomerate said it had contingency measures to continue its Russian business by using euro, yen and dollars payments with European banks.
TOYOTA, AUTOMAKER WITH FACTORY IN SAINT PETERSBURG
The company's operations were unaffected, a spokesperson said. Toyota's plant in Russia makes Camry and RAV4 vehicles, and it has a sales office in Moscow. It has about 2,600 people, including 26 Japanese nationals, at those locations.
EUROPEAN COMPANIES:
BASF, GERMAN CHEMICALS MAKER WITH 1% SALES FROM RUSSIA
""All employees in Ukraine are requested to work from home where possible and to avoid business travel. All of our employees in Russia continue to work as normal,"" BASF said in a statement.

The company sold its Ukraine operations in 2019.
INGKA GROUP, WHICH RUNS IKEA STORES AND MALLS WORLDWIDE 
""Potential sanctions are likely to affect all international companies, including Ingka Group,"" the company said in a statement.
METRO, GERMAN RETAILER WITH RUSSIAN OPERATIONS

NESTE, FINNISH REFINER AND BUYER OF RUSSIAN OIL
""If sanctions are aimed at Russian crude oil and oil products, it will have an impact on the oil market globally. It is very difficult to define those impacts at this stage,"" Sami Oja, interim leader of the oil products business at Neste, told Reuters. ""If there were no Russian oil available, Neste would buy its crude oil in other markets."" 
The company relies on Russia for two thirds of its oil needs.
""A significant part of Neste's crude oil purchases are made on so-called spot markets, meaning one load at a time, and therefore we are able to react flexibly to changes in the markets in our purchases if necessary,"" he said.
NOKIAN TYRES, WHICH HAS A PLANT AND WAREHOUSE IN RUSSIA
""We prepare for different scenarios as part of our normal risk-management work, and now we have intensified the work due to the current geopolitical situation, including availability planning,"" a spokesperson said.

Truth Social was downloaded 170,000 times since its launch, according to research firm Apptopia.
The app's launch could mark Trump's return to social media after he was banned from  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) following an attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters last year.
Digital World's shares jumped 14% to $96.36, levels last seen in October, days after the blank check firm announced a deal to publicly list Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the venture behind Truth Social.
The stock was also trending high on investor-focused social media site stocktwits.com, indicating interest from retail traders.
""It's driven by hype but I'm skeptical that the retail driven frenzy can be sustained,"" said Dennis Dick, head of markets structure, proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas.
""From a fundamental perspective, it's too early to tell. Trump has a huge following and they could move from traditional social media to this platform... but it depends on how good the app is.""
New users faced trouble signing up for the free app or were placed on a waitlist that cited ""massive demand"" soon after the launch. It was unclear if the issues were resolved by Tuesday.
Trump Media & Technology Group and Digital World did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
Wall Street's top financial regulators are investigating Trump's $1.25 billion deal to float TMTG on the stock market, a filing showed in December.

Other stocks linked to Trump also advanced. Phunware, hired by Trump's 2020 Presidential re-election campaign to build a phone app, climbed 11%. SPAC CF Acquisition Corp VI, which is taking video platform Rumble Inc public, added 3.3%.

(Reuters) -As the S&P 500 hovers near correction territory, Wall Street is gauging the further effect of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine on asset prices, with some strategists warning investors to keep their cool and focus on longer-term market trends. 
Worries over geopolitical strife and a more hawkish Fed have combined to take the S&P 500 down nearly 10% from an all-time high hit in early January. 
The benchmark index was recently off around 0.7% on Tuesday after President Joe Biden announced new sanctions against Russia for what he called the beginning of an invasion of Ukraine.
Still, some analysts maintained the longer-term impact of the geopolitical strife could be fleeting, and urged investors not to overreact to recent market moves. 
“We do not see any reason to panic at this stage,” said Charles Henry Monchau, chief investment officer at Bank SYZ in Geneva, Switzerland. “While most Western media comments sound alarming, we might actually get close to 'peak fear' on this crisis and there is a high probability that tensions will start to abate from here on.” 
Monchau has maintained his exposure to equities while also allocating a portion of his portfolio to gold, a popular haven during times of political or economic uncertainty. 
How the worsening confrontation in Eastern Europe could affect the Fed’s actions has been a topic of debate. While some have worried that rising oil prices – which stand around their highest level since 2014 – could push up inflation and force the central bank to become even more aggressive, others believe the market uncertainty could mitigate the central bank’s hawkishness.

""Overly restrictive monetary policy could result in an outright policy error especially if the business cycle continues to deteriorate,” wrote Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, chief equity markets strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), in a note to investors. “The Russia/Ukraine crisis could force a reassessment of the Fed tightening path resulting in central banks turning less hawkish, while policymakers may consider additional fiscal stimulus.""
Research from Capital Economics showed that interest rates have typically fallen in the six months after major geopolitical crises, with some exceptions, including the OPEC oil embargo.
While risks between higher inflation and slower growth appear balanced for now, ""a marked escalation of the crisis might tip the balance in favour of later or slower interest rate hikes,"" wrote Jennifer McKeown, head of the global economics service at Capital Economics.
That tipping point could come sooner in the euro zone, which is reliant on Russia for energy imports, she said.
Jim Reid, of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), pointed to the bank’s data on how markets have behaved in past geopolitical crises. Selloffs in the S&P resulting from geopolitical events have typically been short-lived, with the index falling some 6% to 8% on average, taking three weeks to reach a bottom and another three weeks to recover to prior levels. 
“Ultimately, the underlying economic context tends to dominate, so if you believe the template, much might depend on what you thought momentum was before the sell-off,” Reid wrote in a Monday note. 
Analysts at Truist Advisory Services said a recent tumble in investor sentiment may bolster the case for buying stocks. 
The most recent survey from the American Association of Individual Investors showed the percentage of investors who believe stocks will be higher in six months dropped to 19.2%, its lowest level since May 2016. The S&P 500 was higher three months later 94% of the time with an average gain of 6.7% after similar past readings, Truist analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday. 
""Historically, military/crisis events tend to inject volatility into markets ... but stocks tend to eventually rebound unless the event pushes the economy into recession,"" they said. 

Still, most analysts were expecting the conflict to continue roiling markets in the short term. 
The conflict “just prolongs the uncertainties that are in the market,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. “These uncertainties mean negative sentiment and so even positive news is just put on the back burner.”

The California-based company said there was a chance that the front strut damper - a part used in the suspension - in its sedans was assembled improperly by its supplier. 
Lucid is not aware of any instances of the part failing in its vehicles, but it expects about 1% of the 203 potentially affected cars may have the incorrectly installed part. 

It started building a $169,000 variant of its electric sedan in September after struggling with delays caused by quality issues. The company has since delivered a small number of cars.
In recent weeks, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has filed recalls with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for issues related to its driver assistance system and other software issues.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Woolworths Group Ltd reported a slump in first half profit on Wednesday as COVID-19 lockdowns and mandatory staff isolation blew out costs, but the No. 1 Australian grocer's shares rose as investors focused on robust sales growth.
The country's biggest employer said net profit from continuing operations and excluding one-off costs fell 6.5% to A$795 million ($575 million) in the six months to Jan. 2. Profit from its supermarket chain, a closely watched measure, dipped 7.6%.
The results had been larged flagged by Woolworths in December when it warned the half year would be one of its toughest as lengthy lockdowns to slow the Delta outbreak gave way to significant numbers of staff in isolation because of the fast-spreading Omicron variant. 
Investors instead looked to headline sales, up 7.1% for food, as a sign the company could benefit from rising inflation and grow profit as pandemic-related disruptions dissipated. Woolworths shares rose more than 4% on Wednesday, against a flat overall market.
""Given a comprehensive update was provided in December, there were no surprises in the numbers but ... sales growth is strong,"" Jefferies analysts wrote in a note.
Analysts at Barrenjoey said Woolworths broadly met its guidance despite bigger than expected COVID-19-related costs, ""suggesting the underlying business is in better shape"".
By comparison, smaller rival  Coles Group  (OTC:CLEGF) Ltd, which along with Woolworths rings up about two-thirds of Australian supermarket sales, posted a narrower 2% dip in first half profit a day earlier. But its supermarket sales only grew 2%.
Neither grocer gave a fixed profit forecast but both singled out inflation as a force behind higher shelf prices and operating costs. Woolworths said sales in the first seven weeks of calendar 2022 were up about 5%.
""There is pressure there, the pressure is legitimate,"" Woolworths CEO Brad Banducci said on a call with journalists, when asked about inflation.
""It's not only on the products we sell but across everything that we do. There's a long way to go on this issue.""
Inflation appeared more pronounced in non-food retail, Banducci added. Though supermarkets generate about 90% of Woolworths profits, it also runs discount department store chain Big W.

Woolworths trimmed its interim dividend to 39 Australian cents per share, from 40 cents the prior first half, excluding the dividend contribution from its liquor store and pubs unit which was spun off last June.

The disclosure by the Asset Management Association of China (AMAC) mirrors a slump in fundraising by Chinese mutual funds, and comes as a growing number of money managers announce fund launch failures, or extend subscription periods.
Newly-registered private funds totalled 95.9 billion yuan ($15.16 billion) in January, down 44% month-on-month, according to AMAC. 
Of the total, fundraising by products that invests in stocks and bonds dropped 49%, while private equity and venture capital fundraising fell 25%, and 17%, respectively, according to the association.
China's stock market has been hit by economic headwinds, regulatory crackdown on the tech sector, and uncertainty stemming from U.S. monetary tightening. The rapid escalation in the Russia-Ukraine crisis will only worsen investor anxiety.
In the mutual fund space, fundraising slumped 61% in January from a month earlier, and down 76% from a year ago, according to fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors. 

Adding to signs of tepid investor demand, three Chinese mutual fund firms have failed to launch planned funds over the past weeks, while dozens more have extended subscription periods.

1124,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2022 07:22PM ET</span>",Baby formula makers still breaking global marketing rules - report,"By Jennifer Rigby
LONDON (Reuters) - Almost all parents and pregnant women in China, Vietnam and the UK are exposed to “aggressive” formula milk marketing campaigns that breach global rules set up after scandals more than 40 years ago, according to a new report.
The marketing techniques can push women away from breastfeeding and include everything from giving free samples, to executives setting up or joining ""mums' groups"" on popular messaging apps, the report from the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and M&C Saatchi said. 
Health workers are also targeted, with gifts, funding for research and even commission from sales, all practices that are banned under international guidelines for the marketing of formula milk. 
The WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for newborns, where possible, as the healthier option.
The report's authors and several external experts said it was time to reform the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes. The code was set up by WHO in 1981 in a bid to regulate the industry after scandals in the 1970s when Nestle was accused of discouraging mothers, particularly in developing countries, from breastfeeding. 
Nigel Rollins (NYSE:ROL), lead author of the report and a WHO scientist, told Reuters in an interview: ""Are there areas for strengthening the code? Unquestionably."" 
Formula milk and tobacco are the only two products for which there are international guidelines to prevent marketing. 
Despite this, only 25 countries have fully implemented the code into legislation, and over the last four decades, sales of formula milk have more than doubled, while breastfeeding rates have only slightly increased, the WHO said. The formula milk industry is now worth $55 billion annually.
The report found that more than half of the 8,500 parents across the eight countries surveyed - Bangladesh, China, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, the United Kingdom and Vietnam – reported exposure to marketing, much of which was in breach of the code. 
Titled ""How marketing of formula milk influences our decisions on infant feeding"", the report also included interviews with marketing executives and 300 health workers, and is the largest of its kind. 
In China, 97% of women surveyed had been exposed to formula milk marketing; in the UK it was 84% and in Vietnam, 92%. More than a third of women across all of the countries said that health workers had recommended a specific brand of formula to them.
While the code allows factual informational about formula to be provided, and the authors acknowledged the importance of formula milk for women who cannot or do not want to breastfeed, they said the marketing practices were a key reason for low breastfeeding rates worldwide.
The WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for at least the first six months of life, but at the moment, only 44% of babies this age are fed this way. 
A major study in 2016 suggested more than 800,000 babies’ lives could be saved annually if breastfeeding rates improved to reach this milestone. 
""False and misleading messages about formula feeding are a substantial barrier to breastfeeding, which we know is best for babies and mothers,"" said UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell in a statement. 
Rollins said digital marketing in particular needs work, because of the potential for personalised targeted messaging and because it is now a major area of expansion for formula milk companies, alongside milks for older children and milks for allergies. 
In a statement on behalf of the companies, the International Special Dietary Foods Industries (ISDI) said its members complied with all laws and regulations in the countries in which they operate. 
""Our members support efforts by national governments to ensure compliance with all national laws and regulations. Our members are ready to work together with all stakeholders to support optimal infant health and well-being,"" it added. 
The WHO declined to comment on individual companies, and does not name them in the report, but said that there were no substantial differences between their practices. 
However, an index by the Access to Nutrition Initiative in 2021 found that some companies were more compliant with the code than others: for example, Danone's marketing is 68% in line with the rules, and Nestle, 57%. However, three of the leading companies operating in China – Feihe, Mengniu and Yili – all scored zero. 
External experts said that wider reform was needed to bring all companies, and countries, into line, as well as tougher punishments for those who break or skirt the rules.
Gerard Hastings, emeritus professor of marketing at the University of Stirling, Scotland, said regulators like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should be more involved. 

""We need to rethink how to actually make it (the code) work, so that it can be enforced much more strongly,"" he told Reuters. 
""These agencies really need to go back to the drawing board and think of infant formula products in the same way as you would think of drugs.""

(Reuters) - Shares in Nubank rose nearly 8% in after-hours trading on Tuesday as investors welcomed a narrower fourth-quarter loss at Latin America's most valuable fintech, which added new clients and sold more products.
The digital bank, which listed its shares in New York in December, posted a net loss of $66.2 million, down from a $107.1 million a year earlier. 
Nubank, backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, said its revenue more than tripled to $635.9 million from a year earlier, well above a Refinitiv consensus of $393.76 million.
Its monthly revenue per active client reached $5.60, up $2.30 from the previous quarter, boosted by new products. Costs per client fell to 90 cents a month from $1.10. 
Despite a more challenging economic environment in Brazil in the fourth quarter, Nubank's consumer lending delinquency rate remained roughly stable at 3.5%, up 0.1 percentage point from the previous quarter.
Chief Executive David Velez told analysts in a conference the company, which has 53.9 million clients, will continue to execute its strategic plan, but added that it is able to pull back if the macro environment deteriorates.
Analysts are paying close attention to Nubank's performance as its default rate is seen as likely to deteriorate as inflation and interest rates rise.

Velez said in an interview earlier this month that Brazil's economic downturn may represent an opportunity for Nubank to gain market share, as some players are likely to retreat amid a riskier environment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes fell on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 confirming a correction, as the Ukraine-Russia crisis kept investors on edge after Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized two breakaway regions in the country and ordered troops to the area.
The S&P 500 ended down more than 10% from its Jan. 3 closing record high. A correction is confirmed when an index closes 10% or more below its record closing level.
Indexes pared losses and ended off their lows of the session after U.S. President Joe Biden announced the first wave of sanctions against Russia, while saying he was hopeful diplomacy is still available.
Biden added that the United States had no intention of fighting Russia. He said the sanctions, among others things, target Russian banks and sovereign debt.
""It finally gives all of this rhetoric, all of this strategy, some teeth. This is something to make the other side feel some pain and I think that's appropriate,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
Earlier on Tuesday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that the alliance believed Russia was still planning a big assault on Ukraine following Moscow's recognition of two separatist regions in the former Soviet republic's east.
Britain published a list of sanctions and Germany froze the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline project, which would have significantly increased the flow of Russian gas.
All major S&P 500 sector ended lower on the day, led by losses in cyclical sectors including consumer discretionary and energy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 482.57 points, or 1.42%, to 33,596.61, the S&P 500 lost 44.11 points, or 1.01%, to 4,304.76 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 166.55 points, or 1.23%, to 13,381.52.
The measures announced by Biden were not as harsh as some investors had feared, said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc, an investment advisory firm based in Toledo, Ohio.
But he said the effect is likely temporary given that the Ukraine-Russia crisis is not over.
The Dow and Nasdaq were each down more than 2% shortly before Biden spoke.
Shares of  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) dropped 8.9% after the home improvement chain reported a decline in gross profit margins for the holiday quarter due to a jump in transportation and labor costs.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.79-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.90-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced new sanctions on Russian elites and two banks as the West tries to stop an all-out invasion of Ukraine by punishing Moscow for ordering troops to two separatist regions it has recognised.
The European Union, Germany and Britain also announced ways they will hit Russia financially as they fear a further incursion is to come, a move Moscow has consistently denied for months.
Equity index compiler MSCI said in a report other actions it could take included a security freeze - restrictions such as an increase in the number of shares would not be allowed in the securities of some companies until further notice.

This action would be similar to MSCI's current treatment of the existing sanctions targeting Russia, it said.

The estimate covers investments agreed to under public-private partnerships, which totaled about 40 billion reais last year, according to the ministry's Secretariat of Economic Policy (SPE). 
""It is a very welcome increase and it will have an impact, it is a robust value,"" Economic Policy Secretary Adolfo Sachsida said at a press conference.
In total, the SPE said investors have committed to some 1.3 trillion reais in long-term investments in public-private partnerships, with 360 billion reais coming from 2022 to 2025. 
The figure does not include the privatization of power company Eletrobras, which the government aims to remove from state control this year by selling enough new shares to dilute its current controlling stake.
While the government has forecast economic growth of 2.1% this year, mainly due to increased private investment and an improved labor market, economists consulted in a weekly survey conducted by the central bank project an expansion of just 0.3%. 
""I think we're going to have a better year than most have predicted,"" said Sachsida. 

The ministry will review its macroeconomic estimates in mid-March, and the secretary said that ""if necessary"" the government could raise or lower its outlook for the economy.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Brazilian food processor BRF SA (NYSE:BRFS) turned a profit in the final quarter of 2021, traditionally a good period for food sales due to the holiday season, helping it secure its third consecutive year in the black.
BRF posted a 932 million reais ($184.4 million) gain in the fourth quarter, up 3.3% from the same year-ago period, it said in an earnings statement on Tuesday.
The result was bolstered by a nearly 20% rise in net revenue, to 13.7 billion reais in the quarter, although cost pressures and declining consumer confidence in Brazil, where it derives most of its sales by volume, hurt the business.
Factors including domestic inflation, income loss and uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic weighed, as well as weather-related issues, which compromised South American grain production and caused feed prices to spike. 
""The food industry is still under pressure from rising commodity prices and disruptions in supply chains,"" BRF said.
Despite the headwinds, BRF was able to post a 437 million real profit for 2021. Still, this was down 68.5% from 2020, when overall margins were better.
On international markets, BRF pointed to a drop in both pork export volumes and prices in sales to key customer China during the fourth quarter, following a recovery in local production and a fall in consumption amid the pandemic. 
This affected the segment's gross margins, but was partially offset by a rise in dollar prices for products sold to Japan and South Korea, BRF said. 
The company benefited in the Halal meat sector, in which food products are prepared according to Muslim dietary requirements, from a pickup in economic activity.

As volumes and prices rose in Halal sales, both in Gulf countries and in Turkey, BRF grew revenue by respectively 33% e 11% in those markets, the earnings statement said.

CNH Industrial completed the spin-off of its truck, bus and engine operations, now separately listed as Iveco Group (MI:IVG), at the start of 2022. It is focusing on higher-margin agriculture and construction machine businesses, whose data content, autonomous technologies and alternative fuels are increasingly at the center of CNH's business. 
The group controlled by Exor (OTC:EXXRF) NV, the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family, forecast net sales of between $20 billion and $22 billion in 2024, up from $17.8 billion last year, according to slides in the presentation.
CNH, which houses brands such as Case and New Holland, also estimated a margin on its adjusted operating profit (EBIT) of between 12% and 13% in 2024, up from 9.9% in 2021. The margin for its agriculture unit is expected at between 14.5% and 15.5%, up from 12.3% over the same period.
New York-listed shares in CNH Industrial closed down 5.03%. 
After buying Raven (NASDAQ:RAVN) Industries last year for $2.1 billion to bolster its position in precision agriculture and autonomy, CNH will now focus on ""disciplined"" M&A activity, it added. 
""We're not buying to get bigger. Our dollars are going to go towards driving organic growth,"" Chief Executive Scott Wine told analysts during the presentation.
""Disciplined M&A will be a key part of our strategy going forward.""
The company added it was seeing strong buyer interest for Raven's engineered films and aerostar units, the two non-core businesses it plans to sell. 
Chief Digital Officer Parag Garg said CNH was well placed to be leaders in autonomy and help customers throughout the entire farming cycle.
Over the next three years, the company plans to increase investment for organic growth in construction by 26%, compared with 68% in technology and 53% in agriculture.
""Automation is a key strength for CNH Industrials tech strategy, already bringing benefits to farmers across the world across the whole cycle and helping build a backbone for it to deliver an autonomous future,"" he told analysts.

CNH is relying in part on price increases to offset higher costs, and sees supply chain problems throughout the year. Company executives said ""incremental"" price increases will remain, before prices normalize in 2023.
Advancement in electrification for its mid to large construction equipment is a priority, in addition to the company's core focus on its excavators and powertrains, executives said.

1133,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2022 05:56PM ET</span>",Explainer-Western sanctions on banks only scratch surface of Fortress Russia,"By Tommy Wilkes and John McCrank
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States, the European Union and Britain announced new sanctions on Russia on Tuesday after Moscow's recognition of two separatist regions in Ukraine as independent entities.
Chief among their targets: Russian banks and their ability to operate internationally.
Yet the impact of the new sanctions is likely to be minimal. Western governments - for now - are preferring to keep the much larger sanctions packages that they have planned in reserve should the crisis escalate. 
It means Russian bankers or their Western counterparts with exposures to the country won't be losing much sleep.
Indeed, U.S. banks are not expecting global sanctions to have a major impact on American bank businesses or spark contagion risk, given lenders have little exposure to the Russian economy, said three executives familiar with industry thinking. [nL8N2UX2PZ]
Here's how the banks are being targeted and which measures might hit harder: 
WHAT HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED SO FAR?
European foreign ministers agreed to sanction 27 individuals and entities, including banks financing Russian decision-makers and operations in the breakaway territories.
The package of sanctions also includes all members of the lower house of the Russian parliament who voted in favour of the recognition of the breakaway regions.
Britain imposed sanctions on Gennady Timchenko and two other billionaires with close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and on five banks - Rossiya, IS Bank, GenBank, Promsvyazbank and the Black Sea Bank.
The lenders are relatively small and only military bank Promsvyazbank is on the Russian central bank's list of systemically important credit institutions.
Bank Rossiya is already under U.S. sanctions from 2014 for its close ties to Kremlin officials.
Washington imposed sanctions on Promsvyazbank and VEB bank.
It also ramped up prohibitions on Russian sovereign debt, which U.S. President Joe Biden said meant the Russian government would be cut off from Western financing. The U.S. Treasury said it was extending current prohibitions to cover participation in the secondary market for bonds issued after March 1 by Russia's Central Bank and other entities.
Russian dollar bonds extended their losses after the announcement on U.S. sanctions, with longer-dated issues slipping to record lows trading in the mid-90s, data showed. The premium demanded by investors to hold Russian debt over safe-have U.S. Treasuries blew out to 329 basis points, the widest since the COVID market rout in spring 2020. 
WHAT WILL THE IMPACT BE?
For now - minimal. 
Russia's large banks are deeply integrated into the global financial system, meaning sanctions on the biggest institutions could be felt far beyond its borders. 
But the new sanctions focus on smaller lenders.
The measures targeting banks are not yet as extensive as those imposed after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, although many of those sanctions remain in place.
Then the West blacklisted specific individuals, sought to limit Russia's state-owned financial institutions' access to Western capital markets, targeted the bigger state lenders, and imposed widespread limits on the trade of technology.
Britain's new measures refrained from imposing limits on the biggest state banks, cutting off capital for Russian companies, or ejecting other prominent so-called Russian oligarchs from Britain.
Shares in Russia's biggest banks, Sberbank and VTB soared after the state-controlled groups escaped the sanctions.
Analysts say Russian institutions are better able to cope with limited sanctions than eight years earlier, and Russian state banks have cut their exposure to Western markets.
Russia has since 2014 diversified away from U.S. Treasuries and dollars - the euro and gold account for a bigger share of Russia's reserves than do dollars, according to a January report from the Institute of International Finance.
Russia has some strong macroeconomic defences too, including abundant hard currency reserves of $635 billion, oil prices near $100 a barrel and a low debt-to-GDP ratio of 18% in 2021.
""The ones today were not that significant,"" said Samuel Charap, a senior political scientist at the nonprofit, nonpartisan RAND Corporation, about the U.S. sanctions.
“The question is where we go from here,"" he said. ""I am increasingly pessimistic, and I think there is a high probability of significant further Russian military action and I think in that case, we are likely to see some of the really qualitatively more devastating measures than in the past.""
WHAT MIGHT COME NEXT?
The EU has said it is ready to impose ""massive consequences"" on Russia's economy but has also cautioned that, given the EU's close energy and trade ties to Russia, it wants to ratchet up sanctions in stages.
Officials consider Tuesday's measures as a first round.
Beyond lenders that do business directly with the breakaway regions, it's not clear yet when or whether the EU will hit the biggest banks. 
Washington has prepared a raft of measures including barring U.S. financial institutions from processing transactions for major Russian banks by cutting ""correspondent"" banking relationships, sources told Reuters last week.
Disabling international payments would hit hard.
Those measures, however, may be kept in reserve.
Russia's Sberbank and VTB would face American sanctions if Moscow proceeds with its invasion of Ukraine, a senior U.S. administration official told reporters. 
If such banks did get targeted, U.S. banks could face retaliation, said Charap, who pointed to cyber attacks as a potential weapon that could be used. 
WHAT WOULD HIT HARDEST?
What the region's banks and Western creditors fear most is the possibility that Russia is banned from a widely used global payment system, SWIFT, which is used by more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries.
Such a move would hit Russian banks hard but the consequences are complex. Banning SWIFT would make it tough for European creditors to get their money back and Russia has been building up an alternative payment system. 
Data from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) shows that European lenders hold the lion's share of the nearly $30 billion in foreign banks' exposure to Russia. 
WHICH FOREIGN BANKS ARE MOST EXPOSED?
Europe's banks - particularly those in Austria, Italy and France - are the world's most exposed to Russia, and have been on high alert should governments impose new sanctions. 
Graphic: Bank exposures to Russia - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/myvmnxmabpr/banks%20russia.PNG 
Italian and French banks each had outstanding claims of some $25 billion on Russia in the third quarter of 2021, according to BIS figures. Austrian banks had $17.5 billion. That compares with $14.7 billion for the United States.

Among the most exposed lenders is Austria's RBI, which has big operations in Russia and Ukraine. It has said ""crisis plans"" would come into effect if things deteriorate. Its shares closed down 7.5% on Tuesday.
Many foreign banks have, however, significantly reduced their exposure to Russia since 2014, making some bankers less concerned about the threat of sanctions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500's 1% slump on Tuesday confirmed that the world's most watched stock index was in a correction for the first time since the 2020 Wall Street plunge brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
U.S. investors sold stocks amid growing fears of war between Russia and Ukraine, paring some losses after U.S. President Joe Biden announced a wave of sanctions against Russia.
Those geopolitical concerns have added to recent worries about the possible path of the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes as the central bank attempts to rein in inflation at 40-year highs.
Earlier, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that the alliance believed Russia was still planning a big assault on Ukraine following Moscow's recognition of two separatist regions in the former Soviet republic's east.
The S&P 500 is now down 10.25% from its record closing high of 4,796.56 set on Jan. 3, confirming a correction, based on a widely used definition of a decline of 10% or more. The index had briefly been down more than 10% from its intraday record several times in recent trading sessions, without closing at that level.

The small-cap Russell 2000 index last month confirmed it was in a bear market, or drop of 20% from its most recent high. However, some analysts feel smaller stocks are in the process of bottoming out.
Also in January, the Nasdaq confirmed that it had entered its fourth correction since the start of the pandemic. It is down almost 17% from its record high close in November.

Rising interest rates tend to disproportionately weigh on shares of high-growth companies as investors value them based on earnings expected years into the future, and high interest rates erode the value of future earnings more than the value of earnings made in the short term.

The company founded by billionaire Richard Branson held about $931 million in cash as of Dec. 31, compared with $679 million a year earlier.
The figure excludes the $425 million it raised last month through a debt offering to help fund the launch of its commercial service, which is set to start later this year.
Virgin Galactic earlier this month re-opened ticket sales to the public for space travel, setting prices at $450,000 per person with an initial deposit of $150,000.
The company has sharpened its focus on its Delta class of spaceships, engaging with suppliers to ramp up production of the craft that is expected to make up the bulk of its flight capacity and fly once a week.

It posted a loss of 31 cents per share in the fourth quarter to Dec. 31, compared with estimates of a 35 cents per share loss, according to Refinitiv IBES data. That was helped by labor efficiencies and the postponement of certain non-critical work. 
Total revenue came in at $141,000, below expectations of $331,000.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 stumbled Tuesday, as hopes for a diplomatic resolution to deescalate tensions on the Ukraine border soon turned to despair as the U.S. outlined fresh sanctions to deter Russia from carving out further territory in Ukraine.    
The S&P 500 fell 1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4%, or 482 points, the Nasdaq slumped 1%.
""We're implementing full blocking sanctions to large Russian financial institutions, VEB, and their military bank,"" President Joe Biden said. These sanctions would cut off Russia's government from Western financing.
Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed that Russia had recognized the expanded borders of Luhansk and Donetsk after initially indicating that Moscow would recognize only the two separatist-held areas in Eastern Ukraine.
In sign that diplomacy is running out of road, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he would no longer meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva this week. 
The deepening geopolitics crisis forced the broader market to swing wildly, as brief attempt to stage rebound off session - following Biden's remarks - was soon met with fresh selling pressure. 
Consumer discretionary stocks were also a big drag on the broader market, with  Home Depot  down more than 8% despite reporting better-than-expected fourth quarter results.
Home Depot (NYSE:HD) reported fourth-quarter earnings of $3.21 on revenue of $35.72 billion, underpinned by comparable sales of 8.1%.  
Energy stocks ended the day down down 1% as oil prices eased from session highs.
 Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD), APA (NASDAQ:APA), and  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) were the hardest hit stocks in the energy sector, with the latter down more than 3%.
Tech, meanwhile, struggled to hold onto its gains after turning positive intraday. 
Big tech including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) closed lower. 
Financials, mostly banks were supported by rising Treasury yields even as the odds of a 50-basis points hike at the Federal Reserve has diminished. The 10-year Treasury yield was flat, but the 2-year Treasury yield, which is swayed by fed rate hikes, was up more than 4%.  
 Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY),  First Republic Bank  (NYSE:FRC), People’s United Financial Inc (NASDAQ:PBCT) were among the biggest gainers. 
About 30% of traders expect the Fed to raise rates by 50 basis points, down from about 90% last week.  
Positive economic news showing the consumer remains in good shape was overshadowed by geopolitical developments.  
U.S. consumer confidence index fell to 110.5 in February, though that was ahead of consensus of 110.0. ""Despite the dip today, confidence remains above where it recently bottomed in September (109.8),"" Jefferies said in a note. 
The earnings front served up mixed quarterly results.
Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) bucked the trend lower, rising 5% after the food and beverage company boosted its long-term growth guidance and reiterated its guidance for 2022. 
 Krispy Kreme  (NASDAQ:DNUT) reported its maiden quarterly profit since its initial public offering as price hikes helped offset a rise in costs.
In other news, the special purpose acquisition company  Digital World Acquisition  (NASDAQ:DWAC), which is taking former President Donald Trump's social media app Truth Social, surged 10% on data showing the social media app had strong debut on Sunday as it racked up over 170,000 downloads on Apple's App Store."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Crude oil futures on Tuesday reached their highest levels since 2014 on supply concerns and stocks sold off in a volatile session as investors eyed international responses after Russia sent troops into parts of Ukraine.
Markets were jittery a day after Russia's move but the safe-haven U.S. dollar was slightly lower against major currencies while gold, another safety bet, was also in the red. 
U.S. President Joe Biden announced the first sanctions against Russia for what he called Moscow's beginning of an invasion of Ukraine, and he promised steeper punishments ahead if Russia continued its aggression.
While the S&P 500 confirmed it is in a correction by closing more than 10% under its record high, it still finished above its session low, reached before Biden spoke. [.N] 
""When Biden came out and set sanctions they weren't maybe as severe as people were fearing,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut.
And while investors were jittery, Pavlik said that ""people are trying to sit with what they own if they've adjusted their portfolio ahead of all this. For those that haven't, it's a little late in the game."" 
The European Union also agreed on new sanctions against Russia on Tuesday while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz halted the new Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia and Britain took action against Russian banks. 
""The world is still hoping this is somewhat limited and doesn't really spread across Europe and Ukraine,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, noting that riskier assets were selling off. ""Nobody's rushing to buy.""
Brent crude futures settled up 1.5% at $96.84 per barrel after earlier topping $99 for the highest level since September 2014, reflecting fears that Russia's energy exports could be disrupted by any conflict. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled up 1.4% at $92.35 per barrel after earlier hitting $96, its highest level since August 2014.[O/R] 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 482.57 points, or 1.42%, at 33,596.61, while the S&P 500 lost 44.11 points, or 1.01%, falling to 4,304.76 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 166.55 points, or 1.23%, to 13,381.52. [.N]
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, shed 0.9% after earlier falling 1.5%, with the index at levels not seen since Jan. 28.
Spot gold fell 0.4% at $1,898.77 after earlier climbing to its highest level since June. 
Yields on U.S. Treasuries edged higher after Biden announced new sanctions on Russia in retaliation for Moscow's dispatch of troops into what it recognized as two breakaway regions of Ukraine, but the bond market reaction was muted overall.
Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 2/32 in price to yield 1.9372%, up from 1.93% in the previous session. Yields move in the opposite direction to bond prices.
The dollar index fell 0.047%, with the euro up 0.14% to $1.1326. The Japanese yen weakened 0.29% versus the greenback at 115.06 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3581, down 0.13% on the day. 

The Russian rouble slid to 80.9275 against the U.S. dollar in earlier trading, touching its lowest level against the greenback since November 2020, before reversing course. The dollar was last down 1.7% against the rouble. 
Russian dollar bonds extended their losses a little after the U.S. sanctions were announced, with longer-dated issues slipping to record lows trading in the mid-90s, data showed. The premium demanded by investors to hold Russian debt over safe-have U.S. Treasuries blew out to 329 basis points, the widest since the COVID-19 pandemic market rout in spring 2020.

(Reuters) -The United States Trade Representative's (USTR) office said on Tuesday it opposed Canada's plan to enact a digital services tax (DST) and urged Canada to abandon plans for such a step.
""The United States urges Canada to abandon any plans for a unilateral measure and instead redouble its commitment to the rapid implementation of Pillar One of the October 8 OECD/G20 agreement and the negotiation of a multilateral convention"", the USTR office said in a statement.
The USTR also raised concerns about measures that it said singled out American firms for taxation while excluding national firms engaged in similar lines of business.
""Should Canada adopt a DST, USTR would examine all options, including under our trade agreements and domestic statutes"", the USTR statement added.
The Canadian government said it had proposed the DST to protect Canadian interests and it remained in close contact with the United States over the issue. 
""It is our sincere hope that the timely implementation of the new international system will make this Digital Services Tax unnecessary"", a representative from the office of Canada's deputy prime minister said. 
The United States in October withdrew its threat of tariffs against five European countries over their digital services taxes as part of a deal to manage the transition to a new global tax regime for large highly profitable corporations such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). But it remains at odds with Canada over the issue.
Last month, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Jayme White expressed Washington's concern about Canada's proposed digital services tax in talks with Canada's deputy trade minister, David Morrison.

Canada unveiled the proposed measure in April, saying it would stay in place until major nations come up with a coordinated approach on taxing the big digital companies.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has since agreed on a common approach to ensure such companies pay their share of taxes, but a treaty to enforce this has yet to be implemented.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexico's  America Movil  (NYSE:AMX) said on Tuesday it has launched 5G services in 18 Mexican cities and plans to spend $1.8 billion to kick off what regulators have said will become the largest 5G commercial network in Latin America.
About 1 million Mexicans are now connected to the 5G network from subsidiary Telcel, part of the company owned by the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, executives told a news conference. 
Service plans will be available for users to upgrade as of next week, executives said. An estimated 40 million people will be connected to Telcel's 5G in the initial phase, which includes the vast capital of Mexico City and two other major urban hubs, Monterrey and Guadalajara.
The company hopes to expand to 120 Mexican cities by the end of the year. Mexico had an estimated 84.1 million users online in 2020, according to its statistics agency.
""This new technology will change the way we live, work, learn, interact and have fun,"" America Movil Chief Executive Daniel Hajj said.
He said the company has no plans to retire its 2G and 3G networks for the moment.
Mexico's telecommunications regulator cleared Telcel to launch the 5G network earlier this month. Telcel spokesman Renato Flores said the company had been anticipating the approval, allowing for a quick rollout.
The company said the network will allow ""better, longer-distance connectivity, minimal latency and higher speed,"" with Hajj saying web surfing would be 20 time faster.
Telcel said it used Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) equipment in the north of the country and Huawei in the south to build the network.
Reuters has previously reported that Huawei has been limited from operating in northern Mexico on some projects due to political sensitivities in the United States, which has denounced the company as an untrustworthy agent of the Chinese government.
Although airlines had warned the launch of 5G in the United States could interfere with airplane systems, Flores said aviation in Mexico will not be affected because Telcel's network operates on a different radio frequency band.
America Movil previously said it hoped to roll out the service in 90% of the company's markets by the end of the year, which include Brazil, the region's biggest economy.

Top telecoms operators, including Spain's Telefonica (NYSE:TEF), have begun to deploy 5G in big Brazilian cities but a nationwide rollout is still months away.
Telcel is working with governments around Latin America, including in Colombia, to receive approvals to expand, Flores said.

WASHINGTON/VIENNA/LONDON (Reuters) -European banks on Tuesday were bracing for the fallout from fresh global sanctions as the Ukraine crisis escalated, although U.S. bank executives said they expected the industry to be insulated from major disruption after pulling back from Russia in recent years.
Europe's banks - particularly those in Austria, Italy and France - are the world's most exposed to Russia, and for weeks have been on high alert should governments impose new sanctions against the country.
HSBC warned of market contagion and Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) said it was preparing ""crisis plans."" 
Britain was the first on Tuesday to move in retaliation for Russia recognising two breakaway regions of Ukraine and sending troops. Britain hit five banks and three individuals, a relatively mild package that Prime Minister Boris Johnson said allowed him to ""reserve further powerful sanctions"" for whatever ""Putin may do next"".
The European Union also agreed sanctions that will blacklist more politicians, lawmakers and officials, ban EU investors from trading in Russian state bonds, and target imports and exports with separatist entities.
""This package of sanctions... will hurt Russia, and it will hurt a lot,"" the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told a news conference. 
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he was halting the certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, an important future energy source for Europe's largest economy.
Then on Tuesday afternoon U.S. President Joe Biden announced sanctions targeting two Russian banks, the country's sovereign debt, and Russian elites and family members, and warned that Russia would pay an even steeper price if it continued its aggression.
Since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, the United States and European Union have blacklisted specific individuals, sought to limit Russia's state-owned financial institutions' access to Western capital markets, and imposed bans on weapons trade and other limits on the trade of technology, such as that for the oil sector. 
That caused banks, particularly in the United States, to reduce their exposure to Russia, making some bankers less concerned about the threat of sanctions on their business and more focused on the market impact of geopolitical tensions.
The boss of HSBC, one of Europe's largest banks, said on Tuesday ""wider contagion"" for global markets was a concern, even if the bank's direct exposure was limited.
""It's clear that there is a likelihood of contagion or some second-order effect, but it will depend on the severity of the conflict and the severity of the retaliation if there is a conflict,"" Noel Quinn told Reuters in an interview.
U.S. banks, meanwhile, are not expecting global sanctions to have a major impact on American bank businesses or spark contagion risk, given lenders have little exposure to the Russian economy, said four executives familiar with industry thinking.
According to the Bank for International Settlements, U.S. lenders had outstanding claims of just $14.7 billion on Russia in the third quarter of 2021. 
U.S. banks and financial industry lobby groups have held meetings with the Biden administration to discuss sanctions in recent days, three of the sources said. One said banks had spent the past 24 hours identifying who might be the potential targets of the sanctions so they could move quickly. 
Another said the administration had reached out to executives in the industry before Christmas and had kept banks apprised of its thinking. 
This person added that one area of potential concern was the disruption that might be created if the U.S. decides to target Russia's access to the SWIFT international payment network, although that is seen as unlikely in the near future. 
That's because cutting Russia off from the international payments network could seriously hurt its economy and everyday citizens, and would create enormous complexity and compliance risks for the global banking industry. 
RBI, which has significant operations in Russia and Ukraine, said business was now normal, but ""in the event of an escalation, the crisis plans that the bank has been preparing over the past few weeks will come into effect"". 
Shares in the Austrian bank fell 7.48% on Tuesday. 
Dutch lender ING, which has a large presence in Russia, said: ""A further escalating conflict could have major negative consequences.""

One Danish pension fund said it would immediately halt new Russian investments in the wake of Putin's move into Ukraine.
With several jurisdictions rolling out new sanctions, bankers said they hoped governments would coordinate as they drafted the fine print, in order to reduce complexity for the industry.

Cerner announced earnings per share of 93 cents on revenue of $1.45 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of 88 cents on revenue of $1.49 billion.
The beat on the bottom line despite weaker revenue was driven by rising adjusted operating margin to 21.7%, up 180 basis points from 19.9% for 2020.

(Reuters) -A U.S. retail workers' union on Tuesday accused Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) of unlawfully interfering with a union election at an Alabama warehouse where the company had already been found to have engaged in unlawful conduct to deter labor organizing. 
The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) claiming Amazon removed union literature from employee break rooms, limited workers' access to the warehouse before and after shifts and forced workers to attend anti-union meetings.
Amazon in a statement provided by spokesperson Kelly Nantel said it was confident it had fully complied with the law.
""Our focus remains on working directly with our team to make Amazon a great place to work,"" the company said. 
Scrutiny of working conditions at Amazon has intensified in recent months, with some employees seeking to organize at facilities in New York and Canada. A victory at even one warehouse would be a milestone that labor experts say could invigorate the U.S. labor movement.
The NLRB sent unionization ballots to workers at the Bessemer, Alabama, plant earlier this month and will tally the votes at the end of March.
The RWDSU was handily defeated in an election held last year, but the NLRB threw out those results after finding that Amazon unlawfully influenced the vote by encouraging workers to place ballots in a mailbox on company property.
Amazon and a group of New York workers last week agreed tentatively on terms for a union election at a different warehouse, and an organizer said that vote would take place late next month.
The charges filed on Tuesday could lay the groundwork for the RWDSU to challenge the results of the pending election in Alabama if it loses. 
The union said in the charges that meetings featuring anti-union messaging that Amazon workers are required to attend are coercive, and that workers should have the right to opt out of them.

So-called ""captive audience meetings"" are currently legal under U.S. labor law and are a common feature of employer campaigns to discourage unionizing. 
But the general counsel of the NLRB, an appointee of Democratic President Joe Biden, recently said she wanted the board to reconsider that precedent.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A former Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) construction manager has filed a lawsuit against the electric car company alleging he was fired for reporting widespread safety violations and race discrimination at Tesla's factories.
In the lawsuit filed with Alameda County Superior Court on Friday, Marc Cage, an African American, claimed to have reported safety violations that risked massive explosions at Tesla's battery factory in Nevada and systematic failures by the company to disclose serious on-the-job injuries. 
""Tesla’s commitments to unrealistic production goals and frantic efforts to ramp up its production, often to make good on rash promises, overrode any commitment to employee safety,"" the complaint says. 
He also alleged that Tesla employees, with the full knowledge of the company's management, denigrated and harassed him on the basis of his race. 
""Virtually every restroom in Tesla’s Fremont facility contained writings or carvings of racist symbols and slurs, including swastikas and prominent displays of the n-word,"" Cage said in his complaint.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.
A California state agency earlier this month sued Tesla over allegations by some Black workers that they were subjected to racist slurs and drawings and assigned the most physically demanding jobs at Tesla's factory in Fremont, California. 
That lawsuit, which Tesla said was ""misguided,"" said the company tolerated racial discrimination, adding to claims made in several other lawsuits against the world's most valuable automaker.
Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, have escalated a battle with regulators who have scrutinized his social media posts, the company's treatment of its workers and its testing of semi-automated driving systems on public roads. 
Musk on Tuesday accused the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of being a multi-layered ""corruption onion."" A day earlier, the company had accused the agency of leaking information from a Tesla-related probe.

Tesla disclosed earlier this month that it had received a subpoena from the SEC about its compliance with a 2018 settlement over Musk's tweets about taking the company private.
Last week, the company and Musk accused the SEC of harassing them with an investigation to punish Musk for being an outspoken critic of the government.

Investing.com -- Stocks fell on Tuesday but erased some of those losses, as investors returned after an extended holiday weekend to news that Russia had sent troops to separatist regions in eastern Ukraine to the condemnation of European and American Allies.
President Joe Biden was expected to add sanctions for the move as the West continues to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop his aggressions in Ukraine. Biden views the moves as an invasion, according to reports on Tuesday.
Not helping things in the stock market,  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) sold off after it reported a decline in gross profit margin for the last quarter after rising transportation and employee costs. 
Of course the destabilization of Ukraine meant energy prices rose, with WTI crude, the American benchmark, jumping 2%. Germany stopped the progression of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that was supposed to be Russia’s gas connection to Europe.
The CBOE volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, was at 29.40, well above its long-term average of 20, Reuters reported.
While the situation in Ukraine continues to rapidly evolve, stocks will await more earnings on Wednesday along with the latest reading on oil inventories from the industry.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Lowe’s earnings
The construction and home decorating retailer Lowe’s Companies Inc (NYSE:LOW) will declare its fourth-quarter numbers Wednesday. The company is expected to report a profit per share of $1.71 on revenue of $20.91 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.
2. Travel rebound?
Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG)’ fourth-quarter revenue is expected to be $2.86 billion with profit per share at $13.40, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. Analysts will be waiting to see if there are signs of a return to travel and leisure now that the Omicron variant of Covid-19 appears to be winding down.
3. Industry inventories
The oil industry’s reading on the latest crude inventory levels was delayed a day because of the holiday. The API will report last week’s levels at 4:30 PM ET on Wednesday. The reading for the previous week was a draw of 1.07 million.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Nestle SA said on Tuesday it will almost double its investments in Brazil in 2022 from a year earlier as it builds a new pet food factory and looks to expand its overall industrial capacity in the country.
The annual investments are expected to reach more than 1.8 billion reais ($355.59 million), up from 939 million reais in 2021, Nestle told Reuters, adding that its new Purina plant in the southern state of Santa Catarina - which is already under construction - will get about 40% of the total amount.
Some 1.1 billion reais will be invested in Nestle's industrial operations in the South American country, including new technologies, logistics and sustainability initiatives.
Of that, 90% is set to go to new lines as it aims to boost output capacity, Nestle said, while also planning to invest in energy to shift part of its power generation in Brazil to biomass from gas.
Nestle's coffee plants - seen as a priority for the company in Brazil, the world's largest producer and exporter of the commodity - will get 160 million reais this year. Such an amount does not include investments in sales and distribution channels, it said.
""It is going to be a year of a lot of investments in innovation, increased efficiency and productivity in our lines,"" Nestle's chief executive in Brazil, Marcelo Melchior, said in a statement.

""We're implementing full blocking sanctions to large Russian financial institutions, VEB, and their military bank,"" President Joe Biden said. These sanctions would cut off Russia's government from Western financing.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global stock markets were already headed for a volatile year with modest gains even before the latest escalation of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, according to a Reuters poll of around 120 equity market analysts and brokers around the world.
Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision on Monday to recognise two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine and deploy troops there has deepened Western fears of a major war in Europe and made the outlook much more difficult to predict.
With most central banks around the world now on the move chasing consumer price inflation - at multi-decade highs in many economies as they emerge from the pandemic - double-digit annual stock price rises of recent years already looked unlikely.
""The path of the situation in Ukraine is paramount for now – especially if further escalation of the situation aggravates the rise in energy prices in Europe and globally, as this leaves a backdrop of higher input costs that central banks cannot realistically address with policy tightening,"" strategists at Saxo Bank wrote.
Most major stock market indexes are in the red for the year or barely up. Much will depend on whether the situation in Ukraine, which has already sent crude oil to nearly $100 a barrel, has a greater knock-on effect on inflation and activity.
Even before the escalation in tensions, more than 80% of analysts - 69 of 82 who answered an additional question - said inflation would have a significant or very significant impact on company earnings this year. The remaining 13 said insignificant.
The Feb. 11-21 Reuters poll of stock market strategists, brokers and fund managers also found most participants scaling back predictions for annual gains for most major indices compared with the previous survey three months ago.
Of the 17 major stock indices surveyed, medians showed analysts upgrading predictions for only three of them for end-2022, compared to the previous poll released on Dec. 2.
The UK's FTSE 100 index was the only major index to be upgraded. Brazil's BOVESPA and Mexico's S&P/BMV IPC stock index were also upgraded, although they were revised only marginally higher based on the median forecast of a slightly smaller sample.
In the United States, the benchmark S&P 500 index was forecast to gain about 11.5% by end-2022, barely clawing back its year-to-date losses of about 9%. Canada's will gain 5.6%, the poll found.

Japan's Nikkei index was expected to rise 11.9% from Monday's close to reach 30,100 by year-end. That was lower than a forecast of 31,000 in the previous poll.
""The stock market environment is likely to remain exceptionally dependent on geopolitical and inflation developments, which could trigger significant market volatility over the next few weeks and months,"" said analysts at UniCredit.

Investing.com -- American pizza restaurant chain Papa John's International Inc's (NASDAQ:PZZA) has come under the spotlight of analysts, with Stifel, Northcoast and Oppenheimer talking positively of the firm in the last few weeks. 
The latest note, released today from Oppenheimer, saw analyst Brian Bittner reiterate an outperform rating and $155 price target on the shares.
Bittner said in a note that Papa John's represents a high-conviction top pick for 2022. ""We'd take advantage of the 14% year-to-date pullback (vs. S&P 500's -8.8%) into 4Q21 results (2/24),"" said Bittner.
He added that there is a ""clear path for accelerating unit growth and a 20% valuation discount to DPZ [Domino's Pizza] creates an attractive investment opportunity, in our view.""
The analyst also expects the company's 2022 guidance to be favorable compared to Street estimates.
Papa John's shares are down over 2% Tuesday despite the comments.
However, Bittner's note follows Northcoast's Jim Sanderson, who upgraded the stock to buy from neutral at the start of February. Sanderson told investors he believes the company continues to exceed expectations, driving sales growth. 
Furthermore, Stifel provided positive commentary on Papa John's at the end of January, saying he believes Q1-to-date same-restaurant sales are positive despite the success of the company's Epic Stuff Crust Pizza launch last year.

[MKTS/GLOB]
Below is reaction from analysts and asset managers to the latest events: 
ANDRE BAKHOS, MANAGING DIRECTOR, NEW VINES CAPITAL LLC, BERNARDSVILLE, NEW JERSEY
“Several dynamics are governing the market and its volatility. We have the interest rate environment and (uncertainty about) what exactly is the Fed going to do, when are they going to do it? And more importantly, how much will they raise rates?”
“That, coupled with a great uncertainty as to the ability of the United States to actually address the Russian-Ukrainian situation, magnifies the volatility factor.”
“The volatility that we're seeing is likely representing the norm for the near future. The violent swings are here to stay at least until these variables play out. These variables are large and very important ... they're creating a potpourri of volatility. They're an important blend that's going to dictate how far and where this market is going. It's going to be a violent, choppy, erratic - just a very volatile trip to wherever we end up.”
“A high level of uncertainty creates fear and fear manifests into defensive behaviour. The defensive behaviour translates into some asset and sector rotation from a risky profile to a less risky profiles. So, I believe that the downside is to be favored right now.”
CHARLES HENRY MONCHAU, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT BANK SYZ, GENEVA (via email)
“Our core scenario on this crisis is for tensions to stay elevated but a full-scale conflict being avoided. We continue to view this as the most likely scenario.”
“We do not see any reason to panic at this stage. While most western media comments sound alarming, we might actually get close to “peak fear” on this crisis and there is a high probability that tensions will start to abate from here on. Nevertheless, the worst case scenario (full scale conflict) can still happen. As such, we are keeping some protection in place (e.g Gold) and will refrain to add Russian assets at this stage (although they are starting to look very attractive from a valuation point of view).”
“These developments do not change our current portfolio positioning. It has been our view that equity and credit markets are more at risk from the war on inflation than on a potential invasion of Ukraine. Until we get more clarity on the inflation outlook, volatility is likely to remain elevated and stocks might have to go through more corrective phases.""
""Since the start of 2022, we have had a positive allocation to equity markets but with some portfolio protection in place (lookback put-spread options) and exposure to broad-based commodities and gold. The recent heightened risk level triggered a modest de-risking of the portfolios (reduced equity between 3% and 4% in balanced portfolios). Nevertheless, we have kept a positive exposure to global equities.”
PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“It just prolongs the uncertainties that are in the market. These uncertainties mean negative sentiment and so even positive news is just put on the back burner such as, this morning, we got earnings from  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD).”
“The bottom line is that fear factor remains elevated and until we get some sort of a clearer picture of what Putin may or may not do, the market is just going to stay in a state of confusion and volatile.”
“And with the price of oil surging, that adds to markets uncertainties, because the other question is, how is the Fed going to deal with this? If oil prices continue to rise and go above $100 and stay there for sustained period of time that means you're going to have even higher inflation.” 
“We have to get through this geopolitical problem and get more clarity from the Fed. So until those things happen, in the short term we're just going to be in a state of flux where the market is going to trade with high volatility, and not doing much of anything.”
ELSA LIGNOS, GLOBAL HEAD OF FX STRATEGY, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS
""The short-term market reaction will depend on the extent of sanctions imposed by the West. Western leaders have two options – a 'modest' approach, trying to signal de-escalation (what markets 'want' to see) or a firmer approach, recognising that allowing Putin to dismantle Ukraine piece by piece will still achieve his end goal, over a longer timeframe.
""EU ambassadors are meeting today to discuss their plan for sanctions...The U.S. response is probably more important. This boils down to whether this is termed 'an invasion' or not. Blinken is still scheduled to meet Lavrov in Geneva on Thursday."" 
MARK HAEFELE, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, UBS GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT
""While we believe it is too early to make a final assessment on what Monday's events may mean for the course of events, we remain of the view that the severe risk case we described earlier -- including fighting and a prolonged interruption of Russian energy exports -- still represents a tail risk at this stage.
""Allocations to commodities and energy stocks are an attractive option to help investors hedge portfolio risks. Energy prices would likely rise in the event of an escalation around Ukraine, as well as if cooler heads prevail amid rising demand and somewhat constrained supply.""
DUBRAVKO LAKOS-BUJAS, CHIEF EQUITY MARKETS STRATEGIST, JPMORGAN 
""While the path of Russia-Ukraine crisis remains unclear with potentially elevated market volatility in the short-term, tightening monetary policy, in our view, still remains the key risk for equities as central banks attempt to aggressively re-anchor inflation expectations lower.
""Overly restrictive monetary policy could result in an outright policy error especially if the business cycle continues to deteriorate. At the same time, the Russia/Ukraine crisis could force a reassessment of the Fed tightening path resulting in central banks turning less hawkish, while policymakers may consider additional fiscal stimulus."" 
LEE HARDMANN, CURRENCY ANALUST, MUFG BANK
""The developments have provided a major blow for any remaining hopes for last minute diplomatic solution to avoid conflict in the Ukraine, which will surely be even harder to avoid now after Russia chose to blatantly disregard the Minsk agreement.
""There is now a significantly higher risk that tensions will continue to escalate in the region triggering a sharper sell-off for the rouble and placing more downward pressure on other European currencies, that should boost the relative appeal of the U.S. dollar.""
SEAN DARBY, GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGIST, JEFFERIES 
""Whilst the escalation in tensions is unwelcome, it is unlikely to alter global economic variables that much.

""The initial reaction to President Putin's declaration was an immediate risk-off with oil prices spiking. Our sense is that part of the equity move was a miscalculation over the earlier Russian troop withdrawal. Russia's economy is itself strong with record FX reserves, signs of inflation peaking (Jan. 8.7%), its highest current account ever and debt-to-GDP ~20%. 
""The Ukrainian currency has been under pressure recently, while government bond yields have spiked but not to the extent seen during the annexation of Crimea.""

1164,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 22, 2022 01:09PM ET</span>",‘Every Market Is Oversold’: Wall Street Bulls on Ukraine Crisis,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street strategists, bullish before Russia’s military buildup near Ukraine’s border, are mostly sticking to their view that stock markets can weather Europe’s brewing security crisis. For now at least. 
After a week of volatility, they say loose financial conditions and growing corporate profits will anchor large-cap indexes amid deteriorating relations between Moscow and Western powers. Corporate balance sheets, meanwhile, will prove broadly resilient to higher energy prices and disrupted supplies. 
In this view, the Federal Reserve, not geopolitics, remains the principal threat, while outsize hedging activity gives portfolio managers some firepower to ride through the crisis. 
U.S. officials said additional American sanctions against Russia are coming after President Joe Biden issued an executive order prohibiting U.S. investment, trade, and financing to separatist regions of Ukraine.
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 fell Tuesday, while the Stoxx 600 Index pared losses to trade flat.
 
Easing expectations on the pace of Fed rate hikes may buoy risk sentiment, according to Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler & Co. Traders are now pricing in six 25-basis-point hikes for the full year down from earlier expectations for seven increases in 2022.
Here are five strategists on why stock markets are likely to weather the geopolitical storm.
‘Oversold’
Dennis DeBusschere, founder of 22V Research
Yearend S&P 500 target: 5,040
“Financial conditions have tightened but remain historically easy, earnings growth continues to offset multiple contraction, and just about every major market is oversold.”
“We remain long thematic baskets like pricing power, companies that benefit from higher real rates and improving supply chains. An escalation in Russia/Ukraine could lead to a much quicker tightening of financial conditions and limit the increase in bond yields.”
‘Short-Term Disruptions’
Chris Harvey, head of equity strategy at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC)
Yearend S&P 500 target: 4,715
“We think geopolitical stress surrounding Russia and Ukraine will add volatility and some near term down-side to risk markets including equities. We believe Fed action will be much more influential longer-term. Geopolitical may cause some short term disruptions but changes in monetary policy will be longer lasting and more pervasive.” 
‘Accurate’ Discount
John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer
Yearend S&P target: 5,330 target 
“Consider the market’s dip and recovery in previous escalation of hostilities from as far back as the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Gulf War, the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Notwithstanding initial volatility we recall that the U.S. market has in the distant and recent past considered how a geopolitical situation might affect corporate revenue and earnings and arrived at a discount that in hindsight has proven to be remarkably accurate.”
“Markets are resilient in our view for a number of reasons. Fourth-quarter earnings season has surprised nicely to the upside across key sectors which suggest growth is not the problem but rather that supply chain disruptions remain prevalent.”
Recovery Potential
Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Research
Yearend S&P 500 target: 5,000 
“Historically, crisis events have triggered pullbacks, but the market has typically recovered the losses within a few months. Looking at 54 crisis events since 1907, the Dow Industrials have fallen an average of 7.1% during the crisis period, but gained an average of 9.7% in the six months after the crisis ended.” 
“Russia-Ukraine risks spiking already high energy prices, meaning the earnings slowdown could be steeper than consensus estimates. Big picture, this does not alter our U.S. stock market outlook for a weak first-half with the potential for a second-half recovery.”
Low Earnings Risk
Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)
“Russia-Ukraine tension is a low earnings risk for U.S. corporates. While the path remains unclear with potentially elevated market volatility in the short-term, tightening monetary policy, in our view, still remains the key risk for equities. We’d caution against making hasty changes to global asset allocations right now.”

Investing.com -- Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) (NASDAQ: LCID) plans to recall about 200 high-end EV sedans due to a safety defect that potentially increased the chance of collisions. 
Lucid shares fell 4.4% on Tuesday. The EV maker is a potential competitor to Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).
Bloomberg reported that the maker of luxury electric vehicles may have installed a piece on the Lucid Air's front strut dampers incorrectly, which was the result of an error from a supplier. 
An email sent out to customers, which was seen by Bloomberg said the ""condition may result in a sudden loss of ground clearance, vehicle vibration and front brake line damage, increasing the risk of a crash.""
Owners of the cars will have the automaker inspect and repair the problem at no extra cost. 
Lucid said it initiated the recall. However, it is not aware of any instances of failure in its vehicles so far and expects only 1% of the 203 Air sedans to have the part installed incorrectly.

(Reuters) -European shares ended flat on Tuesday as gains in auto and travel shares were offset by geopolitical risks, with some Western countries imposing sanctions on Russia after it ordered troops into two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was flat, with automakers, travel stocks and technology shares the top gaining sub-indexes, while retailers and financial stocks were among the biggest losers.
Germany put a new Russian gas pipeline on ice and Britain hit Russian banks with sanctions as the West responded to Moscow's recognition of two separatist regions in Ukraine and a speech by President Vladimir Putin suggesting more belligerent aims. 
Germany's DAX fell the most among major European indexes, as it is seen as more vulnerable due to the country's heavy reliance on Russian gas supplies.
Oil stocks slipped 0.1%, despite a jump in crude prices to their highest since 2014, as investors feared stronger commodity prices would stoke more inflation.
""The implication for Europe would be mainly via gas and oil prices, but it is within Russia's interest to make sure that the disruption isn't too great. That's behind the muted market reaction for now,"" said Seema Shah, global chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.
Meanwhile, analysts at TS Lombard were of the view that Western sanctions on Russia appeared limited and Russia would not expand beyond the now recognised Donbas districts.
""The initial package of U.S. sanctions appears limited (forbidding investment into Ukraine’s separatist regions), while EU leaders are split on the severity of the sanctions to enforce,"" said Davide Oneglia, senior economist at TS Lombard. 
A common gauge of volatility across euro zone equities eased after touching 39 points, its highest since June 2020, in the previous session.
Euro zone banks fell 0.7% as investors scaled back their expectations for an European Central Bank rate rise in 2022, pricing in an around 95% chance of a 10 basis point (bp) hike in July and of 40 bps in hikes by the year-end. [GVD/EUR]
Shah said she has been sceptical about an ECB rate hike this year, given concerns about the strength of the European economy and added complications from the Russia-Ukraine situation.

European banks on Tuesday were bracing for fallout and fresh sanctions, with HSBC warning of market contagion and Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International preparing ""crisis plans.""

1170,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2022 12:16PM ET</span>","Facebook launches Reels globally, betting on 'fastest growing' format","By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is launching its short video feature Reels to more than 150 countries, its owner Meta Platforms said on Tuesday, in a move to expand its fastest growing content format. 
The social media giant, which recently lost a third of its market value after a dismal earnings report, has highlighted Reels as a key priority.
Meta launched Reels on Instagram in 2020 and on Facebook in 2021 as its answer to the explosively popular short-video app TikTok, which is owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance.
""Reels is already our fastest growing content format by far, and today we're making it available to everyone on Facebook globally,"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post on Tuesday. 
The company, which says video now accounts for half of the time people spend on Facebook, also announced new ways for creators to make money through the Reels feature. 
It said it was expanding its program to pay creators bonuses to more countries and was testing overlay ads using banners and stickers for creators to earn ad revenue. It would roll out full-screen ads between Reels soon.
Meta said during its latest earnings that it had faced hits from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s privacy changes to its operating system, which have made it harder for brands to target and measure their ads on Facebook and Instagram. It also cited macroeconomic issues like supply-chain disruptions.

The 18-year-old tech behemoth last month also warned it expects slowing revenue growth in the coming quarter due to increased competition for users' time and a shift of engagement toward features like Reels, which generate less revenue.
In its Tuesday announcement, Meta also said it would roll out updates for users to make and see Facebook Reels in new places, such as in its Stories feature, its Watch tab and at the top of the news feed. In some countries, users will also see suggested Reels in their feed.

Investing.com – Tempur Sealy stock (NYSE:TPX) plunged 17% Tuesday after the mattress-maker’s fourth-quarter revenue and profit fell short of estimates.
Net sales in the fourth quarter rose 29%, to $1.36 billion, making it the tenth of its last 11 quarters of double-digit sales growth.
Margins fell due to Covid-related costs and the acquisition of Dreams, a specialty bed retailer in the U.K. Tempur said Dreams' margin profile is lower than its historical international margins as it sells a variety of products across a range of price points. The purchase also boosted international sales which rose 82% to $298 million.
North America sales rose 19% to top $1 billion. Broad-based demand across its retail partners led to an increase in wholesale channel sales. Direct channel sales also rose because of growth in the company’s owned stores.
For the current year, Tempur expects profit per share between $3.65 and $3.85 on sales growth of 15% to 20%. Net sales in 2021 were $4.93 billion.
Profit per share in the fourth quarter was up over 31%, at 88 cents, but fell short of estimates.

(Reuters) -Home Depot Inc on Tuesday indicated that it expects gross profit margins to remain under pressure through the year as it spends aggressively to deal with supply-chain bottlenecks and get building tools and materials to store shelves faster. 
Shares of the largest U.S. home improvement chain tumbled as much as 8.3% to an over six-month low of $318.18. Rival Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) Cos, set to report on Wednesday, fell 3.2%
 Home Depot  (NYSE:HD)'s shares have climbed about 50% since the end of February 2020, riding a more than $40 billion jump in sales during the period as stuck-at-home Americans used their time and savings on do-it-yourself home projects.
The company expects operating margins to be flat in 2022, assuming inflation will not get any worse.
Home Depot has rolled out measures such as chartering its own cargo ship and using air freight to move in-demand goods to beat supply chain disruptions and shipping delays.
While bolstering sales, those expenses along with surging costs of everything from fuel to wages led to a 35-basis point decline in fourth-quarter gross margins to 33.2%.
""The margins are being pressured by a number of things including supply chain cost increases, labor cost increases and other cost inflation that they're able to pass through (to customers), but not fully offset,"" said Michael Baker, analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co.
Overall sales rose a higher-than-expected 10.7% in the fourth quarter to $35.72 billion, while earnings per share of $3.21 topped estimates of $3.18.

The company, which last month named chief operating officer Edward Decker as its next top boss, projected full-year sales growth to be ""slightly positive"". 
Analysts have warned of home improvement sales cooling in 2022 as rising mortgage rates threaten to hit housing demand and prices, potentially making customers less likely to invest in their homes.

1173,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2022 11:46AM ET</span>",Telecom Italia to decide on KKR approach by mid-March,"By Elvira Pollina and Valentina Za
MILAN (Reuters) -  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) is expected to make a decision on a 10.8 billion euro ($12.2 billion) takeover proposal from U.S. private equity firm KKR by the middle of next month.
The U.S. private equity fund made a non-binding approach to take the former phone monopoly private last November. It sought the backing of the company and the government, as well as a four-week due diligence process before it formalised a bid.
But KKR has been forced to play a waiting game as Telecom Italia overhauled its management, ousting its fourth chief executive in six years after a string of profit warnings.
New boss Pietro Labriola is working on a standalone plan to be presented to investors next week as an alternative to a KKR deal, with the backing of Telecom Italia top investors Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) and state lender CDP.
A special committee within TIM is expected to give its verdict on the KKR approach by mid-March, a source close to the matter told Reuters on Tuesday, once investors and markets have had a chance to digest Labriola's plan.
BREAKING UP
KKR already has a role within TIM, having spent 1.8 billion euros last year for a 37.5% stake in the group's secondary network, known as FiberCop.
Under Labriola's draft plans, TIM's domestic business would be split between an infrastructure entity and a services arm to unlock value.
Such a move could facilitate a long-mooted merger of TIM's fixed-access network with state-backed rival Open Fiber, a deal advocated by CDP and one that could improve broadband services for Italian households and businesses. The state lender owns a 60% stake in Open Fiber and 10% of TIM.
KKR for its part wants Telecom Italia to come up with a clear response to its approach before the Italian group embarks on its own restructuring.
""The company must take responsibility for saying 'No' to 0.505 euros a share. KKR expects an answer to its proposal,"" said another source close to the matter. 
TIM shares traded below 0.40 euros on Tuesday, but leading shareholder Vivendi says the bid is too low because it would crystallise a loss on its investment.

Italian unions are also concerned about the impact of a break-up on thousands of workers and plan a strike on Wednesday.

(Reuters) -Macy's Inc on Tuesday decided against a push by an activist investor to spin off its online business and forecast better-than-expected annual sales after a bumper holiday quarter that was driven by strong demand for apparel and jewelry.
Shares rose as much as 10% after the department store chain announced a $2 billion share buyback plan and raised its quarterly dividend by 5%.
Its e-commerce business grew 12% in the holiday quarter and is expected to account for 37% of overall sales in 2022, with modernization efforts resulting in an 81% surge in app downloads compared to the prior quarter.
Still Macy's (NYSE:M) does not want to spin off the unit even though it was pushed to review the business following a demand from activist investor Jana Partners in October last year. 
Jana had argued the online business could be worth a multiple of Macy's market capitalization, which is now nearly $8 billion.
""In every scenario we considered, we found the combination of our profitable digital platform with our national footprint will deliver greater value to shareholders than a separation ... ,"" Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said.
Jefferies analysts said the decision was not a ""big surprise"" as the push for a split had eased as the risk ratio was high. Jana earlier this month said it cut its holdings by 84% in the last months of 2021, before which it held a 1.5% stake in Macy's.
In the holiday quarter, Macy's also benefited from its plan to hold ample stock of key categories such as jewelry, apparel, fragrances and toys amid supply chain constraints.
Quarterly sales rose to a better-than-expected $8.67 billion and Macy's earned $2.45 per share, beating analysts' estimates.

It expects annual sales between $24.46 billion and $24.70 billion, above analysts expectations, betting on sustained demand as wages rise and social events become more frequent. 
Executives, however, warned that record levels of inflation could offset some of the gains.

Booming demand for European fashion and accessories has fueled a steep rise in sales at the luxury group as well as its rivals, including  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and Richemont.
French President Emmanuel Macron has said that the fashion and luxury industry grew to become the country's biggest exporter last year. 
Arnault spoke during an inaugural visit to two new leather goods workshops in Vendome and Aze, France, alongside French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and Louis Vuitton Chief Executive Officer Michael Burke.
Burke said Louis Vuitton has been selling ""more trunks than any year in the 19th century,"" citing ""extraordinary growth"" in the sales of the label's historic product to Americans, Chinese and Koreans. 
""We needed a dedicated workshop for exotic (products),"" said Burke, referring to the new site in Vendome, which is housed in a former abbey.

""We believe that done in a sustainable fashion, this is an extremely important trade to maintain,"" said Burke.
Louis Vuitton also has two production sites in California and one in Texas, as well as sites in Italy and Spain.

LISBON (Reuters) -Heavy tug boats on Tuesday sprayed water on a ship off the coast of Portugal's Azore Islands which went on fire nearly a week ago carrying thousands of Porsches and Bentleys, an incident insurance experts said could result in $155 million in losses.
The losses would likely fall on continental European insurance markets, specialist publication Insurance Insider reported, citing anonymous sources, with Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s in-house insurance covering some of the cost.
Data and analytics company Russell Group estimated the loss at around $155 million, which Insurance Insider said chimed with estimates by sources within the London market of around $140 million.
Lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles on board made the fire very difficult to extinguish, the captain of the nearest port said, raising questions about the safety of transporting them when carmakers worldwide are stepping up production.
The 22 crew members on board the ship, called the Felicity Ace, were evacuated the same day the fire broke out.
Ship manager Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd (MOL) said in a statement the vessel was still on fire but stable, and that no oil leak had been reported so far.
Two large tug boats equipped with firefighting gear arrived from Gibraltar on Monday, and were working with another patrol boat to spray water at the Felicity Ace and cool it down, MOL said.
""When conditions are safe the salvage team will board the Felicity Ace for an initial assessment,"" MOL added.
MOL did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the cause of the fire.

Two other tug boats with more firefighting equipment were scheduled to arrive Feb. 23 and Feb. 26.
João Mendes Cabeças, the captain of the nearest port on the Azorean island of Faial, said on Sunday the fire had lost its intensity, probably because there was little left to burn.

(Reuters) - A Wall Street analyst upgraded Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) to a buy rating after 10 years on Tuesday, highlighting its growing market share, a strong portfolio of computer chips to rival that of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and a relatively cheap stock price.
""This is not the AMD of a decade ago,"" Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon said, lifting the brokerage's rating on the company to ""outperform"" — its highest stock rating — from ""market-perform"".
AMD's market share for laptop central processing unit (CPU) chips had climbed to nearly 20% in the third quarter of 2021 from a low of under 5% six years ago, Bernstein said, citing data from Mercury Research and its own analysis.
""The quality of AMD's portfolio continues to improve ... AMD's desktop CPU are now, on average, on par with Intel's,"" Rasgon said.
AMD shares have ballooned from roughly $2 when Bernstein last had an ""outperform"" rating on them in 2012 to about $114 today, an ascent Rasgon called ""the absolute biggest missed call in our entire Wall Street tenure.""
Shares in AMD were slightly lower in premarket trading on Tuesday, but the chipmaker's market value surpassed that of Intel last week.
Still, AMD's stock price is currently below 30 times its projected earnings for the next 12 months, with shares nearing their cheapest in five years and ""entering into the realm of downright attractive,"" Rasgon said.

Recent commentary from Intel suggests the next several years may be ""open season"" in the key data-center market, another positive for AMD, he added.
AMD could also derive more revenue from its recently closed $50 billion acquisition of Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) than first thought, Rasgon said. ""Our math suggests the company might see an annual revenue run rate that could be hundreds of millions of dollars higher than current expectations,"" he wrote.

1181,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2022 10:56AM ET</span>",Dakota Access pipeline suffers U.S. Supreme Court setback,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a bid led by Dakota Access oil pipeline operator  Energy Transfer  (NYSE:ET) LP to avoid additional environmental review of a section that runs under an artificial lake and is opposed by nearby Native American tribes, leaving the pipeline vulnerable to being shut down.
The justices left in place a lower court's decision that ordered the federal government to undertake a more intensive environmental study of the pipeline's route underneath Lake Oahe, which straddles the border of North Dakota and South Dakota. The pipeline, known as DAPL and open since 2017, will continue to operate as the review is carried out.
""We call on the administration to close the pipeline until a full safety and environmental review is complete.  DAPL never should have been authorized in the first place, and this administration is failing to address the persistent illegality of this pipeline,"" said Jan Hasselman, a lawyer for the environmental group Earthjustice who represents the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.
The Dakota Access pipeline has been the subject of a lengthy court battle between tribes seeking its closure and Dallas-based Energy Transfer.
Whether the project should be shut down was not at issue in Energy Transfer's Supreme Court appeal. But Energy Transfer said in court papers that the pipeline remains ""vulnerable to a shutdown"" with the new environmental review pending. The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, along with the Yankton Sioux Tribe, the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, have opposed the biggest pipeline out of the Bakken shale basin. The pipeline runs about 1,170 miles (1,885 km) from North Dakota to Illinois. The disputed section on federal property under Lake Oahe, an artificial reservoir on the Missouri River, is 1.7 miles (2.7 km) long.
The tribes draw water from the lake for various purposes, including drinking, and also consider the waters of the Missouri River to be sacred. Their lawyers have said the tribes are worried about a potential oil spill.
The tribes lobbied hard to prevent the easement under the lake from being approved and initially appeared to have succeeded when in 2016 the administration of Democratic former President Barack Obama said it would review its original action to allow construction. But after Republican Donald Trump became president in 2017, the government endorsed the original decision to grant an easement.
Democratic President Joe Biden's administration urged the Supreme Court not to hear the appeal, saying the pipeline operator concerns about a shutdown were overstated.
Washington-based U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg in 2020 found that the government had violated a law called the National Environmental Policy Act and threw out the approval.

Boasberg ordered a more detailed ""environmental impact statement,"" which was the decision the pipeline operator was challenging. Boasberg subsequently ruled that the pipeline be shut down but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit blocked that decision while allowing the additional environmental review. 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the federal agency overseeing the permit approval process, has said it expects to complete the review later this year.

Investing.com -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) shares are trading 4% above Friday's close after Bernstein upgraded the stock from Market Perform to Outperform.
Analyst Stacy Rasgon has a $150 price target on AMD shares. The upgrade marks the first time in nearly 10 years that the analyst has had a bullish rating on the stock.
Rasgon acknowledged in a note to clients that the stock surged while he waited on the sidelines, labeling his previous stance as “the biggest missed call of our Wall Street tenure.”
“But time heals all wounds, and (as has frankly been abundantly clear for years) this is not the AMD of a decade ago,"" he added.
The analyst pointed to a combination of ""continued stellar execution, increasingly bankable earnings power, and a recent sizeable pullback,"" making the company's valuation attractive. 
AMD shares are down nearly 30% from its late November high, ""approaching the cheapest in 5 years.""
Rasgon explained that ""from a fundamental basis, traction continues to accelerate with share climbing and mix improving, and Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) recent comments suggest open season in datacenter for the next several years."""
1183,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2022 10:48AM ET</span>",Companies exposed to Russia brace for new sanctions,"(Reuters) - Foreign companies with exposure to Russia were poring over contingency plans on Tuesday, with some looking at whether to shift production or find new supply chains to shield their businesses from new Western sanctions.
 Renault  (PA:RENA)'s carmaker Avtovaz, Finland's Nokian Tyres, soft-drink bottler Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) HBC and German retailer Metro all said they were watching the Ukraine situation closely given this week's escalation. 
Britain sanctioned five Russian banks and three billionaires on Tuesday and Germany halted certification of a gas pipeline in a first wave of restrictions. The EU and the United States are expected to announce measures with energy and technology potentially in the crosshairs, along with financial services and more individuals.
The White House has told the U.S. chip industry, for example, to be ready for new restrictions on exports to Russia, including potentially blocking Russia's access to global electronics supplies.
Avtovaz, the carmaker behind the Lada brand in which Renault has a 69% stake, said on Tuesday it was looking to secure different supplies of semiconductors in case Washington clamps down on electronics.
""Of course we are also investigating possibilities to find alternatives in the case of sanctions,"" Nicolas Maure, Avtovaz chief executive, told reporters in the Russian city of Izhevsk.
Russia relies on foreign supplies of chips and a senior Russian auto industry source said there was concern about how delivery times and new pre-orders might be affected. 
Nokian Tyres, which has a factory and warehouse in Russia, said it had intensified its risk management planning and was prepared to shift the manufacture of certain products between plants if necessary.
STOCKPILING MATERIALS
Coca-Cola HBC, which bottles soft drinks in 29 European and African countries and counts Russia and Nigeria as its two biggest markets, said it had learned lessons from the Russian-Ukrainian conflict of 2014.
Chief Executive Zoran Bogdanovic said it was considering stockpiling ingredients to limit any disruption in Russia and had plans for alternative sourcing of raw materials as well.
""We have looked at all types of scenarios and have ensured that we have contingency plans in place in case there is disruption,"" said Chief Financial Officer Ben Almanzar.
Swiss consumer goods giant Nestle declined to comment on sanctions and said the safety of its staff was its highest priority. As of 2020, Nestle had six factories in Russia, including plants making confectionary and drinks. Its 2020 sales there were worth about $1.7 billion.
Danone, the world's biggest yoghurt maker which controls Russian dairy brand Prostokvashino, said it too was focused on ensuring the security of its employees.
German retailer Metro, which has operations in both Russia and Ukraine, said it was following the current developments with concern.
""Our responsibility as a company in Russia lies primarily with our approximately 10,000 employees and 2.5 million customers,"" Metro spokesman Gerd Koslowski said, adding that the same concerns applied for Metro in Ukraine.
Some companies, however, such as Germany's HeidelbergCement (DE:HEIG) said they did not expect any major impact on their Russian operations, even if the conflict escalated.
""All of our three Russian cement plants supply their respective local/regional markets and do not export outside Russia,"" a company spokesperson said.
ENERGY EXPOSURE
Washington and Brussels imposed sanctions on Russia's energy and defence sectors in the wake of Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014. There is now speculation that those measures could be widened and deepened, with one possible option being to prevent companies settling in U.S. dollars. 
Britain's BP (NYSE:BP), the largest foreign investor in Russia with a 19.75% stake in state-run oil giant Rosneft, declined to comment when asked about potential new sanctions.
Anglo-Dutch oil company Shell (LON:RDSa) owns 27.5% of the Sakhalin-2 liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, which has an annual capacity of 10.9 million tonnes and is operated by Gazprom (MCX:GAZP).
On Monday, Shell's head of integrated gas Wael Sawan told reporters that it would abide by any sanctions on Russia.
Norway's Equinor, which has minority stakes in three Russian oilfields, said it had solid processes in place to ensure it complied with relevant sanctions.
German utility Uniper, which counts Russia as one of its most important markets, declined to comment.
Uniper has five power plants in Russia with a combined capacity of 11.2 gigawatts, providing about 5% of Russia's total energy needs and also imports Russian natural gas to Europe, according to its website.

""On a general note, so far energy production in Russia has been excluded from EU sanctions,"" said Finland's Fortum, which owns 76% of Uniper.
""We are of course following the situation very closely and will assess the possible impacts of sanctions and possible counter sanctions once they have been announced,"" it said.

Earlier this month, Arviv said he planned to nominate five independent directors to Hexo's board at its shareholder meeting, citing concerns over its sliding share price.
Shares in Hexo were about 6.49% lower in morning trading, taking their year-to-date losses to nearly 18%. 
The new board comprising seven directors will stand for election at Hexo's shareholder meeting on March 8. 
Arviv's fund, which currently owns about a 2% stake in the company, will nominate Mark Attanasio and Rob Godfrey and also retain the right to nominate the eighth member.

Last year, a media report said Hexo's co-founder Sebastien St-Louis was ousted from his role as the chief executive officer after Arviv alleged that St-Louis had over-leveraged the company to help finance deals to acquire some cannabis operators.
Hexo this month said it would cut 180 jobs, resulting in annual savings of about $15 million, as it seeks to reduce expenses by 30% by the end of 2023.

HAMBURG/BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and its top shareholder have drawn up a preliminary agreement to list Porsche, paving the way for a deal that investors hope will unlock value from the luxury car brand and could be one of the world's largest stock market debuts.
Analysts estimate Porsche AG could be valued at up to 90 billion euros ($102 billion) in an initial public offering (IPO), compared with Volkswagen's current market value of around 116 billion euros.
A listing could also shift the balance of power at Europe's top carmaker, which was carefully crafted in the wake of a failed takeover of Volkswagen by Porsche in 2009, resulting in Volkswagen acquiring the luxury brand.
At the time, the Porsche and Piech families became Volkswagen's most influential investors via their holding company Porsche SE, which holds 31.4% in Volkswagen and 53% of the carmaker's voting rights.
Volkswagen could issue an equal number of Porsche AG ordinary and preference shares in the potential IPO and may pay a special dividend to its owners to drum up support, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Ordinary shares confer voting rights and Porsche SE said it could buy such shares in any Porsche AG listing.
The sources said Volkswagen may seek to list 25% of Porsche AG if the IPO goes ahead.
Shares in Volkswagen and Porsche SE jumped as much as 10.2 and 15.2%, respectively, with investors hoping a listing could boost the Porsche brand's value and give Volkswagen extra financial clout for the shift to electric vehicles.
Sources previously said the Porsche and Piech families may decide to reduce their stake in Volkswagen to buy into an IPO of Porsche AG.
Such a move would loosen the families' grip on the German group in favour of direct ownership of the sports car brand founded by their ancestor Ferdinand Porsche in 1931.
Volkswagen and Porsche SE declined to comment on details of a potential listing, but the carmaker said a final decision had not been taken and any deal must be approved by management and supervisory boards.
One of the sources said Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess presented a basic outline of the IPO plans to representatives of the supervisory board earlier this week following discussions on the matter over last weekend.

A supervisory board meeting originally scheduled for Tuesday to discuss the plans was cancelled as too many questions remain unresolved, the person said.

1186,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2022 10:42AM ET</span>","Exclusive-Facial recognition company Clearview AI seeks first big deals, discloses research chief","By Paresh Dave and Jeffrey Dastin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Clearview AI, whose search engine for faces has become an unrivaled police tool, this year is aiming to win its first big U.S. government contracts and expand its team by a third even as the startup fights challenges in the courts and Congress, its chief executive told Reuters.
In an exclusive interview, CEO Hoan Ton-That said that he will focus on closing deals with federal agencies. Many of the 3,100 customers the five-year-old New York company touts are on a trial basis, he said.
""We know that some of these agencies are seeing great success, but they are only at a small five-figure purchase or a six-figure purchase,"" Ton-That said, referring to annual deal value. ""And so it's, 'Can we get a few of those to the seven-figure, maybe eight-figure purchases?'""
Ton-That also for the first time revealed a member of Clearview's technology team. While rivals have promoted their benches of scientists or published papers about breakthroughs, Clearview had stayed quiet - calling itself ""Made in the USA"" but not offering details.
Ton-That said Terence Liu is the Pennsylvania-based computational physicist behind some of Clearview's algorithms and its vice president of research. They are listed together on a patent application filed Tuesday.
Overall, the nearly 50-person, mostly remote company aims to hire 18 more this year, including adding five engineers to a team of 12, Ton-That said.
Among its plans this year, Clearview will add enhancement tools to clean up search photos and potentially AI to generate younger and older depictions so that someday seniors could be matched to childhood photos. 
Clearview has become one of the highest-profile developers of facial recognition over the last two years because it sends authorities matches from an ever-growing database of over 10 billion photos that it finds posted publicly on the internet. Results link to websites such as Flickr, Instagram and Getty Images, where captions or other details reveal more about subjects.
Matches from facial recognition tools used by law enforcement across China, India and many other countries typically come from more limited arrest or government ID databases. Police say Clearview's web search tool helps them find people outside those datasets.
Though Clearview compares itself to Google Images search, detractors say it violates privacy norms and foreshadows more egregious surveillance. Some lawmakers want it banned. 
Data protection authorities in at least four countries including Canada and France have said the photo collection broke privacy laws, and Clearview is battling lawsuits in the United States that could force it to change tactics.
Giant companies such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and Meta Platform's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) with the data to develop competing tools have retreated from facial recognition, citing societal concerns and the need for clarity from regulators. No known startup has ventured into the same gray area as Clearview, which raised around $37 million from investors and wants more now.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Fish and Wildlife Service are among a dozen U.S. agencies that have used Clearview, a government audit found last August. Clearview also has won about $50,000 to research augmented reality glasses with facial recognition to secure Air Force base checkpoints.
Critics are alarmed as Clearview weighs entering new industries.
“Clearview AI has a pattern of deception: the company has been publicly defending its mass surveillance by claiming it will only sell to law enforcement while privately pitching an expansion into finance, retail and entertainment,"" said Jack Poulson, executive director of tech accountability group Tech Inquiry.
REDUCING COSTS
Ton-That began developing facial recognition around 2015 after reading papers such as ""DeepFace"" and ""FaceNet"" published by scientists at Google, Facebook and top universities showing dramatic strides in the technology. He replicated the results, gathered online photos and improved accuracy to 99% from 70%.
Tuesday's patent filing covers Clearview's process for fast and lower-cost training of facial recognition. Clearview learns from 70 million online photos of all types of people, compared with smaller databases of celebrity pictures that power rival systems, Ton-That said. 
Clearview uses AI to apply masks, glasses and other distortions to training images, enabling it to recognize faces when obscured, in profile, deep in the background or 20 years younger. In turn, Clearview had greater accuracy than rival tools, according to a U.S. government evaluation last year. 
The research head Liu formally joined last year after working as a senior software engineer at Bloomberg LP since 2017, he said. He earlier had partnered with Ton-That to advance Clearview's prototype.
""It was just something hard to pass on again,"" Liu said.
Other technical staff include a former Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) employee who runs cybersecurity and an entrepreneur who sold his search engine to Clearview in 2019 and oversees data collection. Ton-That declined to name them. 

The team's efforts to rework Ton-That's original code, including by creating two custom database technologies, have lowered processing costs per face in Clearview's system by 95% since 2018, Ton-That said.
As that closely tracked ""cost per face"" falls, Clearview can gather additional photos and become more likely to return a lead, he said.

Truth Social debuted Sunday and was the top free available app on Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) app store.

A surge in infections from the Omicron variant of COVID during the third quarter had overwhelmed hospitals already grappling with labour shortages, compelling them to put off non-critical surgeries to free up staff and beds.
This dented demand for some  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT) devices including cardiac monitors and pelvic health products, but strength in the company's critical heart implants unit helped cushion the blow during the quarter.
Medtronic, whose shares were up 2.8% at $103.41 in morning trade, said it had started seeing a rebound in elective procedures as the impact from surging infections peaked in January and the first half of February.
""Trends are now favorable ... And we think procedure volumes will improve throughout March and April and back to pre-COVID levels by the end of our fiscal Q4,"" Medtronic Chief Executive Officer Geoff Martha said on a call with analysts.
The company forecast fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share between $1.56 and $1.58, compared with analysts' average estimate of $1.57 per share. 
Medtronic's forecast follows similar commentary from smaller rivals Zimmer Biomet and Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE:EW), which have also said they expect the pressure on elective procedures to ease once COVID-19 infections peak and then stabilize through the year.

The company said while staffing challenges are likely to persist into 2023, it expects hospitals to mitigate the impact by employing temporary staff and making use of technologies such as remote monitoring.
Medtronic reported a quarterly adjusted profit of $1.37 per share, edging past analysts' average estimate of $1.36 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

The foundation will partner with non-profits seeking to promote educational access, skills development, network building and access to capital for aspiring professionals and entrepreneurs, the New York-based firm said.
Apollo's employees will identify potential recipients and pitch grants to a council at the foundation also made up of the firm's employees. The process resembles how Apollo picks its deals and will ensure grassroots participation, the foundation's executive director Lauren Coape-Arnold said in an interview.
""We are tapping into the same kind of processes that Apollo uses to make investments so that employees can be involved in every step of the grantmaking and the foundation can expand opportunity for the causes they are passionate about,"" Coape-Arnold said. 
The private equity industry, traditionally white and male-dominated, is stepping up efforts to boost representation of executives and employees from underrepresented backgrounds among its ranks and the companies it invests in, as well philanthropic spending focused on communities.
Apollo peer Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc said last week that it had tapped Maura Pally, former executive vice president at the Clinton Foundation, to lead its 15-year-old charitable foundation that promotes economic opportunity and access to education.
Apollo said last year that by the first half of 2021 all its U.S. companies had met a target it announced in 2020 for 30% of their board members to come from diverse backgrounds. At least three directors on Apollo's 16-member board identify themselves as underrepresented minorities.

Earlier this month, Apollo set a goal for its portfolio companies in its private equity business to collectively spend more than $1 billion on suppliers run by individuals from diverse backgrounds by 2024. In 2021, Apollo launched a 10-year $90 million initiative to expand opportunity for students attending historically Black colleges and universities.
Founded in 1990, Apollo had about $498 billion in assets under management as of the end of December. Last month it completed the acquisition of Athene, a retirement services business whose assets it manages.

The agreement shows support for Humana's strategy of increasing market share in Medicare Advantage business, improving margins, accelerating growth in healthcare services and reducing operating expenses, said Stephens analyst Scott Fidel in a note.

Investing.com – DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) stock traded 0.2% higher in volatile trade Tuesday after a  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst more than halved his target to $19.
The stock erased early losses and was up nearly 3% at one time before retracing. It touched a high of $17.87 after touching a low of $16.57 in the session underway today.
Analyst Daniel Politzer sees the stock at $19, down from his previous target of $41.
The stock had closed at $17.29 Friday, losing more than a fifth of its value after the sports betting firm added fewer customers in the fourth quarter than analysts estimated.
“Our downgrade is company specific and reflects our growing concern on DraftKings’ path to profitability given its fast-growing operating expenses (as opposed to external marketing/promotional spend, which have been a concern among investors). DraftKings’ implied 2022 operating expenditure will increase 60%+ year-on-year versus its expected around 49% revenue growth,” Politzer said in a note, according to StreetInsider.
The analyst expects DraftKings to see acceleration in contribution profit, although he believes it is difficult to model a scenario where the sports betting firm achieves positive full-year EBITDA before 2025.
The company nearly doubled its expenses on sales and marketing in the year to $982 million but managed an increase of just about 32% to 2 million monthly unique paying customers on average on the platform.
The numbers from the company were a surprise, given more states legalized sports betting this year and the firm spent a good part of its time tying up with various associations and sports bodies, including the National Football League, to entrench its sports betting services."

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus said on Wednesday it would build a demonstrator to test propulsion technology for future hydrogen airplanes in co-operation with French-U.S. engine maker CFM International.
The planemaker plans to fit a specially adapted version of a current-generation engine near the back of an A380 superjumbo test plane. Airbus delivered its last A380 in December.
CFM, jointly owned by  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and  Safran  (PA:SAF), is the world's largest jet engine maker by number of units sold.
The new partnership on hydrogen technology was reported by Reuters earlier on Wednesday.
Airbus has said it will produce a small ""ZEROe"" passenger aircraft powered by hydrogen to enter service in 2035.
It told the European Union a year ago that most airliners will rely on traditional jet engines until at least 2050, according to a briefing made public last June.
Even so, Airbus officials say the research will seed disruptive technology likely to play a role in the next generation of larger airplanes, as well as offering radically new technology for small planes holding some 50-100 people.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) has so far been cooler towards hydrogen and placed greater emphasis on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).
In a sign of growing alignment with Airbus on alternative technologies, CFM said last year a separate next-generation jet engine called RISE, which it hopes to offer for larger jets from 2035, would be capable of running on fuels including hydrogen.
The new engine demonstrator will burn hydrogen fuel in the combustion chamber in place of jet fuel. The companies declined to disclose the cost of the research project.
To build the demonstration engine, CFM will need to adapt an existing engine to handle the higher temperatures and speed at which hydrogen burns, compared to carbon-based jet fuel.
An alternative considered by some companies such as Universal Hydrogen is to use hydrogen to power fuel cells which would in turn drive electric engines propelling the plane.
Chief Technical Officer Sabine Klauke said Airbus was looking at fuel-cell technology as well as hydrogen combustion.
Airbus has said it will choose the final type of product for the ""ZEROe"" decarbonised plane project in 2025. 
Chief Executive Guillaume Faury was quoted earlier this month by Welt am Sonntag as saying Airbus could go it alone and make engines for its future hydrogen-fuelled planes.

But Faury played down the prospect of Airbus moving into engine-making at a results presentation last week, telling reporters it ""would require a change of strategy, and I have not indicated that we have changed our strategy on that one"".
He said working with partners on the next generation of technology is theoretically possible ""and it's not something we would rule out completely, but more looking at it case by case"".

Investing.com -- Stocks were mixed in early morning trading in New York Tuesday after a long holiday weekend in the U.S., climbing back from falling at the open despite worries about tensions in Ukraine.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 127 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 reversed earlier losses and was up 0.07% and the NASDAQ Composite also reversed losses to trade up 0.07% as of 9:58 AM ET.
Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the independence of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine on Monday, sending troops to the area. Those actions prompted swift condemnation by Western powers, with sanctions ordered by the U.S. and European nations. Germany stopped the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which had been designed to transport gas from Russia. Reuters reported that the U.S. and European Union were prepared to announce additional sanctions later on Tuesday.
Big tech stocks such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) traded lower, while the price of oil spiked. Crude Oil WTI Futures, the U.S. benchmark, jumped 3% in morning trading, while Brent Oil Futures, the international standard, rose 1.7%. 
The surge in crude prices lifted shares of big energy companies  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), each up 0.3%.
Department store operator Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) jumped 7% after reporting earnings earlier Tuesday, beating expectations for same store sales during the crucial holiday season.

President Vladimir Putin's announcement on Monday drew international condemnation. The United States and its European allies are poised to announce sanctions. Britain also imposed sanctions and German chancellor Olaf Scholz halted the certification of the Russia-led Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
JPM analysts expect further declines in the Russian stock market in the near term. 
Russia's dollar-denominated RTS share index hit its lowest since 2020 in early trading and was down 1.7% at 1316 GMT, while the rouble-based MOEX index was down 1.8%%.
""With uncertainty as high/valuations as low as we can remember and a declining investor appetite to accept Russian risk – either long or short – we move to N (neutral) on Russian within our CEEMEA allocation,"" analyst Elena Jouronova said in a note. 
A fall in dividends poses further downside risk. Russia may not pay out to foreign shareholders when U.S. policy is explicitly designed to isolate Russia from markets, JPM added.
The crisis in Ukraine is changing from a background risk to ""a significant market driver in coming weeks"", JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts wrote in a separate note on Tuesday.
""For the market, the possibility of defusing and de-escalating the crisis without action has been taken off the table.""

As investors become more risk-averse, they will deleverage out of the most crowded positions, JPM said.
Fixed income in emerging markets will be affected by a move higher in energy prices and by some emerging market central banks taking a more dovish stance in response to the uncertainty and hit to growth caused by the tensions, the analysts said.

Investing.com – Macy’s (NYSE:M) stock surged 6% in premarket trading Tuesday after the retailer’s fourth quarter numbers came well ahead compared to 2020 and 2019.
Categories that were solid throughout the pandemic, including home, fragrances, jewelry, watches, and sleepwear, continued to see strong sales performance, Macy’s said, while the fourth quarter had its own share of winners too. This included strong sales of luxury handbags, fine jewelry, men’s shoes, and fragrances.
Adding to the gains in the stock is a new $2 billion share buyback that follows the $500 million repurchases the company completed in the fourth quarter. The company will also pay a 5% higher quarterly dividend of 15.75 cents per share.
Fourth quarter margins expanded due to higher pricing of products as well as tighter control on promotion expenses.
Net sales in the fourth quarter rose 28% to $8.7 billion as more customers shopped and digital sales rose. The retailer attracted around 7.2 million new customers during the quarter with 58% of them coming through the digital channel. Quarterly digital sales rose 12% on year-on-year basis, but it also spent more on delivery as more people ordered online and it had to bear holiday delivery expense surcharges.
Macy's expects net sales to grow up to 1% to $24.46 billion-$24.70 billion in the current financial year. Adjusted profit per share is seen at $4.13-$4.52.
For the ongoing quarter, it expects net sales of $5.27 billion-$5.37 billion with an adjusted EPS of 81 cents at the center of its guidance range.
Adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter more than tripled to $2.45 due to higher impairment and interest costs in the same period a year ago."

Last June, GSK announced plans to divest the business, which includes brands such as Sensodyne toothpaste and Advil painkillers, in its biggest shake-up in two decades to focus on its prescription drugs and vaccines business.
The British group, which had rejected Unilever's 50 billion pound ($68 billion) bid for the consumer healthcare business in December, said it plans to unveil more details at an investor event at the end of the month.
Under GSK's separation plan, shareholders will receive stock in the new consumer health group amounting to at least 80% of the 68% stake that GSK currently owns in it. Pfizer owns the remaining 32%.

Some activist investors had called on GSK to give more consideration to a potential sale of the unit. They have also questioned the ability of top management to boost the success rate of drug development, where GSK has long lagged peers.

MILAN (Reuters) - Oaktree has hired  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to sell a stake in Banca Progetto in a deal that could value the challenger bank at up to $565 million, one of the biggest transactions in Italy's blooming digital bank industry, sources told Reuters.
The U.S. investment firm launched Banca Progetto, which has 4.6 billion euros ($5.2 billion) in assets, in 2015 after buying 54.2% of small local bank Banca Popolare Lecchese from Nuova Banca Etruria, which was being liquidated. 
The deal saw Oaktree entering the Italian banking market just as the government swooped in to rescue four small banks, one of which was Etruria, ushering the industry into a long phase of restructuring that saw a string of bank failures.
Oaktree has since worked to relaunch Progetto by turning its lending business digital and is now looking for bids valuing the bank at ten to more than 12 times its 2021 profit of 41 million euros, the sources said.
Two of the sources said Oaktree was targeting a 400 million euro price tag for the asset, while a third source said the Californian fund was aiming for a valuation above 500 million euros.
A separate source said there had been contacts with Italian bad loan specialist Prelios, whose owner U.S. fund Davidson Kempner Capital Management is also looking for a buyer, but talks had not progressed. 
Morgan Stanley, Banca Progetto and Prelios declined to comment. 
Under the leadership of long-time UniCredit manager and former Carige Chief Executive Paolo Fiorentino, Progetto almost doubled its profit in 2021.
Its lending to businesses rose to 2.2 billion euros, helped by strong demand for loans covered by state guarantees during the pandemic.
Progetto also provides personal loans backed by the paycheck, like rival IBL, which in 2015 withdrew its listing plans at the very last minute.
Challenger banks or neobanks, which compete with established banks often by specialising in niche markets, developed late in Italy compared with more dynamic markets such as Britain.

In 2020, Progetto became the first Italian bank to obtain central bank clearance to externalise its entire IT system, striking a deal with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services for cloud infrastructure.

British sanctions targeted Bank Rossiya, Black Sea Bank, Genbank, IS Bank and Promsvyazbank - smaller lenders of which only the latter is on the Russian central bank's list of systemically important credit institutions.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also sanctioned three high-net worth individuals in response to Russia's decision to deploy troops to two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine after recognising their independence.
In 2014, the U.S. Treasury described Bank Rossiya as ""the personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation"" when sanctioning the lender after Moscow's annexation of Crimea. 
Promsvyazbank was a commercial bank until it was bailed out and nationalised in 2017. It was later turned into a bank specialising in defence sector loans to reduce the exposure of other lenders to potential sanctions.
According to financial marketplace Banki.ru, Genbank is Russia's 92nd largest by assets, with IS Bank and Black Sea Bank occupying 155th and 197th places respectively. 
Market leader Sberbank's shares were 2.8% higher by 1341 GMT, while VTB shares were up 3.4%. 
""The really serious sanctions, which could send the market lower, start at the moment when we are talking about putting large (public) Russian banks or companies on the sanctions list, or about serious trade sanctions,"" said Sofya Donets, Russia and CIS economist at Renaissance Capital. 

Russia's huge foreign currency reserves, moderate debt and strong budget position mean most sanctions risks have already been priced in by the market, she said. 
Elena Kozhukhova, an analyst at Veles Capital, said Russian banks could remain under pressure this year due to potential sanctions, but would rebound quickly should the situation improve thanks to high interest rates.

1203,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 22, 2022 09:00AM ET</span>",Volkswagen Plans IPO of Porsche to Ignite EV Shift Momentum,"(Bloomberg) -- Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) is preparing an initial public offering of  Porsche  (DE:PSHG_p), seeking a listing of its most profitable asset to help boost the parent’s valuation and fund the push into electric vehicles.
VW’s preferred shares surged as much as 10% after the announcement Tuesday on a possible IPO outline between the carmaker and Porsche Automobil Holding SE, a company controlled by the billionaire Porsche and Piech family. 
The tentative listing, estimated to value the sportscar brand at as much as 85 billion euros ($96 billion) by Bloomberg Intelligence, would partly reverse a tumultuous takeover of Porsche more than a decade ago and signals the extent of the upheaval sweeping the industry. 
Europe’s biggest carmaker has been pushing for years to adopt a less centralized corporate structure to become more nimble and step up its challenge to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. Success has been modest. The IPO of Traton SE, VW’s truckmaking unit, fizzled amid internal ructions and a limited free float, while a plan to separate the Lamborghini supercar and Ducati motorcycle brands didn’t progress. 
Volkswagen’s management and supervisory boards still have to sign off on the framework agreement with Porsche SE and a final decision hasn’t yet been made, the carmaker said.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has confirmed what we suspected for some time, that it’s in advanced talks for an IPO of its Porsche brand, which we value at 60-85 billion euros -- based on a 55-70% discount to Ferrari’s EV/Ebitda -- vs. VW’s market cap of just 112 billion euros. Porsche benefits from both its luxury appeal and an electrification edge, with an anticipated 40%-plus battery-electric-sales mix by 2025. VW trades on a lowly 2.1x 2023 EV/Ebitda, representing an 89% discount to Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) and 94% discount to Tesla, with a Porsche IPO likely to generate significant shareholder value.
-- Michael Dean, BI automotive analyst
VW’s Porsche Worth $70 Billion If Driven Like a Ferrari: React
While VW Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess appeared to pour cold water on a Porsche listing about a year ago, he’s under pressure to start catching up to Tesla. After a well-received presentation of VW’s accelerated EV plans in March last year and successful models like the Porsche Taycan, efforts have sputtered and its market valuation remains dwarfed by the U.S. EV leader. 
Support for the push will be hard won even as industry momentum for bold moves is building. VW’s 20-member supervisory board is prone to convoluted decision-making. Worker representatives, who account for half the seats, are often aligned with the two officials from the German state of Lower Saxony to protect jobs. The sprawling Porsche-Piech clan, the biggest backer of CEO Diess, also needs to coalesce to greenlight major strategic overhauls. 
Diess’s consideration of deep job cuts sparked backlash from unions late last year, putting the CEO on the defensive. In the end, VW agreed to a compromise that included a plan for an 800-million euro tech campus and pledge to build a new EV factory near its Wolfsburg headquarters.
“We think a Porsche IPO, which has been a hot topic of discussion for years, is now more of a possibility of actually happening than ever before,” RBC analyst Tom Narayan said in a note. “What is different now however is that the Porsche family is firmly behind it as we expect Porsche SE to be a buyer of a Porsche brand IPO.”
A plan to list Porsche chimes with deep restructurings in train elsewhere among traditional carmakers and suppliers. In the latest example, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. is looking at ways to separate its electric-vehicle operation from its century-old legacy business to unlock value. 
Going ahead would boost Europe’s flagging IPO market. Share sales have slowed dramatically this year, after a record-setting 2021. Steep market swings are deterring issuers as investor appetite has dried up amid concerns about geopolitical tensions in Europe as well as tightening monetary policy.
Many that have braved volatile markets including Norwegian oil and gas company Var Energi AS have had to settle for bottom-end IPO pricing and a subdued start to life on the public market. Portfolio managers have become more selective after the poor performance of last-year’s marquee listings and the shelving of several recent deals.
Funding Options
Separating Porsche could offer a new funding option for the group. VW largely relies on generating enough cash on its own or issue bonds. Its convoluted shareholder structure limits options to raise fresh equity capital like Tesla has done, without diluting shareholdings of key stakeholders that control about 90% of VW’s voting stock.
The two companies share a common history dating back to the late 1930s and have been formally tied together following a protracted battle for control. Porsche first sought to buy VW little more than a decade ago, before the audacious coup failed and the far bigger manufacturer turned the tables, taking control of the sportscar maker in 2009. A remnant from that acrimonious saga is Porsche Automobil Holding, which has a voting stake in VW of about 53%. 
Porsche is the most iconic brand in VW’s stable and highly profitable, among other nameplates like Audi, Skoda and Bentley. Creating the multi-brand structure was the brainchild of Ferdinand Piech, the influential CEO and chairman of VW who engineered the Porsche takeover despite opposition from his cousin, Wolfgang Porsche. Piech passed away in 2019, aged 82.
Replicate Ferrari
Porsche Chief Financial Officer Lutz Meschke first raised the benefits of a potential IPO in 2018, saying such a move could unlock value and replicate Ferrari NV’s successful share sale years earlier. The deliberations didn’t gain support from VW at the time.
But the prospect has remained part of conversations around Porsche and officials have openly flirted with the idea that would give one of the world’s most coveted car brands more independence.
“I think Porsche could be an interesting part for thinking about an IPO,” Porsche CEO Oliver Blume said during a briefing with U.S. reporters last year, cautioning that a final decision won’t be his to make. “We have to hand it to Volkswagen and they have nothing decided.”

Investing.com –  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT) stock traded 0.3% lower in premarket Tuesday after it trimmed its annual revenue growth outlook to 7-8% from 9% earlier.
The company attributed its revised forecast to “the greater-than-expected market impact of the pandemic and healthcare system staffing challenges in the fiscal second quarter, which is expected to continue into the second half of the fiscal year.” Those challenges held the company behind analysts’ expectations in the second quarter.
The lower forecast from Medtronic follows a miss on revenue in the second quarter when the impact of the Delta variant still lingered. Through the last two years, the pandemic has kept treatment of other ailments disturbed. Staff at clinics and hospitals have remained overstretched while patients were scared to get treatment for other illnesses.
The healthcare firm is keeping its guidance for adjusted profit per share unchanged at $5.65-$5.75.
Ventilator sales fell in the second quarter as fewer patients needed them, as Delta began to wane toward the end of the quarter. Excluding the impact of ventilator sales declines, Medical Surgical revenue rose 6% on organic basis.
Organic revenue in the Cardiovascular portfolio rose 3%.
Geographically, emerging markets grew mid-teens led by China, Latin America, Middle East & Africa, and South Asia. Emerging markets revenue of $1.4 billion was 18% of company’s total revenue and offset the decline in U.S. and low-single-digit growth in non-U.S. developed countries.
Second quarter total revenue rose 3% to $7.8 billion. Adjusted profit per share rose 29% to $1.32 due to higher margins."
1205,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2022 08:21AM ET</span>",Spotify's Joe Rogan saga spotlights podcast moderation challenges,"By Elizabeth Culliford, Dawn Chmielewski and Supantha Mukherjee
(Reuters) -At an ad industry conference in New York this month, one of the key architects of Spotify (NYSE:SPOT)'s podcasting strategy outlined what she saw as the biggest challenge facing platforms: how to moderate content.
Chief Content and Advertising Business Officer Dawn Ostroff, the television veteran who had helped bring U.S. podcaster Joe Rogan and other top talent to Spotify, had been asked about the backlash to COVID-19 misinformation spread on his podcast as Neil Young and other artists yanked their music in protest. She said companies faced a ""dilemma of moderation versus censorship"" and there was ""no silver bullet.""
Content moderation has been a thorny challenge for online platforms. While social media companies like Meta's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) have faced pressure to be more transparent over moderation and ramp up investment in human and artificial intelligence review systems, podcasting has often flown under the radar.
The backlash over ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" which Spotify licensed in a more than $100 million exclusive deal in 2020, heightens scrutiny on Spotify's overall approach to moderation as it evolves from a music streaming service to a podcast giant and investor in original content, industry professionals and researchers said.
It also turns the spotlight on the podcast industry's historically hands-off approach to moderation, partly a result of its open and fragmented nature.
Different podcasts are hosted by various platforms and sent through RSS feeds or services to directory apps like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Podcasts or Spotify which catalog shows for listeners. The sheer volume of material - millions of podcasts and hours-long episodes - and technical challenges of transcribing and analyzing audio make moderating even tougher.
Spotify first added podcasts in 2015 and made a major push into the medium from 2019, buying podcast networks Gimlet and Anchor and spending hundreds of millions on exclusive content deals with celebrities like Kim Kardashian and former U.S. President Barack Obama.
Only last month, as its podcast library swelled to 3.6 million, did Spotify publish its platform rules in full online, in response to the Rogan controversy. The policies have been actively enforced for years, and over 20,000 episodes have been removed for COVID-19 misinformation during the pandemic, it said.
Unlike Facebook or Twitter, Spotify does not issue transparency reports that would offer public accounting of content removal. A Spotify spokesman said it was working toward this goal.
Spotify Chief Executive Daniel Ek recently told investors he knew its podcasting strategy would ""test our teams in new ways."" He said it was ""implementing several first-of-its-kind measures to help combat misinformation and provide greater transparency.""
Moderating audio generally involves converting it to text and using automated tools to filter content or identify moments for human review, but it is time-intensive and inexact, experts said. The nuances of speakers' tones, evolving terms and slang across languages, and the need to contextualize within longer discussions all contribute to the complexity.
Audio moderation is ""a perfect storm,"" said Mark Little, co-founder of Kinzen, a firm contracted by Spotify to alert it to brewing problems concerning election integrity, misinformation and hate speech across platforms.
""You're faced with something that is uniquely complex, having this volume ..., having a format that defies the kind of textual analysis that we've relied upon in the past.""
In a Feb. 2 Reuters interview, Ek called Spotify's global content moderation team a ""very big operation."" But he and a spokesman declined to quantify its investment in content moderation, how many employees work on platform safety, or say what technologies it uses.
Spotify uses third-party reviewers to help identify harmful content. Its content team gets advice from a dozen partners with expertise in hate speech, harassment, child exploitation, extremism and misinformation, the spokesman said.
These consultants, most of whom Spotify declined to name, provide its in-house team - which makes all content moderation decisions - with insights, alert it to potential dangers and help it detect abuse.
Spotify added 1.2 million podcasts to its catalog last year alone. As the content available on top platforms swells and new show deals are inked, more robust moderation should be built in, some industry experts argued.
""I'm really hesitant to just fall back on 'it's hard,' because we know it's hard. Is it as hard as creating a multi-billion-dollar, multinational organization that basically is ... the go-to audio app?"" said Owen Grover, former CEO of podcast app Pocket Casts.

The Rogan saga both raises questions about Spotify's duties when it exclusively licenses shows, and about the broader challenge moderation poses for the podcasting industry.
Podcasts are generally uploaded to hosting platforms and distributed to directory apps like Apple or Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Podcasts or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Music via RSS feeds or the hosting services.
The patchwork nature of hosting sites and directory apps dilutes responsibility and makes for spotty enforcement on non-exclusive podcasts, industry experts said. Spotify, for example, does not host podcasts, though it owns hosting platforms like Anchor, home of Rogan's podcast, and Megaphone. 
Podcasts not hosted by a Spotify-owned platform submit shows to Spotify for review before their release on the app. But ""a lot of people don't even realize how simple it is to get something through on Spotify or Apple,"" said Nick Hilton, who runs Podot, a UK-based independent podcast production company and said the Spotify approval process can take only a few minutes. 
Several hosting platforms said in interviews they did not have the ability or desire to vet all the content they host. ""We don't act as moderators,"" said Blubrry CEO Todd Cochrane, though it responds to takedown requests, citing the example of removing measurement services from a white supremacist group.
""When we get wind of something ... we'd just get a bag of potato chips and turn the speed up to 1.5x and sit down and listen,"" said Mike Kadin, CEO of hosting platform RedCircle, which largely relies on user reports or signals like racist artwork. ""Transcribing every piece of podcast content would be prohibitively expensive.""

Podcasting's open, accessible nature is a key feature of the medium, industry professionals and researchers said, but greater scrutiny and advancements in moderation tools could lead to more investment in reviewing content.
""We will react to any market changes here,"" said Daniel Adrian, general counsel of podcast platform Acast. ""We don't know where this will end up.""

IZHEVSK, Russia (Reuters) -Russian carmaker Avtovaz, controlled by France's  Renault  (PA:RENA), is looking to secure alternative supplies of electronic chips in case U.S. sanctions curb deliveries to Moscow, the company's chief executive said on Tuesday.
Western governments are set to announce fresh sanctions against Russia after President Putin recognised two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, with the White House telling its chip industry to be ready for new curbs on exports to Russia. 
Should Washington expand the scope of the restrictions, mirroring a previous move against Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, it could stop shipments of chips, computers, consumer electronics, telecommunications equipment, and other items made anywhere in the world if they used U.S. technology.
Similar measures were deployed during the Cold War, when the United States and other Western nations maintained severe technology sanctions on the Soviet Union, crimping its growth. 
""Of course we are also investigating possibilities to find alternatives in the case of sanctions,"" Nicolas Maure, Avtovaz's chief executive, told reporters in the Russian city of Izhevsk. 
Maure did not say how Avtovaz, behind the Lada brand, secures chips for its car plants in Russia. Russia lacks its own chip production and relies on foreign supplies, including from China, industry watchers say. 
A senior Russian auto industry source voiced a concern over how chip delivery times and new pre-orders could be affected. 
""We don't understand how sanctions (if implemented) could impact the industry but hope that there will be no war - it will complicate the existing situation,"" the person told Reuters.
Russian carmakers, like other producers globally, are struggling to secure chips amid pandemic-related bottlenecks and increased demand elsewhere. 
Sales of new cars in Russia are forecast to slow to 3.3% this year from 4.3% in 2021, because of the shortage of electronic components, logistics challenges and higher costs.
Renault, which owns Avtovaz via a 69%-32% joint-venture with Rostec, is carefully following the Ukraine security crisis, the French carmaker's spokesperson Rie Yamane said, adding it was ""premature"" to estimate the possible sanctions.
Avtovaz sells over 90% of its production locally, Yamane said, with the rest mainly shipped to Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countriesm which include Moldova, Georgia and Kazakhstan. It sources about 80% of its components in Russia. 

Last week, Avtovaz reported its 2021 sales rose 10.4% to 2.85 billion euros ($3.23 billion).

(Reuters) -AstraZeneca non-executive Chairman Leif Johansson will retire next year after serving 11 years in the role, the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker said on Tuesday, as it moves onto the next stage of growth led by newer therapies, including for cancer. 
The Swedish businessman, 70, became chairman in 2012, around the same time Frenchman Pascal Soriot took charge as chief executive. Soriot in an interview with the Financial Times https://on.ft.com/3zapoJp last May hinted that succession planning had begun for him and Johansson. 
The London-listed drugmaker said on Tuesday that Johansson would step down following the annual general meeting in 2023 and the search for a chair successor was ""proceeding well."" 
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) last year asked Johansson to continue in his role to oversee its now-completed $39 billion acquisition of rare diseases drug maker Alexion (NASDAQ:ALXN), its biggest deal on record, while it also navigated developments around its COVID-19 shot. 
He also served as chairman of telecommunications firm Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) from 2011 until 2018.
New governance codes introduced in 2019 to diversify talent said that a chair for a firm in Britain should not remain in the post beyond nine years, and companies must carefully consider any extension beyond that for a limited period. 
AstraZeneca said on Tuesday it had once again asked Johansson, who reached nine years' tenure in 2021, to continue for another year until 2023 to facilitate the succession planning. 

""The Board believes it would be in the best interests of shareholders for Mr Johansson to seek re-election at the AGM in April 2022 and continue to serve as Chair for one further year,"" it said in a statement.
Following confirmation of Johansson's retirement plans, Soriot's tenure could come back into investor focus as it leaves behind only him from the old guard at the top. Former finance chief Marc Dunoyer was moved to a new role to lead Alexion.

Investing.com –  Krispy Kreme  (NASDAQ:DNUT) stock traded 1.4% higher in premarket Tuesday after price hikes and more purchase points for the customers helped it surpass fourth quarter estimates.
The company said it faced wage and commodity inflation in the period, but price increases in September and November more than offset those headwinds.
In the last 12 months, Krispy Kreme added over 2,000 spots for its customers to buy its doughnuts, and this also helped its topline beat estimates as well as expand margins.
Net revenue rose nearly 14% to $371 million. Total organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter, excluding the exit from the legacy wholesale business, grew almost 20%.  
The company said sales from Insomnia Cookies were strong in U.S. and Canada. It also attributed the gains to its hub and spoke model that allows it to deliver fresh doughnuts that customers like.
International sales drove the sales, rising 26% to $90 million. Limited offers helped internal sales, the company said. Growth was strong across all the markets, including the U.K., Mexico, Australia, and New Zealand.
Krispy Kreme is now expecting its 2022 net revenue to grow 11-13% to $1.53 billion-$1.56 billion. Adjusted profit per share in 2022 is seen between 38 cents and 41 cents.

Europe's highest court ruled in 2020 that an EU-U.S. data transfer agreement was invalid, citing surveillance concerns.
That promoted Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) to issue a provisional order that the mechanism Facebook uses to transfer data from European Union users to the United States ""cannot in practice be used.""
The order was frozen following a challenge by Facebook in the Irish High Court but resumed last May when the court dismissed Facebook's claims. 
Facebook has warned a stoppage could have ""devastating"" and ""irreversible"" consequences for its business, which relies on processing user data to serve targeted online ads. The DPC has said other companies could face massive disruption.
The DPC, which is the EU's lead regulator of Facebook and many other of the world's largest technology company's due to the location of their EU headquarters in Ireland, issued its revised preliminary decision on Monday, which Facebook owner Meta Platforms has 28 days to respond to.
The DPC declined to give details of its revised findings. 
Under EU data protection rules, the DPC must then share the ruling with all concerned EU supervisory authorities and consider their views before issuing a final verdict. 
A DPC spokesperson anticipated the revised findings would be shared with other EU regulators in April.
A spokesperson for Meta confirmed it had received the revised version.

""Suspending data transfers would be damaging not only to the millions of people, charities, and businesses in the EU who use our services, but also to thousands of other companies who rely on EU-US data transfers to provide a global service,"" she said. 
""A long-term solution on EU-US data transfers is needed to keep people, businesses and economies connected.""

1213,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2022 07:00AM ET</span>",Funds win again with U.S. curve flatteners: McGeever,"By Jamie McGeever
ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) -Another week, another big win for hedge funds betting on a flatter U.S. yield curve.
Futures market data for the week through Feb. 15 show that funds' extending their bets on a narrower gap between two- and 10-year yields coincided with one of the most dramatic 24-hour periods at the short end of the curve in over a decade.
The pace of flattening this year, however, has been so rapid that a period of consolidation may now be in store: in recent days the 2s/10s part of the curve has begun to steepen, and frenzied interest rate expectations have cooled. Slightly.
The latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission report shows that funds increased their net short position in two-year Treasuries by more than 104,000 contracts to 115,758 contracts in the week through Feb. 15.
That is the largest overall net short since October, and the weekly change marked the most bearish shift since last March. It was wholly driven by liquidation of long positions rather than funds opening fresh short positions.
A short position is essentially a bet that an asset's price will fall, and a long position is a bet it will rise. In bonds, yields rise when prices fall, and move lower when prices rise.
The week in question covers Thursday Feb. 10, when figures showed U.S. inflation at a 40-year high of 7.5%, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he had turned ""dramatically"" more hawkish, and the two-year yield soared 24 basis points.
That was the biggest one-day rise since 2009 and contributed to a 13-basis point narrowing of the spread between two- and 10-year yields, the fourth biggest compression in a decade.
The 2s/10s curve flattened to 35 basis points on Feb. 14, the lowest since mid-2020. This is an increasingly loud warning that the Fed may tighten policy too aggressively and that the economy could soon stall or even tip into recession.
Other parts of the yield curve have flattened further and some parts of the rates futures curve have inverted. This is due to the ratcheting up of expectations that the Fed will raise rates aggressively to cool inflation.
Economists at JP Morgan on Friday were the latest to revise up their Fed outlook, to seven 25-basis point hikes this year, while strategists at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) raised their 10-year U.S. yield forecast by 50 bps to 2.70%.
""We expect the curve to continue to flatten, but believe the extent to which flattening is already priced leaves little appeal to adding further exposure,"" Credit Suisse's Jonathan Cohn said.
Fatigue might be setting in though. Last week was the first in eight that the two-year yield declined week on week, even though it was only by a couple of basis points. Perhaps markets are realizing that Bullard, the Fed's most vocal hawk, doesn't speak for the whole rate-setting committee.
Money markets are no longer fully pricing in at least 150 basis points of tightening from the Federal Reserve this year, and the two-year yield has come off almost 20 basis points from its Feb. 10 high of 1.64%.
The CFTC report for the week through Feb. 15 also showed that funds cut their net short 10-year Treasuries futures holdings by 27,847 contracts to 174,063, the smallest since October.
The most eye-catching nugget was that this marked the third week in a row that funds added to their long positions, something they have not done since last May.
This suggests that the 10-year yield's recent climb above 2% for the first time since 2019 was attractive to investors who, with Russia and Ukraine on the brink of war, had extra incentive to buy the safest, most liquid asset in the world.
There may be life in the old bonds yet.

Adding to the gains in the stock is the company’s decision to raise its quarterly dividend by 15%.
As more people returned to work, demand from those looking to upgrade their surroundings or furnish their new properties was expected to soften. That isn’t exactly what is happening.

1216,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2022 06:37AM ET</span>","Airbus, Safran consortium to buy fighter jet parts maker A&D","By Gus Trompiz and Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) -A consortium backed by Airbus and  Safran  (PA:SAF) has agreed to buy superalloys supplier Aubert & Duval from Eramet after the French government stepped in to protect its strategic interests in the maker of fighter jet and submarine parts.
The preliminary deal comes more than a year after mining group Eramet , launched a review of its loss-making specialist metal alloys business and entered talks with Airbus, jet engine maker Safran and Tikehau Ace Capital.
The provisional agreement, which the parties expect to finalise before year end, gives the loss-making A&D business an enterprise value of 95 million euros ($107.3 million), Eramet said.
It marks a new step in the overhaul of Eramet whose activities are concentrated in mining and processing nickel and manganese for steel firms. It has shifted focus recently to developing raw materials for electric vehicle batteries.
Eramet pre-announced an accounting charge of 340 million euros in 2021 results due on Wednesday, in connection with the deal, adding there would be no impact on group debt.
Eramet shares fell around 4% at the opening in Paris, before bouncing back to trade up to 2% higher.
The charge includes specific guarantees that Eramet has provided to the buyers for any quality problems in the wake of issues experienced at A&D, a spokesperson said.
On Sunday, the French government, Eramet's second-largest shareholder, paved the way for a sale by issuing a ""golden share"" related to certain A&D assets, which will be maintained following the transfer of control to new owners and give the government a final say on defence interests.
The government already has veto-wielding golden shares in ArianeGroup, which builds Ariane space launchers and French ballistic missiles under the joint ownership of Airbus and Safran, and satellite imaging firm Airbus DS Geo.
A&D's advanced superalloys are used in engines for the Rafale fighter and the LEAP commercial engine, co-produced for Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus by Safran and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE).
Airbus is the biggest direct customer for A&D, which also supplies parts for French missiles, warships and artillery as well as the country's large nuclear-power sector.
Airbus, Safran and Tikehau will have equal shares in A&D. The trio said the deal would allow them to secure strategic supply chain materials for civil and military projects.
The French government owns 25.6% of Eramet, 12% of Safran and 10.9% of Airbus, though its role in the European planemaker is restricted to overseeing defence interests.

Investing.com – Volkswagen (DE:VOWG) stock was up 4.5% in German trading Tuesday after the company said it is exploring an initial public offering of  Porsche .
The public offering of Volkswagen’s most profitable asset is expected to fuel the valuation of the world’s second largest automaker and help it take on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in the electric vehicle market.
VW and family holding company Porsche Automobil Holding have negotiated a framework agreement to form the basis for preparing a potential IPO, the company said in a statement.
“The conclusion of the framework agreement is subject to the approval of the management board and the supervisory board of  Volkswagen AG  (OTC:VWAGY). A final decision has not yet been taken (sic),” Volkswagen said.
Europe’s largest carmaker has a convoluted shareholder structure, which limits its options to raise fresh equity. It relies on its own cash that the business generates, or bonds and loans. A Porsche listing will open up a new avenue for it to raise funds.
The listed Porsche Automobil Holding (DE:PSHG_p) is separate from the sportscar business. It was created more than 10 years back when Porsche tried to wrest control of a much larger VW. The attempt imploded when the 2008 financial crisis led to a fund crunch and the sportscar business came under VW group and Porsche SE stayed a separate legal unit.

(Reuters) -Britain's biggest retail stockbroker  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) on Tuesday reported slower growth than analysts had expected in the assets it manages and net new business for the half year to December, sending its shares sliding over 15%. 
London-listed Hargreaves reported net new business of 2.30 billion pounds ($3.12 billion) in the half year, but that was 18% below a company-compiled consensus. Assets under administration of 141.20 billion pounds were 2% below estimates. 
The company in a media call attributed the decline to decreased investor confidence due to the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and worries over inflation. Hargreaves shares were down roughly 15% at 1,106.5 pence by 1015 GMT after having fallen as much as 22.3% earlier.
Trading platforms saw record levels of activity during the early stages of the pandemic on the back of a retail trading frenzy.
But the absence of events like ""Vaccine Mondays"" - which drove record levels of stockbroking, easing of market volatility and low interest rates for much of last year has hurt the value of cash balances Hargreaves held for its clients, the company said.
""In the first half of this financial year we saw a gradual return to the office and calmer markets which led to more normalised share trading levels,"" the fund supermarket said in a statement.
Hargreaves reported fewer net additions of 48,000 clients during the period, compared with 84,000 a year earlier, but declared a 3% increase in interim dividend to 12.26 pence per share.
""Possibly (Hargreaves) has seen bigger clients leaving the platform or drawing down, while newer ones are smaller, which is a headwind to profitability,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note.
The company also said it would suspend special dividends until 2024 to fund investments into expanding its Active Savings unit and digital services, having ear-marked 125 million pounds for that purpose.

1220,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2022 06:16AM ET</span>","Canadian banks set for 1st-qtr profit growth, but costs, margins could deal blow","By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian banks are set to report higher first-quarter earnings from a year ago, thanks to low provisions for credit losses and improving loan demand, but rising costs are a focus area for investors.
Analysts expect Canada's Big Six banks - Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF) - to post an average 6% increase in adjusted earnings per share in the three months through January. 
However, excluding the impact of provisions and taxes, earnings could be lower than a year earlier, with expense growth outpacing revenue expansion, and lower contribution from capital markets units following last year's strength, CIBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a recent note. 
Royal Bank kicks off results reporting on Thursday.
Canadian banks have reported record profits throughout the pandemic, as strong mortgage lending, trading and deals activity helped offset an evaporation in demand for other kinds of credit. Now, with restrictions and accommodative government and central bank policies coming to an end, the drivers of earnings are also starting to shift.
""Mortgage growth will continue to be strong, no surprise there,"" said Rob Colangelo, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service. ""But other kinds of lending, credit card, auto lending, there's some return to growth there.""
Credit-loss provisions are also likely to keep trending lower, with the banks continuing to release capital they had set aside in anticipation of impaired loans that have not materialized, Colangelo said.
But expenses are among the biggest uncertainties for the quarter, particularly related to compensation, driven by a tight labour market. 
""There's a lot of movement, especially in the financial services sector, and a lot of it is driven by wages,"" Philip Petursson, chief investment strategist at IG Wealth Management. ""I'm curious as to how much of an impact this is having on the banks."" 
The phenomenon is a global one, with major Wall Street banks raising pay and bonuses to attract and retain talent, particularly in investment banking units.
Surging inflation and planned business investments could also exacerbate cost pressures, even as revenues remain challenged during the quarter.
CIBC analysts predicted year-on-year revenue growth of just 1% in the first quarter, noting central bank interest rate hikes that could help have not happened yet. 
""The natural offset to inflation is higher interest rates,"" they wrote in a note. ""Inflationary impacts are happening now and rate benefits are in the future."" The Bank of Canada is widely seen raising rates at its March 2 meeting. 
A much-awaited improvement in net interest margins may also not have materialized during the quarter. Although fixed rates on mortgages have risen, they have done so at a slower pace than short-term rates, which determine banks' borrowing costs and have risen in anticipation of central bank rate hikes.

With the Canadian banks index up 115% since its March 2020 trough, compared with an 89% gain in the Toronto stock benchmark, bank shares have more downside risks, Petursson said. 
""If banks surprise to upside, I'm not as convinced we will see a significant jump up in stock performance,"" he said. But if the earnings disappoint, ""you could see a sharper hit to the downside.""

SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) -HSBC brought forward its key profitability target by a year and more than doubled its annual profit as expected bad loans from the COVID-19 pandemic failed to materialise, and it pointed to rising interest rates lifting its income.
Like global peers, HSBC, one of Europe's largest banks, is taking advantage of lower-than-expected impairment charges as its borrowers reap the benefit of government support in markets hit by coronavirus, while economic recovery also helps firms.
HSBC's shares shed 3.4% in afternoon trade on Tuesday, compared to a fall of 1.4% in the benchmark FTSE index as global stocks stumbled after the Ukraine crisis intensified.
""We have good momentum coming into 2022 and are confident that we can continue to execute against our strategy,"" Group Chief Executive Noel Quinn said in the results statement.
London-headquartered HSBC said it would buy back up to $1 billion of its own shares after the conclusion of an existing $2 billion buyback programme.
It said that if central bank interest rates rose worldwide as expected, the resulting improvement in lending margins would meet its goal of a double-digit return on equity in 2023, a year sooner than expected.
""Given their large Asia footprint, it will be interesting to see if the zero-COVID policy in the region will adversely impact their performance relative to their other more UK-centric London rivals in 2022,"" said Sudeepto Mukherjee, head of financial Services at consultancy Publicis Sapient.
Quinn, who has run the bank on a permanent basis for the past two years, has doubled down on Asia by moving global executives there and is investing billions of dollars in the lucrative wealth management business.
The lender reported pretax profits of $18.9 billion last year, up from the previous year's $8.8 billion, and just below the $19.1 billion average of 17 analyst estimates compiled by HSBC. Asia contributed 65% of the profit.
Analysts at Citi said HSBC's guidance for this year was largely in line with consensus, ""with some downside risks to provisions and upside risks to capital return"".
The bank said it took a $500 million charge for expected credit losses in the quarter, mainly due to the downturn in China's troubled commercial real estate sector.
HSBC expects weaker performance in its wealth management in Asia in the first quarter of 2022.
HONG KONG MARKET
HSBC CFO Ewen Stevenson told Reuters the wealth management business would be affected by the weakness in global markets and closures of bank branches in Hong Kong, but the bank expected a bounceback later this year.
While Asia and most global economies open up, Hong Kong - HSBC's biggest market - is tightening pandemic curbs as it battles a growing outbreak of COVID-19, stoking worries about the economic impact.
The HSBC results come after Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) raised its core profitability goals as it bets on inflation-battling rate increases to boost lending.
HSBC's London-listed shares have gained 29% over the past year, versus a rise of 16% in StanChart and a surge of 25% in  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
The bank reported revenue slipped 2% in 2021 on low global interest rates and falling income in its markets business, but said rising rates this year and beyond should help reverse the decline.

""After absorbing the impact of low interest rates for some time, we believe we have turned the corner on revenue,"" Quinn said.
HSBC said it released $900 million in cash it had put aside in case pandemic-related bad loans spiked, as opposed to the corresponding time a year earlier, when it took a charge of $8.8 billion against expected losses.

1223,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2022 06:01AM ET</span>",U.S. prosecutors explore racketeering charges in short-seller probe -sources,"By Megan Davies and Chris Prentice
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. prosecutors are exploring whether they can use a federal law originally enacted to take down the mafia, in a sprawling probe of hedge funds and research firms that bet against stocks, according to two sources familiar with the situation.
The Justice Department last year issued subpoenas to dozens of firms, including such well-known names as Citron Research and Muddy Waters (NYSE:WAT) Research LLC, as part of the sweeping probe focused on potentially manipulative trading around negative reports on listed companies published by some of their investors, Reuters and other media have reported.
While prosecutors haven't made any decisions yet, potential charges under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) were an option on the table, the sources said. 
In the past, prosecutors have built RICO cases alongside other allegations, such as manipulation. One of the most high profile cases brought under the RICO Act included that of Michael Milken, who was indicted in the 1980s for racketeering and securities fraud but reached a plea deal, pleading guilty to securities violations but not racketeering or insider trading.
Reuters could not ascertain which types of charges the agency was leaning toward at this stage of the investigation or whether the probe would eventually lead to charges.
Spokespeople for the Justice Department in Washington and the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, which are involved in the probe according to the sources, declined to comment.
Citron declined to comment.
A spokesperson for Muddy Waters did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The potential use of the 1970 law, which has not been previously reported, provides new insights into the scale and ambition of the investigation. The probe marks a new frontier for the Justice Department's unit in Washington tasked with rooting out corporate crime. 
A racketeering case could allow prosecutors to ensnare a broad swathe of investors involved in an alleged ""criminal enterprise,"" even if they participated indirectly, lawyers said. 
But such a case would also face more challenges than a narrower one aimed at a smaller group of people. That's in part because prosecutors have to establish a pattern of activity, they said.
Among the activities the Justice Department is investigating is whether funds conspired to perpetrate a so-called ""short and distort scheme,"" sources have previously told Reuters. 
In such a scheme the funds would have placed trades that stood to profit if a company's stock fell and then issued false or misleading negative research reports about the company.
Prosecutors are also investigating the relationships between the short-sellers who publish the reports and hedge funds and other investors that may have profited, the sources have said. 
They are examining whether there is coordinated trading designed to boost trading volumes and exaggerate price drops on news of the short reports, Reuters previously reported.
RICO charges have historically been used to combat bribery, money laundering, or drug trafficking conducted by organized criminal enterprises such as the mafia. They are unusual in the world of finance but not unprecedented. 

U.S. prosecutors in 2019 charged then-current and former JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) executives with racketeering and manipulating prices of precious metals. 
""RICO statutes haven’t been used in this realm often in recent years, but they aren’t limited to organized crime,"" Robert Frenchman of Mukasey Frenchman LLP in New York said. ""It’s certainly in the prosecutors’ toolbox.""

Investing.com – SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) stock traded 3.3% lower in premarket Tuesday on fears of equity dilution due to its reported plans to buy banking-software maker Technisys in an all-stock deal.
According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the deal is worth $1.1 billion, equivalent to roughly 10% of SoFi’s market value.
The deal gives SoFi control of its own core banking platform, the back-end technology that allows customers to bank from anywhere and helps lenders provide them end-to-end services. SoFi offers home and auto loans, stock and cryptocurrency trading, and wealth management services.
The WSJ report said SoFi estimates the Technisys acquisition to generate up to $800 million in additional revenue through 2025. It will also create up to $85 million in cost savings over that period.
SoFi expects to be a bank soon. Last month, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve approved its applications to become a bank holding company through its proposed acquisition of Golden Pacific Bancorp. SoFi expects the acquisition to close this month, and operate its bank subsidiary as SoFi Bank, National Association.
SoFi started trading on June 1, 2021, after its merger with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings V, a blank check company run by tech investor Chamath Palihapitiya. "

(Reuters) - Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) HBC said on Tuesday it had contingency plans to cope with the escalating Russia-Ukraine crisis, as the London-listed soft drinks bottler reported a surge in annual profit driven in part by its large Russian business.
It shares tumbled 7% in early trade.
The company, one of Coca-Cola's many bottlers worldwide, said it was considering stockpiling ingredients to limit any disruption in Russia, after Western nations threatened new sanctions following Moscow's recognition of two breakaway Ukrainian regions. 
""We have contingencies in place for all scenarios, including alternative sourcing, so that we can act swiftly to whatever happens,"" Chief Executive Zoran Bogdanovic told Reuters.
He said Coca-Cola HBC, which operates in 29 European and African countries and counts Russia and Nigeria as its two biggest markets, had learned lessons from its experience during the 2014 Russian-Ukrainian conflict.
""We ensure that we have the right level of stocks in our markets to avoid disruptions,"" the CEO said.
Coca-Cola HBC's annual profit trounced market expectations, led by higher demand for low-sugar and energy drinks as more people dined out after COVID restrictions eased. 
The company holds local Coca-Cola franchises to bottle and sell drinks produced by the U.S. beverage giant, which holds a roughly 23% stake in the Switzerland-headquartered company.
It said comparable operating profit for the year ended Dec. 31 jumped nearly 24% to 831 million euros ($939 million), topping a company-provided market estimate of 797.6 million euros.
""The business has delivered a very strong recovery in 2021, with all key metrics above pre-pandemic levels,"" Bogdanovic said in a statement, adding that the firm faced inflationary pressures ahead. 
Soft drink makers such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) have flagged profit pressures for this year from a relentless rise in costs related to labour, shipping and aluminium cans, pushing them to hike prices.
Coca-Cola HBC said emerging markets like-for-like revenue jumped 27% on a constant currency basis, with Nigeria, Russia, and Ukraine showing strong momentum. 
On Russia, Chief Financial Officer Ben Almanzar said the company was considering alternative sourcing for raw materials.

""We have looked at all types of scenarios and have ensured that we have contingency plans in place in case there is disruption,"" he said.

""It's clear that there is a likelihood of contagion or some second order effect, but it will depend on the severity of the conflict and the severity of the retaliation if there is a conflict,"" he said.

1229,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2022 05:17AM ET</span>",Analysis-Amazon defies break-up wave sweeping conglomerates,"By Anirban Sen, Svea Herbst-Bayliss and David French
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has become the poster child of technology giants bucking the trend of major conglomerates breaking up, thanks to bright growth prospects shielding it from pressure to follow suit, investors and dealmakers said. 
Investors have in recent years fallen out of love with conglomerates holding disparate businesses. Many companies have taken note, with  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp announcing plans to break up in recent months.
Some hedge funds have been arguing that Amazon's $1.6 trillion market capitalization masks the true value of Amazon Web Services, its cloud business which could be worth almost as much as a separate entity.
They found ammunition in a letter sent last week by Daniel Loeb's hedge fund Third Point to investors, arguing the company is undervalued with ""significant sum-of-the-parts value"" hidden away. Third Point has not urged Amazon to break up.
Investment bankers said Amazon was unlikely to part with its cloud business, a big cash cow. It helps fund Amazon's expansion into new areas and compensates for less lucrative divisions that are showing strong revenue growth, such as its third-party merchant and advertising businesses.
""In contrast to industries where companies may have businesses that are either clearly unconnected or with very different financial profiles and capital needs, large tech companies have ample access to capital and businesses that have not hit maturity,"" said Michael Kagan,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)'s North America head of shareholder advisory and structured solutions.
""As a result, opportunities to drive long-term shareholder value by separating into 'pure plays' may be less obvious, both financially and operationally.""
An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment. 
Amazon has thrived largely on the back of its e-commerce business and highly profitably Amazon Web Services, even as it made inroads into new areas, building them or bulking up through large acquisitions in industries ranging from big-budget film-making to online groceries.
Its rapid growth has alarmed many U.S. lawmakers, who have in recent years unsuccessfully pushed for Amazon and big technology peers to be broken up over antitrust and data privacy concerns.
Those companies' founders, including Amazon's Jeff Bezos, have pushed back, arguing technology is the glue that keeps their disparate businesses together.
""In the world of tech, there typically is an underlying technology that permeates the various segments of a conglomerate entity,"" said Richard Grossman, an M&A partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.
""By contrast, in a classic sort of conglomerate you often will see less overlap between a company's various businesses."" 
Amazon's stock price surged at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as people avoided shopping in stores and doubled down on online orders. In 2021, the shares barely rose despite bumper gains for the S&P 500 index and other big-tech names, as global lockdowns started easing and consumers relied less on online shopping. 
Analysts have become more bullish on Amazon. Its shares rallied after its fourth-quarter earnings report this month showed strong growth in many non-ecommerce businesses.
BREAK-UP MANIA
Some 56 companies announced break-ups last year, up from 41 in 2020 and 47 in 2019, according to Dealogic. 
GE said last year it would split into three public companies to reduce debt and simplify its business. Days later, Johnson & Johnson said it would split off its consumer business to focus on its core pharmaceutical business.
Shares of both companies got a boost after the news. That same week, Japan's Toshiba said it would split into three companies as part of a broader push to improve shareholder value, following pressure for change from activists, including Elliott Management Corp.
The technology sector is a different story. Sprawling empires such as Amazon, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are expanding, often through dozens of acquisitions, and are venturing into new areas ranging from autonomous vehicles to groceries. 

Citi's Kagan said the fact that many tech giants are still controlled by their founders also made it less likely that they would yield to pressure to break up anytime soon. 
""Ongoing founder voting control also insulates many tech company boards and management teams from significant outside shareholder influence and activism, which have continued to be a key driver of separation activity,"" Kagan said.

Investing.com –  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) stock could extend Friday’s losses that followed a cautious outlook from the company.
The stock traded 1.2% lower in premarket Tuesday after shedding nearly 6% Friday. Markets were shut Monday on account of George Washington’s Birthday.
“While we are seeing progress on our strategic priorities, we continue to see supply chain pressure across most of our businesses as material and labor availability and inflation are affecting healthcare, renewable energy and aviation. Although varied by business, we expect these challenges to persist at least through the first half of the year,” GE said in an investor release it sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
For the current year, GE has forecast organic revenue to grow by around 9% with adjusted profit per share seen between $2.8 and $3.5. The company said while its guidance factored in the pressures, “The magnitude of these challenges likely present pressure to overall growth, profit and free cash flow through the first quarter and the first half, beyond typically expected seasonality.”
GE is currently going through a big restructuring that will eventually split its business into three. The company plans to spin off its healthcare business in early 2023, and its renewable energy and power company in early 2024, leaving the parent to focus overwhelmingly on aviation. GE plans to keep around 20% in the healthcare business."

As mainstream interest in cryptocurrencies grows, LSEG said the acquisition of TORA will help expand its trading and banking business globally.
TORA, led by Chief Executive Robert Dykes, supports customers trading multiple asset classes including equities, fixed income and digital assets across global markets.
It offers LSEG the ability to better compete in Asia and North America where TORA has a presence with offices in Hong Kong, New York, Singapore and Tokyo among others.
""Acquiring TORA will enable LSEG to deliver critical 'at trade' capabilities for the buy side,"" Dean Berry, the group's head of Trading & Banking Solutions, said in a statement.
The move is the latest in a growing trend of major financial institutions swooping on digital firms in the expectation they will upend trading processes in the sector.

1235,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2022 04:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive-HSBC targets 34% oil and gas emissions cut by 2030,"By Simon Jessop, Tommy Wilkes and Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC aims to cut emissions associated with loans made to its oil and gas clients by 34% this decade, the bank's sustainability chief told Reuters, marking the first time that Britain's biggest lender has committed to such a target.
More than 100 banks have pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and are under pressure to provide details on the deep shorter-term cuts to ""financed emissions"" that are needed if banks are to have any chance of meeting their goal.
""This is rewiring the way we make financing and investment decisions from here on in,"" Group Chief Sustainability Officer Celine Herweijer said of HSBC's 2030 targets. 
HSBC is a major lender to corporate clients across Asia and some of the world's biggest oil and gas companies, and its plan is expected to set the tone for other banks in the region, most of which have yet to release targets.
HSBC said its oil and gas target was based on 'absolute' reductions rather than 'carbon intensity', which measures emissions per unit of energy or barrel of oil and gas produced, and so could see actual emissions rise.
Climate activists say intensity-based targets do not go far enough if the world is to keep global warming from rising beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels, which scientists deem crucial to prevent catastrophic climate change.
""There's no way that you can move to a net-zero economy by 2050 if you have intensity-based metrics in the energy sector,"" Herweijer told Reuters.
Environmental campaign group Market Forces said HSBC's targets contained loopholes that undermined their credibility, including applying the target only to 'on-balance sheet' emissions. The policy also allowed HSBC to continue to finance new and expanded oil and gas projects, it added.
""HSBC knows what needs to be done, but can't bring themselves to break their dirty habit,"" Adam McGibbon, UK Campaign Lead at Market Forces, said in a statement.
Among the biggest global banks, few have committed to absolute targets, although  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) last month vowed to reduce its energy-sector absolute emissions by 29% by 2030.
HSBC's new targets also include a plan to reduce by 75% the intensity of financed emissions for power and utility clients.
Herweijer said this target was intensity-based, rather than absolute, because electricity consumption globally would need to rise during the transition to a lower-carbon economy.
The bank's targets are aligned with the International Energy Agency's Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, which Herweijer said was the hardest to meet but ""doable"".
HSBC said on Tuesday targets for the coal, aluminium, cement, iron, steel and transport sectors would follow in 2023.
BIGGEST CLIENTS
Around 100 large upstream and integrated companies are responsible for 90% of HSBC's oil and gas sector financed emissions, and the bank has given them an end of 2022 deadline to produce plans on how they intend to decarbonise.
The targets will cover so-called Scope 1 and 2 emissions, those linked to a company's own operations, and Scope 3 which are produced when customers use their products and which Herweijer said account for 80% of their emissions.
While focused on helping clients to plan, those who did not risked losing access to finance, Herweijer said, adding that a major challenge is the variability in emission disclosures.
""There's a big diversification on how different companies are measuring and reporting, if at all, on Scope 3, and the extent of that,"" she said. 

HSBC's targets like most, but not all, banks exclude capital markets activity such as underwriting bonds and share placements, although it said this would change as standard accounting for 'facilitated emissions' becomes available.
While that may not happen until later this year, Herweijer said HSBC was not ""ignoring capital markets"" and for future deals was ""thinking about the financed emissions of them as part of our decision making"".

Researchers reviewed women's representation in about 24,000 positions in firms on Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100, mid-cap FTSE 250 and FTSE 350 indices.
This puts Britain in second place globally, up from fifth in 2020 and just behind France which has a nearly 44% representation, according to the report. 
Homebuilder  Taylor Wimpey  (LON:TW) this month named Jennie Daly as CEO and Britain's largest pet supplies retailer, Pets At Home, appointed Sky UK executive Lyssa McGowan as its CEO.
The review also set out four new recommendations, including increasing the minimum board and leadership representation of women in FTSE 350 companies to 40% by the end of 2025.
In July, Britain's financial regulator also said at least 40% of board members in blue-chip companies should be women.
The latest report also found that female board representation in 2021 in the FTSE 250 and FTSE 350 grew by roughly 37% and 38% respectively. 
British business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng lauded the progress, but said there was still more work to be done, with many companies yet to hit a 33% target set by previous reviews.
""Only one in three leadership roles and around 25% of all Executive Committee roles are held by women and there are very few women in the CEO role,"" Kwarteng in a statement.

The report also said that number of women in chair roles across the FTSE 350 rose to 48 in 2021 from 39 a year earlier.
Water utilities  Severn Trent  (LON:SVT) and Pennon, and Holiday Inn owner IHG are three of the companies with women in chair roles.

(Reuters) -Worldline's fourth-quarter sales surpassed market expectations, prompting the French payments company to herald a new year of ""conquest"" in Europe, with shares rising more than 9%.
The group, which processes transactions for clients from merchants to government agencies, seeks to give priority to acquisitions in regionwide efforts to consolidate.
The payments sector has seen several big takeover deals in recent years as the growing use of e-commerce platforms and smartphones has sparked competition to develop new systems.
In a call, Chief Executive Gilles Grapinet told analysts he had never seen, in his ten years at the head of Worldline, so many banks, some significant ones among them, undertaking very deep strategic reviews of their payment activities.
He called 2021 a tipping point that had ""moved the thinking"" of some of the largest European banks, which now look to answer the question 'What should I do with my payment activities?'.
""It is unprecedented,"" he added. 
A SIGH OF RELIEF
""This is a year of perfect execution of our plans on all fronts,"" Grapinet told journalists in a call reviewing last year's performance, pointing to a group he described as being ""in movement and in conquest"".
Worldline posted sales of 1.04 billion euros ($1.17 billion) in the fourth quarter, which J.P. Morgan said was 2.6% ahead of consensus, fuelled by strong growth in merchant services.
Although Europe is still in the grip of the coronavirus pandemic, leading more people to switch to digital transactions, in-store volumes of payment processing firms have begun to recover.
""The results should be seen as a relief by the market since, given the Omicron variant in Q4, there were concerns that there would be revenue impact due to Worldline's DACH exposure, where there were issues,"" JPM wrote in a note.

Investing.com – ADRs of HSBC (NYSE:HSBC) traded 1% lower in premarket Tuesday after its fourth quarter earnings disappointed, hit by a $500 million charge, mostly due to its exposure to Chinese commercial real estate.
The lender’s warning of a weaker performance in its wealth business in Asia overshadowed any boost that could have come from its plan for an additional $1 billion share buyback program. The bank also warned of inflationary pressures, much on the lines of its rival Natwest (NYSE:NWG) which trimmed its cost-cutting target last week, blaming rising prices for the decision.
The impairment charge -- booked on HSBC’s Hong Kong balance sheets -- was the result of local policy measures that had led to an increase in “refinancing risk and liquidity pressures,” Chief Executive Officer Noel Quinn told Bloomberg. He said those market conditions have improved to some extent.
Fourth quarter profit after tax nearly doubled to $2 billion after the bank released more reserves it had earlier, created to tackle contingencies. With economy and asset quality improving, the bank felt it could do with fewer reserves. However, at 45 cents on a per share basis, it was behind estimates.
Revenue was up 2% at $12 billion as credit and lending activities gained.
The bank said it expects mid-single-digit lending growth over the year while it targets adjusted operating expenses in line with 2021, came in at $8.3 billion.
HSBC is optimistic that, if interest rates harden, it would meet its goal of a double-digit return on equity in 2023, a year sooner than expected.

STOCKHOLM/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Ailing airline SAS on Tuesday launched a cost savings plan and said it hoped to raise new capital after posting a wider quarterly loss as it grapples with weak demand and tough competition.
The group, which has been struggling for years, said it would fully transform its business, including its network, fleet, labour agreements and other cost structures, aiming to save 7.5 billion Swedish crowns ($799 million) a year. 
""The last two years have been the most challenging in the history of the aviation industry ... SAS is now, more than ever, in need of a new start,"" CEO Anko van der Werff said. 
The ""plan paves the way for undertaking a complete revitalisation of SAS' balance sheet and to substantially strengthen SAS’ liquidity position,"" SAS said in a statement.
The airline, in which Sweden and Denmark each hold a stake of around 22%, secured a 3 billion crown rescue deal from the two governments in 2020 to keep afloat. 
It did not specify how much capital it hoped to raise this time but its CEO later told investors the firm would be able to provide more detail in April.
""The success of the plan and the ability to attract potential new capital relies on SAS fully achieving the SEK 7.5 billion annual cost take-out plan which in turn depends upon SAS stakeholders’ full participation.""
Danish Finance Minister Nikolaj Wammen said in an email the government was monitoring SAS' development closely and declined to comment further. 
Sweden's Enterprise Minister Karl-Petter Thorwaldsson was not immediately available for comment. 
""This is a big cost-cutting plan and it means that SAS addresses that they are a few steps behind their competitors which are ready to move,"" Sydbank analyst Jacob Pedersen said in a note to clients.
The airline reported a loss before tax of 2.60 billion Swedish crowns ($275 million) for the November-January quarter after posting a loss of 1.92 billion a year earlier.

SAS shares fell around 4% shortly after the market open but rebounded to trade up 7% by 0913 GMT. The stock shed some 30% after Norwegian brokerage DNB last week said SAS was edging closer to bankruptcy if no restructuring was carried out.

Investing.com -- European stock markets slumped Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into eastern Ukraine on recognizing two breakaway regions as independent republics, taking the region to the brink of war.
By 3:35 AM ET (0835 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.6% lower, the CAC 40 in France dropped 0.9% while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 fell 0.5%.
Global stock markets have been on edge for the last week as tensions were ramped up on the Ukraine border. Putin’s decisions to recognize two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent and then deploy troops in what Moscow called a peacekeeping operation has prompted investors to shun risk, causing a broad-based selloff.
U.S. President Joe Biden followed this by signing an executive order to halt any U.S. business activity in the breakaway regions, and Linda Thomas-Greenfield, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said, after an emergency meeting of the Security Council late on Monday, there would be further sanctions announced on Tuesday.
European Union ambassadors meet later Tuesday to discuss a plan for sanctions in response to Putin’s move, while Britain has said it too would sanction Russia.
In the corporate sector,  HSBC Holdings  PLC (LON:HSBA) stock fell 1.2%, with the banking sector hit hard on fears that sanctions on Russia could result in an increase in the sector’s bad loans. That said, HSBC is largely Asia-focused and reported pretax profit of $18.9 billion last year, up from the previous year's $8.8 billion. It will also buy back up to $1 billion of its own shares, after completing its existing $2 billion buyback program.
SAS (ST:SAS) stock slumped 4.6% after the Scandinavian airline said it will look to raise new capital after reporting a wider loss of 2.60 billion Swedish crowns ($275 million) for the November-January quarter loss of than a year earlier.
Investors will also focus on the release of Germany's Ifo business climate index later Tuesday. Positive signs of an economic recovery could encourage the European Central Bank to unwind post-pandemic stimulus faster than expected, although the uncertainty sparked by the situation in Ukraine could stay the central bank’s hand.
Crude oil and gas prices soared Tuesday following Russian troops entering eastern Ukraine, raising the potential of a disruption of energy supplies if U.S. and European governments decide to impose oil or gas sanctions on Moscow as a consequence.
By 3:35 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 4.7% higher at $94.47 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 3.2% to $95.32, having earlier Tuesday climbed to its highest level since September 2014. Gasoline RBOB Futures were up 4% at $2.9245 a gallon.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,905.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1314.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russian state bank VTB on Tuesday reported a record net profit of 327.4 billion roubles ($4.1 billion) in 2021, but said it would not give any forecasts until markets stabilise.
Collectively, Russian banks made a record 2.4 trillion roubles profit last year as a rebound from the coronavirus crisis revived loan growth and boosted interest in real estate assets, the central bank said last month.
However, VTB shares slumped 18.25% lower on Monday, underperforming the wider Russian market, amid fears that new Western sanctions in response to Moscow sending troops to two Russia-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine may target key financial institutions.
Russian stock indexes were hit after President Vladimir Putin recognised the independence of the regions, a move the West fears could presage a major war.
Shares in VTB, Russia's second-largest bank by assets, were down 3.1% at 0843 GMT on Tuesday, after earlier touching their lowest level since March 2020. 
VTB board member Dmitry Pyanov declined to comment on the bank's dividend plans and gave no forecasts for the year ahead. 
""The situation on the market now is very volatile, so we are refraining from financial forecasts for 2022,"" Pyanov told reporters. ""We plan to tell the market about our expectations and plans for 2022 after the market situation has stabilised.""
VTB's fourth quarter net profit was 69.8 billion roubles, up from 16.2 billion roubles in October-December of 2020. Its full-year profit was up from 75.3 billion roubles in 2020.
The bank said its return on equity (RoE), a key measure of profitability, rose to 16.5% in 2021, while its cost of risk fell by 120 basis points to 0.7%. 

Provisions against bad loans fell to 116 billion roubles from 249.8 billion roubles, VTB said, while its net interest margin declined to 3.7% in the fourth quarter, from 3.9% in July-September.

(Reuters) -March was expected to be a busy window for Europe's stock market listings, but Russia's move to redraw borders in Ukraine and market uncertainty due to the escalating security crisis on the continent are prompting companies to put their plans to go public on ice.
Proceeds raised so far this year by companies going public in Europe, the Middle East and Africa are down 79% to $3.1 billion compared to the same period last year, when companies raised $15.1 billion in what was a record-breaking year for equity capital markets activity in the region, according to Refinitiv data.
Soaring stock markets have boosted the IPO market in recent years. But with post-pandemic measures driving up inflation, an increasingly strained economic environment is dampening investor risk appetite for new names. 
Expectations had previously pointed to a busy March window for initial public offerings (IPO) this year after several deals were postponed from the end of 2021.
March typically marks the beginning of the IPO season as most companies wait to close their financial year to beef up their IPO prospectus with their most recent results.
But the pipeline ahead is under pressure as the United States and its European allies are poised to announce new sanctions against Russia after President Vladimir Putin formally recognised two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, dealing a blow to a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
""I suspect a significant disruption and delay to the pipeline due to what has happened. A lot of companies are sitting back, looking at this situation and waiting to list,"" said Kasper Elmgreen, head of equities at French asset management company Amundi.
A number of European companies including Spanish bank Ibercaja have kicked large public listings down the road after officially launching the process.
On Jan. 27 Dutch file transferring service WeTransfer scrapped an Amsterdam float that would have valued it at between 629 million euros and 716 million euros.
German artificial limb maker Ottobock is waiting until September to launch its multibillion-euro stock market listing, adding to a series of deals being delayed in recent weeks.
Fears that Moscow will launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine have taken their toll.
""Any market which is driven by headlines is a tough one, and the impact is negative with respect to adding risk,"" said Andrew Briscoe, head of EMEA ECM Syndicate at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
""Naturally there's going to be delays and some that need to be a bit more nimble on timing.""
LARGER DEALS IN FOCUS
Larger deals that offer greater access to liquidity and high-quality assets are likely to go ahead, several bankers said, but some deals are at a standstill until the situation stabilises.
""Whether you're a large-cap or a small-cap, it will certainly make most issuers pause and try to take stock, especially when you're looking at an IPO and a four-week process, and things are changing day-to-day,"" a second banker who manages IPOs in Europe said.
Along with a volatile market, the poor performance of some of last year's IPOs is further increasing investor pessimism, with the likes of Deliveroo to Alphawave trading well below their listing price.
The FTSE Renaissance IPO Index for Europe, the Middle East and Africa is down about 23.5% so far this year.

Norwegian oil and gas company Var Energi completed a 77 billion Norwegian crowns IPO last week but shares closed on Monday 2.3% below IPO pricing.
""If an investor is already quite worried about the state of their current portfolio, it doesn't usually trigger the right mindset to invest in an IPO,"" one senior European equity capital markets banker told Reuters.

1243,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2022 03:11AM ET</span>",Potential investors in India LIC's giant IPO fret over govt control of insurer -sources,"By Nupur Anand, Aftab Ahmed and Scott Murdoch
MUMBAI (Reuters) - Prospective investors in Life Insurance Corp of India's (LIC) $8 billion IPO are seeking assurances from company management that it will not sacrifice their interests to meet the goals set out by the government, its controlling shareholder, sources said.
In virtual roadshows for India's biggest ever public listing, LIC management and the IPO bankers have been peppered with questions about the insurer's past investments and their quality, four people with knowledge of the matter said.
LIC has in recent years been a key buyer of shares in state-owned firms sold off by New Delhi, often bailing out less-than-successful public issues of shares. It has also been tapped to rescue struggling financial institutions.
Potential conflicts of interest issues are taking centre-stage in the IPO roadshows that began last week and are expected to go on till the end of the month, the sources said.
""The government tends to act as a regulator, manager and shareholder and it tends to get its position confused at different points of time,"" said Shriram Subramanian, founder of proxy advisory firm InGovern, who has not attended the roadshows.
""The government ministries may tend to think that LIC is 100% under their control and would like to exert that kind of an influence whenever required and that is a concern for investors,"" Subramanian added.
How effectively LIC and its investment bankers are able to address the investor concerns will help in determining the insurer's valuation in the float, and consequently the state of finances of the Indian government which is banking on proceeds from the IPO to plug an annual fiscal deficit hole.
The Finance Ministry did not respond to emails seeking comment while LIC declined. The sources declined to be identified as the discussions are private.
In its draft prospectus, the insurer cited involvement of the government, which owns 100% of LIC now and is expected to own about 95% after the IPO, as a risk factor and said that minority shareholders could be disadvantaged by government action.
LIC chairman M R Kumar told a news conference on Monday that potential investors should not worry about government control post the IPO as decisions are taken by its board and not by the government.
PARALLELS TO COAL INDIA?
LIC, which was formed six decades ago when India's insurance sector was nationalised, straddles the business in the country, with more than 280 million policies and over 60% of the insurance segment.
It is also a big investor, owning as of March last year 23.5 trillion rupees ($315 billion) worth of government securities, higher than even the central bank, out of the total central and state government securities worth 115.2 trillion rupees, according to the prospectus.
In 2019, it took over troubled IDBI Bank as the government struggled to find a viable buyer for the lender whose shares had tanked and nearly a third of its book had gone bad.
LIC said in its draft papers that it may have to infuse more capital into IDBI Bank even though it has been pursuing a buyer for its more than 50% stake in the lender.
Some market analysts and fund managers are drawing parallels of LIC with Coal India, which made its market debut in 2010 and, despite being a monopoly, has lost over half its equity value.
In its last earnings call, Coal India chairman and managing director Pramod Agrawal said one of the reasons for its current low market valuation could be because sometimes government takes steps that are not appreciated by shareholders. 

""If LIC makes decisions that are not beneficial for the shareholders then they will raise concerns,"" said Ashvin Parekh, an independent financial services consultant.
""We have seen that happen earlier when Children Investment Fund exited from state-owned Coal India after listing as it had concerns over what the majority shareholder was doing and LIC could also face similar pushbacks from its shareholders.""

1244,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2022 03:10AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Not so quiet on the Eastern front,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Sujata Rao
It was perhaps inevitable that Vladimir Putin would resort to the playbook similar to the one employed during the 2014 Crimea annexation, recognising as independent two breakaway Ukrainian regions then sending in the tanks.
As Western powers debate what kind of sanctions to impose, markets' reaction is predictable too. Asian stocks teed off with the worst session so far this year, Brent crude futures have jumped above $97 a barrel, European shares are opening lower and Wall Street futures are down as much as 2.5%.
The rouble has hurtled below 80 against the dollar.
There is also a dash for the usual safe-havens -- the bond rally has sent 10-year Treasury yields down 7 basis points while the Swiss franc and gold are at nearly one-month highs. 
But markets don't really seem to be in a ""sell anything risky"" mode. 
For one, a senior U.S. official said the deployment of Russian troops to the breakaway enclaves did not merit the harshest sanctions. Any measures should for now stop short of cutting off Russia's access to international payments systems.
Second, money markets have priced out chances of a 50 basis-point rate hike by the Federal Reserve in March. More policy easing may be on its way in China too; Finance Minister Liu Kun flagged bigger tax and fee cuts to support the economy.
Finally, remember, markets had more or less already priced a Russian incursion into the two eastern Ukrainian provinces; Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimates U.S. and European stocks already carried discounts of 5% and 8% respectively. Worst case? Further 6%-9% falls. But we are not there - yet. 
Away from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the earnings season continues. HSBC brought forward its profitability target by a year and more than doubled annual profits. Earnings from retailers Macy's (NYSE:M) and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) will show us what kind of mood the U.S. consumer is in; following blowout retail sales data last week, the figures could prove reassuring.

1245,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 22, 2022 03:00AM ET</span>",Elon Musk Laughed at the Idea of Tesla Using Too Much Water. Now It’s a Real Problem,"(Bloomberg) -- When Elon Musk was asked last year whether the factory Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. was constructing in Germany would deplete the area’s water supply, he broke out in bellowing laughter and called the notion “completely wrong.”
Six months later, water is one of the primary reasons the plant still isn’t producing vehicles.
While Musk in August flippantly pointed to water “everywhere” around Berlin, the region is suffering from falling groundwater levels and prolonged droughts due to climate change. That’s sparked a legal challenge that will go to court next week and an acknowledgment from local authorities that supplies won't suffice once Tesla ramps up the plant. The issue has the potential to further delay or even stop the 5 billion-euro ($5.7 billion) project in what could turn into a costly setback to the carmaker’s expansion.
“Tesla will increase the problem for sure,” said Irina Engelhardt, who heads the hydrogeology department at Berlin’s Technical University. “There might not be enough water for everyone.”
Ramping up the factory in the eastern state of Brandenburg is key to Tesla’s global ambitions. The carmaker needs a manufacturing base in Europe to supply the region’s fast-growing electric-vehicle market, which is expected to remain much bigger and more competitive than the U.S. for years to come. While Tesla has erected the plant at breakneck speed, it’s still waiting for final approval from local authorities just as Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), Mercedes-Benz AG and Stellantis NV broaden their own EV lineups.
“The current water supply is sufficient for the first stage of the factory,” Brandenburg Economy Minister Joerg Steinbach said in an interview. Once Tesla expands the site, “we’ll need more.”
Musk, 50, has been on a charm offensive to promote the plant Tesla has said will eventually produce batteries and as many as 500,000 cars annually. He has tweeted in German, rubbed shoulders with local politicians and threw an Oktoberfest-style county fair at the construction site in October. But he’s also frustrated authorities with several last-minute changes to the factory and sparked outrage in Germany last week for posting a meme evoking Adolf Hitler. The country’s vehicle regulator said this week it’s investigating one of Tesla’s driver-assistance features.
Much of the optimism about Tesla's growth prospects this year rests on the company's ability to get the factories it's been constructing near Berlin and Austin, Texas, up and running. When Credit Suisse analysts raised their share-price target to $1,025 from $830 last month, the first factor cited was capacity expansion. The Berlin plant “arguably serves as Tesla’s most critical incremental source of capacity,” the analysts led by Dan Levy wrote in the Jan. 18 report. Ramping it up should bolster supplies in a market that’s been “ground zero for the global EV inflection.”
German politicians have backed the investment because it promises thousands of new jobs in a region that has little heavy industry. Yet progress at the site in the small town of Gruenheide has been slower than hoped, with the pandemic, red tape and backlash from locals over water usage delaying the start of production by several months.
The Nabu and Gruene Liga groups sued Brandenburg’s environment office last year, saying it failed to take into account the impact of climate change when approving a 30-year permit to pump more groundwater for Tesla’s factory. Authorities say the issue is manageable and that they’re already looking for additional supplies. A decision in favor of the environmentalists would likely delay the plant’s opening and could derail it altogether. A first court hearing is scheduled for March 4.
Tesla and Brandenburg’s environment ministry, which is in charge of the office, didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Experts say some of the environmentalists' concerns are valid. Brandenburg’s water table has been dropping for the past three decades. Droughts in each of the past four years have resulted in wildfires and crop failures. Meteorologists are predicting more frequent heat waves, further weakening the ability of local soil to store rainfall.
Tesla’s factory would roughly double the amount of water consumed in the Gruenheide area, according to Axel Bronstert, a hydrology professor at the University of Potsdam. He said it’s “naive” to think reserves would suffice for both the factory and residents, and called the groundwater situation in Brandenburg “serious.”
Regardless of how judges rule in the case, the local water works will have to invest in new infrastructure including a wastewater treatment plant to ensure adequate supplies -- major engineering projects that authorities admit could take years.
“There are considerable delays in the processing of the necessary measures,” Andre Baehler, the head of the local WSE water works, said earlier this month during a Brandenburg parliamentary environment committee hearing.
Tesla flagged in its impact report last year that water is becoming increasingly scarce due to climate change. The company said it withdraws less water per vehicle produced than the majority of established carmakers, and that it’s taking steps at the German plant to further reduce usage.
As per a contract with local authorities, the Gruenheide site would get 1.4 million cubic meters of water annually -- enough for a city of around 40,000 people. Steinbach said that while he’s taking the environmental concerns very seriously, the large majority of the local population is in favor of the factory. Brandenburg authorities are backing efforts to drill for more water in the area and supplies could also be sourced from further away if necessary, he said.
But digging new wells probably won’t make the concerns disappear. Manuela Hoyer, who lives just a few miles from the factory, says Tesla is getting preferential treatment from local politicians even though it would make an already serious environmental issue worse.
“We’ve been told for years that we shouldn’t water our lawns,” Hoyer, who is active in a citizen’s initiative monitoring the project, said in an interview. “Then the world’s richest man comes along and gets everything he wants.”

1248,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2022 01:35AM ET</span>","HSBC says Hong Kong COVID clampdown may hurt ability to hire, keep staff","LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - HSBC said Hong Kong's strict curbs on travel and social interaction are hurting the economy and may impact the ability to hire and keep staff in the Asian financial hub, in one of the strongest comments yet by a global lender on the city's tough measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The evolving Covid-19 restrictions in Hong Kong, including travel, public gathering and social distancing restrictions, are impacting the Hong Kong economy, and may affect the ability to attract and retain staff,"" the lender said on Tuesday.
The comments came as the Asia-focused lender reported its annual profit more than doubled. It said, however, it expects a weaker performance in its wealth management business in Asia in the first quarter of this year.
Daily infections numbers in Hong Kong have risen sharply this year, reaching a record 7,533 cases on Monday, overwhelming the government's testing, hospital and quarantine capacities.
The Chinese territory is following Beijing's ""zero-COVID"" policy rather than adapting to life with the virus.
As a result of that policy, more expats are thinking of leaving, and global banks, asset managers and corporate law firms are facing up to many of their staff exiting after annual bonuses are paid out in the first three months of the year. 

Economists say that without unprecedented relief measures in Hong Kong's 2022-23 budget on Wednesday, it's hard to see how the economy can avoid contracting again after emerging last year out of its most prolonged recessions, which lasted from 2019 to 2020.
HSBC's comments came after Bill Winters, chief executive of Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), last week said the city's travel curbs could in the long run hurt its status as a financial hub compared to other regional centres.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Allianz has dismissed two asset managers who oversaw a group of investment funds that collapsed after racking up massive losses when the spread of coronavirus triggered wild market swings, according to regulatory filings.
The downfall of the $15 billion Structured Alpha funds has landed the German insurance company in hot water with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission, which are both investigating what went wrong. 
The funds were run by portfolio manager Greg Tournant, who had been with Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors since 2002, according to a profile that used to be on Allianz's website.
""(Tournant) was discharged for violation of firm policies designed to ensure compliance with industry regulations and standards relating to the preparation and provision of client communications,"" according to a filing on Dec. 13 by the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. 
Reuters reported in October that the DOJ was looking into possible misconduct by managers of the Structured Alpha funds and the misrepresentation of risk to investors.
Tournant did not immediately respond to a LinkedIn message seeking comment and has not responded to multiple previous efforts by Reuters to contact him. Allianz declined to comment.
A second Allianz employee, Stephen Bond-Nelson, was ""discharged for violation of firm compliance policies"", according to a separate filing. Reuters was unable to reach Bond-Nelson for comment.
Investors in the funds, which were predominantly U.S. public pension funds, have sued Allianz for a total of $6 billion in damages, though settlements have now been reached with some.
The Allianz funds used complex options strategies to generate returns but when the coronavirus pandemic sent stock markets into a tailspin in February and March 2020, they plummeted in value, in some cases by 80% or more. 
In their lawsuits, investors alleged Allianz had strayed from its stated investment strategy of hedging to limit potential losses.
The funds catered in particular to normally conservative U.S. pension funds, including those for labourers in Alaska, teachers in Arkansas and subway workers in New York.
Last week, Allianz announced a 3.7 billion euro ($4.2 billion) provision to deal with the fallout, pushing the company into a fourth-quarter loss and resulting in a cut in pay for its chief executive and other board members.
In a 2016 video reviewed by Reuters, Tournant likened Structured Alpha's strategy to insurance.

""Our strategies are not race cars looking to speed their way to high returns. They're four-wheel drive vehicles designed to tackle rough terrain,"" he said in separate marketing material.

(Reuters) -Steady sales of pacemakers and heart stents may have likely helped  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT) Plc offset weak demand for its other medical devices, in a quarter that saw an Omicron-led surge in COVID-19 cases and staffing crisis at most U.S. hospitals.
Overwhelmed by soaring infections and shortages of nurses and other healthcare workers, hospitals had to put off non-critical surgical procedures, denting demand for knee and spine implants made by companies such as Medtronic and Zimmer Biomet. 
""Medtronic has areas you know, for example, in cardiac surgery ... those procedures are not seeing delays, but in areas where we can defer like spine, spinal cord stimulation, that's where they're going to see more of an impact,"" said BTIG analyst Ryan Zimmerman.
""So it's less severe for Medtronic, but it's certainly generally going to lower their fiscal third-quarter 2022 numbers.""

THE CONTEXT 
** During its second quarter ended Oct. 29, the hit to sales of some of Medtronic's products such as its spinal devices, which rely on elective procedures, was offset by the strength in its business that sells critical implants including pacemakers and other heart devices.
** Smaller rivals Zimmer Biomet and Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE:EW) have said the pressure on elective procedures has continued early into the year.

** Medtronic, which reports results on Feb. 22, is expected to post third-quarter revenue of $7.88 billion, according to the mean estimate from 12 analysts, based on Refinitiv data
** Medtronic reported second-quarter revenue of $7.85 billion
WALL STREET SENTIMENT
** The current average rating on Medtronic shares is ""buy"", with six analysts rating it ""strong buy"", 15 ""buy"" and nine ""hold""

The developer is seeking to extend the maturities of about $1 billion of debt due this year because it may not have enough capital to meet its obligations, it said in an exchange filing late Monday. Worries about Zhenro may undermine the government’s efforts to stem financial contagion in the sector and further drive up financing costs for property firms that need to repay almost $100 billion of debt this year.
The heightened concerns about Zhenro come as the broader Chinese market is under pressure, with technology stocks dropping for a third day amid signs of a fresh crackdown on the sector. There’s still room for China to cut interest rates and the bank reserve requirement ratio, the China Securities Journal reported.
Key Developments:
China High-Yield Dollar Bonds Fall as Developer Worries Persist (10 a.m. HK)
Chinese high-yield dollar bonds fell 0.5 cent to 1 cent Tuesday morning, according to credit traders. Shimao Group Holdings Ltd.’s 6.125% bond due 2024 was indicated down 0.6 cent on the dollar at 43 cents, Bloomberg-compiled prices show as of 9:54 a.m. in Hong Kong.
Zhenro’s 5.98% dollar note due April was indicated slightly lower on Tuesday morning at 19.6 cents on the dollar, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. 
China Tells Banks, SOEs to Report Exposure to Jack Ma’s Ant (9:26 a.m. HK)
Chinese authorities told the nation’s biggest state-owned firms and banks to start a fresh round of checks on their financial exposure and other links to Ant Group Co., renewing scrutiny of billionaire Jack Ma’s financial empire, according to people familiar with the matter.
Multiple regulators, including the banking watchdog, recently told institutions under their oversight to closely examine all exposure they had to Ant, its subsidiaries and even its shareholders up to January, said the people, asking not to be identified as the matter is private. 
Yango Group Bondholders to Meet After Dollar Bonds Default (9:12 a.m. HK)
Holders of Yango Group’s 6.92% yuan bond due 2025 will hold a meeting on Feb. 28 after two dollar bonds default triggered cross-protection clauses, according to a statement on Chinamoney.com.cn. 
Developer Zhenro Proposes Maturity Extension With Bond Swap (6:20 a.m. HK)
Zhenro is proposing a maturity extension on five dollar and yuan notes due in 2022 for new bonds, which would mature March 2023 and bear interest of 8% per annum. The developer said that if it can’t complete its exchange offer and consent solicitation, it may not be able to repay some of the debt and meet its financial commitments. 
The proposal comes days after Zhenro asked bondholders to waive any default claims that may arise from a failed redemption of a $200 million perpetual note on March 5. That prompted Fitch Ratings to cut Zhenro’s long-term debt rating to C from B, saying the request amounted to a “distressed debt exchange.” Moody’s Investors Service followed suit. 
China May Cut Interest Rate, Reserve Ratio Further: Sec. Journal (6:51 a.m. HK)
There is still room for China to cut interest rates and the bank reserve requirement ratio, although the urgency of monetary easing has declined following a major increase in credit supply in January, China Securities Journal says in a front-page report, citing analysts.

1253,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 21, 2022 09:55PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Down, Oil Soars Over Ukraine Tensions","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Tuesday morning following Russia’s troops into breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine, intensifying tensions between the West and Russia over Ukraine. Oil surged to a seven-year high.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.09% by 9:44 PM ET (2:44 AM GMT). The safe-haven yen edged about 0.2% higher early in Asia to a nearly three-week high of 114.50 per dollar.
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 1.86%. The Bank of Korea will hand down its policy decision on Thursday.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 1.34%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 2.81%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 1.13% while the Shenzhen Component was down 1.73%. The People’s Bank of China’s released the loan prime rate on Monday, which stayed unchanged at 3.7%.
Russia president Vladimir Putin recognized Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, and ordered Russian troops to “maintain peace” in the two breakaway regions on Monday.
The U.S. and Europe vowed new sanctions against Russia’s move, but it was not clear whether the West will see the military action as the start of a full-scale invasion.
“We are much closer to military intervention, which of course is going to drive a lot of the risk off sentiment in the markets,” Carlos Casanova, senior Asia economist at UBP, told Reuters. He added the short-term volatility in markets was “relentless”, led by both geopolitical factors and the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Casanova said the move would lead to higher oil prices, an equity sell off, and people flocking to safe-haven assets like the Japanese yen.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell as much as 5.5 basis points to 1.8715%. Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said on Monday she will keep an eye on the economic data over the next three weeks to determine whether it is necessary to raise the interest rate by a half percentage point at the central bank's next meeting in March.
On the data front, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will hand down its policy decision on Wednesday."

BEAUMONT, Texas (Reuters) -Union workers locked out of their jobs at a Texas oil refinery for nearly 10 months voted on Monday to accept an  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) contract offer, ceding to a key company demand that it have the right to determine plant assignments.
About 600 United Steelworkers union members at the 369,024 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery and Mobil 1 motor oil plant were locked out May 1 to preclude a wildcat strike, Exxon has said. The Beaumont, Texas, facility has continued to run since with managers and temporary workers.
The contract allows Exxon to decide all assignments, an issue that led to a rejection vote in October. A quarter of assignments previously were determined by worker seniority. The contract also adds Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a paid holiday. 
Exxon said it was ""thrilled"" by the vote, adding employees would return to work ""as soon as safely possible."" The contract was made effective from Feb. 1, 2021. 
The six-year contract was approved by a vote of 214 to 133, according to USW International representative Bryan Gross. 
""The membership decided to accept the offer after 10 months of a fight,"" Gross said. ""The company started the lockout; they can end it at any time."" USW local 13-243 intends to continue with an unfair labor practices complaint, Gross said. The USW has alleged Exxon imposed the lockout to force removal of the union. 

Also to be decided is whether the USW will continue to represent the plant's hourly workers. The U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) oversaw a vote in November and December on removing the USW, a move sought by 30% of union members. 
Before the Beaumont workers can return to work, the two sides must negotiate an agreement that sets rules for returning employees. Preliminary talks on the agreement began last week.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian grocer  Coles Group  (OTC:CLEGF) Ltd said December half profit fell in line with analysts' forecasts as cost controls offset COVID-19 disruptions, adding that an explosion of household savings would enable people to keep shopping despite inflation.
The first-half result suggests the No. 2 supermarket chain outperformed larger rival Woolworths Group Ltd at a time when many staff have had to isolate and supply chain pressures have left shelves understocked with elevated prices on some products. Coles shares jumped 4%.
Coles and Woolworths, which collectively sell about two-thirds of Australian groceries, benefited initially from a rush of ""pantry loading"" as pandemic-related restrictions prompted people to spend more time at home.
But they are also among Australia's biggest employers and rising COVID-19 case numbers saw high numbers of frontline, warehouse and delivery staff forced to isolate, driving up costs and limiting the ability to restock shelves.
For Coles, net profit dipped 2% to A$549 million in the six months, broadly in line with analysts' forecasts and including costs associated with an automated distribution system it is building. Pre-tax profit from supermarkets, where it makes most of its money, declined 0.8%, while profit from liquor and service stations fell more.
""Coles seems to have managed a difficult trading period well relative to Woolworths,"" said Barrenjoey analysts in a client note, which noted that Woolworths had previously flagged a larger decline in grocery sales for the same period.
Shares of Coles hit their highest intraday level in six weeks, while the broader Australian market fell 1%. Shares of Woolworths, which reports first-half results on Wednesday, were up 1.7% by mid-session.
Coles CEO said shelf prices of some products, like red meat, were heightened, but prices of other items like apples and avocados were unusually low because of favourable growing conditions.
""We have seen further cost price pressure coming through in the early part of this half and we expect that to continue, based on both local and global input prices and various supply chain costs including the cost of oil"", he said on an analyst call.
""I would expect own-brand penetration to continue to increase for those who are looking for value, but equally we should recognise that there's more than A$100 billion in consumer bank accounts than there was pre-Covid.""

Coles declared an interim dividend of 33 Australian cents per share, in-line with last year.

1256,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2022 08:31PM ET</span>",Futures tumble as Putin recognizes Ukraine rebel regions,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures tumbled on Monday after Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, increasing concerns about a major war.
Putin described Ukraine as an integral part of Russia's history, with eastern Ukraine made up of ancient Russian lands, and he was confident the Russian people would support his decision.
S&P 500 e-mini futures fell 1.53%. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures fell 1.26% and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures fell 2.15%.
Under treaties signed with the separatist leaders by Putin that were submitted for ratification by parliament, Russia has acquired the right to build military bases in Ukraine's two breakaway regions.
U.S. stock markets were closed on Monday for the Presidents' Day holiday. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine was committed to peace and diplomacy, accusing Russia of ruining peace talks, and ruled out making any territorial concessions in an address to the nation.
Putin ordered the Russian army to launch what Moscow called a peacekeeping operation in the area and a Reuters witness saw columns of military vehicles, including tanks, on the outskirts of Donetsk.
In response, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order for a halt to all U.S. economic activity in the breakaway regions and a ban on import of all goods from those areas as well as investment there. Britain also vowed to impose sanctions while Japan's Yomiuri newspaper reported Tokyo will likely join U.S.-led sanctions.
""This infighting has been going on since 2014 and Russia has been supporting them without necessarily recognizing them as republics, today he formalized it so that now ramps it up again,"" said Ken Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors in Boca Raton, Florida.
""The markets are going to react and if Russia pushes to invade then all the threats that have been made, like the sanctions, go into effect.""
Oil prices rose as the Ukraine news exacerbated existing supply concerns that have pushed prices near $100 a barrel. The S&P energy sector has been by far the best performer in 2022, up nearly 22%, and one of only two S&P sectors that are positive on the year.
Gold gained ground as investors moved away from risky assets, touching $1,913.89 per ounce, its highest since June 1. 
U.S. equity markets have been under pressure in recent weeks as rising inflation has put the Federal Reserve on a path to tightening its monetary policy, likely to begin at its March meeting, while simmering tensions in Ukraine have grown.
Later in the week, personal consumption expenditures data will be released and is likely to cement expectations the central bank will begin raising interest rates next month. 

Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said on Monday that she will assess incoming economic data over the next three weeks in deciding whether a half percentage point interest rate rise at the central bank's next meeting in March is needed, highlighting the division among policymakers about how aggressive to be in starting to tighten policy.
The benchmark S&P 500 dropped for a second straight week on Friday, and is down 9.3% from its Jan. 3 record closing high, just shy of correction territory, commonly viewed as a drop of 10% from a high.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors were bracing for a torrid day for Russian, Ukrainian and wider global markets when they reopen on Tuesday, after Vladimir Putin upped the ante in a crisis the West fears could unleash a major war.
In a lengthy televised address, the Russian president recognised two breakaway regions Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine as independent entities and described Ukraine as an integral part of Russia's history.
Tensions have already rattled global markets this year and wiped tens of billions of dollars off the value of Russian and Ukraine assets, but Monday's escalation is expected to cause much worse.
""It is probably an understatement to say that it will be an ugly day (on the markets) tomorrow,"" said Viktor Szabo, an emerging market portfolio manager at abrdn in London.
""I was hoping we weren't going to get here, but this is a significant step.""
Russian markets were still open when Putin announced his decision live on television following phone calls to the leaders of Germany and France.
The rouble losses reached 3.3%, while Moscow's stock markets plunged to their lowest level in over a year as the dollar-denominated RTS index finished the day 13.2% lower and the rouble-based MOEX Russian index lost 10.5%.
Analysts at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) warned traders ahead of the start of Tuesday's Asian open that Putin's decision to recognise the separatist-held areas of Ukraine would clearly exacerbate already high tensions  
""Financial market participants now wait for a response from the United States and Europe,"" they added.
That response is expected to come in the shape of tough new sanctions. 
Although other steps might come first, some of the most severe measures would be to cut Russia's banks off from the SWIFT banking system and order a complete ban on EU, UK and U.S. investment funds holding Russian government bonds. 
At the end of last year foreigners held just over $43 billion of OFZs, as Russia's rouble-denominated bonds are known.
""We agreed (Britain) and (the EU) will coordinate to deliver swift sanctions against Putin’s regime, and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine,"" British Foreign Minister Liz Truss said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) following a call with European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. 
GRAPHIC: Russia Ukraine CDS - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klvykmxlqvg/Pasted%20image%201645485094587.png 
FUTURES SLUMP
Yields on Russia's 10-year OFZs were expected to surge further having hit a high of 10.6% on Monday. Russia has one of the biggest stockpiles of international FX reserves in the world at $630 billion, but the cost of insuring its sovereign debt against default has also soared to its highest since early 2016.
Analysts were also warning of the wider impact on global market confidence, which along with the pressures of fast-rising global borrowing costs this year, has already been hit by the tensions.
Futures markets were pointing to a 1.8% fall on the S&P 500 on Wall Street later, a 2.2% drop on Japan's Nikkei, a 2.5% drop on the Nasdaq and 3.7% slump on Germany's DAX in Europe. Demand for traditional safe assets also saw U.S. Treasuries rally.
""This step clearly increases uncertainty and thus creates further downside risk for global risk assets,"" said Manik Narain, head of emerging market strategy at UBS.

""We are going to see a negative reaction,"" added Ken Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors in Florida. ""We are going to test the Jan. 24 lows which was 4,220 on the S&P 500"".

TOKYO (Reuters) -SoftBank Group Corp is likely to trim its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), an analyst said on Tuesday, as the Japanese tech conglomerate invests in unlisted startups through its second Vision Fund and repurchases its shares.
SoftBank sold 20 million Alibaba shares in the last quarter and ""will need to sell more in 2022,"" Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a note.
The group will need $40 billion-45 billion of cash this year, Goyal estimates, if it maintains the current pace of investing in startups and share repurchases as part of the 1 trillion yen ($8.7 billion) programme announced in November. 
SoftBank is prioritising Vision Fund 2, which has taken stakes in more than 200 companies including recent investments in AI software firm 6sense, digital financing platform Funding Societies and cryptocurrency business Polygon.
While earlier this month SoftBank said there was no link between Alibaba registering a U.S. share facility and any plan to sell down its stake, the group is under pressure to trim stakes following the collapse of the deal to sell chip designer Arm to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
""We will definitely be selling a good chunk of assets,"" SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son told analysts earlier this month, pointing to options including the public Vision Fund portfolio, where many assets are trading below their listing price.
The conglomerate, which was forced to sell Arm after it was hit by falling valuations during the COVID-19 pandemic, hopes to list the British firm in New York.
SoftBank's loan-to-value ratio rose to 22% at December-end from 19% three months earlier. When additional borrowing is included the ratio is closer to 30%, Goyal estimates. 
A successful Arm listing will give the group more dry powder for options including buybacks, Son said, amid executive frustration over the group's persistent conglomerate discount. 

""It's a big buyback time now,"" Son said in a recent English language video aimed at investors.

The Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) says the iPhone maker is abusing a dominant market position by failing to allow software application makers in the Netherlands to use other payment methods for dating apps accessible via its App Store.
The ACM has been levying weekly fines of 5 million euros since Apple missed a Jan. 15 deadline to make changes that the watchdog had mandated.
It said the U.S. company had not made any new proposal to comply with its ruling in the past week.
""We have clearly explained to Apple how they can comply...,"" the watchdog said in a statement. ""So far, however, they have refused to put forward any serious proposals."" Apple declined comment on Monday.
Apple's App Store requirement that app developers exclusively use its payment system with commissions of 30% has come under scrutiny in several countries, most recently the United States.
In blog posts, Apple indicated it complied with the Dutch ruling by allowing dating app makers there to submit a new app with alternative payment methods enabled.
Apple said it still intends to charge a 27% commission on any in-app payments it does not process, only slightly below the 30% it charges on those it does process.

The ACM has rejected Apple's moves as putting an unreasonable burden on software developers and not amounting to compliance.
Neither Apple nor the ACM have commented on whether any of the weekly fines have been paid, but it is understood that all are still outstanding.

UniCredit said the aim was to give smaller businesses access to products and services developed by its corporate solutions division, such as advisory or capital markets access.
The new streamlined structure will be led by Massimiliano Mastalia, who joined the group in November after previous roles at BNL, the Italian arm of BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), and as co-founder of instant-lending fintech Prestatech.
Under the previous set-up, UniCredit's Italian corporate division served companies with revenues of at least 5 million euros ($5.7 million).
Smaller businesses belonged, like individuals, to the bank's retail division, while very large firms fell under the investment banking arm.
Italian companies are typically very small. Some 98% of firms have fewer than 10 staff. 
Reporting to Mastalia, Francesco Iannella will lead the small business segment for companies with a turnover of up to 50 million euros.
Lucio Izzi will be in charge of companies with up to 1 billion euros in revenues as head of corporate. Marica Campilongo will be responsible for Unicredit (MI:CRDI)'s largest corporate clients.

The so-called FAANGs have seen some of their COVID-era surges cut back this year, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) down 38%, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) down 5.7%, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) down 8.5% and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) down 35% and 10% respectively..
JPMorgan's analysts estimate that on average tech firms that are yet to even make a profit have lost 30% of their value since peaks around September last year, while 'fintech' firms which focus on tech-savvy banking apps and tools have dropped 40%.
""As Growth stocks weakened of late, they derated, but are still not outright cheap,"" JPMorgan's analysts said in a note to clients, adding that banks and commodity-linked stocks which have rallied this year thanks to rising oil and metals prices or interest rates were still ""far from expensive"".
The chance is that the earnings of 'growth' sectors might not be exceptional anymore, although the big driver remains bond market borrowing costs, which have shot up this year as top central banks have laid the groundwork for interest rate rises.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks hit three-week lows and oil rose on Monday as worries increased that Russia will invade Ukraine.
Russian forces killed a group of five saboteurs who breached the country's southwest border from Ukraine on Monday, news agencies quoted the military as saying, an accusation that Kyiv dismissed as the latest in a series of fakes.
Kyiv and the West fear that a border incident near eastern Ukraine could be used as a pretext for Moscow to attack its neighbour. Russia denies such plans.
Markets are on high alert for any escalation in the crisis.
MSCI's world equity index fell 0.4% to 700.11, with Monday's public holiday in the United States, which will keep Wall Street closed, thinning trade and adding to the volatility.
S&P 500 stock futures fell 0.66%. Nasdaq futures dropped 1.2%. 
European stocks dropped 1.65% to their lowest in more than four months. British stocks fell 0.5%. Shares in companies exposed to Russia and Ukraine fell heavily.
U.S. stock futures and European stocks lost earlier gains made on news that U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin had agreed in principle to hold a summit on the Ukraine crisis. 
The Kremlin said there were no concrete plans in place for a summit, though a call or meeting could be set up at any time. 
""The Kremlin made clear today that they are in no rush for a summit with Biden,"" said Tim Ash, strategist at BlueBay Asset Management.
British foreign minister Liz Truss said she was stepping up preparations with allies for a worst-case scenario, adding that a Russian invasion of Ukraine was highly likely.
In a reminder of the stakes, Reuters reported Biden had prepared a package of sanctions that includes barring U.S. financial institutions from processing transactions for major Russian banks.
The rouble slid nearly 3% against the dollar and Russian shares slumped 9% their lowest in 14 months.
The U.S. dollar index dipped 0.1% to 95.668, well short of a 1-1/2 year high of 97.441 hit last month. 
The euro was little changed at $1.1327, while yields on German 10-year government bonds, seen as Europe's safest asset, hit two-week lows at 0.185%. [FRX/]
A preliminary Purchasing Managers' Index survey showed the euro zone economy rebounded sharply this month as an easing of coronavirus restrictions gave a boost to the dominant service industry.
""A Russian invasion of Ukraine would make the job of central banks across Europe much harder,"" said Matteo Cominetta, senior economist at Barings Investment Institute.
""Investors should position for even higher uncertainty and probability of policy mistakes."" 
Markets are also expecting aggressive policy tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve as inflation runs rampant. The Fed's favoured measure of core inflation is due out later this week and is forecast to show an annual rise of 5.1% - the fastest pace since the early 1980s.
At least six Fed officials are set to speak this week and markets will be hyper-sensitive to their views on a possible hike of 50 basis points in March.
Recent commentary has leant against such a drastic step and futures have scaled back the chance of a half-point rise to around 20% from well above 50% a week ago.
In oil markets, Brent crude rose by $1 to $94.41 on the Ukraine crisis, while U.S. crude also gained $1 to $91.98.
Oil had suffered its first weekly loss in two months last week, taking it off seven-year highs, amid signs of progress on an Iran deal that could release new supply into the market. 

Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said ""significant progress"" had been made in talks to revive Iran's 2015 nuclear agreement on Monday after a senior European Union official said on Friday that a deal was ""very, very close"". [O/R]

1265,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2022 03:50PM ET</span>",Trump's Truth Social tops downloads on Apple App Store; many waitlisted,"By Kenneth Li, Julia Love and Helen Coster
(Reuters) -Donald Trump's new social media venture, Truth Social, launched late on Sunday in Apple's App Store, potentially marking the former president's return to social media after he was banned from several platforms last year. 
The app was available shortly before midnight ET and was the top free app available on the App Store early Monday. Truth Social was automatically downloaded to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices belonging to users who had pre-ordered the app.
Many users reported either having trouble registering for an account or were added to a waitlist with a message: ""Due to massive demand, we have placed you on our waitlist."" 
The app has been available for people invited to use it during its test phase, Reuters previously reported.
Trump was banned from  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters, after he was accused of posting messages inciting violence.
Led by former Republican U.S. Representative Devin Nunes, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the venture behind Truth Social, joins a growing portfolio of technology companies that are positioning themselves as champions of free speech and hope to draw users who feel their views are suppressed on more established platforms. 
So far none of the newer companies, which include Twitter competitors Gettr and Parler and video site Rumble, have come close to matching the popularity of their mainstream counterparts. 
""This week we will begin to roll out on the Apple App Store. That's going to be awesome, because we're going to get so many more people that are going to be on the platform,"" Nunes said in a Sunday appearance on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo"".
""Our goal is, I think we're going to hit it, I think by the by the end of March we're going to be fully operational at least within the United States,"" he added.
Truth Social's app store page detailing its version history showed the first public version of the app, or version 1.0 was available a day ago, confirming a Reuters report. The current version 1.0.1 includes ""bug fixes,"" according to the page.
DRUMMING SUPPORT
On Friday, Nunes was on the app urging users to follow more accounts, share photos and videos and participate in conversations, in an apparent attempt to drum up activity, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. 
Among Nunes' posts, he welcomed a new user who appeared to be a Catholic priest and encouraged him to invite more priests to join, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. 
Even as details of the app begin trickling out, TMTG remains mostly shrouded in secrecy and is regarded with skepticism by some in tech and media circles. It is unclear, for example, how the company is funding its current growth. 
TMTG is planning to list in New York through a merger with blank-check firm Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC) and stands to receive $293 million in cash that DWAC holds in a trust, assuming no DWAC shareholder redeems their shares, TMTG said in an Oct. 21 press release. 

Additionally, in December TMTG raised $1 billion committed financing from private investors; that money also will not be available until the DWAC deal closes.
Digital World's activities have come under scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, according to a regulatory filing, and the deal is likely months away from closing.

1266,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2022 03:36PM ET</span>","Rouble sinks, stocks plunge as Russia recognises Ukraine breakaway regions","By Alexander Marrow
MOSCOW (Reuters) -The rouble tanked on Monday, slipping past 80 against the dollar, while stocks plunged to their lowest in over a year as Russian President Vladimir Putin called for the immediate recognition of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.
Putin signed a decree recognising the breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, upping the ante in a regional crisis the West fears could erupt into war.
The rouble fell to as low as 80.0650 against the dollar during Putin's lengthy televised address to the Russian nation but pared some losses as Putin announced his decision, which he said would find support among Russian people.
The sharp drop in the rouble from levels around 70 to the greenback seen just four months ago is expected to fuel already high inflation, one of the main concerns among Russians, which would dent the country's already falling living standards.
By 1956 GMT, the rouble fell 2.7% to 79.37 against the dollar. It had been as strong as 76.1450 earlier in the session.
Against the euro, the rouble had lost 2.6% to 89.79 after hitting 90.7850, a level last seen in April 2021.
No Russian assets were left unscathed, with stocks cascading to their lowest since early November 2020 and bond yields, which move inversely to prices, soaring to their highest since January 2016. 
The dollar-denominated RTS index finished the day 13.2% lower at 1,207.5 points and the rouble-based MOEX Russian index lost 10.5% to 3,036.9 points.
Yields on Russia's 10-year benchmark OFZ bonds hit a high of 10.64%. The cost of insuring Russia sovereign debt against default also surged to its highest since early 2016 and both Moscow and Kyiv's sovereign dollar bonds tumbled.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said it now seemed plausible that geopolitical risks in the Ukraine-Russia standoff were starting to have a meaningful impact on global assets.
Comparing the rouble with its high-yielding emerging market peers was a good measure of the amount of risk premium still priced into the rouble, they said. 
""On that basis, our latest estimates would put the risk premium from recent escalation at 9% based on Friday’s closing prices,"" Goldman Sachs said.
DIPLOMACY VS. SANCTIONS
The prospect of a possible summit between Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden, as well as upcoming talks between the United States and Russia's top diplomats on Feb. 24, had given investors a glimmer of hope earlier in the session. 
Despite Moscow's repeated denials of Western statements saying that it plans to invade neighbouring Ukraine, Russian assets have been hammered by fears of a military conflict that would almost certainly trigger sweeping new Western sanctions against Moscow.
Washington has prepared an initial package of sanctions against Russia that includes barring U.S. financial institutions from processing transactions for major Russian banks, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Shares of Russia's top banks Sberbank and VTB fell 20% and 17% respectively, underperforming the wider market. 
Oil major Rosneft's shares also dropped 13.3%.

He added he expects M&A volume to be stable in 2022 compared to last year, as Brazilian companies will use proceeds of large share issues last year to acquire rivals.
Despite higher volatility, some transactions are going well in the equity capital markets, Guimaraes said. Local investors are more cautious, but foreigners are coming back to the markets and some selected IPOs may be completed, he added.

The slower activity in equity capital markets this year is expected to be offset by growth in fixed income and more business in the agricultural division, with the sale of more credit instruments, funds specific to the industry and more trading activity. 
Itau BBA plans to hire up to 120 people in the agriculture division, and rise its total headcount in the unit by 200 people from the current 2,100 employees, its CEO Flavio Souza said.

1270,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2022 12:36PM ET</span>",Financial think-tank calls for regulated ESG ratings in Britain,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain should regulate sustainability ratings on companies to improve transparency, reduce the risk of greenwashing and protect investors, a regulatory research body said on Monday.
The wall of money going into environmental, social and governance (ESG) funds has raised concerns among regulators about greenwashing, when sustainability credentials are exaggerated to attract investor cash.
The International Regulatory Strategy Group (IRSG) said in a report that the use of ratings was growing fast and investors needed confidence that the market was operating with a high degree of integrity.
""While ESG ratings provide just one interpretation of the many sources of ESG data available to portfolio managers, the growing significance of ESG ratings products across both equity and fixed-income markets cannot be understated,"" the IRSG said.
At the moment, asset managers typically use largely unregulated ratings on a company's ESG credentials to pick stocks on behalf of investors and pension funds.
The IRSG, sponsored by TheCityUK and the City of London Corporation, called for a principles-based and proportionate set of rules which dovetail with global efforts to bring consistency and standardisation to data and protect investors.
""The IRSG believes that regulation of ESG ratings is now desirable, to provide more transparency around the basis for ESG ratings and mitigate against potential conduct risk,"" it said.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority consulted last year on whether there should be voluntary ""best practice"" guidance for ESG raters or binding regulation, with the outcome due this year.
The European Union's securities watchdog, ESMA, is also studying the sector ahead of potential EU regulation, while global securities body IOSCO set out its first global framework last November to prise open the ""black box"" of ESG ratings.

The IRSG said a global approach was needed to avoid fragmentation in rules which would bump up compliance costs.
""Increased efforts are required to improve the quality, consistency, and availability of the underlying data to ensure market confidence in ESG products,"" said the report produced with consultants Accenture (NYSE:ACN).

LONDON (Reuters) -Global markets are already pricing chunky geopolitical risks, but there is scope for risk premia to rise further across all sectors, if a conflict breaks out between Russia and Ukraine, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists said in a note on Monday.
Current market levels imply a 5% discount is already priced into U.S. stocks, while European stocks carry an 8% geo-political discount, Goldman wrote. It estimated the U.S. 10-year Treasury discount at 25 basis points and 2% on the euro.
It said gold was trading at a 5% premium.
Goldman Sachs strategists said that while this discount would evaporate if tensions ease, a flare-up would boost geopolitical risk premia further. They based their forecasts for global market falls on how much the rouble would depreciate.
""On that basis, the rouble is still more than 10% away from its maximum undervaluation level of the past two decades,"" analysts Dominic Wilson, Ian Tomb and Kamakshya Trivedi told clients.
""This is likely to be a conservative benchmark, however, given that this past undervaluation came in 2014/15 at a time of collapsing oil prices and weak external balances.""
In that scenario, U.S. stocks would fall more than 6% and European stocks decline more than 9%, the U.S. investment bank said.

Peter Kinsella, global head of FX strategy at UBP, agreed that the market has already priced in a certain deterioration in the situation. ""The surprise element isn't there to the extent it was some time ago"".
Given where the oil price is, the rouble should be 65-66 versus the dollar, but it is currently around 79 per dollar, while European equities too are pricing ""an awful lot"", he said.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) is looking to sell its stakes in three oil and gas fields in Equatorial Guinea, hoping a recent rally in energy prices will help attract buyers, three industry sources told Reuters. 
The U.S. company acquired the assets in the west African country as part of the $13 billion acquisition of  Noble Energy  (NASDAQ:NBL) in 2020.
Chevron has hired investment bank Jefferies to run the sale process which could raise as much as $1 billion, the sources said.
Chevron declined to comment. Jefferies declined to comment.
The decision to sell the Equatorial Guinea assets comes as Chevron focuses on its most profitable production hubs including the U.S. Permian shale basin and Kazakhstan, the sources said.
With oil prices at their highest in seven years and a strong demand outlook, the world's top oil and gas companies are hoping to attract smaller buyers, such as private equity-backed producers, to ageing and non-core assets.
Chevron holds a 38% interest in the Aseng oilfield and the Yolanda natural gas field in Equatorial Guinea's Block 1 as well as a 45% interest in the Alen gas and condensate field in Block O. It operates the three fields.

The company expanded its presence in Equatorial Guinea in December when it signed a production-sharing agreement for an offshore block in the Douala Basin.
The Equatorial Guinea assets added 441 billion cubic feet of natural gas to Chevron's reserves in 2020, according to its annual report.

Media outlets published the results of investigations into a leak of data on thousands of accounts held at the bank in past decades and said they appeared to show clients included human rights abusers and businessmen under sanctions.
Credit Suisse said it strongly rejected any allegations of wrongdoing and that the media reports were based on ""partial, inaccurate or selective information taken out of context"".
The European People's Party (EPP), the conservative grouping which holds the biggest number of seats in the European Parliament, called on the EU Commission on Monday to ""re-evaluate Switzerland as a high-risk money-laundering country"" as part of the next review of the list.
The European Commission, which is responsible for drafting and reviewing the list, declined to comment on the EPP's statement. A spokesperson pointed to the fact that the list was updated last month and no time had been set for the next review.
""Today, Switzerland meets all international standards on the exchange of information in tax matters and on fighting against money laundering, terrorist financing and corruption,"" the finance ministry's State Secretariat for International Finance said in an emailed statement.
""The 'Swiss Secrets' findings point to massive shortcomings of Swiss banks when it comes to the prevention of money laundering,"" the EPP's coordinator on economic affairs Markus Ferber said.
""When Swiss banks fail to apply international anti-money laundering standards properly, Switzerland itself becomes a high-risk jurisdiction,"" he added.

""Apparently, Credit Suisse has a policy of looking the other way instead of asking difficult questions,"" Ferber said. When asked about the group's statement, the bank said it had nothing to add.
The EU list currently comprises over 20 countries who are deemed to have shortfalls in their rules and practices against money laundering. Among them are Iran, Myanmar, Syria and North Korea. No European country is on the list.

The General Administration of Customs, in a post published on Sunday on its website, referred to a Feb. 18 notice issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that cautioned consumers against buying or eating certain batches of baby formula products made by Abbott.
The day before, Abbott said it was recalling powdered baby formulas, including Similac, made at a Michigan facility after four consumers complained about bacterial infections in infants who consumed them.
China Customs said while the affected formula products were not directly sold in China, some consumers who may have bought them from abroad via cross-border e-commerce should stop using them. 
One item, however, a Similac human milk fortifier which was affected by the issue, had been sold in China and Abbott had issued a voluntary recall of the affected batch, it added. 
Abbott, whose shares fell about 3.1% on Monday, said in a statement it had issued a recall for a batch from the Michigan factory and that other items it sold in China were not affected. 

Following the post by China Customs, other countries have called on consumers to stop using some Abbott formula products.
The Omani Ministry of Health on Monday warned against using two Abbott baby milk powder formulas due to potential bacterial contamination. Oman's statement followed a similar warning from the Saudi Food and Drug Authority concerning three baby milk powders made by Abbott, according to Saudi state news.

1278,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2022 10:36AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse on the defensive after dirty money data leak,"By Michael Shields and Francois Murphy
ZURICH/VIENNA (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) was plunged into a dirty money scandal on Monday after media outlets reported the Swiss bank had managed accounts for human rights abusers, fraudsters and businessmen who had been placed under sanctions.
One person leaked information on the accounts, which were held in decades ranging from the 1940s to 2010s, to Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung. The German daily then shared it with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and 46 other news organisations including the New York Times, Britain's Guardian and France's Le Monde.
The Panama Papers-style investigations were published on Sunday and come as Credit Suisse, which denies any wrongdoing, tries to shake off a series of risk-management scandals and a 1.6 billion Swiss franc ($1.75 billion) loss in 2021 that has pummelled its stock.
The New York Times said the leaked data covered more than 18,000 accounts collectively holding more than $100 billion.
The revelations also turned the spotlight on Switzerland only a little more than three years after it ditched, under U.S. pressure, a centuries-old culture of secrecy that had made the Alpine state a global no-questions-asked vault for the world’s rich.
""For CS, even if the allegations are unfounded, this raises questions about its business practices in wealth management and should tie up management having to spend time fighting fires instead of moving forward,"" RBC analysts said.
Shares in Credit Suisse, which fell by almost a quarter last year, were almost 3% lower by mid-afternoon.
""Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations about the bank's purported business practices,"" the bank said in a statement issued on Sunday night in response to the consortium's reports.
Switzerland's financial watchdog, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) which in 2018 rapped Credit Suisse for deficiencies in fighting money laundering, said it was in contact with the bank about the matter.
""Compliance with money laundering regulations has been a focus of our supervisory activities for years now,"" a FINMA spokesperson said.
After a call from members of the European Parliament to review Switzerland's banking practices and perhaps include the country in the EU's dirty-money blacklist, the finance ministry's State Secretariat for International Finance said in an emailed statement that the country meets ""all international standards on the exchange of information in tax matters and on fighting against money laundering, terrorist financing and corruption"".
It added that Switzerland was now participating in the automatic exchange of information on account data with more than 100 countries. 
Credit Suisse described the issue as ""predominantly historical"", adding that information had been taken out of context.
The bank said it had received numerous inquiries from the consortium in the past three weeks and reviewed many of the accounts. 
""Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015,"" it said. 
The bank said that it was satisfied with its checks on the remaining accounts.

""The Swiss financial centre has no interest in money of dubious origin. It attaches the greatest importance to the maintenance of its reputation and integrity,"" the Swiss Bankers Association said.

FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - A steep drop in hydrogen shares is likely to hit the valuation of Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG)'s hydrogen unit Nucera, according to investor and financial sources, which could make it more challenging to list the division in a potential share sale.
Putting a value on Nucera has been a challenge from the get-go, with analysts giving a range of 3 billion to 6 billion euros ($3.4 billion to $6.8 billion) for the business, reflecting the uncertainty relating to the booming hydrogen sector.
""The prices investors are prepared to pay for such assets have come down,"" said Ingo Speich, head of sustainability and corporate governance at Deka Investment, a top-20 shareholder of Thyssenkrupp.
""It's not because the quality of the asset has changed, but due to the changed market conditions and the fact that these business models are no longer valued that highly.""
Shares in Nucera's rivals have slumped, with Norway's NEL ASA, Britain's ITM Power and France's McPhy Energy all down more than half over the past 12 months.
They have underperformed global and European stocks, which have gained 3-4% over the same period, as well as renewables stocks, which have fallen 9%.
Thyssenkrupp has said an IPO of Nucera could happen in the first half of 2022 but the group still needs to make a firm decision in favour of such a move and has left the door open to a partial sale.
Nucera, which is co-owned by Thyssenkrupp and Italy's De Nora in a 66-34 split, is the world's top supplier of chlor-alkali membrane technologies needed to produce hydrogen and is also active in alkaline water electrolysis.
""Valuation certainly depends on the market environment. And that's rather fragile at the moment,"" said Marc Tuengler of DSW, a lobby group that represents Thyssenkrupp's private shareholders. ""Time is pressing.""
In a note published after Nucera's capital markets day in January, analysts at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) attributed a value of 2.3 billion euros for Thyssenkrupp's 66% stake in Nucera, which indicates 3.4 billion euros for the whole business.
A person familiar with the matter said the asset was currently valued at 3 billion to 4 billion euros.
Thyssenkrupp declined to comment.
In the fiscal year to September, Nucera posted operating profit of 27 million euros, while sales came in at 319 million, a level expected to triple to 900 million to 1 billion by 2025-26.

""The multiple that Nucera might have received nine months ago can no longer be reached that easily,"" Deka's Speich said.

The company plans to issue up to 2.1 billion shares to up to 35 investors at a price that will be disclosed at a later stage, Luxshare said in a filing to the Shenzhen stock exchange.
The move came as Luxshare pushed to ""improve the company's production capacity in downstream applications such as consumer electronics and smart vehicles,"" it said in the filing.
The six projects included the construction of production lines of smart wearable devices, smart mobile terminal precision components, and high-voltage connection systems for new energy vehicles, according to its filing.
Founded in 2004, Luxshare has in recent years become a fast-growing supplier for Apple. It has steadily moved up the hardware giant's value chain, from making connector cables for the iPhone and Macbook to manufacturing Airpods.
In 2020 the company acquired two iPhone assembly plants from Taiwan-based Wistron Corp.

That move is seen by analysts as a sign of more indigenous Chinese companies making deeper inroads into Apple's supply chain.

MADRID (Reuters) - Under pressure from a campaign by a 78-year-old pensioner against financial exclusion of elderly people in the digital age, Spanish banks have agreed to extend cashier services and provide better customer care, the government said on Monday.
Many among Spain's more than nine million over-65s, or almost 20% of the total population, have struggled to manage their finances since bank branches started vanishing from the high street and going digital instead.
""From now on, elderly people who go to a bank branch will receive this personal, preferential approach with extended cashier service, which is what they were asking us to provide,"" Economy Minister Nadia Calvino said, explaining details of a deal reached with Spanish banking associations.
Her ministry had pressed the sector to tackle the issue in the past few weeks, spurred by a two-month-long campaign by retired urologist Carlos San Juan dubbed ""I'm old, not an idiot"".
His petition has been signed by more than 640,000 people and that has moved lenders to change their tack.
""I am excited to see that older people will not be excluded...Today is a great day,"" San Juan said on Monday.
Among the measures, banks will dedicate trained staff to engage with the elderly and make ATMs, apps, websites and remote channels, such as phone-banking, more user-friendly.
Bank of Spain Governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos said the protocol offered concrete answers to those with lower digital skills and the central bank would oversee their implementation.
""We should not take for granted (that these actions) will be enough,"" De Cos added.
The problems in Spain and other European countries lay bare the disconnect between pursuing profits through massive layoffs and servicing the needs of a section of the population struggling with cheaper online channels.
Calvino echoed De Cos' comments and added that if these steps proved to be insufficient, or could be improved, ""we will have to promote and deploy other measures that guarantee access to banking services for all citizens.""
The measures have raised questions among unions and consumer associations who say they may fall short if not accompanied by new hirings.

Among measures to protect consumers, the government is planning to approve in coming weeks a services bill with specific requirements for the financial sector, improving channels and personalised attention, the Economy Ministry said.
It is also setting up a financial customer protection authority, to ensure that institutions comply with their obligations while boosting digital inclusion of the elderly, especially in rural areas.

The billionaire activist investor, who stated that he holds 200 shares in the company, nominated Leslie Samuelrich and Maisie Ganzler to stand for election at the 2022 annual meeting, the company said in a statement, adding that it would evaluate the nominees as it would any other board candidates. 
Icahn has previously said that it is ""obscene"" how the animals used for McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) products are treated.
Icahn has insisted on new McDonald's commitments, including requiring all of the company's U.S. pork suppliers to move to ""crate free"" pork, and set specific timeframes, the company said.
Such a commitment would be impossible given the current supply ""and would harm the company's shared pursuit of providing customers with high quality products at accessible prices,"" the statement said.
McDonald's pledged in 2012 to source pork from producers who do not use small crates to house pregnant sows. Icahn pushed for the change behind the scenes, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month. 
""Since making this commitment, McDonald's has led the industry, and today an estimated 30%-35% of U.S. pork production has moved to group housing systems,"" the company's statement said. 
The company expects to source 85% to 90% of its U.S. pork volumes from sows not housed in gestation crates during pregnancy by the end of 2022 and expects 100% of its U.S. pork to come from sows housed in groups during pregnancy by the end of 2024, it added.
McDonald's also said it was ""noteworthy"" that Icahn, the majority owner of Viskase, a company that supplies packaging for the pork industry, ""has not publicly called on Viskase to adopt commitments similar to those of McDonald's 2012 commitment."" Icahn did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

McDonald's said it sources only approximately 1% of its U.S. pork production and does not own any sows, or produce or package pork in the United States.
Icahn, who became known as a corporate raider on Wall Street, was embroiled in a proxy battle with Southwest Gas (NYSE:SWX) Holdings Inc in November last year.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Mercedes-Benz expects to have factories producing exclusively electric vehicles (EVs) by the second half of the decade but will steer clear of building EV-only plants, instead keeping production lines flexible in line with market demand.
The carmaker foresees some of its production lines within factories switching fully to electric even sooner, production chief Joerg Burzer said in an interview with Reuters.
""Building a whole new battery-electric vehicle factory takes time. We have taken another approach,"" Burzer said. 
""We will certainly have some lines producing only electric vehicles in the next few years... we also see whole factories switching to electric - that is a topic for the second half of the decade.""
The premium carmaker will launch production of its EQE model, revealed last September at the IAA (NYSE:IAA) Mobility show, in Bremen later this year, followed by Beijing and Tuscaloosa. 
Mercedes is betting on the model, an electric adaptation of the E-class with a peak range of 660 km, to boost EV unit sales as it shifts investment away from internal combustion vehicles and towards electric-only production platforms.
""With the ramp-up of the EQE in Bremen and later in Beijing, we are coming into a segment where we can deliver at far higher volumes,"" Burzer said.
Just 2.3% of Mercedes-Benz Cars' sales last year were battery-electric vehicles, rising to 11% including plug-in hybrids, which have both an engine and a battery.
As of 2025, it expects electric and hybrid electric cars to make up 50% of sales, with all-electric cars expected to account for most of that.

Existing models are all being built in factories also producing internal combustion engine vehicles, with batteries transported by rail from the main plant in Sindelfingen to plants in Germany and Hungary.
Down the line, battery assembly and production could be brought nearer to car plants as the design of vehicles develops to integrate the battery more closely into the car, Burzer said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian ratings agency ACRA estimates that the country's banks imported $5 billion worth of banknotes in foreign currencies in December, up from $2.65 billion a year before, in a pre-emptive step in case of sanctions creating increased demand.
Dollars traditionally dominate such imports which, along with other currencies, many Russians like to hold as a hedge against any drop in the value of the rouble or rise in inflation, both potential outcomes of foreign sanctions.
Valery Piven, senior director at ACRA, told Reuters that calculations based on technical reports which banks submit to Russia's central bank each month showed that they had also imported $2.1 billion in foreign banknotes in November.
The United States is considering new sanctions against Russia, proposing to cut some of its top banks from dollar transactions and reducing their ability to service dollar-denominated obligations, sources told Reuters.
""The ratio of forex assets and liabilities held by banks is regulated by the central bank and (currently) does not cause a concern. The increase in (forex) imports is more related to a possible spike in demand for cash currency,"" Piven said.
Russia's central bank declined to comment but the country's banks regularly import foreign currencies in cash to meet demand from customers for dollars or euros needed for overseas travel or in case of unforeseen circumstances.
CORRESPONDENT ACCOUNTS 
Despite heightened fears of a military conflict in Ukraine, the foreign exchange imports in December are still well short of the $18 billion brought into Russia at the end of 2014, when the rouble was in free-fall after Moscow's annexation of Crimea.
Russian denies that it plans to attack Ukraine. 
Around a half of Russia's total banking foreign assets and liabilities, or some $100 billion and $70 billion, respectively, are held in U.S. dollars, central bank data shows. This is down from around 80% in 2002 and 70% in early 2014. 
Russia's top banks Sberbank, VTB, VEB and Gazprombank, which were named in the Reuters report on Monday as possible dollar sanctions targets, did not reply to requests for comment. 
The Russian finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment. 
In preparation for possible sanctions on dollar transactions first floated by U.S. officials a few years ago, Russia's top banks opened correspondent accounts between themselves, allowing them to move dollars around domestically, sources have said, provided at least one major lender is untouched by sanctions. 

""We are aware that Washington is constantly working on drafting new sanctions,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday, adding it was hard to make further comment. 
Russia's finance ministry said last week it would ensure all bank liabilities, including in foreign currencies, would be honoured should sanctions hit the financial sector, while saying there would be temporary market volatility.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration has prepared an initial package of sanctions against Russia that includes barring U.S. financial institutions from processing transactions for major Russian banks, three people familiar with the matter said.
The measures, which would only be implemented if Russia invades Ukraine, aim to hurt the Russian economy by cutting the ""correspondent"" banking relationships between targeted Russian banks and U.S. banks that enable international payments. 
While U.S. authorities have said banking restrictions would be part of a package of possible sanctions, the administration's plan to cut correspondent banking ties - which underpin global money flows - has not previously been reported. 
The United States will also wield its most powerful sanctioning tool against certain Russian individuals and companies by placing them on the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, effectively kicking them out of the U.S. banking system, banning their trade with Americans and freezing their U.S. assets, the same sources said. 
The White House and Treasury Department declined to comment. 
The sources said the package could change up to the last minute and it was unclear who the targets would be. However, they believe top Russian financial institutions including VTB Bank, Sberbank, VEB, and Gazprombank are possible targets. 
Experts consulted by Reuters said that while the correspondent banking tool lacks the punch of an SDN designation, which freezes a bank's assets, they could still deal a meaningful blow to the target banks by making it difficult to transact in U.S. dollars, the global reserve currency. 
Much of global trade is transacted in dollars.
It is unclear whether Russian banks would be added to the SDN list, but both types of sanctions could hit Russia hard. 
""Since a significant number of global trade transactions are in U.S. dollars this is a sanction with bite, but without the more complicated and deadly sanction of being placed on the SDN list and having all assets in the U.S. or in the hands of U.S. persons frozen,"" said Washington lawyer Kay Georgi, who specializes in international trade.
Sources noted that the administration could exempt certain transactions from the restrictions if deemed necessary.
'UPFRONT COSTS'
The Biden administration has been threatening tough banking sanctions against Russia for weeks in a bid to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine. Moscow has amassed upwards of 150,000 troops on Ukraine's borders, but Putin has denied plans to launch an attack.
Peter Harrell, who sits on the National Security Council, said last month that ""heavy hitting financial sanctions"" were part of a strategy to hurt Russia's economy but spare its citizens. 
""The goal of the financial sanctions is really to have short term upfront costs on Russia, to trigger capital flight, to trigger inflation, to make the Russian central bank provide bailouts to its banks,"" he said in a speech late last month.
The tough warnings have put some U.S. financial firms on edge. Members of the financial services and payment industries have been in touch in recent days with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which administers sanctions, sources said. 
Tensions grew over the weekend as Russia extended military drills in Belarus, heightening fears among Western powers of an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
Biden and Putin on Sunday agreed in principle to a summit, France said, offering hope conflict could be avoided.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the United States and Britain would cut off Russian companies' access to U.S. dollars and British pounds if the Kremlin orders an invasion.
The Biden administration has been similarly aggressive in its rhetoric. In a briefing on Friday, Deputy National Security advisor Daleep Singh told reporters that the cost to Russia of an invasion would be ""immense, both to its economy and its strategic position in the world.""

The southern city of Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province, is home to the country's most indebted property developer China Evergrande Group.
The move follows decisions by some banks to require smaller downpayments in some cities last week. Media have also reported this month that developers will also gain easier access to presale proceeds from residential projects.
Cutting mortgage rates for first-time home buyers to 80 basis points over the country's benchmark loan prime rate (LPR) from 100 basis points were the Guangzhou branches of the Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) and Agricultural Bank of China (OTC:ACGBF), said the two people.
For those buying their second homes, the rate was also lowered by 20 basis points to 100 basis points over the LPR, said the people, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Two other major banks, Bank of Communications and Postal Savings Bank of China also lowered the mortgage rates in Guangzhou on a par with their peers, State broadcaster CCTV reported. 
The six banks did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. 
The one-year LPR, a market-based benchmark lending rate, was at 3.7% while the five-year rate stands at 4.6%.

Regulatory curbs on borrowing drove China's property sector into a liquidity crisis last year. The contagion has engulfed a swathe of developers and contributed to a sharp slump in China's property market, which accounts for a quarter of its economy.
Several banks in the eastern city of Suzhou, Jiangsu province have also lowered the mortgage rate for first-time homebuyers to as low as 4.8%, Chinese media outlet Cailianshe reported on Monday.

LONDON (Reuters) - The United States and European Union countries are unlikely to impose blanket sanctions on Rusal if Russia invades Ukraine as that would exacerbate aluminium shortages, propel prices to new records and damage manufacturing, analysts say. 
Russia has repeatedly denied it is preparing to invade Ukraine.
Rusal, which accounts for about 6% of global aluminium supplies estimated by analysts at around 70 million tonnes this year, is the world's largest producer outside China. 
Aluminium production by country - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/byprjxyaype/aa%20Aluminium%20production%20by%20country.PNG 
U.S. sanctions on Rusal imposed in April 2018 - and lifted in early 2019 - created major disruption for firms in the transport, construction and packaging industries. The resulting scramble for aluminium saw prices jump 30% in just a few days.
""It is important to note that lawmakers initially underestimated the impact of the Rusal sanctions,"" said CRU analyst Eoin Brophy. ""Aluminium inventories are so low today that a replay of that error would be explosive for prices."" 
""To limit disruptions to manufacturing, it is highly likely that any existing contracts would sit outside of sanctions.""
In response to requests for comment, EU spokesperson Peter Stano said it was premature to speculate about specific measures, since ""no decisions have been made about any new sanctions against Russia"".
""Our sanctions will be suggested, discussed and adopted only in reaction to further violation or aggression against Ukraine,"" he said.
A U.S. Treasury spokesperson declined to comment when asked about Rusal's potential treatment in any sanctions imposed against Russia. The department typically does not discuss details of sanctions before they are imposed.

The possibility of the market losing Rusal's aluminium pushed prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) to $3,333 a tonne last week, close to the record high of $3,380.15 a tonne touched in July 2007.
Shortages in Europe and the United States can be seen in the duty-paid physical premiums that consumers pay above the LME price, at record highs above $460 a tonne and $790 a tonne respectively.
""Any moves that have direct implications for industry will be considered very carefully. Aluminium has already priced in an element of disruption,"" said Macquarie analyst Marcus Garvey, adding that any disruption could not be fully priced in at this stage.
""Our base case is that there will not be disruptions to Russian aluminium supply... the market is extremely tight.""

Macquarie expects the aluminium market to see a deficit of 1.8 million tonnes this year after a shortfall of 1.5 million tonnes in 2021.

Shortages have meant draws on inventories, which in LME-approved warehouses have more than halved to 855,525 tonnes since March last year.

KUWAIT CITY (Reuters) -State-owned Kuwait Airways on Monday announced it would now purchase 31 jets from Airbus instead of 28 as part of a restructured deal in which it has also reduced orders for A350-900 jets.
Chief Executive Ma'an Razoq told a press conference the restructured aircraft order, estimated to be worth $3 billion, would save the loss-making carrier a total of $200 million.
The new deal, which includes some aircraft already delivered, is for nine A320neos, six A321 neos, three A321neo-LRs, four A330-800neos, seven A330-900neos and two A350-900s.
""All jets will be delivered by the end of 2028,"" Razoq said.
The original 28 jet order was for 15 A320 neos, eight A330-800neos and five A350-900s, according to Airbus' website.

Of the original order, the airline has already taken delivery of six A320neos and two A330-800neos, the website says.
Kuwait Airways is now targeting to break even before 2026, Chairman Ali Aldokhan said.

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Shares and international bonds of Zhenro Properties slumped further on Monday after it said existing internal resources might be insufficient to repay debt due in March.
The comment was contrary to a previous commitment to redeem a $200 million perpetual bond due on March 5 and raises fresh concerns over liquidity at the Shanghai-based developer and among its peers.
Zhenro's Hong Kong-listed shares plunged more than 13% to a record low HK$0.75 versus a 1.1% drop for the Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index.
Its dollar bond due Aug. 3 traded at 15.871 cents on the dollar, compared with 20.345 on Friday.
Zhenro said in a filing late on Friday that its internal funds available for debt servicing have become increasingly limited since the announcement it made on Jan 4 about the redemption, citing adverse market conditions.
Zhenro, China's 30th-biggest property developer by sales, added that it is asking holders of the perpetual bond to waive claims against the company if it defaults and is offering to pay $17.50 per $1,000 principal amount if bondholders consent.
Fitch downgraded Zhenro's long-term issuer default rating to C from B after the consent solicitation, which it views as a distressed debt exchange. If it is approved, Fitch said it will make a further downgrade to ""restricted default"".
Fellow ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) also lowered Zhenro's rating to Caa2 from B3, reflecting heightened default risk.
""Zhenro had provided inconsistent debt repayment plans to the market over the past two months, which raises concerns over the company's financial strategy and risk management,"" Moody's said in a statement.
Zhenro has another $50 million dollar bond due on March 6, Refinitiv data shows, while the amount of total international bonds outstanding is $3.65 billion.
Its onshore September 2024 exchange-traded bond, however, jumped more than 22% when the market opened on Monday, triggering an automatic suspension, though only one trade was recorded.
Zhenro's shares and bonds first took a hit on Feb. 11 after reports that it had plans to restructure its dollar bonds. The company issued a statement on Feb. 14 calling the reports ""untrue and fictitious"" and said it reserved the right to pursue legal action.
""Zhenro’s proposal is highly disappointing and akin to a distressed restructuring, as it gives perpetual holders lower compensation compared to the original terms,"" said Leonard Law, senior credit analyst at Lucror Analytics.

LIC, the country's biggest insurance company, is planning to float a 5% stake to raise about $8 billion next month, which could make it India's largest initial public offering (IPO) by far. 
Its majority stake in IDBI Bank, which it rescued in 2019, is seen as a risk to its balance sheet.
""I would like to have some stake in IDBI Bank. It has been the strongest contributor to the bancassurance channel for us. This will help us to grow that part of the channel,"" said M R Kumar in a press conference with reporters on Monday.
India's government and LIC hold over 90% stake in IDBI Bank, which had assets of over 2,900 billion rupees ($38.91 billion) at the end of December and over 1,800 branches across the country. LIC took over the lender when it was weighed down by bad loans and needed a new infusion of capital.
The government and LIC have been looking at offloading their stake in IDBI for the past few years. 

Kumar also said LIC is well capitalised, and potential investors should not worry about government control post the IPO as decisions are taken by its board and not by the government, which will hold a 95% stake after the flotation.

The sanctions are countermeasures against the two companies over a $100-million Feb. 7 arms sale that ""undermined China's security interests, seriously undermined China-U.S. relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait"", foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a regular news briefing. 
Beijing views the self-ruled island of Taiwan as a breakaway province that must accept Chinese sovereignty and has never renounced the use of force to achieve that goal. 
""In accordance with the relevant stipulations in China's anti-foreign sanctions law, the Chinese government has decided to take countermeasures on the infringing acts of Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Technologies and Lockheed Martin,"" Wang said.
""Both are military enterprises that have long participated in U.S. arm sales to China's Taiwan region.""
No further details were given on the nature of the sanctions.
This is the first time the companies have faced sanctions under China's new anti-foreign sanctions law drawn up last year in response to U.S. sanctions against Chinese companies.
On at least two previous occasions China has announced sanctions against Lockheed and Raytheon, in 2019 and 2020, though Beijing has not explained what those sanctions entailed or how they were enforced.
The United States does not sell weapons to China.
However, the United States is bound by the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, and U.S. weapons sales always attract China's anger.

China has over the past two years stepped up its military and diplomatic pressure against Taiwan, whose government says it wants peace but will defend the island if attacked.
China regularly says Taiwan is the most important and sensitive issue in its ties with Washington, which are also strained over trade and human rights disputes.

Investing.com -- European stock markets traded higher Monday, boosted by fresh hopes for a diplomatic solution to the tense situation on the Ukraine border.
By 3:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.9% higher, the CAC 40 in France climbed 0.6% while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.8%.
News of a potential summit on Ukraine between President Joe Biden and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin has buoyed markets which have been perturbed by the possibility of a Russian invasion, given its massive troop buildup as well as its extended military drills in neighboring Belarus.
The two leaders have agreed in principle to a summit, French President Emmanuel Macron, who proposed the idea, said in a statement Monday, while the EU foreign ministers will also discuss the situation.
That said, gains are limited Monday with many details about the proposed summit uncertain and its likely success very much up in the air. Additionally, there will be no lead from the U.S., given its markets are on holiday.
Back in Europe, producer prices in Germany rose by 2.2% in January, a hefty leap of 25% on the year, more than expected and an indication of the pressures the European Central Bank is under to combat inflation in the bloc.
Investors will also focus on the release of the German manufacturing PMI data for February, given the importance of this sector in driving growth in the region. The PMI data from France, the Eurozone’s second largest economy, came in ahead of expectations, both in the manufacturing and services sectors. 
In the corporate sector,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) stock fell 0.6% after the leak over the weekend of data on thousands of suspect accounts held at the bank in previous decades. The Swiss lender rejected any allegations of wrongdoing, while FINMA, the country’s banking supervisor, said it has been in contact with the bank.
 Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) stock fell 0.4% after the company dismissed as ""unfounded and harmful"" a Sunday newspaper report concerning financial targets in a plan by new Chief Executive Pietro Labriola.
On a more positive note,  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) stock rose 0.7% after the French car parts group forecast a rise in full-year sales, as it expects semiconductor shortages to ease from the second half of the year.
Oil prices stabilized Monday as traders attempted to balance the potential for a summit between the leaders of Russia and the U.S. to defuse the continued tensions on the Ukraine border with the prospects of a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, increasing the possibility of the Persian Gulf country’s crude exports returning to the global markets.
By 3:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $90.30 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.2% to $91.56. Both contracts last week registered their first losing week in nine, despite hitting their highest levels for over seven years earlier in the week.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,897.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% higher at 1.1368.

1301,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2022 03:05AM ET</span>","Australia's AGL Energy spurns surprise $3.5 billion bid, suitor Brookfield digs in","By Sonali Paul and Shashwat Awasthi
MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Australia's top power producer AGL Energy (OTC:AGLXY) Ltd on Monday rejected an unsolicited $3.54 billion takeover overture from tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and Canada's Brookfield Asset Management, sticking to its own spin-off tune.
The surprise bid comes as AGL seeks to split itself in two - a retail and renewable energy operation and a coal-fired generation business - by June in an attempt to turn around a 75% slump in its market value over the past five years.
Brookfield and Cannon-Brookes, Australia's second-richest man, said their goal is to speed up delivery of cleaner and cheaper energy. AGL, Australia's biggest polluter, produces more than 8% of Australia's carbon emissions.
But AGL said the A$7.50 per share cash proposal - a 4.7% premium to the stock's Friday close - undervalued the business. The shares jumped as much as 13% on Monday, to a high of A$8.09, as investors placed bets that a higher bid will emerge.
""Energy transition will be one of the biggest investment opportunities of our lifetime,"" said Mark Carney, vice chair of Brookfield, which has nearly $700 billion in assets under management, and former Bank of England governor.
Brookfield and Cannon-Brookes, a co-founder of software business Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) Corp and climate activist, said they plan to invest about A$20 billion ($14.4 billion) to replace AGL's coal-fired power with clean energy and storage, aiming to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2035, five years earlier than AGL's current plan.
On Monday, AGL was unmoved.
""The proposal does not offer an adequate premium for a change of control and is not in the best interests of AGL Energy shareholders,"" AGL Chairman Peter Botten said, adding that the company's own spin-off plan will build a ""strong future"" for both parts of the business.
The bidding consortium hopes to persuade AGL's board to allow the team to look at AGL's books, Brookfield's Asia Pacific Chief Executive Officer Stewart Upson said.
""This is going to be a long journey,"" Upson told Reuters in an interview. ""And during that time, we would likely bring in other partners, who we've already been talking to.""
He declined to say what the ownership split would be between Brookfield, Cannon-Brookes and potential others. In its recent acquisition of power distributor AusNet Services, Brookfield ended with a 45% stake alongside other institutional investors. 
BID BATTLE?
Analysts said the approach from Brookfield and Cannon-Brookes could spark a bidding war for AGL, with major European companies, including Shell (LON:RDSa), Spain's Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY) and France's TotalEnergies all looking to expand into Australian power retailing. 
Those companies, however, are unlikely to want AGL's legacy coal power business as they look to decarbonise their own operations.
""This is not a low-risk venture - that's why no-one else has emerged to date,"" said Tim Buckley, founder of a new think tank, Climate Energy Finance.
AGL's earnings have been hammered in recent years by an influx of cheap solar and wind power. That has made coal-fired plants less viable. At the same time the government has forced utilities to slash power prices to households and businesses.
The bidding team said they would not shut coal-fired capacity until it has been replaced by renewables and storage to ensure steady supply and prices. AGL flagged earlier this month it would shut its last coal-fired plant in 2045.
""This proposal will mean cheaper, cleaner and more reliable energy for customers,"" Cannon-Brookes, 42, said in a statement. ""It will create over 10,000 Australian jobs and ensure customers don't bear the brunt of higher power prices - a likely scenario if the proposed demerger happens.""
Brookfield has nearly completed raising $15 billion for a Global Transition Fund which will be used for the bid. Brookfield says the fund is the world's largest focused on investing in the transition to a net zero economy.

Cannon-Brookes has long pushed for Australia to speed up the shift to clean energy. He spurred Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Elon Musk to build Australia's first large-scale battery in 2017 and is backing a A$20 billion project, Sun Cable, to supply solar power from northern Australia to Singapore.

While the Kremlin complains about ""daily"" Western predictions of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, investors for their part have had no choice but to adjust to each day's unique sabre rattling noise and assess the probability of a conflict hitting global financial markets.
Today's news that U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin have agreed in principle to a summit over Ukraine has lifted U.S. and European stocks futures and helped Asian shares pare some losses. 
But as much as a swift diplomatic breakthrough to reset Europe's security framework appears unlikely for now, so does a full-fledged confrontation between the West and Russia. 
What analysts are struggling to do, is pricing how the various scenarios in between will impact a vast range of asset classes, from energy to wheat, gold, stocks, bonds and currencies to name a few.
At the moment, the prospect of de-escalation is moving capital away from safe havens with the euro jumping 0.4% to $1.1367 and the dollar retreating 0.36% against its rivals.
This morning also sees oil prices ease on the hope of summit over Ukraine and news of a possible nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. Still at about $93 a barrel, oil remains close to the symbolic $100 bar for the liking of many countries.
A flurry of data from France, Germany and the UK this morning will shed some light on how much of a toll inflation, tighter monetary policy and this winter's COVID-19 Omicron wave have taken on the economic recovery.
And while European companies hoping to fund deals via bond markets are facing a sudden jump in borrowing costs, business goes on unabated with French payments company Worldline entering exclusive talks to sell its TSS terminals business to Apollo Funds in a deal potentially worth around 2.3 billion euros.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday:
-Arab oil producers say OPEC+ should stick to current output agreement 
- China's new home prices perk up 
- Japan's manufacturing activity expanded at the slowest pace in five months
- Thai economy returns to growth in Q4 

- Flash PMIs for France, Germany, EU, UK

Faurecia now sees full-year sales of 17.5 billion to 18 billion euros ($19.89 billion to $20.45 billion), up from 15.6 billion euros recorded last year.
The group said it will release full-year guidance for the combined group with Hella along with first-quarter sales figures on April 28.
The combined group, which will continue to equip cars under the name of Forvia, is set to become the seventh-largest automotive supplier in the world.
""Our most exciting challenge for 2022 will be the great opportunity to combine our operations and teams with Hella to create a powerful group, which is far more than the sum of the two preexisting companies,"" Faurecia CEO Patrick Koller said in a statement, adding that Forvia is now fully on track to deliver on its ambitions.
Faurecia, which supplies car seats, dashboards and fuel systems to automakers, also said it expects its operating margin to be between 6% and 7% in 2022 compared to last year's 5.5%.
Its full-year net loss shrank to 79 million euros from a year-earlier loss of 379 million euros.
Faurecia said its 2022 forecast is based on assumption that the worldwide automotive production will recover to 78.7 million vehicles in 2022.

1306,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2022 02:10AM ET</span>",Column-Funds win again with U.S. curve flatteners: McGeever,"By Jamie McGeever
ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Another week, another big win for hedge funds betting on a flatter U.S. yield curve.
Futures market data for the week through Feb. 15 show that funds' extending their bets on a narrower gap between two- and 10-year yields coincided with one of the most dramatic 24-hour periods at the short end of the curve in over a decade.
The pace of flattening this year, however, has been so rapid that a period of consolidation may now be in store: in recent days the 2s/10s part of the curve has begun to steepen, and frenzied interest rate expectations have cooled. Slightly.
The latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission report shows that funds increased their net short position in two-year Treasuries by more than 104,000 contracts to 115,758 contracts in the week through Feb. 15.
That is the largest overall net short since October, and the weekly change marked the most bearish shift since last March. It was wholly driven by liquidation of long positions rather than funds opening fresh short positions.
(Graphic: CFTC Funds' 2-Yr Treasuries Net Position - Weekly Change, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klpykmxzlpg/2YCFTCWEEKLY.png)
A short position is essentially a bet that an asset's price will fall, and a long position is a bet it will rise. In bonds, yields rise when prices fall, and move lower when prices rise.
The week in question covers Thursday Feb. 10, when figures showed U.S. inflation at a 40-year high of 7.5%, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he had turned ""dramatically"" more hawkish, and the two-year yield soared 24 basis points.
That was the biggest one-day rise since 2009 and contributed to a 13-basis point narrowing of the spread between two- and 10-year yields, the fourth biggest compression in a decade.
The 2s/10s curve flattened to 35 basis points on Feb. 14, the lowest since mid-2020. This is an increasingly loud warning that the Fed may tighten policy too aggressively and that the economy could soon stall or even tip into recession.
Other parts of the yield curve have flattened further and some parts of the rates futures curve have inverted. This is due to the ratcheting up of expectations that the Fed will raise rates aggressively to cool inflation.
Economists at JP Morgan on Friday were the latest to revise up their Fed outlook, to seven 25-basis point hikes this year, while strategists at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) raised their 10-year U.S. yield forecast by 50 bps to 2.70%.
""We expect the curve to continue to flatten, but believe the extent to which flattening is already priced leaves little appeal to adding further exposure,"" Credit Suisse's Jonathan Cohn said.
Fatigue might be setting in though. Last week was the first in eight that the two-year yield declined week on week, even though it was only by a couple of basis points. Perhaps markets are realizing that Bullard, the Fed's most vocal hawk, doesn't speak for the whole rate-setting committee.
Money markets are no longer fully pricing in at least 150 basis points of tightening from the Federal Reserve this year, and the two-year yield has come off almost 20 basis points from its Feb. 10 high of 1.64%.
The CFTC report for the week through Feb. 15 also showed that funds cut their net short 10-year Treasuries futures holdings by 27,847 contracts to 174,063, the smallest since October.
The most eye-catching nugget was that this marked the third week in a row that funds added to their long positions, something they have not done since last May.
This suggests that the 10-year yield's recent climb above 2% for the first time since 2019 was attractive to investors who, with Russia and Ukraine on the brink of war, had extra incentive to buy the safest, most liquid asset in the world.
There may be life in the old bonds yet.

The company's shares fell as much as 4.3% and hit a two-week low.
In a letter to the InterGlobe's board on Friday, Rakesh Gangwal said he was stepping down immediately as he didn't want access to unpublished price sensitive information when he begins trimming his stake in the company.
Gangwal and his family own 36.61% stake in InterGlobe, while another co-founder and managing director Rahul Bhatia and his family own about 37.8%. 
""I have been a long-term shareholder in the company for more than 15 years and it's only natural to someday think about diversifying one's holdings,"" Gangwal said https:// in the letter, without divulging how much stake he plans to retain.
Both the co-founders were involved in a spat in early-2020 when Gangwal had sought to modify certain rules in the company's articles of association.
Gangwal, a non-executive director, had alleged violations in corporate governance rules at the parent group and wanted to remove an article that prevented co-founders from buying publicly-listed shares in InterGlobe and potentially trigger an open offer for the rest of the company.

MUMBAI (Reuters) -Amazon's rivalry in India with oil-to-retail conglomerate Reliance Industries looks set to head to the cricket field, where they will likely battle media heavyweights for telecast rights to India's premier cricket league with its hundreds of millions of viewers. 
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Reliance Industries Ltd are expected to take on India units of  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group Corp and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co for exclusive five-year TV and digital broadcast rights to the two-month series of matches, at a cost that could run to a record 500 billion rupees ($6.7 billion), sources familiar with the companies' plans said.
""Cricket is the second-biggest sport in the world with two-and-a-half billion fans and IPL is like its Super Bowl,"" said Anton Rublievskyi, head of Parimatch, a betting company that advertised at the Indian Premier League (IPL) last year.
""If you're not there, you do not exist.""
Disney-owned Star India, which is one of the top broadcasters in India along with Sony and its planned acquisition Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, paid 163.48 billion rupees for the digital and television rights until 2022. The league's matches reached 350 million viewers during the first half of the 2021 season alone.
But traditional media firms now face stiff competition from deep-pocketed rivals like Reliance, India's biggest retailer, and Amazon, two billionaire-led behemoths competing for the fast-growing e-commerce market while building up their digital platforms. [L4N2IB3MD]
Amazon and Reliance are already locked in a pitched courtroom battle over the acquisiton of assets of Future Group, another big India retailer.
Reliance is also in talks with investors, including foreigners, to raise up to $1.6 billion for its broadcasting joint venture, Viacom18.
""Winning this bid is critical to Reliance's long-term plans for its Jio platform and its digital expansion,"" said a source with direct knowledge of the company's strategy.
""Everything that has happened at Viacom18 in the last few months, like buying rights to the Spanish La Liga and setting up a sports channel, has been building up to this,"" the source said.
Reliance and Viacom18 did not respond to requests for comment.
Amazon, whose Prime Video platform recently began live-streaming cricket matches, wants to win the IPL rights to expand the platform's user base, another industry source familiar with the company's thinking said.
An Amazon India spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
The company lacks a TV platform and would need to bring in a TV partner or could only bid for the digital portion. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which runs the tender, awarded it in 2017 to a consolidated TV and digital bid from Star, which surpassed any of the combined individual bids.
Industry sources expect flexibility from the BCCI given the prospects for record payments by bidders including a deep-pocketed digital-only player like Amazon.
BCCI secretary Jay Shah, in an interview with Reuters, said the board had studied various models and proposals but he did not comment on details or the likely dollar value of the bids. 
""We will do our best to derive the right value a tournament like the IPL deserves,"" he said.
Among the media majors, Disney India did not respond to a request for comment but Disney CEO Bob Chapek told a recent earnings teleconference that the company was confident of achieving its subscriber targets in India even without IPL rights.
Sony's India entertainment unit said it would evaluate bids for both broadcast and digital rights.

Some in the industry however, are questioning the sharp rise in the cost of the rights and whether it is sustainable.
""The IPL has got to a stage where it's now too big to fail and therefore everyone who is part of the ecosystem is propping it up,"" said advertising industry veteran Meenakshi Menon.

The downbeat forecast sent the stock of Australia's biggest standalone buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) company down nearly 7% to its lowest since May 2020.
The BNPL sector in Australia, which saw a meteoric rise during the pandemic as customers thronged to online shopping and preferred alternate sources of credit to pay for purchases, is going through a rapid consolidation.
Zip said it would undertake a series of cost-saving measures to narrow its losses, but did not provide further details.
Bad debts were at 2.6% of transaction volumes for the first half ended Dec. 31, higher than RBC's estimate. Zip attributed this to its expansion into ""less mature"" markets, and less stimulus in the United States.
The company has been rapidly expanding into new markets over the past year, acquiring and investing in companies in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Last month, it said it was in talks to buy smaller Australian peer Sezzle.
RBC said Zip's expansion strategy was likely to result in higher operating costs going forward. 

Zip said it expected half-year earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization to be a loss of A$108.1 million ($108.10 million), compared to RBC's estimate of a A$39.7 million loss.

1318,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2022 09:00AM ET</span>",Surging oil prices add another worry for frazzled investors,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) -A U.S. stock market, already on edge from a hawkish Federal Reserve and a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, now has another worry: higher oil prices. 
U.S. crude prices stand at around $91 a barrel after surging some 40% since Dec. 1 and earlier this week touched their highest level since 2014. Prices for Brent crude, the global benchmark, have also soared and are near 7-year highs. 
Rapidly rising oil prices can be a troubling development for markets, as they cloud the economic outlook by increasing costs for businesses and consumers. Higher crude also threatens to accelerate already-surging inflation, compounding worries that the Fed will need to aggressively tighten monetary policy to tamp down consumer prices. 
“The stock market would really run into trouble if we went north of $125 per barrel and stayed there for a while because that would overheat high levels of inflation,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. ""That means that the Fed would have to be a lot more aggressive and that certainly would not be a pleasant scenario for the stock market."" 
Rising tensions between Russia – one of the world’s largest oil producers – and Ukraine recently helped drive the rally in oil, which had been supported by a recovery in demand from the coronavirus pandemic. 
Capital Economics analysts said earlier this week that crude oil and natural gas prices would surge if the conflict in Ukraine escalated ""even if they fall back relatively quickly as the dust settles.""
Elevated oil prices contributed to the rise in U.S. inflation, which grew at its fastest pace in nearly four decades last month: While overall consumer prices rose 7.5% year-over-year in January, the index's energy component rose by 27%. 
Each ""sustained"" $10 increase in the price of oil per barrel adds about 0.3 percentage points to the overall consumer price index, on a year-over-year basis, according to analysts at Oxford Economics. 
""The largest impact of higher oil prices is on consumer price inflation and it adds further to the pressure for the Fed to be more aggressive,"" Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics, said in emailed comments to Reuters. 
The benchmark S&P 500 is down over 8% this year while the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note has risen by 40 basis points to over 1.9%. Investors are pricing the Fed funds rate to rise to above 1.50% by the end of 2022, from near zero now, according to Refinitiv's Fedwatch tool.
CONSUMER SPENDING IMPACT
Rising crude is already raising costs for businesses and drivers. The national U.S. average for gasoline recently stood at $3.48 a gallon, automobile group AAA said earlier this week, up 18 cents from a month earlier and 98 cents from a year ago.
As gasoline prices rise, investors are monitoring trends for consumers, whose spending accounts for over two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Data on Wednesday showed U.S. retail sales increased by the most in 10 months in January, but last week's consumer sentiment reading came in at its lowest level in more than a decade in early February. 
""The risk is that if gas prices at the pump start going up that means less discretionary spending for consumers at a time when a lot of their fiscal benefits from the last couple years are fading,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors. 
Investors are gauging the effect of higher oil on companies’ earnings. Typically, rising oil prices are estimated to lift overall S&P 500 earnings by about $1 per share for every $5 increase in the price of crude, according to David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer at DWS Group, with benefits to energy firms outweighing the drag on earnings of airlines and other companies potentially hurt by higher crude costs. That amounts to about 0.4% of total S&P 500 earnings expected for 2022.
The S&P 500 energy sector is up 22% so far in 2022 while fund managers in the latest BofA Global Research survey reported their highest allocation to energy stocks since March 2012. 

But with oil prices already near seven-year highs, and energy stocks comprising a far lower share of the market than a decade ago, those slim bottom-line benefits may be overshadowed by inflation worries if crude keeps charging higher, some investors said.
""Higher oil prices, without a recession, raise S&P profits,"" Bianco said. ""But not as much as it used to and you definitely don’t want this happening when the Fed is fighting inflation.""

The Felicity Ace ship, carrying around 4,000 vehicles including Porsches, Audis and Bentleys, some electric with lithium-ion batteries, caught fire in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday. The 22 crew members on board were evacuated on the same day.
""The intervention (to put out the blaze) has to be done very slowly,"" João Mendes Cabeças, captain of the nearest port in the Azorean island of Faial, told Reuters late on Saturday. ""It will take a while.""
Lithium-ion batteries in the electric vehicles on board are ""keeping the fire alive"", Cabeças said, adding that specialist equipment to extinguish it was on the way. 
It was not clear whether the batteries sparked the fire.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), which owns the brands, did not confirm the total number of cars on board and said on Friday it was awaiting further information. Ship manager Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Cabeças previously said that ""everything was on fire about five meters above the water line"" and the blaze was still far from the ship's fuel tanks. It is getting closer, he said. 
""The fire spread further down,"" he said, explaining that teams could only tackle the fire from outside by cooling down the ship's structure as it was too dangerous to go on board. 

They also cannot use water because adding weight to the ship could make it more unstable, and traditional water extinguishers do not stop lithium-ion batteries from burning, Cabeças said. 
The Panama-flagged ship will be towed to a country in Europe or to the Bahamas but it is unclear when that will happen.

MILAN (Reuters) -A group of investors led by Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca has agreed to buy into Italian Serie A club Atalanta.
The deal is the latest U.S.-led investment in Italy's top soccer league following the acquisitions of Genoa, AC Milan, Fiorentina, Spezia, AS Roma and Venezia.
Nine of the 20 top-flight Italian clubs are now controlled by foreign names, including China’s Suning Group at Inter Milan and Canadian Joey Saputo at Bologna.
In a statement on Saturday, Atalanta Bergamasca Calcio said the investor group would buy 55% of La Dea, the holding owned by Italy's Percassi family, which owns around 86% of the club.
The Percassi's, whose eponymous group owns cosmetics chain Kiko Milano and manages Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stores in Italy, will keep a stake of 45% in La Dea and remain the biggest single shareholder in an ""equal partnership"" deal.
Under the deal, which sources said values Atalanta at around 500 million euros ($566 million) including debt, Antonio and Luca Percassi will remain chairman and CEO of Atalanta. 
Pagliuca, who is also co-chairman of investment firm Bain Capital, will be co-chairman.
""Atalanta and Boston Celtics share the common sports values: teamwork and an extraordinary relationship with the fans and the community,"" Pagliuca said.
Based in the northern city of Bergamo, Atalanta has always been among the best of Italy's provincial clubs, but under Percassi ownership since 2010 it has punched above its weight and become a feature in the European soccer landscape.
The team has qualified for the lucrative Champions League in the past three seasons and achieved three consecutive third-place finishes in Serie A, helping it report a full-year 52 million euro profit in 2020 despite the impact of Covid.
In its latest annual report dedicated to top European soccer clubs, accountancy firm KPMG penciled in a valuation of 364 million euros for the club.
The Percassi family was advised by BofA Securities, Studio Gatti Pavesi Bianchi Ludovici and Deloitte. 

The investors were assisted by Legance and Kirkland & Ellis, Alvarez & Marsal and Pirola, Zei, Pennuto & Partners.

The company, which owns Germany's flagship carrier as well as Eurowings, Swiss, Brussels and Austrian Airlines, will conduct some last flights to those cities over the weekend before suspending flights from Monday until the end of the month, the spokesperson said.
It will continue to fly to the city of Lviv in western Ukraine where some countries have moved their embassies, the spokesperson said. Lufthansa is constantly monitoring the situation and will decide on further flights at a later date.

Lufthansa follows several other European airlines which have already canceled services to and from Ukraine.

By Emma-Victoria Farr and Alexander Hübner
(Reuters) - German artificial limb maker Ottobock is waiting until September to launch its multibillion-euro stock market listing because of choppy financial markets, four people with knowledge of the matter said.
Many investors had expected the business, which could be valued at more than 5 billion euros ($5.7 billion), to float in the first six months of the year, after it engaged banks to prepare last summer.
Now Ottobock has decided to bide its time ahead of a listing in Frankfurt, the people said. 
The company told Reuters on Friday that while it continued to prepare for a stock market listing, no final decision to do one had been taken.
""We always said that we want to be ready for the capital market from 2022,"" said a company spokesperson. ""The preparations for this are ongoing. Whether and when we will go public has still not been decided."" 
European stock markets have seesawed in recent weeks as investors took fright over a potential conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as well as at the prospect of rising borrowing costs and spiralling price inflation.
A steady stream of stock-market listings had been expected in March, traditionally a busy month, but bankers have said some companies are postponing plans until later, amid growing investor uncertainty.
Ottobock, founded in 1919 as a maker of prosthesis for World War One veterans, is 80% owned by the founding Naeder family and 20% by buyout fund EQT (NYSE:EQT).
Ottobock is branching beyond medtech into industry and recently won its first industrial customer for its exoskeleton products. 
Listed peers include Ossur, Hanger Invacare (NYSE:IVC) and Ekso Bionics.
The company makes prosthetics, orthotics, wheelchairs and exoskeletons and in 2019 posted core earnings of 191 million euros on sales of 1 billion euros.
While Ottobock has been considering an initial public offering (IPO) for years, EQT's stake purchase in 2017 at a valuation of 3.15 billion euros delayed earlier plans. EQT declined to comment.
Since the buyout group's investment, Ottobock named former Fresenius manager Philipp Schulte-Noelle as chief executive.
The wait until later this year will enable Ottobock to show investors a longer track-record of earnings, the people said.

Ottobock hired  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) to work on IPO plans in August last year.

NextEra said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Friday that its NextEra Energy Resources unit and other Mountain Valley joint venture partners continue to evaluate options and next steps for the project.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit over the last month has invalidated key permits for the project issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Forest Service.
The court rulings were the latest setback for the pipeline, which is years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget.
Several analysts have said the court decisions would likely delay the project startup until 2023 or 2024.
Before the latest setbacks,  Equitrans Midstream  (NYSE:ETRN) Corp, the project's lead partner, said it expected the pipeline to cost about $6.2 billion and enter service in the summer of 2022.
Equitrans said in January it was ""evaluating the project’s next steps and timing considerations,"" noting total work on the pipeline was ""nearly 94% complete.""
Mountain Valley is one of several U.S. pipeline projects delayed by regulatory and legal fights with environmental and local groups which found problems with federal permits issued during President Donald Trump's administration.
When Mountain Valley construction started in February 2018, Equitrans estimated the 303-mile (488-km), 2-billion-cubic-feet-per-day (bcfd) project would cost about $3.5 billion and enter service by late 2018.

Equitrans has a 47.8% ownership interest in Mountain Valley and will operate the pipeline.
The Mountain Valley venture is owned by units of Equitrans, NextEra, Consolidated Edison Inc (NYSE:ED), AltaGas (TSX:ALA) Ltd and RGC Resources Inc.

The U.S. investment fund, which owns 37.5% of FiberCop, last year made a 10.8 billion euro ($12.2 billion) bid for Telecom Italia but has not yet received any official response and is growing impatient, the Italian daily said.
The fund does not intend to allow FiberCop to be folded into any network company, the newspaper said, citing financial sources.
KKR and TIM declined to comment.
The new management team at indebted TIM is working on a new plan that could envisage shunting the former phone monopolist's network assets into a NetCo vehicle and splitting it off from its services businesses. 
The overhaul would be an alternative to KKR's takeover proposal and could pave the way for a merger of NetCo with smaller rival Open Fiber to create a national fast-fiber network champion, sources have said.
State lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), which owns around 10% of TIM, controls 60% of Open Fiber, with the rest in the hands of Australian investment fund Macquarie.

""This move would open new scenarios (but) would not be that surprising taking into account the reluctance of TIM to deal with the offer,"" Italian broker Banca Akros said on Saturday.

1326,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 09:15PM ET</span>",U.S. judge rules for Saba Capital in closed-end fund voting litigation,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) -A U.S. federal judge ruled that Nuveen and trustees of its closed-end funds violated the Investment Company Act by stripping hedge fund Saba Capital of its full voting rights at an annual meeting.Saba filed litigation against Nuveen funds and their trustees in early 2021, arguing the asset management company illegally amended fund bylaws to prevent large shareholders from voting all of their shares. The changes resulted in shareholders only being able to vote the first 10% of their stake unless they received approval to vote the rest.
The $280 billion closed-end fund market is dominated by Nuveen, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and other investment firms, who earn fees based on a fund's levered assets. Other closed-end fund firms also amended their bylaws and this ruling could have a knock-on effect for these funds, experts said.
""Saba has the better argument on Section 18(i)’s requirement that all stock be 'voting stock',"" wrote Judge Paul Oetken in a rare summary judgment order on Thursday. ""Section 18(i)’s requirements that every stock be voting and have equal voting rights are clear and unambiguous,"" he wrote.
Saba, run by Boaz Weinstein, has launched more proxy fights at closed-end funds than any other activist in recent years. 
""The court recognized Nuveen's self-serving actions for what they are: an illegal attempt to get around the 1940 Act's clear requirement of equal voting rights,"" Weinstein told Reuters.
Nuveen is a wholly owned subsidiary of investment firm TIAA. A spokeswoman said Nuveen disagrees with the ruling and will ""determine next steps that protect long term interests of our shareholders.""
Saba has nominated director candidates at many prominent investment firms, arguing shareholders are harmed because the funds often trade at large discounts to their underlying holdings and have poor corporate governance.
Its Saba Capital Closed-End Opportunities Fund was launched in 2015 and has returned an average 12.5% per year. 
The court rejected Nuveen's argument that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission effectively allowed closed-end funds to adopt so-called control share provisions.

""There may, however, be certain venues and events where masks will be required,"" Carnival said in the statement.
Carnival also said it plans to be offer more flexibility in pre-cruise testing requirements.

(Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower on Friday after escalating tensions in Ukraine and U.S. warnings of a potential Russian invasion prompted investors to dump risky assets in the run-up to a long weekend.
The Nasdaq fell sharply, pulled down by declines in high-growth stocks, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), each down around.
Russian-backed separatists packed civilians onto buses out of breakaway regions in east Ukraine, another development in a conflict the West believes Moscow plans to use as justification for all-out invasion of its neighbor. Russia has said it has no intention to attack Ukraine, accusing the West of fear-mongering.
Speculation about the Federal Reserve's next move also weighed on equities. New York Fed Bank President John Williams said earlier in the day it would be appropriate to hike interest rates in March, without mentioning the magnitude. 
""This is a confused market, confused about Ukraine, confused about how aggressive the Fed is going to be, and pretty much ignoring very strong earnings results from the fourth quarter,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York. 
Expiration of monthly options contracts was also seen adding to the volatility ahead of the U.S. market holiday on Monday for Presidents' Day.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.68% to end at 34,079.18 points, while the S&P 500 lost 0.72% to 4,348.87. 
The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.23% to 13,548.07.
The indexes logged weekly declines for the second straight week, buffeted by rising tensions between Moscow and the West over Ukraine. For the week, the S&P 500 fell 1.6%, the Dow lost 1.9% and the Nasdaq declined 1.8%.
 Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) tumbled 5.3% to its lowest since 2020 after the chipmaker's turnaround pitch failed to impress investors worried about its loss of market share. 
About 78% of the 417 S&P 500 companies have in this reporting season posted quarterly earnings above analyst estimates as per Refinitiv data.
 Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc slumped 22% after the streaming platform's disappointing quarterly revenue and first-quarter outlook.
DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) Inc also fell 22% after the sports-betting company forecast a bigger-than anticipated 2022 loss. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.84-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.10-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 8 new 52-week highs and 28 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 19 new highs and 395 new lows.

1329,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 07:06PM ET</span>",Intel's new chip plans could turn rival AMD's fortunes- analysts,"(Corrects typographical error in paragraph 4)
By Chavi Mehta and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)'s latest focus on making chips to meet rising demand will give Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc, its biggest rival in the server and PC market, a chance to build a greater foothold in the segment, analysts said.
Intel, which plans large investments in chip technologies in the next four years, said on Thursday it expects revenue from its segment housing PCs to grow in low to mid single digits, and its datacenter and AI business to grow in high teens from 2023 through 2026.
The company's shares fell about 6%, while those of AMD slipped 1% on Friday. 
AMD's market cap briefly breached Intel's earlier this week when it closed its $50 billion Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) deal. AMD is now about $1 billion short of Intel's roughly $182 billion market cap, both far from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s $585 billion.
In servers, AMD had less than 5% market share in 2018, but now holds 15%. This could go as high as 25%, WestPark Capital analyst Ruben Roy said. In PCs, he expects AMD market share to reach high 20s from its current 18% to 20% range. 
""We think share gains will continue as Intel tries to catch up on manufacturing process tech."" 
But Wall Street is less enthused with Intel's latest chip plans, which analysts said lacked ""credibility"" amid tough competition, and include muted gross margin growth and aggressive spending.
Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar said there was no imminent threat to Nvidia and AMD from Intel's ambitious roadmap. ""Intel only plans to find its normal cadence but is not really expected to take any meaningful share.""

Once a market leader in the semiconductor space, Intel gave up its spot to Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) in 2021 for the first time since 2018,  Gartner  (NYSE:IT) data showed, while AMD jumped to the tenth spot from 14.

1331,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 06:01PM ET</span>",Airbus ordered to delay implementing Qatar jet cancellation,"By Tim Hepher
(Reuters) -A UK judge ordered planemaker Airbus to delay any practical impact of a decision to revoke a $6 billion jet order from Qatar Airways for several weeks, as two of aviation's most powerful players wage an escalating court battle.
The move effectively prevents the planemaker from allocating valuable early delivery slots for the in-demand A321neo plane to other airlines, pending an early April hearing at which Qatar Airways plans to seek an injunction reinstating the contract.
The two sides have been clashing for months about surface flaws on A350s, some of which have been grounded by Qatar over safety concerns as its airline sues Airbus for $600 million.
Airbus acknowledges quality problems but accuses the airline of mislabelling them as a safety issue to secure compensation.
The row widened in January when Airbus revoked a deal with Qatar for 50 A321neos, saying its refusal to take disputed A350s had triggered a clause linking the two plane deals.
In a Friday hearing, Qatar Airways condemned the decision.
""They took the risk and knew it would be absolutely incendiary. We have paid $330 million for this (A321neo) contract so far and they knew it was a hand grenade being thrown into our bunker,"" Qatar Airways lawyer Philip Shepherd said.
COURT BATTLE
The technical hearing gave glimpses of what looks set to be a highly charged court battle in aviation, with a hearing on Qatar's request for an injunction set for the week of April 4, and a court date on the main A350 dispute set for April 26.
Pending the first of those hearings, a UK judge rejected an Airbus request for more time to prepare and ordered the company not to do anything in the meantime that may scupper its ability to fulfil the A321neo deal if Qatar wins that part of the case.
Its lawyer Rosalind Phelps said the cancelled planes had been removed from its industrial plans and warned of damage to its supply chain if its hands were tied too severely.
The first plane is due for delivery in February 2023, with planes due to be delivered at a rate of six a year. Planemakers usually order parts up to a year ahead.
Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said on Thursday it had been forced to cancel the A321neo order to ""exercise our rights"". On Friday, he reiterated on BFM TV that Airbus was ready for an amicable solution, adding ""it takes time"". Sources close to both sides say there are no signs so far of any truce.

Reuters reported on Thursday that Qatar Airways was expected to seek a ruling to preserve the A321neo deal.
Airbus is meanwhile preparing counter-claims in the A350 case. It has cancelled two out of 23 A350s still on order for Qatar but has agreed not to look for alternative buyers for now.

1332,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 05:40PM ET</span>",Purdue's Sackler owners propose up to $6 billion opioid settlement,"By Dietrich Knauth and Tom Hals
(Reuters) -The Sackler family owners of Purdue Pharma LP have proposed a new and larger settlement worth up to $6 billion to resolve allegations that the OxyContin maker and its owners contributed to the deadly U.S. opioid epidemic, a mediator's report showed on Friday.
The mediator, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman, has been overseeing talks between Sackler family members and eight states and the District of Columbia. U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in December blocked an earlier $4.33 billion proposed settlement that would have legally shielded the family members, a decision that threatened to upend Purdue's bankruptcy reorganization.
The Sackler family members are trying to win support for a new settlement that could allow Stamford, Connecticut-based Purdue to emerge from bankruptcy.
The proposed framework would add at least $1.175 billion in cash, plus up to $500 million in proceeds from the sale of other companies owned by the family members, according to the mediator. While the agreement is not final, the mediator revealed the framework under discussion for the first time on Friday. 
All of the funds would be directed toward abatement of the opioid crisis, including support and services for survivors, victims and their families, according to Chapman.
""We remain focused on achieving our goal of providing urgently needed funds to the American people for opioid crisis abatement,"" Purdue said a statement. ""We believe a global settlement is the swiftest and most cost-effective exit path from Chapter 11 and we will continue working to build consensus.""
Not all of the states have agreed to the deal, and Chapman asked for permission from U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain, who is overseeing the Purdue case, to continue negotiations until Feb 28. That date would fall close to the March 3 expiration of legal protections that prevent the Sacklers from being sued while Purdue remains in bankruptcy.
Purdue, maker of the highly addictive OxyContin opioid pain drug, filed for bankruptcy in 2019 in the face of thousands of lawsuits accusing it and Sackler family members of fueling the opioid epidemic through deceptive marketing.
The company pleaded guilty to misbranding and fraud charges related to its marketing of OxyContin in 2007 and 2020. Sackler family members have denied wrongdoing.
McMahon ruled in December that the bankruptcy court lacked the authority to approve sweeping legal protections to shield the Sacklers from the opioid lawsuits. 
Purdue and Sackler family members have appealed McMahon's decision to the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, seeking to reinstate legal protections for the family members. Oral arguments in that appeal are scheduled for April 25. 

The size of the Sackler contribution was a source of controversy throughout Purdue's bankruptcy case. Sackler family members took out more than $10 billion from the company in the decade before it filed for bankruptcy, and they had a net worth of $14 billion in 2015, according to McMahon's decision. 
The bankruptcy court also evaluated the Sacklers' withdrawals from the company, but it concluded that there were legal and practical hurdles that made it difficult to recoup anything close to the $10 billion withdrawn.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 05:35PM ET</span>",U.S. prosecutors explore racketeering charges in short-seller probe -sources,"By Megan Davies and Chris Prentice
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors are exploring whether they can use a federal law originally enacted to take down the mafia, in a sprawling probe of hedge funds and research firms that bet against stocks, according to two sources familiar with the situation.
The Justice Department last year issued subpoenas to dozens of firms, including such well-known names as Citron Research and Muddy Waters (NYSE:WAT) Research LLC, as part of the sweeping probe focused on potentially manipulative trading around negative reports on listed companies published by some of their investors, Reuters and other media have reported.
While prosecutors haven't made any decisions yet, potential charges under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) were an option on the table, the sources said. 
In the past, prosecutors have built RICO cases alongside other allegations, such as manipulation. One of the most high profile cases brought under the RICO Act included that of Michael Milken, who was indicted in the 1980s for racketeering and securities fraud but reached a plea deal, pleading guilty to securities violations but not racketeering or insider trading.
Reuters could not ascertain which types of charges the agency was leaning toward at this stage of the investigation or whether the probe would eventually lead to charges.
Spokespeople for the Justice Department in Washington and the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, which are involved in the probe according to the sources, declined to comment.
Citron declined to comment.
A spokesperson for Muddy Waters did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The potential use of the 1970 law, which has not been previously reported, provides new insights into the scale and ambition of the investigation. The probe marks a new frontier for the Justice Department's unit in Washington tasked with rooting out corporate crime. 
A racketeering case could allow prosecutors to ensnare a broad swathe of investors involved in an alleged ""criminal enterprise,"" even if they participated indirectly, lawyers said. 
But such a case would also face more challenges than a narrower one aimed at a smaller group of people. That's in part because prosecutors have to establish a pattern of activity, they said.
Among the activities the Justice Department is investigating is whether funds conspired to perpetrate a so-called ""short and distort scheme,"" sources have previously told Reuters. 
In such a scheme the funds would have placed trades that stood to profit if a company's stock fell and then issued false or misleading negative research reports about the company.
Prosecutors are also investigating the relationships between the short-sellers who publish the reports and hedge funds and other investors that may have profited, the sources have said. 
They are examining whether there is coordinated trading designed to boost trading volumes and exaggerate price drops on news of the short reports, Reuters previously reported.
RICO charges have historically been used to combat bribery, money laundering, or drug trafficking conducted by organized criminal enterprises such as the mafia. They are unusual in the world of finance but not unprecedented. 

U.S. prosecutors in 2019 charged then-current and former JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) executives with racketeering and manipulating prices of precious metals. 
""RICO statutes haven’t been used in this realm often in recent years, but they aren’t limited to organized crime,"" Robert Frenchman of Mukasey Frenchman LLP in New York said. ""It’s certainly in the prosecutors’ toolbox.""

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index ended down 168.13 points, or 0.8%, at 21,008.20, its lowest closing level since Jan. 28. For the week, the index was down 2.5%. It follows three straight weeks of gains.
Wall Street's main stock indexes also fell as escalating tensions in Ukraine and U.S. statements of an imminent Russian invasion prompted investors to dump risky assets.

The energy sector fell 2.4% as the price of U.S. oil settled 0.8% lower at $91.07 a barrel, pressured by the prospect of increased Iranian oil exports.
Healthcare was down 3.5% and the materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 1.1%.
On the economic front, Canadian retail sales rose 2.4% in January from December, preliminary data from Statistics Canada showed, following on a 1.8% decline in December as consumers stayed home amid concerns over the Omicron coronavirus variant.

Among individual names, Air Canada gained 3.1% after the carrier reported a smaller fourth-quarter loss, powered by strong holiday demand.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A new U.S. lawsuit filed on Friday accuses L'Oreal SA of causing American shoppers to overpay for its beauty products by misleading them into thinking they are actually made in France.
Veronica Eshelby, the plaintiff in the proposed class action, said L'Oreal's labeling its products ""L'Oreal Paris"" and use of French words such as ""fini mat"" (matte finish) and ""sans huile"" (oil-free) are meant to suggest its products are French.
She said the products are in fact neither made nor sold in France, but are designed by the company's New York subsidiary for the American market, and made in its North Little Rock, Arkansas, plant or elsewhere in the United States and Canada.
Eshelby, a resident of Orange County, California, said she bought shampoo and two other products labeled L'Oreal Paris, and ""did not notice or read the fine print"" revealing the products' North American origins.
""Millions of American consumers are overpaying for L'Oreal 'Paris' products that are not what they claim to be,"" according to the complaint filed in the Manhattan federal court. ""The fine print does not stop reasonable consumers from being misled.""
L'Oreal did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for Eshelby did not immediately respond to similar requests. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.
Companies are periodically sued over their products' origins in American courts.

In 2015, Anheuser-Busch offered refunds to settle a Florida lawsuit claiming it tricked consumers into thinking it brewed Beck's beer in Germany, though production had moved in 2012 to St. Louis, Missouri.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc said on Friday it plans to further trim its summer schedule due to Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's delay in delivering 787 Dreamliner jets.
In a regulatory filing, the Texas-based carrier said it now expects to receive only 10 Dreamliner planes this year, not the 13 expected earlier. The remaining jets are now scheduled for delivery next year, it said.
As a result, American said it would temporarily suspend routes between Seattle and London, Los Angeles and Sydney, and Dallas and Santiago. The company will also delay the launch of service between Dallas and Tel Aviv, and reduce the frequency of flights between Miami and São Paulo to one a day.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the plan to trim the summer schedule.
In December, the carrier had announced plans to scrap, reduce or delay the introduction of flights to several international destinations, including Hong Kong, saying the delays in deliveries of the 787s had crimped its ability to ramp up capacity.
Reuters reported last month that deliveries of the 787 are expected to remain frozen for months as U.S. regulators review repairs and inspections over structural flaws in the jets.
American was expecting to receive the first delivery in April. However, Boeing has said that the timing would be set by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.
The Chicago-based planemaker last month unveiled a $3.5 billion pre-tax non-cash charge related to 787 delivery delays and customer concessions.

In the filing on Friday, American said the 787 Dreamliner jets remain an ""essential"" part of its fleet and that Boeing would compensate it for the delivery delays.
Last month, the carrier said the ongoing delays in 787 deliveries have added to its cost pressure.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -General Motors Co and its self-driving technology unit Cruise have petitioned U.S. regulators for permission to build and deploy a self-driving vehicle without human controls like steering wheels or brake pedals, Cruise said Friday.
Cruise said in a blog post https://www.getcruise.com/news/seeking-nhtsa-review-of-the-origin it sought permission to deploy the Cruise Origin that does not need features like a steering wheel to operate safely. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has authority to grant petitions to allow a limited number of vehicles to temporarily operate on U.S. roads that do not have required human controls.
""The submission of this petition signals that Cruise and GM are ready to build and deploy the Origin, here in America,"" Cruise wrote, saying it would expand mobility options for people who had traditionally faced barriers to reliable transportation, including seniors and the blind.
The Origin, which was developed with GM and Cruise investor Honda Motor, has two long seats facing each other that can comfortably fit four passengers. Production is expected to begin in late 2022 in Detroit at a GM factory with vehicles delivered in 2023, Cruise said Friday.
Cruise and GM first disclosed in October 2020 they planned to seek approval from NHTSA within months to deploy the Cruise Origin.
In 2018, GM petitioned NHTSA to allow a car built on a Chevrolet Bolt without steering wheels or brake pedals on U.S. roads. In late 2020, GM withdrew the petition.
NHTSA, which spent 15 months reviewing the first GM petition before seeking public comment, declined to comment Friday.
Legislation to speed deployment of self-driving cars on U.S. roads without human controls has stalled in Congress.
Under current law, companies can seek an exemption from motor vehicle safety standards for up to 2,500 vehicles for up to two years that do not meet existing federal rules.
In May 2021, Cruise urged U.S. President Joe Biden to back legislation raising the cap on the number of vehicles that a company can seek to have exempted. The rules were largely written decades ago and assumed human drivers would be in control of a vehicle.

In December, China's Geely Holding said its premium electric mobility brand, Zeekr, will make electric vehicles for Waymo, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's self-driving unit, to be deployed as fully autonomous ride-hailing vehicles across the United States.
Concept images showed a roomy, low-to-the-ground minivan without a steering wheel and with seating for about five riders.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A gauge of global stocks fell and government debt prices rose on Friday after hopes that diplomacy might resolve the Ukraine crisis faded on news Russian-backed separatists were evacuating residents from breakaway regions in the country's east.
Sentiment soured as shelling increased in eastern Ukraine and a rebel leader announced the surprise evacuation, a surprise development in a conflict the West suspects Russia will use to justify an all-out invasion of its neighbor.
The dollar rebounded and the safe-haven Swiss franc rose as a mood that had improved on news late on Thursday that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken would meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov next week darkened again. 
The dollar index, a measure of the greenback to six major trading currencies, rose 0.301%, while the euro against the franc fell 0.19%. The two currencies often are recipients of a flight to safety during times of crisis. 
The ruble weakened 1.40% at 77.16 per dollar as Russian assets have been hammered by fears that a military conflict would trigger sweeping new Western sanctions against Russia. 
Germany's foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said all options were on the table regarding sanctions on Russia if it attacks Ukraine, including the Nord Stream 2 pipeline intended to bring Russian gas to Germany.
Investors are waiting for the three-day weekend to be over to assess an equity market already weaker on the outlook that rising interest rates will hurt growth stocks, said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments.
""Coming into this weekend with geopolitical concerns and what's been a persistently weak market, a lot of people threw in the towel,"" Meckler added.
In Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 share index retreated from initial gains to close down 0.81%, with travel and banking shares leading the decline. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.85%, down almost 7% this year.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.68%, the S&P 500 lost 0.72% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.23%. All but one of the 11 S&P 500 sectors fell, with the exception being consumer staples, which do well in economic downturns. 
The worst-case scenario, after discounting an all-out war, would be Russia occupying most of Ukraine and suffering severe economic consequences, which would slow the global economy, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Funds. 
""You get a spike in inflation but the Federal Reserve will probably see that kind of spike in energy prices associated with more uncertainty as ultimately disinflationary rather than inflationary,"" Kelly said. 
""As an investor I wouldn't get out of good long-term investments because of that,"" Kelly added.
As tensions rise, history shows that investors overestimate the downside impact and underestimate the possibility of a positive resolution, said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member of hedge fund Great Hill Capital LLC.
""In the worst-case scenario that Russia does take Ukraine, hypothetically as they took Crimea, a lot of the bad news is priced in and it would be 'sell the rumor, buy the news,'"" Hayes said. 
U.S. Treasury and European government debt rose as Ukraine developments dented risk appetite. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell 5.2 basis points to 1.922%, while benchmark German 10-year bond yields were set for their biggest weekly fall since November. Bond yields fall when prices rise. 
Gold retreated slightly from the key $1,900 level. U.S. gold futures settled down 0.1% at $1,899.80 an ounce. 
Crude oil extended losses and was heading for a weekly fall as the prospect of increased Iranian oil exports eclipsed fears of potential supply disruption resulting from the Russia-Ukraine crisis. 

U.S. crude futures fell 69 cents to settle at $91.07 a barrel, while Brent, the international benchmark, settled up 57 cents at $93.54 a barrel. 
Bitcoin fell below the $40,000 mark at one point, but was last down 1.45% at $40,095.93.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) urged Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors to vote for a resolution demanding greater transparency in the iPhone maker's efforts to protect workers in its supply chain from forced labor.
Apple will hold its annual shareholder meeting on March 4.
Apple and independent third-parties audited the company's global suppliers in 2020 and found no evidence of forced labor, its latest proxy filing said. Apple also releases reports with information on the protection of its supply-chain workers.
But independent human rights investigators have reported that some Apple suppliers have participated in the Chinese government's forced labor program in the Xinjiang region, ""bringing into question the effectiveness of these policies and procedures,"" ISS said in a report to investors issued Tuesday.
A group of shareholders have asked Apple's board to prepare a report on how the company protects supply-chain workers from forced labor. The request covers the extent to which Apple has identified suppliers and sub-suppliers that are a risk for forced labor, and how many Apple has taken action against.
""The big picture dream is that Apple puts in place a much more solid set of policies and procedures, eliminating forced labor from its supply chain and living by its code of conduct which says it has zero tolerance for forced labor,"" said Vicky Wyatt, campaign director for SumOfUs, a group supporting the shareholder proposal.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in December declined an effort by Apple to skip the shareholder proposal. That same month, American lawmakers passed a bill banning imports from China's Xinjiang region over forced-labor concerns.
Apple declined to provide more details, but its proxy said the company rigorously evaluates labor and human rights risks associated with prospective suppliers before signing them up.

1341,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 04:35PM ET</span>",J&J unit proposes independent exam if it remains in bankruptcy,"By Dietrich Knauth, Tom Hals and Mike Spector
(Reuters) - A Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) subsidiary proposed on Friday that it would submit to an independent examination of the corporate restructuring the healthcare giant undertook in an attempt to settle in U.S. bankruptcy court thousands of lawsuits alleging that J&J baby powder and other talc products cause cancer.
Greg Gordon, a lawyer for J&J subsidiary LTL Management LLC, raised during a hearing before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan the idea of a court-appointed examiner that could ""come in and do whatever investigation it wants"" to determine whether the restructuring short-changed cancer victims.
Bankruptcy judges have wide discretion over the scope and budget for an appointed examiner. Any such examination would be contingent on LTL remaining in bankruptcy, an arrangement that cancer plaintiffs oppose. 
Cancer plaintiffs have asked Kaplan to dismiss LTL's bankruptcy case and allow them to resume the lawsuits against J&J. Kaplan, who presided over a week-long hearing on the matter in Trenton, New Jersey, has said he will decide by the end of the month whether to dismiss the case.
J&J is attempting to use LTL's bankruptcy case to resolve about 38,000 lawsuits alleging the company's talc products caused ovarian cancer and mesothelioma, an illness linked to asbestos exposure. J&J maintains that its talc products are safe and asbestos-free, but attorneys for LTL argued that bankruptcy is the only practical way to resolve the sheer volume of lawsuits. 
During closing arguments in the hearing, Gordon floated the option of an independent examiner to clear the air after lawyers for cancer victims argued the bankruptcy was improper.
J&J, which has a stock market value of more than $400 billion, created LTL to take on the responsibility for the cancer lawsuits in October 2021. LTL filed for bankruptcy just days later. Cancer plaintiffs have called the corporate restructuring and bankruptcy ""rotten to the core.""
Legal experts have dubbed this type of maneuver a ""Texas two-step"" because it exploited a Texas law that allows a company to split into two via a so-called divisive merger, saddling one company with liabilities while the other takes valuable assets.
Gordon said if a court-ordered investigation finds evidence of improper corporate maneuvering, the talc plaintiffs would be able to sue for fraud related to the restructuring while the bankruptcy case proceeds. 

In the bankruptcy of media company Tribune Co, an examiner found evidence of dishonesty in the media company's disastrous 2007 leveraged buyout, ultimately leading to a $200 million settlement of related fraud claims in 2019. 
Before Gordon raised the possibility of an examiner, the U.S. Justice Department's bankruptcy watchdog suggested another alternative path, saying on Thursday that the court should consider appointing a Chapter 11 trustee to take over LTL's operations from the J&J-appointment management team.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 fell for a second straight week Friday, as investors weighed intensifying Russia-Ukraine tensions against easing expectations for an aggressive Federal Reserve rate hike in March.
The S&P 500 fell 0.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.7%, or 232 points, the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.2%.
Russian-backed separatists are believed to have evacuated its citizens from Donetsk in Eastern Ukraine, deepening fears that Moscow was creating false provocation to invade Ukraine.
Fresh fears of an imminent Russia invasion of Ukraine comes as the U.S. and its allies said that Russia has been beefing up its military presence on the Ukraine border, casting doubt on reports that Moscow had recalled some of its troops from the area.
President Joe Biden is set to provide an update on the Russia-Ukraine security crisis this afternoon from the White House.
The geopolitical tensions have dampened investor bets on a 50 basis point rate hike at the Federal Reserve’s March meeting, with odds of larger hike falling to 18% from about 90% earlier this week.
The prospect of a rate hike in March, however, remains priced in, with New York Fed President John Williams saying Friday the Fed should “steadily” hike rates starting in March.
Falling expectations for aggressive Fed monetary policy tightening weighed on U.S. Treasury yields, but tech continued to come under pressure.  
Technology led the market lower as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) were off session lows.  
Energy ended lower even as oil prices cut some losses after the U.S. and its allies said they wouldn't sanction Russian oil and gas in the event of an invasion of Ukraine. Sentiment on oil prices has soured recently on the growing prospect of a U.S.-Iran nuclear deal, which would remove the export ban on Iranian oil.
“If it had not been for reports that agreement was supposedly imminent in the nuclear talks with Iran, oil prices would have probably already attempted to overcome the $100 per barrel mark,” Commerzbank said in a note.
Mostly underwhelming quarterly earnings, meanwhile, didn’t offer much respite for stocks.
 Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) fell 22% after its quarterly revenue fell short of Wall Street estimates, while softer guidance amid supply chain woes also weighed on sentiment.
DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) slipped 21% as its forecast for a wider-than-expected loss offset quarterly results that beat analysts’ estimates on both the top and bottom lines.
Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) fell 4% following softer-than-expected first-quarter revenue guidance offset fourth-quarter results that topped expectations."

The move comes against the backdrop of unionization efforts gaining momentum at large U.S. corporations, including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX).
The report said employee groups at at least two Apple retail stores are backed by major national unions and are preparing to file paperwork with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in the near future.
At least six more locations are at less advanced stages in the unionization process, the report said, adding that Apple employees more than 65,000 retail workers.
Apple and the NLRB did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Apple has 270 stores in the country and made 36% of its total $365.82 billion net sales in fiscal 2021 through its retail stores and website, according to a regulatory filing.
Its boss Tim Cook's pay last year was 1,447 times that of the average employee at the tech giant, fueled by stock awards that helped him earn a total of nearly $100 million.

The company had decided to temporarily shutter several outlets across the United States during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Last year, it planned to give store workers one-time bonus of as much as $1,000, Bloomberg News had reported in September, amid tight labor market conditions and unrest among employees.

Investing.com -- Shares of  Roku  Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) closed significantly lower Friday after the streaming company reported fourth-quarter earnings that saw revenue miss expectations and guidance for the first quarter fall short of expectations.
The company announced earnings per share of 17 cents on revenue of $865.33 million. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of 6 cents on revenue of $896.94 million.
The report resulted in Roku shares closing Friday down 22.34%, adding to Thursday's 10.37% loss before it posted earnings. 
Roku sees first-quarter revenue at $720 million. However, this was below the consensus of $748.5 million for the quarter.
The company said its slower growth was due to supply chain disruptions in the television market, which it expects to continue into 2022. 
The report prompted Pivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak to downgrade the stock from to sell from hold. Wlodarczak said in a note that ""the bottom line is with increasing competition, a potential significantly weakening global economy, a market that is NOT rewarding non-profitable tech names with long pathways to profitability and our new target price we are reducing our rating on ROKU from HOLD to SELL.""
In contrast, Needham analyst Laura Martin was bullish in her note following the report, saying the firm is is a buyer “on weakness.”"

The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said in a statement published on its website that some companies were engaging in illegal fund-raising, fraud, and virtual real estate speculation.
""Beware of being duped, and if you find clues of suspected illegal crimes, please actively report this to the relevant local departments,"" the statement said.

Investors，entrepreneurs, and established Chinese tech giants have piled into the country's ""metaverse"", described as a virtual shared space that blurs the boundaries between the online and offline worlds. But the fervour has received mixed reactions from Chinese authorities.
While the ruling Communist Party and state media have issued calls for caution and warned about the risk of a metaverse bubble popping due to over-speculation and financing, some local governments have held symposiums on the topic and also described how it could be used to spread Party ideology.

(Reuters) - Technology that merges the virtual and physical worlds could start to become a reality for consumers in a few years, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms Inc has told advertising agencies, giving more details of its vision for the creation of the metaverse.
Mixed reality (MR) technology could allow a person wearing an MR headset to use a real world object to trigger a virtual world reaction, like hitting a video game character with a real world baseball bat, for instance. 
It is one of three types of extended reality technologies often associated with the metaverse. Augmented reality exists, with mobile games like Pokemon Go, but players cannot affect the digital world with a physical object. Virtual reality headsets, like Meta's Oculus, immerse users into a fully virtual world where they can interact with the environment. 
The comments from Meta came on a Zoom call with ad agencies on Thursday, which was scheduled to help advertisers better understand the metaverse, said an agency executive who attended the call. It was Meta's first roundtable discussion with agencies about the metaverse. 
The estimate of mixed reality being a few years away brings additional detail to the timeline of building the metaverse, the futuristic idea of a network of virtual worlds that can be accessed from different devices, which Meta has said could take a decade to build.
Some mixed reality headsets are available, but are not yet geared toward general consumers. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s HoloLens 2, which was introduced in 2019, retails for $3,500 and is geared for workplace use.
At its annual Connect conference in October, Meta announced Project Cambria, a headset that will feature mixed reality capabilities and include face and eye tracking. The headset is expected to be released this year. 
In the meantime, Meta continued to advise advertisers to experiment with augmented reality ads, such as photo and video filters that overlay digital images onto the real world, the ad agency executive said. The comments reiterated Meta's pitch at ad industry conferences.
Meta said brands could partner with content creators on AR ads or use the technology for virtual clothing try-ons.
The roundtable with agencies lacked detail on what ad formats could be built for the metaverse, or what specific controls would be in place to prevent brands from appearing next to unsuitable content or actions, the agency executive said. 

Advertisers are also looking for detail on how the effectiveness of ads in the metaverse will be measured, and will be asking ""what did I get for my money?"" the executive said. 
A Meta spokesperson declined to comment.

1349,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 02:40PM ET</span>","As stocks swing, investors bet choppy markets are here to stay","By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - After a turbulent start to the year, investors are betting stock market volatility isn’t going away anytime soon. 
While tensions between Russia and Ukraine have been the most recent driver of stock market gyrations, many expect inflation, uncertainty over monetary policy and stretched valuations to keep stirring asset prices this year, even if geopolitical fears subside.
The Cboe Volatility Index, often called Wall Street's ""fear gauge,” recently stood at 29, some 11 points higher than its historical median. Volatility futures at least eight months out show markets pricing increased stock market gyrations for much of the year.
Some 78% of U.S. investment professionals responsible for fund selection and portfolio construction anticipate a rise in stock market volatility in 2022, according to a recently released Natixis Investment Managers Survey.
""This is not just Ukraine ... investors understand that this is not going to be an easy year, "" said Arnim Holzer, global macro strategist at Easterly EAB Risk Solutions, which provides risk mitigation strategies for institutional investors. 
Plunging stock markets in the wake of COVID-19 shattered a long period of placid trading and took the VIX to an all-time high of 85 in March 2020. 
While the VIX has retreated as stocks more than doubled from their lows, it has not closed below last decade’s median level of 15 in more than two years, one of several signs pointing to expectations of more market swings to come.
""We don't necessarily see new post-COVID lows for the VIX anytime soon,"" said Max Grinacoff, equity derivative strategist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), who has been recommending strategies such as put options spreads, which are designed to offer protection against volatility. 
The S&P 500 is down 8% this year after rising 27% in 2021, while yields on the 10-year Treasury are up about 42 basis points year-to-date in anticipation that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy as it fights to tamp down inflation. 
The gyrations haven’t been confined to stocks. The ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofAML U.S. Bond Market Option Volatility Estimate Index - a one-month measure of expected volatility in Treasuries - stands near two year highs, while corporate bonds have also slid. 
Elevated stock market valuations pose another danger if volatility persists, investors said. 
The S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio on a forward 12-month basis stands at 25.5, a 38% premium to its 20-year average, according to Refinitiv Datastream. 
The elevated valuations could make stocks more vulnerable to bad news, potentially increasing volatility, said Patrick Kaser, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management.
""Anything less than an orderly outcome is almost certainly a downside scenario for equities,"" Kaser said. 
Kaser is favoring stocks and sectors he believes will be comparatively less volatile, including chemicals, banks and healthcare. 
Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts recommended investors buy call options, which target higher prices, on interest rate sensitive stocks including financials like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).
""Higher interest rates have been a key driver of equity market volatility in recent weeks,"" they wrote in a report earlier this week. ""We believe it is important for investors to have rate-reactive instruments in their financial toolkit.""
Not everyone believes higher volatility will persist. Analysts at JP Morgan said on Friday that markets have likely priced in monetary policy and inflation risks. They recommended investors buy bearish put options on the VIX that would increase in value if the index fell by July, a seasonally quiet period for volatility.
Others however, are betting calm won’t return anytime soon.
""I would be expecting still some months of volatility for all risky assets,"" said Antonio Cavarero, head of investments at Generali (MI:GASI) Insurance Asset Management in Milan, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Thursday. 

""I probably am a bit more confident in the second part of the year, but from now until then, it probably is going to be a choppy ride,"" he said.

Lithium-ion batteries in the electric cars on board the vehicle carrier Felicity Ace have caught fire and the blaze requires specialist equipment to extinguish, captain Joao Mendes Cabecas of the port of Hortas said.
It was not clear whether the batteries first sparked the fire.
""The ship is burning from one end to the other... everything is on fire about five metres above the water line,"" Cabecas said.
Pictures provided by the Portuguese maritime authority showed severe burns on the bow and along the 200-metre-long 200 meters (220-yard-long) side of the ship, which according to Refinitiv data was built in 2005 and can carry 17,738 tonnes of weight.
Towing boats were on route from Gibraltar and the Netherlands, with three due to arrive by Wednesday, Cabecas said. He added the vessel could not be towed to the Azores because it was so big it would block trade at the port.
A 16-person salvage team from Smit Salvage, owned by Dutch marine engineer Boskalis, was sent to the ship to help control the flames, Boskalis said.
The Panama-flagged ship, owned by Snowscape Car Carriers SA and managed by Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd, was travelling from Emden, Germany - where Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has a factory - to Davisville in the United States, based on the Maritime Traffic website.

The 22 crew members on board were evacuated on Wednesday, when the fire broke out, with no one hurt, Portugal's navy said in a statement.
Around 1,100 Porsches and 189 Bentleys were on board, spokespeople for the car brands owned by Volkswagen said. Audi, another Volkswagen brand, confirmed some of its vehicles were also on the ship but did not state how many.
Volkswagen did not confirm the total number of cars on board and said it was awaiting further information.

YouTuber Matt Farah, whose automotive review channel ""The Smoking Tire"" has more than a million followers, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) he was contacted by a car dealer who said the Porsche he ordered was aboard the ship.

1351,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 02:21PM ET</span>",JPMorgan sees higher net interest income; return target nears,"By David Henry
(Reuters) -JPMorgan Chase & Co expects its core net interest income to grow to $53 billion in 2022, up $3 billion from its prior forecast, and said it could reach its return target sooner than widely expected. 
Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said on Friday that it is ""entirely plausible"" the bank could deliver a 17% return on tangible common equity in 2023, a year or more earlier than many analyst models predict.
Barnum said that markets revenue in the first quarter is on course to be better than expected, though still down ""a little bit more than 10%"" from its exceptional level a year earlier.
Speaking at a conference hosted by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Barnum mostly addressed JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s financial prospects, but also said ""our base case is very positive"" on how the U.S. economy will fare with inflation and changes in monetary policy.
JPMorgan shares were up slightly Friday afternoon in contrast to declines in the shares of other big banks. 
JPMorgan's new outlook for net interest income is based on an expectation of six interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve this year. The prior outlook in January had assumed three to four hikes.
The change follows predictions by analysts that banks will get a significant lift in net interest income in 2022. It builds on JPMorgan's estimate last month that net interest income from its businesses outside of securities markets would increase 12% to $50 billion this year from 2021.
Barnum said loan growth will contribute to the gains.
The return target is coming into reach partly because JPMorgan is finding ""a bunch of offsetting tools"" for the higher capital requirements it faces under a mix of changing rules, Barnum said.
""We feel really good about the 17%,"" Barnum said.
The outlook for markets revenue is better, Barnum said, partly because of increased volatility in fixed-income trading as markets adjust to expectations for changes in central bank policies that impact short- and long-term rates.
""That type of dynamic global rate environment tends to be quite supportive of the fixed-income business,"" Barnum said.

The bank will not spend more than planned on business investments in light of the additional net interest income expected, he said in response to a question.
JPMorgan, which has been getting questions from analysts and investors about its increased spending, has decided to hold an ""investor day"" conference within the next few months, Barnum said.

1353,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 02:00PM ET</span>","Italy approves 8 billion euro package to help economy, curb energy bills","By Giuseppe Fonte and Gavin Jones
ROME (Reuters) -Italy's government on Friday approved measures worth around 6 billion euros ($6.81 billion) to help consumers and firms hit by a rise in energy bills, as part of an 8 billion euro package to support the economy.
The latest price-capping scheme in the energy sector comes on top of some 10 billion euros budgeted since last July to try and soften surging oil and gas prices.
Prime Minister Mario Draghi told a news conference the government had also found resources to help the struggling automotive sector.
With public finances better than forecast, funding for the latest spending could be found elsewhere in the state budget without resorting to extra borrowing, Economy Minister Daniele Franco said at the news conference.
""This year's deficit will not exceed the target of 5.6% of gross domestic product,"" Franco said.
Ministers provided little detail of the latest measures, but a draft of the decree seen by Reuters showed some 3 billion euros of the energy package will go to cut a range of ""system-cost"" levies.
The levies, which help finance measures ranging from solar power subsidies to nuclear decommissioning, typically account for more than 20% of Italian retail energy bills.
Employers association Confindustria has estimated that energy bills will cost industry some 37 billion euros this year compared with 20 billion euros in 2021.
Rome also plans to introduce simplification measures to speed up the construction of renewable power plants, Ecological Transition Minister Roberto Cingolani said at the news conference.
Cingolani detailed measures to boost domestic gas production to around 5 billion cubic metres from the current output of 3.2 billion. He said the government is also studying ways to have Italy's gas storage system filled to at least 90% of capacity starting in the storage year 2022-2023.
Storage currently stands at around 40% of capacity.
Italy has 20 billion cubic metres of storage capacity, of which 4.5 billion cubic metres are strategic reserves overseen by the government which can only be used in emergency situations. 
Gas storage is typically filled during the summer season before being used in the winter.
Industry Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti said the Cabinet had set aside 1 billion euros per year for eight years to support the automotive sector.
Additional funds will be allocated to support research and development in microprocessor technology, Giorgetti added.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and the Italian government are in talks over investments expected to be worth around 8 billion euros to build an advanced semiconductor packaging plant.

By Isla Binnie and Emma Rumney
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African miner Exxaro and Chinese state fund CNIC are among potential buyers admitted to the final round of bidding for African renewable energy firm Lekela Power - a company worth around $2 billion, a number of sources familiar with the deal told Reuters. 
    African Infrastructure Investment Managers (AIIM), an arm of Old Mutual, has advanced to the final stages alongside Exxaro, two sources said. Another two sources said CNIC was in the final bidding round. All sources spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Private equity firm Actis' plans to sell its 60% stake in Lekela were first reported last year, but 40% shareholder Mainstream Power is also looking to cash out as well, three sources familiar with the decision said, with one adding it was being advised by Citi alongside Actis.
Actis, which founded Lekela with Mainstream in 2015, values the company at $1.9 billion, according to its website.
Lekela develops utility-scale renewable power projects in Africa. It has 1.3 GW of projects in Egypt, Ghana and South Africa and lays claim to building the first ever utility-scale wind farm in Senegal, according to its website.
AIIM, advised by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), is currently seen as the frontrunner, two of the sources familiar with the deal said. 
China Guangdong Nuclear Power and the country's State Power Investment Corporation were also looking to bid, one of those people and one of the other sources said, but it was not clear whether they had proceeded. 
Two of the sources also added that Shell (LON:RDSa) had expressed interest in the assets, while Reuters previously reported British government-owned power firm Globeleq had considered bidding. It was not clear if either advanced in the process.
Mainstream Power, AIIM, Lekela, Exxaro,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Shell declined to comment. Actis, Goldman Sachs, Globeleq and China Guangdong Nuclear Power did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It was not immediately possible to reach CNIC and the State Power Investment Corporation. 
Plentiful wind, sun and hydropower potential mean Africa is seen as fertile ground to develop energy sources that emit no planet-warming carbon dioxide and could also help stabilise electricity systems plagued by routine blackouts. 
Exxaro sells coal both at home in South Africa and abroad, and is a top supplier to South Africa's state run power utility Eskom. It said last year it would stop investing in new thermal coal assets and is on a push to transition to cleaner business lines. 
China has been investing heavily in Africa for years and is now the continent's biggest trading partner, according to the International Institute for Sustainable Development.

Investing.com --  AMN Healthcare Services Inc  (NYSE:AMN) — the temporary healthcare staffing company — reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations for earnings and revenue.
AMN shares jumped 10% above Thursday's close at $103.31. Earlier in the session, they hit a high of $109.73. 
The company posted earnings per share of $2.95, above consensus expectations of $2.52. Revenue was $1.36 billion, compared to expectations of $1.28 billion.
AMN benefitted from the demand for workforce staffing and technology solutions during 2021, which has continued this year. They put the demand increase down to healthcare organizations experiencing record job vacancies, high turnover from employee burnout, quarantined workers, retirements, and changing worker preferences for more career flexibility.
""The accelerating nurse shortage has captured nationwide attention, including the essential role of the healthcare staffing industry to enable nurses to quickly mobilize and deliver patient care in all areas of the country. But the labor shortages and increased need for workforce solutions span far beyond nursing,"" said Susan Salka, Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare
""Our allied staffing business hit an all-time high for travelers on assignment so far in the first quarter, and our locum tenens division saw demand surge by 25% from Q3 to Q4 and continues to be strong entering 2022,"" she added.
Looking forward, the company sees first quarter revenue between $1.475 billion and $1.515 billion, above the consensus of $1.14 billion.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -General Electric Co warned on Friday that a supply chain logjam coupled with a labor crunch and inflation will pressure profits through the first half of the year.
The Boston-based industrial conglomerate, however, did not change its 2022 earnings forecast. In a regulatory filing, the company said the forecast, which was shared with investors last month, had factored in supply-chain and inflationary challenges.
GE expects adjusted profit in the range of $2.80 per share to $3.50 per share in 2022, compared with $1.71 per share last year. Full-year free cash flow is estimated at $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion, up from $2.6 billion in 2021.
The company's shares were down 5.6% at $92.94 in early afternoon trade.
Roughly two years into the coronavirus pandemic that has snarled supply chains across the globe and driven up costs for everything from labor to raw materials, companies of all sizes are scrambling not just to produce enough to feed current demand - but to also restock inventory shelves.
Last month, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) said it would delay releasing new vehicles until next year because of supply chain breaks that the electric car maker said could last through this year.
Siemens Gamesa, the world's largest maker of offshore wind turbines, has issued three profit warnings in nine months, citing supply-chain problems.
GE said it was grappling with supply-chain issues across most of its businesses. It said raw material and labor shortages, along with soaring costs, were adversely impacting its healthcare, renewable energy and aviation units.
In response, the company said it is raising prices and trying to keep a lid on costs. It is trying to source alternative parts to help deal with shortages. 

""While these improvements will take time to show in our results, we continue to see strong demand which will support our growth throughout the year,"" GE said.

Investing.com – Shake Shack stock (NYSE:SHAK) plunged 8% Friday after the burger chain’s first-quarter forecast left traders unimpressed.
While the company is forecasting a 26% to 30% year-on-year jump in first-quarter revenue to $196 million to $201.4 million, a big erosion in Shack-level operating profit margin is a possibility. According to the forecast, the OPM could fall to 11% from 15% a year ago. On the most optimistic side, the margin is seen at 14%, still down a percentage point.
The margin erosion would have been worse, but the company is promising a price hike. Shake Shack will jack up prices in March and increase its third-party delivery menu prices, Reuters quoted CEO Randy Garutti as saying during an earnings call.
Successive waves of Covid-19 have disturbed operations at its restaurants, keeping diners confused about their repeated opening and closing though full-year same-Shack sales exceeded 2019 levels.
Same-Shack sales define sales at domestic company-operated Shacks open for at least 24 full financial year months.
“While a return to pre-Covid movement patterns remains uncertain, we are pleased to see improvement through fiscal February, with same-Shack sales up approximately 13% month to date,"" Garutti said in a statement, holding out hope for the current quarter.
Total revenue in the fourth quarter rose 29% to exceed $203 million. The net loss almost halved and was just over $10 million.
Same-store sales in Shake Shack's urban restaurants, which account for over half of its topline, declined 4% as many city dwellers moved to the suburbs during the pandemic. That helped comparable sales at suburban restaurants gain 9%.

Verona-based doValue, 28.3% owned by Japan's SoftBank Group, was set up in 2015 when UniCredit spun off its debt servicing arm in a deal with Fortress Investment Group, the U.S. fund that was later bought by SoftBank.
UniCredit and doValue signed at the time a debt management agreement which has provided doValue with a steady revenue flow.
The company later worked to expand its business, moving into the Spanish and Greek non-performing loan (NPL) markets.
Milan-based broker Equita this month flagged potential risks for doValue after Reuters reported that UniCredit was in talks with rival bad debt firm Prelios over a 2 billion euro portfolio of ""unlikely to pay"" loans.
UniCredit late last year invited offers to manage a 1 billion euro UTP portfolio with a view to evaluating how the selected partner performed versus the bank's in-house collections ahead of considering further UTP deals, sources close to the matter have told Reuters.
UniCredit declined to comment.
The sources said Prelios, which has offered not just to manage the loans but has lined up investors to buy twice the value of the original portfolio, was set to prevail over rivals including doValue. Prelios declined to comment.
Asked about the implications of UniCredit's UTP transaction on Friday during a post-results analyst call, doValue CEO Andrea Mangoni downplayed the risks for his group.
""First, our current projections in terms of new non-performing loans inflows from UniCredit are extremely conservative,"" he said.

""Second, we're currently discussing with UniCredit the extension of our current contract in terms of size.""
""So the impact of the UTP disposal process currently under way is definitely negligible on our results.""

(Reuters) - Steady sales of pacemakers and heart stents may have likely helped  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT) Plc offset weak demand for its other medical devices, in a quarter that saw an Omicron-led surge in COVID-19 cases and staffing crisis at most U.S. hospitals.
Overwhelmed by soaring infections and shortages of nurses and other healthcare workers, hospitals had to put off non-critical surgical procedures, denting demand for knee and spine implants made by companies such as Medtronic and Zimmer Biomet. 
""Medtronic has areas you know, for example, in cardiac surgery ... those procedures are not seeing delays, but in areas where we can defer like spine, spinal cord stimulation, that's where they're going to see more of an impact,"" said BTIG analyst Ryan Zimmerman.
""So it's less severe for Medtronic, but it's certainly generally going to lower their fiscal third-quarter 2022 numbers."" 
Medtronic's heart devices unit has boosted revenue - https://graphics.reuters.com/MEDTRONIC-PREVIEW/dwpkrjxxnvm/chart.png 
THE CONTEXT 
** During its second quarter ended Oct. 29, the hit to sales of some of Medtronic's products such as its spinal devices, which rely on elective procedures, was offset by the strength in its business that sells critical implants including pacemakers and other heart devices.
** Smaller rivals Zimmer Biomet and Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE:EW) have said the pressure on elective procedures has continued early into the year.

Investing.com --  General Electric  Company (NYSE:GE) shares tumbled 5% on Friday after a regulatory filing containing the company's investor newsletter pointed to supply chain challenges.
The company continues to ""see supply chain pressure"" across most of its businesses as ""material and labor availability and inflation are affecting Healthcare, Renewable Energy and Aviation.""
GE expects the challenges to persist through the first half of the year. The pressures have been included in its annual guidance, but the magnitude of the challenges is likely to present pressure to overall growth, profit, and free cash flow throughout the first quarter and the first half of the year, beyond expected seasonality.
""As a result, supply chain headwinds may continue to partially mask the significant progress we are making across our business,"" GE said.
The company reported its fourth quarter earnings in late January, beating analyst predictions on earnings per share but missing revenue expectations.

""We expect a profit in 2022. But uncertainty factors such as Russia, China, inflation and the interest rate environment are difficult to assess,"" he said.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank has been plagued by scandal and last week reported a $2.2 billion quarterly loss. It said 2022 earnings would be weighed down by restructuring and compensation costs.
Gottstein said he was convinced the bank's strategy of focusing even more on wealth management would pay off in the long run.

Investing.com – Cognex stock (NASDAQ:CGNX) surged 7% Friday after the company beat fourth quarter estimates that helped its annual revenue cross the $1 billion mark.
Fourth quarter revenue rose 9% to $244 million as economies recovered and there was greater momentum toward automation at factories and distribution centers, places where its machine vision systems, sensors and barcode readers are most used.
Logistics and automotive contributed the most to fourth quarter revenue while consumer electronics was a drag. Gross margin eroded by 3 percentage points to 72% due to higher supply chain costs and a global shortage of components.
Gross margin in the current quarter is expected to be in the low-70% range, similar to the level in the same period last year.
CGNX forecasts current quarter revenue of $275 million to be the midpoint of the guidance range. According to the company, demand from the logistics market remains strong and delivery lead times are improving.
Net profit in the fourth quarter fell 23% to $53 million, owing to narrower margins, foreign currency loss and other income loss, compared to a large foreign currency gain and higher other income last year."
1370,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 11:09AM ET</span>",Nasdaq Sinks Into Death Cross After 15% Drop From November Peak,"(Bloomberg) -- The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled into an ominous “death cross” technical formation Friday morning for the first time since April 2020, when the pandemic battered the global economy and U.S. equity markets swooned.
The index has shed 15% since touching a record high on Nov. 19. The pattern, which is used by some investors to assess longer-term trends, has at times presaged further weakness. It appears when an index’s short-term 50-day moving average crosses below its longer-term 200-day moving average, 
The formation occurred in June 2000 when the dot-com bubble burst and again in January 2008 ahead of the global financial crisis.
“When you hear ‘death cross’ your antenna goes up,” Jay Woods, chief markets strategist at DriveWealth Institutional, said in a phone interview. “It doesn’t always mean doom and gloom is coming. It just means we’ll likely be in a more extended downtrend.”
With inflation surging, the Federal Reserve is preparing for its sharpest monetary policy tightening in decades in an attempt to bring down prices. This has sparked wild swings among the rate-sensitive tech, Internet and growth stocks that fill the Nasdaq Composite, since their elevated valuations become targets as borrowing costs rise. 
To be sure, a death cross has historically been a lagging indicator, meaning that by the time it appears, the move has already occurred in stocks. For instance, the Nasdaq entered a death cross in April 2020 but the index actually bottomed in March of that year, Woods explained. 
“This could actually be a buying opportunity for longer-term investors since stock prices are getting cheaper,” Woods added. 
Since 1971, there have been 31 death crosses for the Nasdaq Composite, according to data compiled by Potomac Fund Management. The index rose over the next 21 days 71% of the time, and it was higher six months later 77% of the time.
“A signal like the death cross has preceded major drawdowns in the past, but there hasn’t always been a major market decline following one,” said Dan Russo, portfolio manager at Potomac Fund Management. “Market breadth is still a concern for investors right now, but as long as we stay above the January lows, it will likely be choppy consolidation. If we fall below those lows though, I think it’s a good idea to manage your risk.”

Investing.com -- Quidel Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL), the diagnostic healthcare products manufacturer, reported its fourth quarter numbers after the bell Thursday, beating analyst expectations on revenue and earnings.
The company's shares have rallied over 15% as a result. 
Quidel posted earnings per share of $7.29 on revenue of $636.9 million. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $5.61 on revenue of $540.9 million.
However, revenue fell from the $809.2 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Quidel said the decline was caused mainly by a $249 million revenue decline of the Sofia 2 Flu + SARS antigen FIA. In addition, there was a shift in the product mix for rapid immunoassay COVID-19 products from higher-priced Sofia products sold in the professional market to lower-priced QuickVue products sold in the retail, pharmacy, and employer testing markets.
Revenue from COVID-19 products rose to $511.8 million from $405.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, with Douglas Bryant, President and CEO of Quidel, saying demand for COVID-19 testing remains elevated.
The company launched the Savanna MDx instrumented system in select markets during the quarter. Commenting on the system, Bryant said it is a ""key near-term opportunity"" for the company.
""Based on customer reviews in Europe, we believe Savanna will be a major growth driver, both in the U.S. and globally, for years to come,"" he added."

LONDON (Reuters) - Volta Trucks said on Friday that it had raised 230 million euros ($260 million) in Series C funding round, which will finance it through the launch of series production of its Volta Zero electric truck in late 2022.
Stockholm-based Volta Trucks, which also operates in the UK, said that the funding round was led by hedge fund Luxor Capital, which had previously invested in Volta Trucks.
Initial seed investor Byggmastare Anders J Ahlstrom Holding AB also participated in the funding round, which brings the total Volta Trucks has raised to around 300 million euros.
Protoypes of the Volta Zero, a 16-tonne fully-electric truck, will be delivered to customers in mid-2022, with series production due to start in late 2022.
Startups and traditional automakers are rushing to bring electric models to market as they face looming bans on fossil-fuel vehicles in China and Europe.
The latest funding ""gives us the financial runway to be able to deliver on all our goals as we transition from a start-up to a manufacturer of full-electric trucks,"" Volta Trucks Chief Executive Essa Al-Saleh said in a statement.
The company said its order book now exceeds 5,000 vehicles with a value of 1.2 billion euros.

The funding will also fund the development of 7.5-tonne and 12-tonne electric trucks.
Volta Trucks plans to make 5,000 trucks at its plant in Steyr, Austria, in 2023, and annual production should rise to 27,000 by 2025.

Investing.com – Bloomin’ Brands stock surged 11% Friday after a spate of positive news at the company that included an estimate-beating fourth quarter and the restoration of the quarterly dividend.
The company also plans to buy back shares worth up to $125 million.
“Over the past year we executed against our strategy resulting in sustained gains in off-premises, higher digital engagement, and improved operational efficiencies in the restaurants. As we move into 2022, we are well positioned to deliver on our long-term goals of growing sales,” CEO David Deno said in a press release.
Total revenue in the fourth quarter rose 29%, to top $1 billion, as more restaurants reopened after the pandemic and in-restaurant dining recovered. Revenue exceeded 2019 levels.
Operating margin improved because of higher comparable restaurant sales from in-restaurant dining and strong retention of off-premises sales, and higher franchise revenue. This was partially offset by higher labor costs and inflation in commodities and rent.
During the quarter, the company decided against replicating the significant promotional activity from 2019 at Outback Steakhouse, the largest of its four chains that include Carrabba's Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill and Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar.
The casual dining restaurant chain is forecasting 2022 revenue to be $4.3 billion to $4.35 billion with adjusted profit per share at $2.40 at the midpoint of its guidance range. It sees commodity inflation to be 11% to 13% in the year with labor inflation in high single digits.
Current-quarter revenue is seen between $1.1 billion and $1.13 billion.

OSLO (Reuters) -Norwegian Air may order jets from Airbus in the future unless ongoing litigation with Boeing (NYSE:BA) over previous aircraft cancellations is resolved in a timely fashion, the carrier's chief executive told Reuters on Friday. 
Norwegian, which flies a Boeing-only fleet, emerged from bankruptcy protection last May but is still locked in a dispute over the cancellation of pre-pandemic orders for 97 Boeing aircraft, which is to be decided in U.S. legal proceedings.
It however managed to get a similar contract over deliveries from Airbus terminated.
Top executives of Norwegian, including Chief Executive Geir Karlsen, last month met with an Airbus sales team, Reuters reported at the time. Karlsen on Friday said this was part of a long-running dialogue.
""We see it as, shall we say, problematic to construct a fleet plan going forward with Boeing while we are sitting in the middle of a litigation with them,"" Karlsen said on the sidelines of a corporate earnings presentation.
""So we need to decide on what to do going forward and if it is even at all possible to come to a commercial deal with Boeing. We wish for that, but we haven't succeeded so far,"" he said.
Boeing had no immediate comment, and an Airbus spokesman declined to comment.
Norwegian operated 51 Boeing 737 aircraft last year and has agreed leasing deals to expand this to 70 this year.
However, under the lease terms some of the aircraft can be substituted for ""new technology narrow-body aircraft from either Boeing or Airbus"", the two top rivals in the commercial aircraft market.
""We wish really to have a fleet which is partly owned and partly leased, and if we are going to do a new aircraft order again, time is sort of running away, you can say,"" Karlsen said.
He declined to comment on how urgently a decision was needed.

Norwegian and Airbus agreed in February last year on terms to repudiate the carrier's remaining contract for 88 new aircraft, lawyers representing the two firms told Ireland's High Court. Among the terms, Airbus was to keep deposits and was still owed 600,000 pounds ($816,540) by Norwegian.

1377,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 10:11AM ET</span>","Back in the black, Renault looks to tap into electric boom","By Gilles Guillaume and Piotr Lipinski
PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) is looking at creating separate divisions for electric and combustion engine cars, an idea other automakers have resisted in case it weakens their ability to use profits from polluting vehicles to fund a cleaner future. 
The French automaker announced its ""strategic studies"" on Friday as it reported an annual profit for the first time in three years and said its turnaround plan was ahead of schedule. 
With its finances on a surer footing, the company is now accelerating efforts to catch up with the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), whose share prices have soared as they take a lead in the switch to electric vehicles. 
In a presentation to investors, Renault said a ""pure electric entity"" could be focused on France and be open to partnerships, while a separate one for combustion engine and hybrid cars could be focused outside France and do the same. 
Spain is Renault's main hub for hybrid powertrain production. The company sources combustion engines from Romania, Turkey and South Korea.
The growing preference among investment managers for companies focused on low-carbon technology has helped Tesla become the world's highest-valued automaker, and led some investors and analysts to urge other carmakers to consider separating their combustion engine and electric businesses. 
However, companies such as General Motors (NYSE:GM) have resisted those calls, arguing profits from petrol and diesel vehicles will fund the transition to electric ones. 
European governments are pushing automakers to phase out combustion engines, and the Renault car brand has said it is aiming to be all-electric in Europe by 2030. But other markets, including Latin America, Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe, are expected to continue using petrol and diesel for longer.
'RENAULUTION'
Renault also said its finance chief of six years, Clotilde Delbos, would move to lead its Mobilize business full time. 
The business, which covers areas such as car sharing and data management, is part of its strategy to achieve carbon neutrality in Europe by 2040. 
Delbos will continue as deputy to CEO Luca de Meo and be succeeded as finance chief by her current second-in-command deputy, Thierry Pieton.
De Meo is leading a wide-ranging restructuring effort under the name ""Renaulution"" aiming to cut costs and emphasize value over sales volume. 
Rocked by the 2018 arrest of Carlos Ghosn, the architect of its alliance with Japan's Nissan (OTC:NSANY), Renault was then hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
But now de Meo's efforts are bearing fruit, 
Last month, Renault and Nissan said they would work more closely together on electric vehicles, as they detailed a five-year, $26 billion investment plan.
Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Nissan and other alliance partner Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF) were only recently informed that Renault might move its internal combustion engine and hybrid operations into a separate entity.
But they said in almost identical emailed statements to Reuters that they ""believe this step to be a preparation for the next stages of the Renaulution plan,"" adding they would ""continue to collaborate as an alliance partner.""
Asked whether the plan might change the alliance structure, de Meo said: ""It's a project that on paper we are capable to do on our own, we don't need anyone to do it, but obviously we will leave the door open to our partners in case they are interested in making the company's structure evolve.""
BACK IN THE BLACK
Renault reported a bigger than expected net profit of 888 million euros ($1.0 billion) for 2021, and an operating margin of 3.6%. The ""Renaulution"" plan had aimed for a margin of above 3% in 2023.
The company cut fixed costs by 2 billion euros between 2019 and 2021, one year ahead of plan. 
Helped by the improved finances, Renault said it aimed to repay the 4 billion euros of state aid it received during the pandemic by the end of 2023, ahead of the 2024 deadline.
It did not propose a dividend for 2021, while it prioritises the turnaround plan and repaying the state loan.
Renault's shares were up 0.8% at 1420 GMT, after spiking 4.8% in earlier trade. 

For this year, the company is targeting an operating margin of more than 4%, and an automotive operational free cash flow of at least 1 billion euros.

Canada's largest carrier, which lost C$3.6 billion in 2021, is adding flights and bringing back staff amid hopes for a further easing of government restrictions.
Shares rose around 2% in morning trade. 
Canada's largest provinces are reopening businesses and removing vaccine passport curbs as coronavirus cases drop and after facing mass protests against the measures. 
""If bars and large public events can open at full capacity and if some provinces such as Quebec and Ontario can put an end to the vaccination passports, there is no reason to single out travel,"" Rousseau told analysts. 
Air Canada said it would increase its available seat miles capacity by 243% during the first three months of 2022, compared with the same quarter in 2021, although it was down 44% from 2019 levels. 
A December travel warning by Canada was accompanied by additional testing in a blow to carriers that were counting on increased flying during the key holiday travel season after the country lifted border restrictions in August. 
Canadian carriers were harder hit by restrictions than their U.S. counterparts.
""Although booking curve improvements and air cargo volume growth looks very encouraging ...Air Canada's pandemic-era recovery continues to lag its U.S. peers,"" Citi Analyst Stephen Trent said in a note to clients.

Chief Commercial Officer Lucie Guillemette said she expects a rebound in lucrative business travel this year as companies return to the office.
The airline's net loss was C$493 million ($388.10 million), or C$1.38 per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of C$1.16 billion, or C$3.91 per share, a year earlier.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Allianz announced on Friday big bonus cuts for its CEO and board, and a settlement with a ""vast majority"" of investors, as it braces for the outcome of U.S. regulatory investigations into a multibillion-dollar trading debacle at its funds arm.
The collapse of a $15 billion set of investment funds during the pandemic market turmoil in early 2020 has cast a shadow over Germany's most valuable financial firm and one of the world's largest asset managers.
A 3.7 billion euro ($4.2 billion) provision announced on Thursday to deal with a slew of investor lawsuits goes some way to resolving the issue, but investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission are ongoing. The provision was the largest ever for Allianz (DE:ALVG), which said further costs were likely.
The issue has worried Allianz's top shareholders and harmed its reputation with pension funds that provide a source of business for one of Germany's best known brands.
Speaking at a news conference, a contrite CEO Oliver Baete apologised for investor losses and promised a ""significant impact"" on compensation for himself and all board members for the past year.
""We want to demonstrate we are taking this matter extremely seriously and we regret really the losses,"" he said, declining to quantify the cut.
Baete's pay package in 2020 totalled 6.39 million euros, and the entire board's was 32 million euros.
Baete also said the German insurer and asset manager had settled U.S. lawsuits with the ""vast majority of investors,"" without giving details of the agreement. 
But the fallout continues, and some investors remain cautious.
Reiner Kloecker, a fund manager with Union Investment, one of Allianz's largest shareholders, said the provision was a step in the right direction, but warned significant additional losses would mean ""management's credibility would suffer again.""
The issue centres around Allianz funds that used complex options strategies to generate returns but racked up massive losses when the spread of COVID-19 triggered wild stock market swings in February and March 2020.
Allianz, with 2.6 trillion euros of assets under management, said on Thursday the provision plunged it to a fourth quarter loss. Its 2021 profit was the lowest since 2013.
Investors in the so-called Structured Alpha set of funds have claimed some $6 billion in damages from the losses in cases filed in the United States. 
The set of funds catered in particular to normally conservative U.S. pension funds, from those for labourers in Alaska to teachers in Arkansas to subway workers in New York.
After the pandemic sent markets into a tailspin early in 2020, the Allianz funds plummeted in value, in some cases by 80% or more. Investors in their lawsuits alleged Allianz strayed from its stated strategy.
Baete declined to specify which investors had settled.
Allianz shares were down 3.7% at 1445 GMT. 
Ingo Speich, head of sustainability and corporate governance at Deka, a top Allianz investor who once called the issue a ""massive setback"" for the company, expressed some relief.

He said the amount and timing of the provision were a positive for Allianz and investors.

The division had also attracted interest from private equity firms including  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc and Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc, according to a Bloomberg report.
DuPont said it intends to use the proceeds from the divesture to fund the Rogers deal, mergers and acquisitions as well as to continue share repurchases.
The deal is expected to close around the end of 2022.
Celanese said it expects to achieve run-rate synergies of around $450 million within the first four years of deal close.
The deal is also expected to immediately add to Celanese's adjusted earnings per share, with accretion of $4 or more per share once full synergies are achieved by 2026.

DuPont's unit is a perfect fit for Celanese's specialty plastics business and the valuation looks attractive, said Matthew Blair, analyst at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. 
Shares of Celanese rose 3.7% to $157.92, while DuPont was up 4.2% at $83.07.

1383,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 09:55AM ET</span>","Cooling home improvement demand may pressure Home Depot, Lowe's 2022 sales","By Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) -  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) Cos Inc may warn of a slowdown in 2022 sales when they report their quarterly results next week to reflect a potential cooling in the U.S. housing market and a rapid rise in inflation.
The easing of COVID-19 fears in many parts of the country is encouraging people to get back to their normal routines, dampening demand for home improvement products that had soared during the pandemic. 
Also, rising mortgage rates are expected to dent housing demand as buyers will be less keen to invest in their dream homes or spruce them up.
""We expect moderation throughout 2022 to a point where demand is likely at best flattish year-over-year by the back half of the year, and that's on the back of a slowing housing market and consumer confidence,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Seth Basham told Reuters.
THE CONTEXT 
After two years of robust sales growth, thanks to pandemic-driven demand for tools, paint and gardening equipment from stuck-at-home Americans, both companies are expected to forecast full-year sales growth near levels they saw before the pandemic. 
Basham, however, expects sales during spring - a key selling season for home-improvement chains - to remain strong, driven by demand for big-ticket items such as lawn-mowers, barbecue grills and other appliances.
Lowe's has already forecast 2022 sales and profit below estimates late last year, while Home Depot is expected to start providing full-year outlook on Tuesday after a near two-year pause.
The expected impact of rampant cost inflation and sustained supply-chain hurdles on profit margins will also be on top of investors' minds.
THE FUNDAMENTALS
* Analysts project Home Depot's fiscal 2022 net sales to rise 2.5%, while Lowe's 2022 net sales are expected to rise 1.3%
* Home Depot's fourth-quarter sales are expected to rise 8.1% to $34.87 billion. It is expected to post earnings of $3.18 per share 
* Lowe's fourth-quarter sales are expected to rise 2.8% to $20.89 billion. It is expected to post earnings of $1.71 per share 
WALL STREET SENTIMENT
* The current average analyst rating for Home Depot is ""buy"", with a median price target of $425, a 22.1% upside to the stock's last close

* The current average analyst rating for Lowe's is ""buy"", with a median price target of $285, a 27.4% upside to the stock's last close
* Home Depot shares have risen 27.1% this year and those of Lowe's have gained 30.4%

(Reuters) - E-commerce sites operated by China's Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd were added to the U.S. government's latest ""notorious markets"" list, the U.S. Trade Representative's office said on Thursday.
The list identifies 42 online markets and 35 physical markets that are reported to engage in or facilitate substantial trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy. 
""This includes identifying for the first time AliExpress and the WeChat e-commerce ecosystem, two significant China-based online markets that reportedly facilitate substantial trademark counterfeiting,"" the USTR office said in a statement.
China-based online markets Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) Wangpan, DHGate,  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD), and Taobao also continue to be part of the list, along with nine physical markets located within China ""that are known for the manufacture, distribution, and sale of counterfeit goods,"" the USTR office said.
China does not agree with the U.S. government's decision to include some e-commerce sites in its notorious markets list, calling the action ""irresponsible,"" the Chinese ministry of commerce said on Friday.
Alibaba said it will continue working with government agencies to address concerns about intellectual property protection across its platforms. 
Tencent said it strongly disagreed with the decision and was ""committed to working collaboratively to resolve this matter."" It added that it actively monitored, deterred and acted upon violations across its platforms and had invested significant resources into intellectual property rights protection.
Inclusion on the list is a blow to the reputation of companies but carries no direct penalties. 
Industry bodies including the American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA) and the Motion Picture Association welcomed the release of the report by the USTR.
The USTR office said in a separate report released on Wednesday that the United States needs to pursue new strategies and update its domestic trade tools to deal with China's ""state-led, non-market policies and practices.""

The United States and China have been engaged in trade tensions for years over issues like tariffs, technology and intellectual property, among others. 
The United States has said that China had failed to make good on some commitments under a so-called ""Phase 1"" trade agreement signed by the administration of former President Donald Trump.

(Reuters) -Deere & Co raised its annual profit forecast after posting estimate-beating quarterly earnings on Friday, as the world's largest farm equipment maker expects a margin boost from price hikes and solid demand for its tractors and combines.
Demand for agricultural equipment is seen to be high this year as farmers are flush with cash from high grain prices and government support during the COVID-19 pandemic. They, however, face challenges from soaring costs for seeds and fertilizers.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated net farm income to have risen 25% in 2021 but has warned it may fall 4.5% this year.
Deere (NYSE:DE) has raised equipment prices to combat rising shipping and supply chain costs, but that has not deterred demand, with the company's North American order books full or nearly full for most of its large farm equipment in 2022.
""Looking ahead, we expect demand for farm and construction equipment to continue benefiting from strong fundamentals,"" Chief Executive John May said in a statement.
Shares in Deere were up 0.8% in early trading.
Production problems due to supply snarls linger, but Third Bridge senior analyst Patrick Donnelly said he remained bullish on Deere's ability to roll out more higher-priced precision agriculture technology in response to demand.
""Deere's earnings beat was driven by the strong equipment pricing environment, which was partially able to offset inflationary costs,"" said Donnelly. 
Smaller rival AGCO Corp last week also reported upbeat quarterly results and outlook, helped by strong demand.
Deere forecast fiscal 2022 net income between $6.7 billion and $7.1 billion, up from a prior estimate of $6.5 billion to $7.0 billion.

Net sales from equipment operations rose about 6% to $8.53 billion for the first quarter ended Jan. 30, beating the Refinitiv-IBES consensus estimate of $8.22 billion.
Net income fell to $903 million, or $2.92 per share, as costs weighed, but still beat the average estimate of $2.38.

The deal values Mitchell & Ness at $250 million, according to sources familiar with the matter. The company pulled in $350 million in sales and $70 million in profit last year, the sources said.

The Fidelity Physical Bitcoin ETP, available to the asset manager's professional and institutional clients in Europe, began trading on the Deutsche Börse Xetra on Tuesday.
The physical bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) will also debut on the SIX Swiss Exchange in the coming weeks, Fidelity said. 
Nick King, head of ETFs at the company, said the ETP launch ""is the first step in our digital assets product capability"".

More than 90% of those interested in digital assets expect to have an allocation in their institution's or clients' portfolios within the next five years, the survey showed.

1390,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 09:22AM ET</span>",Continental to keep investing in Lithuania despite China pressure,"VILNIUS (Reuters) - Continental will continue investing in a factory in Lithuania, an executive was quoted saying, despite a diplomatic dispute between Beijing and the Baltic state that has threatened to embroil the German car parts maker.
Two people familiar with the matter told Reuters in December that China was pressuring Continental to stop using components made in Lithuania, after a row erupted over the opening of a de facto Taiwan embassy in the capital Vilnius.
Taiwan is a self-ruled island that China views as part of its territory, and following the embassy dispute China has pressed multinationals to sever ties with Lithuania or face exclusion from its market - dragging firms into the diplomatic spat and placing Beijing on a collision course with the European Union.
But the director of Continental's Lithuanian factory told local newspaper Verslo Zinios its investment plans hadn't changed.
""Our plans in Lithuania are the same as we stated at the beginning - 1,500 jobs and over 185 million euros ($210 million)investments,"" Shayan Ali was quoted saying.
Asked about the Chinese trade pressure, he said the factory ""was undoubtedly affected by the changing situation, we did all we can to adapt to changing circumstances"". He gave no further details.
Continental said in 2017 it would invest 95 million euros in the factory, creating 1,000 jobs. This was followed last year by the announcement of an additional 90 million euros investment into the factory, creating 500 more jobs.
""So far we have not deviated from the planned investment timetable,"" a Continental spokesperson told Reuters.
The EU in January launched a trade case against China at the World Trade Organization, backed by the United States, Australia and Taiwan itself, over Beijing's alleged trade curbs on Lithuania.

China's foreign ministry in December denied that Beijing had pressured multinational companies not to use Lithuanian-produced parts, though it said its companies no longer trusted Lithuania.

Investing.com – DraftKings stock (NASDAQ:DKNG) plunged 16.4% in premarket trading Friday after the sports betting firm added fewer customers in the fourth quarter than analysts estimated.
The company nearly doubled its expenses on sales and marketing in the year to $982 million, but managed to increase just about 32% to 2 million monthly unique paying customers on average on the platform.
According to Bloomberg, the company also forecast between $825 million and $925 million in adjusted loss excluding some items for the year; wider than estimated. “In the present environment where tech investors have displayed zero tolerance for large losses, the 2022 EBITDA guidance is going to be a disappointment,” the wire agency quoted Vital Knowledge analyst Adam Crisafulli.
The numbers from the company were a bigger surprise, given more states legalized sports betting this year and the firm spent a good part of its time tying up with various associations and sports bodies, including the National Football League, to entrench its sports betting services.
Fourth quarter revenue rose 47% to $473 million. Average revenue per monthly unique payer rose 19% to $77.
The company raised its annual revenue forecast to be between $1.85 billion and $2 billion, attributing the revision to last month’s permission to mobile sports betting in New York and Louisiana."

The success of COVID-19 vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology from Moderna and rival  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) has prompted efforts to use the novel technology in other vaccines and therapeutics targeted at hard-to-treat diseases.
Pfizer is also developing an mRNA-based vaccine for shingles and expects to begin clinical trials in the second half of 2022.
If successful, both companies will compete with GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK)'s two-dose vaccine Shingrix, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2017.
Shingles typically develops in older adults who were infected with chicken pox, or the varicella-zoster virus, when younger. It is characterized by a painful rash that generally clears up within a month.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Friday that it would take up to three months to stabilise a worsening COVID-19 pandemic that has overwhelmed health facilities and forced the postponement of an upcoming leadership election.
""Our government needs to focus on the epidemic,"" Lam said at a news conference after a week that saw daily infections jump by 60% so far this month. It ""cannot be diverted... we cannot afford to lose,"" she said.
Quarantine facilities in Hong Kong have reached capacity and hospital beds are more than 95% full as cases spiral, with some patients, including elderly, left on beds outside in chilly, sometimes rainy weather.
The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who backs a ""dynamic zero-COVID"" strategy, has said controlling the spread is Hong Kong's ""over-riding mission"".
Lam said Hong Kong's daily caseload had yet to peak and that plans were being drawn up for a mandatory testing programme to cover the whole of the territory.
A citywide lockdown was not being planned, she said.
Global banks HSBC and Standard Chartered said some branches were shut on Friday after several staff became infected.
Hong Kong reported 3,629 new daily COVID-19 infections on Friday, with an additional 7,600 preliminary positive cases.
Authorities reported 10 deaths in the past 24 hours, taking total deaths to more than 240, still much lower than in other major global cities.
The Hospital Authority said it was aiming to move all patients currently lying outside in open-air beds to indoors by Friday night ahead of an expected drop in temperature to around 10C (50F).
At the Caritas Medical Centre on the city's Kowloon peninsula, 98-year-old Lam Foon sat swaddled in soggy woollen blankets on a hospital bed in the parking lot on Thursday, waiting for tests to confirm a preliminary positive result for COVID-19.
""I don't feel so good,"" she told Reuters through a surgical mask, next to a similarly wrapped patient wearing a mask and face shield.
Medic Trevor Chung, 29, said the government had underestimated the situation.
""I expect things to get a lot worse,"" he said. ""There are many elderly people in this district, and many aren't vaccinated.""
HOTELS ROOMS
On Friday, Lam said Hong Kong had identified more than 20,000 hotel rooms for quarantine accommodation, with property developers piling in to show support.

Lam said 21 hotels had expressed interest in turning their facilities into isolation venues, exceeding ""by a large margin the government's original target of 7,000 to 10,000 rooms"".
CK Asset Holdings, owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing, said it would provide more than 3,000 hotel rooms in four hotels. Sun Hung Kai Properties (SHKP) said it could provide 1,000 rooms. Both developers said they would broadcast a government promotional video on vaccine passports in its major malls. New World Development said it planned to provide about 700 rooms, while Henderson Land (OTC:HLDCY) Development said its founding Lee family would donate HK$10 million ($1.3 million) to send anti-epidemic materials to elderly homes, among others. Reuters reported in September that Beijing had given a new mandate to the global financial hub's powerful property tycoons, telling them to pour resources and influence into backing Beijing's interests.

(Reuters) - Wall Street expects Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) to report the biggest jump in holiday sales among U.S. department stores when it reports quarterly results on Tuesday, benefiting from its investments in online business and ability to keep its shelves stocked.
Analysts said the company was able to keep its supplies steady during the peak shopping season as it used multiple ports to receive early deliveries of apparel and accessories from overseas suppliers.
That is in contrast to their expectations for rival  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN) as struggles at its Rack off-price division, which accounts for a third of its sales, turned Wall Street cautious on its near-term prospects.
""Nordstrom was the original digital strategy store, but Macy's has caught up and really has done more. Macy's has embraced a more data-driven, disciplined approach to managing all aspects of the business,"" retail analyst Jane Hali said.
Analysts also expect Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) Inc, which has seen takeover bids from activist investors, to benefit from lower discounts and its tie-up with Sephora beauty chain, but they doubt the strength of its online business.
THE CONTEXT
In its last quarter, Macy's added 4.4 million new customers, up 28% from pre-pandemic levels, with around a third of them returning to the brand after months. J.P. Morgan analysts said Macy's is a primary market share beneficiary, with J.C. Penney and Belk ceding ground.
Macy's quarterly online sales has grown for nearly two years, thanks to its loyalty program that has attracted million of younger customers. It plans on building on the momentum by launching a marketplace, where third-party sellers could sell brands it does not carry and help expand its customer base.
THE FUNDAMENTALS
** Analysts polled by Refinitiv expect Macy's fourth-quarter revenue to jump 25% and profit to more than double.
** They expect Nordstrom sales to decline sharply from pre-pandemic levels, although that implies a 24% increase from a year earlier when it faced shipping delays.
** Kohl's revenue is expected to jump 11% from a year earlier, but was likely to be roughly flat when compared with pre-pandemic levels.

WALL STREET SENTIMENT
** Macy's current mean price target implies a 35% upside to Thursday's close, while Nordstrom's and Kohl's are both roughly 13% above their last closing price.

The broadband and mobile provider, a joint venture between Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA) and Telefonica (NYSE:TEF), will be an anchor tenant of the new network, which will also be available to other operators on a wholesale basis, the company said.
Virgin Media O2 has already increased speeds on its existing network, and also plans to upgrade these connections to fibre by 2028.
The company confirmed the investment talks as it reported 142,000 fixed-line additions in 2021 and 53,000 in the final quarter, its best performance in the quarter for six years.
In mobile, it added 2.7 million connections in 2021, including wholesale customers. Virgin Media O2 added 129,000 mobile contract additions in the final quarter, it said.
Chief Executive Lutz Schuler said the eight-month-old joint venture had strong momentum, and was growing the 45% of fixed-line customers who also had mobile.
""We launched Volt, our first converged offer, we are now four months in the market and customers like the product,"" he said.
Schuler said Virgin Media 02 would offer its entire network, which will eventually cover 23 million homes, to wholesale partners.
He said broadband providers such as Sky and TalkTalk would then have an alternative to BT, which aims to extend its fibre network to 25 million premises by end-2026. 
""If you put yourself in the shoes of the other brands, what do you prefer: sticking to one supplier or having the option to balance one a bit with the other?""

But the company was not under pressure to strike wholesale deals. 
""We are not committing wholesale revenue to finance the 7 million homes,"" he said. ""Virgin Media as an anchor tenant is more than enough.""

Vivendi said on Friday that it was considering offering an increased price of 25.50 euros per share, up from its current offer of 24.10 euros.
Lagardere shares were up 5.1% in late trading while Vivendi shares dipped 0.4%.
Last year, Vivendi said it would buy activist fund Amber Capital's stake of around 18% stake in Lagardere for 24.10 euros per share, and then file a full takeover offer for Lagardere.
The acquisition would mean Vivendi, which already owns pay TV group Canal+ and right-leaning news channel CNEWS, will gain control over Lagardere's flagship magazine Paris Match, weekly newspaper Journal du Dimanche and radio station Europe 1.

Bollore's ambitions have ruffled feathers in President Emmanuel Macron's inner circle, sources have said, with some fearing his empire building could result in airwaves dominated by right-wing views ahead of France's April presidential election.
Lagardere had also attracted the attentions of luxury goods company LVMH's billionaire boss Bernard Arnault, but Arnault has ceded ground to Bollore over Lagardere.

Eurostat said the final consumption of oil and petroleum products across the region registered its sharpest drop ever, falling by about 10% to 310 megatonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in only one year.
In March 2020 EU governments began to limit people's movements to curb the spread of COVID-19, leading to a significant decline in consumption of transport fuels such as diesel and gasoline. 
The use of kerosene-type jet fuel in aviation, which in 2019 reached an absolute high at 48.2 Mtoe, slumped more than 56% in 2020 as travel restrictions forced airlines to cancel flights.
Luxembourg registered the largest decrease in oil and petroleum products consumption in energy and non-energy use, down 21% from 2019.

As member states increasingly turn to wind, solar and other clean energy sources in their efforts to meet the bloc's net-zero ambition by 2050, the EU tapped renewables for 22% of its energy consumption in 2020.
The two-year lag on the data is because Eurostat processes comparable data collected by statistical authorities using harmonised methodology.

Celanese (NYSE:CE) also traded higher in premarket, by 3%.
The all-cash deal also includes engineering polymers business and select products within the performance resins and advanced solutions business lines. Combined, these businesses generated net sales of around $3.5 billion and base operating income of about $0.8 billion in 2021. However, fourth quarter volumes in the Mobility & Materials business fell, reflecting the softness in global auto production.
Celanese has all commitments in place to finance the transaction, which is expected to close around the end of 2022, a joint press release said.
DuPont said it will use the proceeds to fund its acquisition of Rogers (NYSE:ROG) as well as its share repurchases, and the money from the deal may also be used for further M&A opportunities. DuPont is buying the electronics materials specialist for $5.2 billion.
Rogers makes products for use in high-frequency circuit materials, ceramic substrates for power semiconductor devices, and high-performance foams that go into a variety of highly specialized end markets, but a growing share of its business is with the EV sector and 5G telecommunications.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A global supply crunch of electrolysers needed to produce green hydrogen and a lack of domestic manufacturers to make them pose a major challenge to India's ambitious targets to use the zero-carbon fuel, a government official told Reuters.
India, which unveiled the first phase of its hydrogen policy on Thursday, plans to manufacture 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen per year by 2030, half of the European Union's 2030 target of 10 million tonnes.
Green hydrogen has the best environmental credentials of the various categories of the clean-burning fuel because it is produced using renewable energy.
For India, it is critical to its plans to cut carbon emissions, but its green hydrogen target would require at least 10 gigawatts (GW) of electrolyser capacity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.
""The kind of electrolyser capacity that will be required to realise all these ambitious programmes, they are not available right now in the country,"" S. S. V. Ramakumar, a director at the country's top refiner Indian Oil who helped to frame the country's hydrogen policy, told Reuters.
""All the production capacity and order books of big global players are booked and overflowing till 2025,"" he said.
India will initially import electrolysers, he said adding that state-run refiners planned to form joint ventures with foreign companies manufacturing the equipment.
Power Minister R K Singh said in September India would need at least 10 GW of electrolyser capacity. Global electrolyser capacity was 0.3 GW in 2020, and is expected to reach nearly 17 GW by 2026, an International Energy Agency (IEA) report found in December 2021.

Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries has said it plans to build an electrolyser unit in western Gujarat state, but it is unclear when the unit will start commercial production. 
India expects initial demand to mainly come from refiners and fertiliser firms, followed by the steel industry and transport. India's refineries are expected to produce 38,000 tonnes of green hydrogen by 2025, Ramakumar said.

Investing.com – Deere stock (NYSE:DE) traded 1.3% higher in premarket Friday after the company raised its annual forecast, banking on rising agricultural incomes supporting demand for its farm equipment.
The company expects 2022 net income to be $6.9 billion at the center of its guidance range, higher than the $6.75 billion figure it handed out earlier.
“Looking ahead, we expect demand for farm and construction equipment to continue benefiting from strong fundamentals,"" Chairman and CEO John C. May said in a statement. The company said, “the end-market demand remains favorable.”
Demand for its tractors and combines has stayed elevated for some quarters now. Thanks to record-high crop prices fueling farmers’ incomes; cash-rich farmers have thus looked to buy new machinery or upgrade to boost productivity.
Worldwide net sales and revenue rose 5% in the first quarter to $9.6 billion. Equipment operations net sales were $8.5 billion, compared with $8 billion in the first quarter of 2021.
Costs escalated more, rising 11%. Net profit thus fell to $903 million."
1403,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 07:20AM ET</span>",Analysis-Tesla software updates allow quick fixes - and taking risks,"By Tina Bellon, Hyunjoo Jin and David Shepardson
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's ability to quickly issue safety patches via remote software updates is an approach other automakers eye enviously, but that also carries risk as cars become more like rolling computers.
Investors have awarded Tesla's leadership on in-car software with a market value of $905 billion that dwarfs traditional carmakers, many of which are now scrambling to roll out their own ability to offer over-the-air software updates.
However, Tesla's risk-friendly culture and its desire to quickly release cutting-edge technology has also put it on collision course with U.S. safety regulators, which have launched a string of recalls and investigations into the carmaker in recent months. The latest included the opening of a formal probe on Thursday into reports of unexpected brake activation.
""There's definitely the mindset that you can fix fast so you can take a higher risk,"" Florian Rohde, a former Tesla validation manager who is now a consultant, said about the electric carmaker's ability to issue remote updates.
That behavior was illustrated earlier this month when the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) ordered Tesla to issue a recall to prevent some of its vehicles from making ""rolling stops"" instead of coming to a complete halt at some intersections. That feature violated state laws and was a safety risk, the agency said.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, who has a long history of clashing with U.S. safety officials, denied there was a safety issue with the function. ""The car simply slowed to ~2 mph & continued forward if clear view with no cars or pedestrians,"" Musk wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
But the carmaker nevertheless issued a software update to disable the function. NHTSA officials on Thursday said they would push for recalls if they feel safety risks may exist in any vehicles.
Tesla has said it develops almost all its software to allow for regular over-the-air updates. The carmaker has issued software updates that control vehicle performance, braking, battery charging and infotainment functions. 
Tesla has led the auto industry in over-the-air recall updates. While nearly all recalls issued by NHTSA since 2020 required physical fixes, seven of Tesla's 19 recalls since January 2020, or 37%, were addressed with over-the-air software updates, an analysis of public data showed. 
Tesla handles majority of industry remote software recalls - https://graphics.reuters.com/TESLA-RECALLS/lgpdwxdobvo/chart.png 
Graphic on NHTSA recalls: https://graphics.reuters.com/TESLA-RECALLS/byprjxgqnpe/index.html 
Unlike traditional recalls that require a trip to the dealership, remote updates are cheaper and can ensure that all vehicles receive the required fix. Traditional recalls have shown an average compliance rate of around 70%, with that rate falling to less than 50% for older cars, according to NHTSA data.
With other automakers racing to offer the same upgrades as Tesla, safety experts are concerned wider over-the-air updates could open the door to carmakers lowering their safety thresholds by rushing out immature updates.
""Over-the-air software updates come with promise and they come with peril,"" said William Wallace, manager of safety policy at Consumer Reports. ""Companies need to be really responsible.""
The dispute over Tesla recalls comes as the automaker faces increasing scrutiny by several U.S. agencies over its conduct and CEO Elon Musk's personal behavior. Musk's attorney on Thursday accused the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of an ""endless"" investigation to punish him for criticism of the U.S. government.
'SILICON VALLEY MINDSET'
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment, but it has criticized the agency for ""anachronistic regulations"". Analysts wonder whether the company's fast-moving, technology-centered culture could lead to issues.
""The problem is, when you try to apply the Silicon Valley mindset to automobiles, it's a very different situation,"" said Guidehouse Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid, a former automotive software engineer. He added Tesla should do more internal testing before releasing updates. 
But the software shift also raises new challenges for regulators, with some experts questioning whether NHTSA has the expertise to validate modern technology.
""I haven't seen any evidence that NHTSA has people with the experience and expertise to deal with software issues right now,"" said Don Slavik, a Colorado-based lawyer who has served as a consultant in automotive technology lawsuits, including many against Tesla.
NHTSA's recent investigations into Tesla have centered around the carmaker's driver assistance system Autopilot and what Tesla calls its Full Self-Driving (Beta) software - technology that allows about 60,000 Tesla users in the United States to test the company's autonomous technology on public roads.
While the aggressive approach allows Tesla to deploy software updates faster than the competition, ""it puts untrained drivers in the position of having to compensate for potential software defects,"" said Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University professor working on autonomous vehicle safety.

Safety advocates warn Tesla vehicles potentially affect everyone on public roads. 
""A two-ton vehicle is not the same as a desktop computer or your laptop crashing,"" Consumer Reports' Wallace said. ""Automakers and their suppliers need to treat software that relates to safety like it's a life-and-death issue.""

The United States and European countries have threatened to impose sanctions on Russia if it invades Ukraine, something Moscow has repeatedly denied planning.
Prices of nickel and aluminium have soared to multi-year highs on supply disruption fears.
Following are some details about Russia's major commodity exports.
ALUMINIUM 
Most Russian metal producers have so far escaped sanctions imposed by the West since Moscow annexed the Crimea in 2014.
One exception is the world's largest aluminium producer outside China, Rusal, under sanctions imposed by the United States between April 2018 and early 2019.
Rusal produced 3.8 million tonnes of aluminium in 2021, about 6% of the estimated world production.
Europe, Asia and North America are Rusal's main markets. Miner and commodity trader Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) has a long-term deal running until 2025 to buy primary aluminium from Rusal. 
COBALT
Data from U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) shows Russia produced 7,600 tonnes of cobalt last year, more than 4% of world total. 
Russia was the second largest producer, far behind the Democratic Republic of Congo which produced 120,000 tonnes. 
Nornickel is the largest producer in Russia, selling 5,000 tonnes in 2021. Nornickel sells most of its output to Europe.
COPPER
Russia produced 920,000 tonnes of refined copper last year, about 3.5% of the world total, according to USGS, out of which Nornickel produced 406,841 tonnes. 
UMMC and Russian Copper Company are the other two major producers.
Asia and Europe are the main export markets. 
NICKEL
Nornickel is the world's top producer of refined nickel. It produced 193,006 tonnes in 2021 or about 7% of global mine production estimated at 2.7 million tonnes. It sells to global industrial consumers under long-term contracts. 
PALLADIUM AND PLATINUM
Nornickel is also the world's largest producer of palladium and a major producer of platinum. 
It produced 2.6 million troy ounces of palladium last year or 40% of global mine production and 641,000 ounces of platinum or about 10% of total mine production.
GOLD
Russia is the world's third largest producer of gold after Australia and China and accounts for about 10% of global mine production, which according to the World Gold Council totalled 3,500 tonnes last year. 
Russian gold is produced by companies that include Polyus and Polymetal. Russian miners mainly sell their gold to the country's commercial banks which then export it. 
STEEL
Russia produced 76 million tonnes of steel or nearly 4% of the global total, according to the World Steel Association.
Severstal, NLMK, Evraz, MMK and Mechel are Russia's main producers. They export about half of their production, mainly to Europe.
The country's ferrous sector also includes Metalloinvest, making iron ore products, and TMK, making steel pipes. 
DIAMONDS
State-controlled Alrosa, the world's largest producer of rough diamonds, produced 32.4 million carats in 2021, about 30% of the global total. It exports mostly to Belgium, India, and the United Arab Emirates. 
FERTILISERS
Russia is a major producer of potash, phosphate and nitrogen containing fertilisers - key crop and soil nutrients. It produces more than 50 million tonnes a year of the fertilisers, 13% of the global total.
Phosagro, Uralchem, Uralkali, Acron and Eurochem are the biggest players. 
They export to Asia and Brazil. 
WHEAT
Russia is the world's largest wheat exporter, with Turkey and Egypt among its main buyers. [GRA/RU] 
It produced 76 million tonnes of wheat last year and is expected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to export 35 million tonnes in the July-June season, 17% of the global total.

Russia has been curbing grain exports since 2021 with quotas and taxes as part of its wider efforts to subdue inflation.
The global market fears supplies could get disrupted if the conflict between Russia and Ukraine escalates and affects commercial shipping in the Black Sea, the main wheat export route of the two countries.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Friday, bouncing back from the previous session’s hefty losses amid hopes that talks between Russia and the U.S. next week will defuse the crisis on the Ukraine border.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 75 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 16 points, or 0.4%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 75 points, or 0.5%.
Global markets have been roiled this week by the fear of a Russian invasion of Ukraine that could potentially disrupt European energy supplies and Russian exports of other commodities, notably wheat and palladium.
The major indices on Wall Street all closed sharply lower Thursday after both Russian-backed rebels and Ukrainian forces claimed the other side had shelled their positions in the east of the country, potentially creating the circumstances that Russia could use as justification to invade. Russia will hold exercises to test the readiness of its nuclear and ballistic missiles on Saturday, flexing its military muscles once more.
The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 600 points, or 1.8%, for its biggest daily drop since the end of November, while the broad-based S&P 500 dropped 2.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 2.9%.
However, the mood has improved a little after Secretary of State Antony Blinken agreed to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Europe next week, a sign that neither side is abandoning diplomatic channels yet.
Elsewhere, St. Louis Fed president James Bullard continued his campaign for aggressive monetary policy tightening by the U.S. central bank, repeating Thursday that the Fed should implement a full percentage point of rate increases over its next three meetings. He warned that the Fed Funds rate may have to top 2% to bring inflation down over the medium term.
There are a number of Fed speakers due later Friday, including Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, FOMC member John Williams and Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard, and their comments will be studied carefully for clues ahead of the March meeting. 
Turning to the corporate sector,  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock tumbled premarket after the video-streaming company disappointed with its quarterly revenue, hit by supply chain issues that affected sales.
Agricultural equipment maker Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) lifted its full-year profit forecast, expecting to benefit from solid demand for its tractors against a backdrop of high grain prices. Numbers are also due from sports betting company DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG), tech company Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) and  Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB). 
Oil prices slipped, heading for a weekly fall, as traders digested the raised prospects of Iranian oil returning to the global market, which outweighed the ongoing Russia-Ukraine risks.
A draft accord is taking shape that would eventually lead to the removal of oil sanctions on the Persian Gulf country’s crude exports. Such a deal could result in an additional 1 million barrels a day of oil coming back to the market, according to some estimates.
Details of the number of U.S. oil rigs in play from Baker Hughes and CFTC crude oil positioning data round off the week later in the session.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.9% lower at $90.05 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.8% to $91.30. Both contracts were set for their first weekly fall in nine weeks, after hitting their highest levels for over seven years earlier in the week.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,893.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1366.

Investing.com – Starbucks stock (NASDAQ:SBUX) traded 0.8% higher in premarket Friday amid a public outcry against the coffee brewer’s decision to raise product prices in China, its largest market outside the U.S.
The stock is down 11% in the last year.
The company has raised prices on some beverages and food products in China by 1-2 yuan (16-32 cents), the first time in over three years. It had earlier hiked prices in its home market as well, which attracted a little flak of its own.
The price increases comes just when the coffee chain was battling an online outrage after staff at one of its stores in Ciqikou, an ancient town in the Shapingba district of Chongqing city, drove out local police who were eating food at the doorstep of the store because it would “affect the brand’s image.”
The company apologized on Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), a Twitter-like service. According to Starbucks, pricing decisions are based on many factors, including operating costs. Users on Weibo called for a boycott of the retailer.
Starbucks had a tough first quarter in China. Comparable store sales in the country fell 14%, driven by a 9% decline in average ticket and a 6% decline in transactions. First quarter revenue from the market fell 2% year-on-year to $897 million. As of January 2, Starbucks had 34,317 stores worldwide. China accounted for more than one in seven of those.
Increasing cost pressure has led Starbucks to project a sharper decline in total earnings this year. The company now sees profit per share falling 4-6% for the year compared to its previous projection of no more than 4%.
The company revised its outlook earlier this month after first quarter results fell short of estimates, hit by surging costs in a tight market for labor and materials."
1408,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 06:26AM ET</span>",U.N. pact may restrict plastic production. Big Oil aims to stop it,"By John Geddie, Valerie Volcovici and Joe Brock
(Reuters) - United Nations member states are set to meet this month in Nairobi to draft the blueprint for a global plastics treaty, a deal that could see countries agree for the first time to reduce the amount of single-use plastics they produce and use.
It's being touted as the most important environmental pact since the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.
A global explosion of disposable plastic, which is made from oil and gas, is increasing carbon emissions, despoiling the world's oceans, harming wildlife and contaminating the food chain. More than 50 countries, including all 27 members of the European Union, are calling for the pact to include measures targeting plastic production.
That's a problem for big oil and chemical companies. The industry is projected to double plastic output worldwide within two decades.
Publicly, plastic industry groups representing firms like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Corp, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc and Dow Inc, have expressed support for a global agreement to tackle this garbage. 
Behind the scenes, however, these trade organizations are devising strategies to persuade conference participants to reject any deal that would limit plastic manufacturing, according to emails and company presentations seen by Reuters, as well as interviews with a dozen officials involved in the negotiations.
Leading that effort is the American Chemistry Council (ACC), a powerful group of U.S.-based oil and chemical firms. The Washington-based ACC is attempting to forge a coalition of big businesses to help steer treaty discussions away from production restrictions, according to an Oct. 21 email sent from the trade group to a blind-copied list of recipients. Reuters received a copy of that email from an employee of a consumer goods company who requested anonymity. 
The ACC has dubbed the proposed alliance ""Business for Plastic Pollution Action,"" according to the email, which called on firms to ""shift the debate"" by focusing governments' attention on the benefits of plastic. The group planned to hold monthly meetings and share policy recommendations with governments, according to the email.
The ACC did not respond to Reuters' questions about the email or the proposed business coalition.
Plastic is embedded in modern life and indispensable to sectors such as automaking. The plastics industry has been quick to cite such applications in defending unfettered production.
But it is throwaway plastics such as food wrappers, grocery bags and delivery packaging that are the main focus of the U.N. conference. Single-use plastic accounts for around 40% of all production, according to a landmark 2017 study in the journal Science Advances.
The ACC has long defended disposable plastics as better for the planet than alternatives such as glass and cardboard, which are heavier and require more fossil fuel to transport. Some climate scientists say that analysis is flawed because it doesn't take into account the massive societal cost to managing plastic garbage, which is hard to recycle, slow to degrade and expensive to collect, bury and burn.
LOBBYING
Meanwhile, the ACC and its Brussels-based counterpart, Plastics Europe, have been meeting privately with government officials ahead of the talks to press their case, according to correspondence obtained by Reuters through freedom of information requests and interviews with four people involved in the talks.
The ACC last year held a telephone briefing offering U.S. officials its own vision for what the Nairobi treaty should look like, according to a March 3 email invitation sent to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and obtained by Reuters.
Documents attached to that invitation outlined the ACC's opposition to potential production caps on plastic. Among its claims: that global inequality would worsen due to increased food waste and less access to clean water in the developing world if restrictions were enacted. Big consumer brands have used single-use plastic packaging to sell basic goods in poor countries, a move that has increased their revenues but fueled widespread waste pollution.
The ACC briefed EPA twice last year as to its views on plastic, once in March and again in July, the agency told Reuters.
It's not unusual for industries to interact with government agencies. Still, the ACC has been in regular contact with EPA and the U.S. State Department, voicing opposition to domestic and international efforts to restrict the use of plastic, according to correspondence accessed by Reuters through freedom of information requests.
Against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, meanwhile, Plastics Europe is citing public health as a reason for U.N. delegates to steer clear of production caps or bans on throwaway plastics. In a presentation sent Dec. 16 to European Union officials and seen by Reuters, the trade group said any such restrictions could have ""unintended consequences"" given high demand for disposable masks, gloves and water bottles. 
Plastics Europe did not respond to questions about its presentation or lobbying efforts. The group ""has significant concerns about the introduction of new mandatory restrictions,"" its managing director, Virginia Janssens, said in an email.
Plastic makers want U.N. delegates to focus instead on waste collection, recycling and nascent waste-to-fuel technologies, areas that don't impact their businesses, according to documents reviewed by Reuters and interviews with four people involved in talks with the industry. 
""A better solution is to address the leakage of plastic into the environment,"" Stewart Harris, the ACC's senior director of plastics policy, told Reuters in an emailed statement. 
That approach has had little success. Just 9% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled, with the rest incinerated, dumped in landfills or left to pollute the environment, according to the 2017 study published in Science Advances.
A series of Reuters investigations last year revealed that some of the plastic industry's own recent recycling projects have made little impact or shut down.
‘PEOPLE ARE WATCHING’
More than 100 countries are due to attend the U.N. Environmental Assembly (UNEA) summit - either in person or virtually - to agree on the framework for a global plan to tackle plastic pollution. It is likely to take at least two more years to finalize a treaty. But whatever is agreed upon at the conference, which runs Feb. 28 to March 2, will determine key elements of any deal.
Getting countries to commit to binding limits on the production and use of throwaway plastics is essential if the treaty is to have any effect, advocates say.
""Voluntary efforts have spectacularly failed,"" said Trisia Farrelly, a plastics researcher at New Zealand's Massey University and a consultant to UNEA. ""We need measurable, time-bound targets.""
In a surprise move last month, some of the plastic industry's biggest customers, including The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc, said for the first time that they wanted any treaty to curb future plastic production.
The public is also on board, according to a 2019 IPSOS poll. More than 70% of people surveyed said single-use plastic packaging should be banned, according to that poll of 19,515 adults across 28 countries.
""People are watching what we're doing, and they're expecting results,"" said Steven Guilbeault, environment minister for Canada, which along with Ghana is facilitating the treaty talks in Nairobi. 
Many of those eyes will be on the United States. Democratic President Joe Biden has sought to rebuild U.S. credibility on environmental matters, steps that have included rejoining the Paris Agreement last year. Earlier this month, the United States joined with France in calling for a global agreement on plastic waste that recognizes ""the importance of curbing it at its source."" 
Still, the Biden administration has not committed publicly to production curbs or bans on single-use items. The United States generates more plastic waste per person than any other country, and is home to some of the world's largest manufacturers of plastic polymers. Any strict new terms in a plastics agreement would likely require approval from the U.S. Senate; the deeply polarized chamber currently is split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans.

In an interview with Reuters, State Department Assistant Secretary Monica Medina, the official heading the U.S. delegation in Nairobi, declined to state whether the administration would support or oppose production restrictions, nor would she provide any specifics about U.S. goals for the treaty. 
""We're thinking about this in terms of being as innovative as possible and not having a prescriptive and top-down approach,"" Medina said.

1410,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 06:10AM ET</span>",Factbox-A global treaty to curb plastic pollution,"(Reuters) - More than 100 United Nations member states will convene this month to draw up a blueprint for the first-ever global agreement to tackle plastic pollution. The U.N. says it could be the most important environmental pact since the Paris Agreement climate deal in 2015.
Why is it happening and what's at stake?
- The planet is awash in plastic waste, which is hard to recycle, slow to decay, and expensive to bury and burn. It's harming wildlife and contaminating the food chain. Eleven million metric tons of it ends up in the ocean each year, a figure that's expected to triple by 2040 unless production and use of throwaway plastics such as drinks bottles, delivery packaging and grocery bags are reduced, multiple scientific studies show.
- If the U.N. cannot agree on a deal to put the brakes on plastic pollution, there will be widespread ecological damage in coming decades, putting some marine species at risk of extinction and destroying sensitive ecosystems like coral reefs and mangroves, according to a World Wildlife Fund study released this month.
- Fast-growing plastic production, which is forecast to double over the next 20 years, also poses a major climate-change threat, since plastic is largely derived from fossil fuels.
What's the process?
- The United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) will take place - in person and online - at the U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP) headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya from Feb. 28 to March 2.
- The primary goal is to hammer out broad terms for a global agreement on plastic pollution and form an intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) to broker a final deal.
- If member states can agree on a basic framework, the INC would then spend at least two years negotiating a final treaty to be signed. 
What could be in a plastics treaty?
- Possible elements could include: caps on plastic production, commitments by member countries to phase out single-use and hard-to-recycle plastics, and targets to increase waste collection and recycling rates.
- There is a wide spectrum of potential outcomes. A key issue is whether provisions in any deal would end up being voluntary or legally binding.
What's at risk for big business?

- Plastic-making oil and chemical companies, including Dow, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), have the most to lose from an ambitious treaty that would limit plastic production or phase out single-use packaging.
- Big consumer goods brands like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Nestle and Unilever (NYSE:UL), which sell a myriad of products in throwaway plastic packaging, would also be impacted if the treaty places restrictions on the manufacturing or design of plastics.

Investing.com – NatWest Group stock (LON:NWG) traded 2.2% lower in London Friday after the lender lowered its cost-cutting target, citing rising prices for the decision.
A final dividend of 7.5 pence and promise to pour in another 750 million pounds ($1.02 billion) in share buyback didn’t reverse the erosion in the stock price.
The U.K.’s biggest corporate lender reduced its annual cost-cutting target to 3% from 4% for each of the next two years, citing inflation pressures and reinvestment. The revision comes even as NatWest met the 4% cost-cutting target for 2021.
“It seems certain that inflation will continue to increase in the short term at least – especially as energy prices remain high. And we are yet to see the full impact that the end of government support schemes will have on the employment or housing markets,” NatWest said in a statement after disclosing its annual numbers.
The bank grew its net interest income as lending rates hardened while the economy stayed strong. It expects the net interest margin – derived out of the difference between lending and deposit rates – to improve in the current year.
Recovery in the economy translated into healthier assets, allowing the bank to release funds set aside to meet contingencies. In the fourth quarter, NatWest released another 341 million pounds.
Operating profit before tax was 635 million pounds, with mortgage demand and customer deposits growing.
According to Reuters, the bank expects its income to grow to 11 billion pounds this year, up from 10.5 billion pounds in 2021."

BELLINZONA, Switzerland (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) learned of murders and cocaine smuggling allegedly connected to a Bulgarian gang but continued to manage cash that is now the focus of a criminal trial, a banker accused of money laundering told a Swiss court during the case.
In the first criminal trial of a major bank in Switzerland, Credit Suisse and one of its former employees face charges of allowing an alleged Bulgarian cocaine trafficking gang to launder millions of euros, some of it in used banknotes stuffed into suitcases.
The bank and the accused banker deny any wrongdoing. The proceedings, which began on Monday of last week, continued through this week and are scheduled to run until early March.
The indictment centres on relationships that Credit Suisse and its ex-employee had with former Bulgarian wrestler Evelin Banev and multiple associates, two of whom are also charged in the case.
The female banker, who is accused of helping conceal the criminal origins of the money through more than 146 million Swiss francs in transactions, appeared in the Federal Criminal Court in Bellinzona in southern Switzerland along with her managers who gave evidence. The events unfolded between 2004 and 2008.
A Credit Suisse spokesperson said the bank has rejected all allegations and that it was convinced its former employee was innocent.
Credit Suisse disputes the illegal origin of the money, a source familiar with its thinking has told Reuters, saying that Banev and his circle operated legitimate businesses in construction, leasing and hotels. 
Banev is not facing charges in Switzerland but was convicted in Italy of drug trafficking in 2017 and in Bulgaria in 2018 for money laundering. He was arrested in September in Ukraine as countries including Bulgaria and Romania sought his arrest.
In Sofia, his attorney said last week that Banev denied any involvement in laundering money from drug trafficking through Credit Suisse.
The former Credit Suisse banker whose identity cannot be reported under Swiss privacy rules said she told her managers of events, including two murders, but that they decided to pursue the business nonetheless.
In an email from June 2005 read out in court last week, a Credit Suisse banker played down press reports linking the murder of one of Banev's associates a month earlier with drug trafficking. 
""After the homicide we have decided to continue the business relationships,"" the banker wrote in the email. ""The said (short and imprecise) article linking the murder to Spanish cocaine...has not been confirmed.""
Roughly two years later, the victim's mother was also murdered shortly before she was due to give a statement as part of an investigation into Banev, the female banker later told the court, prompting her to raise the matter with her managers. 
Banev, whose lawyer declined to comment further on Thursday, was in custody at the time, charged with participating in an organised crime group that aimed to launder money.
""The reaction I received when talking with my hierarchy, the questions were: was the person killed a bank client? No, she was not,"" the banker told the court.
""Is she in any way linked to bank, do you know her?"" she said, recalling the conversation. ""I said: 'No, never met her'. And then the reaction was, well then what is your problem?""
The court heard that the banker received bonuses of 122,000 Swiss francs in 2006 and 180,000 francs in both 2007 and 2008.

Taking the stand to give evidence, the banker's managers said this week they could recall little of events at the time and said they had trusted the matter to the bank's legal and compliance department in line with internal rules regarding funds under investigation.
""The whole process is with legal and compliance,"" one of the banker's former managers told the court. ""The relationship manager is asked not to inform colleagues, when legal and compliance considers it important to inform different hierarchy, then they do it.""

PARIS (Reuters) -Sales growth at Hermes eased in the final quarter of last year, missing market forecasts and sending its shares down as much as 7%, as self-imposed production caps kept the group from meeting demand for its prized handbags.
The slower revenue increase in the key holiday period, in contrast with an acceleration at other luxury groups, put Hermes, one of the industry's strongest names, in the unusual position of underperforming rivals.
""Hermes is one of the last large-cap luxury stocks to report, and this does not quite echo LVMH,  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and Richemont's recent results,"" Citi said in a report.
Investors could also be disappointed by the lack of a special dividend, which some had expected, it added.
Hermes shares fell 5% by 0920 GMT on Friday, having fallen as much as 7% earlier, for their worst day since September 2016 and their lowest price in more than eight months. 
Sales at Hermes' leather goods and saddlery division, which includes its famed Birkin and Kelly handbags and account for almost half the total, fell by 5.4% over the period, with the company citing capacity constraints.
Hermes caps volume growth in its leather goods production at 6% to 7% annually, preferring to have long waiting lists for its products rather than accelerate production - and Executive Chairman Axel Dumas said the group had no plans to change that.
""It takes 15 hours for an Hermes bag. Even if there's a lot of demand, I’m not going to start doing them in 13 hours to raise production,"" Dumas told reporters. 
The group recruits about 400 artisans per year – but not many more, given the time it takes to train them, he said. 
""Contrary to what people may think, we're always very sad when we have to say to our customers, 'No', because we don't have that,"" he said, adding that the group had considerably run down stocks last year. 
Overall sales rose to 2.38 billion euros ($2.71 billion) in the three months to December, with U.S. and Chinese shoppers driving growth.
That compared with a consensus forecast for revenues of 2.53 billion euros and 12% growth at constant exchange rates cited by UBS.
The 11% increase compares with growth of 31% in the third quarter and 127% in the second. The group's profitability margin also eased in the second half of the year to 38.1%, analysts said. 
That compared with a margin of 41% for rival LVMH's fashion and leather goods division, led by Louis Vuitton and Dior, and 38.2% for Kering's top brand Gucci. 
Still, Hermes has weathered the COVID-19 pandemic better than many rivals, and its 2021 sales grew by 42% from a year earlier and by 33% from 2019 levels.
Revenues exceeded their pre-pandemic levels in all regions except France, where business has been dented by the absence of deep-pocketed tourists.
Dumas said Hermes had increased global prices by 3.5% on average this year, above the usual rate of 1.5%, to reflect a rise in production costs in Europe, with regional price adjustments to account for currency fluctuations.
That is below rivals' more aggressive price increases, such as an average hike of 7% worldwide by Louis Vuitton this week.

Dumas said Hermes would not increase prices to boost its results. Given its hand-crafted production, Hermes is less exposed than rivals to increasing costs of energy and primary materials, he added.

LONDON (Reuters) -British bank NatWest swung to a hefty profit on the back of the country's economic recovery but said rising prices will make it harder to cut overheads, prompting it to lower its cost-cutting target.
NatWest on Friday reported pretax profit of 4 billion pounds ($5.45 billion) for the 2021 calendar year, compared with a 351 million pound loss in 2020, restated as a 481 million pound loss to exclude its axed Irish business.
Like their European peers, British banks have benefited from a rebound in consumer spending, lower than expected loan defaults and a buoyant housing market since the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The improved picture meant NatWest could release 1.3 billion pounds of the reserves built up to deal with soured loans.
It also announced a dividend of 7.5 pence per share and a 750 million pound share buyback. 
However, analysts warn that inflation at its highest in nearly 30 years threatens to squeeze household incomes and dampen the recovery.
""We're really aware the challenges are to come for a lot of customers,"" NatWest Chief Executive Alison Rose told reporters, adding that there had not yet been any increase in calls to the bank's helplines from people struggling to pay their bills.
""People are phoning up and talking about it, but we're not seeing any concerns coming through in our data as yet,"" she said.
NatWest reduced its annual cost-cutting target to 3% from 4% for each of the next two years, citing inflation pressures and reinvestment. 
POSSIBLE DOWNGRADES
The higher cost guidance is likely to lead to downgraded consensus forecasts for the bank, analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Cazenove said in a note.
NatWest shares were down 2% at 235.4 pence by 1000 GMT.
The pressure on costs was reflected in a 40% leap in the bank's bonus pool to 298 million pounds in 2021. Rose's total pay packet, meanwhile, climbed to 3.6 million pounds from 2.6 million pounds, having previously waived some awards.
The Bank of England's two increases to interest rates in quick succession have broadly improved the outlook for banks because they make money on the difference between rates charged on lending and paid out on deposits.
NatWest said it expects revenue to grow to 11 billion pounds, up from 10.5 billion pounds in 2021. 
NatWest is close to ending its 14 years of being majority owned by the state after the group's 2008 financial crisis bailout. A string of stock sales has reduced the government's holding to 51%, with further sales expected within months.
However, NatWest did not escape 2021 without setbacks. Profit was dented by 466 million pounds of litigation and conduct charges, including a 265 million pound fine for failing to prevent the laundering of 365 million pounds, some of it deposited at a branch in bin bags. 
The bank's veteran chairman, Howard Davies, told reporters he plans to remain in the role for the ""foreseeable future"", in response to a media report saying the board was considering replacing him.

""Reports of my death have been much exaggerated,"" Davies said. ""There are no plans for me to leave at present and there is no process under way.""

Meituan fell more than 14%, while shares in video streaming sites Kuaishou and Bilbili as well as artificial intelligence firm SenseTime tumbled more than 4%.
China's state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), on Friday issued rules to promote a faster recovery from the pandemic in the services sector, including guidance for online food delivery platforms to reduce service fees to help to lower operating costs for catering businesses.
Those rules were announced as the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission warned against using the metaverse as a tool for illegal fund-raising, saying that some companies were engaging in illegal fund-raising, fraud, and virtual real estate speculation.
Investors, entrepreneurs, and established Chinese tech giants have in recent months piled into the trend of the metaverse, described as a virtual shared space that blurs the boundaries between the online and offline worlds.
The regulatory moves come as China's technology sector is still smarting from a year-long regulatory crackdown, which has upended once-common industry practices and wiped millions of dollars off share prices.
In contrast, property sector shares soared on Friday after China's finance minister pledged more fiscal support for the economy and an easing of home-purchase down payments in several Chinese cities aimed at reigniting demand. 
China Orient Asset Management, one of China's four large ""bad banks"" set up to dispose of non-performing loans from major state banks, also got approval to issue bonds to resolve risks in the property sector that have walloped developers' bonds and shares..
A sub-index tracking China's real estate developers rose 4.6% in its strongest daily performance since November, with state-owned Poly Developments and Holdings up 5.4%. In Hong Kong, the mainland properties index ended 2.9% higher, led by a 5.3% rise in Sunac China Holdings.

In another move targeted at stabilising commodity markets, the NDRC said it would ensure supply and stabilise prices of primary products and key raw materials, including iron ore and fertiliser.
The announcement, made just before the close of mainland stock markets, pushed a Hong Kong materials sub-index lower in late trade to close down 0.93%.

Investing.com – Hermes stock (PA:HRMS) fell 4% in Paris trading Friday after the company’s self-imposed production caps limited its capacity to capture the waiting demand for its hand-crafted Birkin and Kelly bags in the fourth quarter.
At one point, the stock shaved off 8.4%, falling the most in five years.
The luxury goods maker generally caps volume growth in its leather goods production at 7-8% annually, making it a unique selling proposition for finicky consumers.
""It takes 15 hours for an Hermes bag. Even if there's a lot of demand, I’m not going to start doing them in 13 hours to raise production,"" Reuters quoted Executive Chairman Axel Dumas as saying.
That exclusive policy meant fourth-quarter sales at the leather goods and saddlery division were down 5.4% at constant exchange rates. The business accounted for 45% of 2021 revenue. Hermes said it will boost production capacity with new sites in France.
Investors could also be disappointed by the lack of a special dividend, Reuters quoted a Citi report as saying.
On the lines of its rivals Louis Vuitton (PA:LVMH) and  Kering  (PA:PRTP), Hermes raised prices too, by 3.5% on average this year. Hermes usually undertakes price hikes once a year while its mostly hand-made produce insulates it from much of the rise in energy prices.
Total revenue rose 11% to 2.4 billion euros ($2.7 billion), relying on about 30% growth each in ready-to-wear and accessories as well as silk and textiles.
Revenues grew above their 2019 levels in all regions except for France, where the absence of deep-pocketed tourists hurt business.
Annual net income rose 77% to 2.4 billion euros. Recurring operating margin for the year rose 8 percentage points to 39%. The company revenue in the current year will be higher."

The boom in e-commerce during the pandemic is also helping warehouse operators like Segro remain relatively resilient in the face of rising inflationary pressures.
""We are seeing new names emerge in the space — rapid grocery delivery services and other 'q-commerce' businesses — and its impact is now being felt more widely across the portfolio, for example in our urban estates in Germany, France and Spain,"" Segro said, using a term for ""quick-commerce"".
In a sign of rising interest in the rapid delivery business, U.S. private equity giant Blackstone (NYSE:BX) said this week it was leading a nearly $24 billion recapitalisation of Mileway, Europe's largest operator of urban warehouses.
Segro said on Friday adjusted pre-tax profit jumped to 356 million pounds ($484.9 million) in 2021, from 296 million pounds a year earlier, while a measure that reflects the value of its buildings, called EPRA Net Tangible Assets, surged 40% to 1,137 pence per share.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Car spare parts dealers in Sri Lanka's main city of Colombo are receiving a steady stream of customers looking for what is fast becoming a prized commodity in the island nation - side mirrors for Suzuki's compact Wagon R.
The scramble for the humble product highlights rising economic risks for the South Asian country as imports slump, foreign exchange reserves plummet and a potential sovereign default looms. 
Suzuki's boxy, five-seater vehicle is hugely popular in Sri Lanka, given its low running costs. With some 30,000 of the cars sold over the past four years in a nation that has relatively high road crash rates, replacement side mirrors are commonly sought in the spare parts shops scattered across the suburb of Nugegoda. 
""Everyone is looking for Wagon R parts,"" said Supun Deshak, a salesman at one store in the district where shop fronts are piled high with reconditioned spare parts.
The difficulty is that importers are struggling to source car parts because they are deemed non-essential imports under rules drawn up by the government to save dwindling foreign exchange reserves after the coronavirus pandemic hit. 
Reserves have plummeted to $2.36 billion from $7.5 billion in January 2020. At the same time, the government faces a debt obligation of around $4 billion this year, and local banks are often unable to provide dollars that importers need.
""The biggest concern right now is the difficulty in importing spare parts for maintaining the existing fleet of vehicles,"" said Yasendra Amerasinghe, chairman of the Ceylon Motor Traders Association (CMTA), which represents the country's major vehicle importers.  
The CMTA estimates imports of car spare parts will fall by around 30% in value terms this fiscal year, compared to pre-pandemic levels, primarily because of the foreign exchange shortages in the past few months.
Five auto dealers in Colombo told Reuters many spare parts were already in short supply, with only a trickle of new stock coming in from abroad, driving up local prices.
Exacerbating the problem are thieves looking to make a quick buck by stealing side mirrors of popular models like the Wagon R to sell in a thriving grey market, the dealers said. 
The price of reconditioned Wagon R mirrors has surged by more than 35% from pre-pandemic levels to at least 30,000 Sri Lankan rupees ($148.5) per piece, the dealers said.
SECOND-HAND CAR PRICE SURGE
The economic crisis facing the country - its worst in a decade - has also triggered an escalation in second-hand vehicle prices. 
Almost all car imports were banned in March 2020, followed by a stop on imports of other non-essential goods like airconditioners, refrigerators and video games consoles, as part of the government's bid to deal with the financial strife. 
That has pushed the cost of some second-hand vehicles up by more than 100%, the CMTA said. Sri Lanka does not mass produce any cars locally. 
A used Wagon R currently costs around 5 million rupees ($24,752), well above the 2.8 million rupees a brand new vehicle cost in 2018, said CMTA Vice Chairman Virann De Zoysa.
That's added further pressure on the spares market as many car owners look to cash in on the price jump but first try to spruce up their vehicle with replacement parts, said Musthaq Nazeer of Azka Auto Supply, a small shop packed with car mirrors and lights.

As global automotive supply chain disruptions add another layer to the problem, the CMTA said it has asked the government to classify car spare parts as an essential item, along with some food and medicine, to increase imports.
""Every distributor's out of many, many key parts,"" De Zoysa said. ""We're turning away customers on a daily basis.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's New South Wales state ordered employers of freelance delivery drivers such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) to pay a minimum rate, a decision hailed by a union as making it the world's first jurisdiction to compel the retailer to follow laws on such payments.
The measure, to be phased in over three years from March 1, requires companies which hire drivers with their own small vehicles to pay a minimum of A$37.80 ($27.20) per hour in Australia's most populous state.
That makes the state, the headquarters of Amazon's operations in Australia, the first place where the retail giant must pay wages to contractors that are set by law, the Transport Workers' Union (TWU) said.
""Gig behemoths are on notice: this is what happens when workers call out these dangerous bottom feeders and fight together for a fair day's pay,"" said the union's national secretary, Michael Kaine.
""For too long the likes of Amazon have been able to exploit independent contractor loopholes to sidestep rights and rip workers off fair rates of pay,"" he added in a statement.
An Amazon spokesperson said the company was ""pleased to continue offering Amazon Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX) delivery partners competitive pay as well as the flexibility to work when it suits them"".
Flex drivers with a sedan in New South Wales already earned more, on average, than the enforceable rate that would take effect from March 1, the spokesperson added.
The minimum wage ruling applies to all companies which hire casual delivery drivers with cars weighing less than two tonnes, according to the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission ruling, which was reviewed by Reuters. Amazon is the dominant employer of small car drivers with thousands of contractors in the state, the union says.
Shares of the $1.6-trillion company have nearly doubled in value over the past two years, as the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a rush to online shopping.
But it has faced scrutiny over perceptions that it takes a hands-off approach to front-line worker safety and labour laws in the countries where it operates. 
Last year, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ordered Amazon to pay $61.7 million to reimburse Flex drivers for tips it was accused of stealing.
Since Flex launched in Australia in 2020, drivers, who use their own vehicles to deliver by deadline packages picked up from Amazon distribution centres, have received varying amounts set by the company as they are not technically employees.
Friday's ruling by the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission confirms that it is possible for all workers to have access to enforceable rights and protections, regardless of employment status, the TWU said.

""Having regard to the parties' submissions and evidence, I am satisfied that the variations proposed...would result in fair and reasonable conditions for the contract carriers to whom they apply,"" wrote commissioner Damian Sloan in the ruling.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Friday with investors digesting the news that Russia and the U.S. are set to meet next week, raising hopes that there can be a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis
By 4 AM ET (0900 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France climbed 0.6% while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.2%.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov agreed to meet U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken for talks in Europe next week, the State Department said late Thursday.
This follows the ramping up of tensions after Ukrainian government forces and Moscow-backed rebels accused each other of breaking cease-fire rules, potentially creating a pretext for Russia to invade.
Helping the tone Friday was the news that U.K. retail sales rose 1.9% on the month in January, a jump of 9.1% on the year, as consumers returned to shops after the Omicron surge in late 2021.
Additionally, France's unemployment rate fell in the final quarter of last year to the lowest level since 2008, dropping to 7.4% from 8.0% in the previous three months, better than the expected 7.8%.
Corporate news from France was not so good, however. Electricite de France (PA:EDF) stock fell 4% after the French government announced it would pump in over 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) to prop up the troubled state-controlled power group, with the company undertaking a 2.5 billion euro rights issue as a consequence.
Hermes (PA:HRMS) stock fell 4.8% after the luxury house said sales grew by 11% in the fourth quarter of 2021, a touch below market expectations that had driven the stock to an eye-wateringly high valuation by late last year. It's now down nearly 30% from November but still trades at over 50 times 2021 earnings.
More encouragingly,  Renault  (PA:RENA) stock climbed 4.5% after the French auto giant posted a profit for 2021, beating expectations after two straight years of losses aggravated by the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent chip supply issues.
Staying in the auto sector, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG) stock fell 0.3% after a container ship carrying a number of the group’s vehicles from Germany to the U.S. caught fire near the coast of Portugal's Azores islands.
NatWest (LON:NWG) stock fell 2% after the U.K. lender relied on releasing more provisions for souring loans in order to beat earnings estimates in the fourth quarter, while Eni (MI:ENI) stock climbed 1.3% after the Italian energy company reported that its fourth-quarter net income had returned to pre-Covid levels after oil and gas prices soared.
Oil prices slipped, heading for a weekly fall, as traders digested the raised prospects of Iranian oil returning to the global market, which outweighed ongoing Russia-Ukraine risks.
A draft accord is taking shape that outlines a sequence of steps that would eventually lead to the removal of oil sanctions on the Persian Gulf country’s crude exports. Such a deal could result in an additional 1 million barrels a day of oil coming back to the market.
By 4 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% lower at $90.44 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.3% to $91.71. Both contracts were set for their first weekly fall in nine weeks, after hitting their highest levels for over seven years earlier in the week.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,896.00/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1373.

The Model 3 sedan description on Tesla’s Korean-language web site was changed to say the vehicle is capable of travelling a ""maximum"" of 528 kilometres (328 miles) on a single charge, from ""more than"" 528 kilometres, screen shots captured by local media showed. 
The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) this week said it had sent a report to the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) maker stating that it had exaggerated the mileage of some of its models, including Model 3, in violation of the Act on Fair Labeling and Advertising.
Analysts said most electric vehicles could generally experience some loss of driving range in cold weather. 
""The KFTC plans to give the automaker the opportunity to respond to our finding and then hold a general meeting to review and determine the extent to which the automaker has violated the law and decide the level of sanctions,"" said a commission official, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. 
On its U.S. website, the Model 3 description said: ""Go anywhere with ""up to"" 358 miles of estimated range on a single charge."" That distance equates to about 576km.

The description for Hyundai Motor Co's Ioniq 5 midsize crossover also states its range as travelling a ""maximum"" 429km on a single charge. 
Although analysts said driving range labelling should follow each country's specific guidelines, the KFTC's claims over Tesla's mileage advertisement would most likely not have a significant impact on the automaker's sales in the country, citing Tesla's dominant position and reputation in the EV market.

The retailer, majority-owned by Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, said it expects its 2021 headline loss, the main profit measure in South Africa, from total operations to come in between 1.478 billion rand and 1.571 billion rand. That is at least 60% to 70% wider than the loss of 924 million rand reported in 2020.
Excluding food businesses held for sale such as Cambridge and Rhino stores, the loss is seen widening to between 938 million rand and 1 billion rand.
The owner of Game general merchandise chain had said in December it took a significant inventory write-off because of the looting that erupted after President Jacob Zuma was forced to turn himself in to be jailed for contempt of court in July.

The looting directly impacted 43 of its stores, resulting in lost trading profit of around 450 million rand and an accounting loss of around 650 million rand after insurance proceeds.

Profit for the October-December period rose to 468 million ringgit ($112 million) from 149 million ringgit a year earlier, while revenue climbed 53% to 5.55 billion ringgit.
Malaysian plantations have suffered a severe labour crunch worsened by pandemic-induced border closures, which cut production and pushed benchmark prices of crude palm oil to records.
Crude palm oil prices are expected to stay elevated through the first half of the 2022 amid supply constraints, Sime Darby, the world's largest oil palm planter by landholdings, said in an exchange filing. 
But it expects production to increase in the second half of the year, in line with the high-crop season and as the government looks to free up recruitment of migrant workers, the company said. 
""Although the threat of COVID-19 persists, the group anticipates that with better control measures and responses, the return to normalcy across the world will pick up pace, together with a corresponding increase in demand,"" it said.
The company expects satisfactory performance for financial year 2022, it added. 
Mechanisation, automation and digitalisation of its operations will be a top priority this year, Sime Darby said, as the group looks to reduce dependence on manual labour. 
The firm, whose products have been barred by U.S. authorities over accusations of forced labour, said it looked forward to soon completing an independent assessment of labour operation. 

This week, the company said it would set aside about $20 million to compensate migrant workers who paid recruitment fees to secure jobs, a practice that often leads to debt bondage.

1431,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 01:06AM ET</span>","Trump, children are ordered to testify in N.Y. attorney general probe","By Karen Freifeld and Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York judge ruled on Thursday that former U.S. President Donald Trump and two of his adult children must answer questions under oath within 21 days in the state attorney general's civil probe into their family company.
Justice Arthur Engoron of the New York state court in Manhattan ruled in favor of Attorney General Letitia James in directing Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr and his daughter Ivanka Trump to testify.
Engoron said James had ""the clear right"" to issue her subpoenas and question the Trumps after having uncovered ""copious evidence of possible financial fraud.""
Failing to issue subpoenas ""would have been a blatant dereliction of duty,"" Engoron wrote.
""Today, justice prevailed,"" James said in a statement. ""No one will be permitted to stand in the way of the pursuit of justice, no matter how powerful they are. No one is above the law.""
The decision followed a two-hour hearing in which the Trumps' lawyers accused James of doing an end run around their clients' constitutional rights by seeking testimony she could then use against them in a parallel criminal investigation.
Trump attorney Alina Habba accused James of ""selective prosecution and prosecutorial misconduct that this country has never seen,"" citing what she called Democratic attorney general's ""vile disdain"" for Trump, a Republican.
""If he was not who he is, she would not be doing this,"" Habba said. ""This court can help stop this circus.""
Trump in a statement issued later on Thursday called the accusations false and accused James of a political agenda in targeting him and his family. 
""It is a continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt in history - and remember, I can't get a fair hearing in New York because of the hatred of me by judges and the judiciary. Its not possible!,"" Trump said in the statement.
Last month, James said her nearly three-year investigation into the Trump Organization had uncovered significant evidence of possible fraud https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ny-attorney-general-details-possible-fraud-donald-trumps-family-business-2022-01-19. 
She described what she called misleading statements about the values of the Trump brand and six properties, saying the company may have inflated real estate values to obtain bank loans and reduced them to lower tax bills.
The Trumps have not been accused of criminal wrongdoing.
Engoron declined the Trumps' request to put James' case on hold while the criminal case, led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, is pending. James joined that probe last May.
The criminal investigation, begun by Bragg's predecessor Cyrus Vance, resulted last July in tax fraud charges against the Trump Organization and its longtime chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. Both pleaded not guilty.
'COMPLETELY MISSES THE MARK'
Engoron said the argument that James was trying to bypass grand jury protections, which would give the Trumps immunity, by issuing civil subpoenas ""completely misses the mark.""
He said the Trumps could refuse to answer questions, noting that Donald Trump's other adult son Eric Trump invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination more than 500 times when the attorney general's office questioned him in 2020.
The judge also rejected the Trumps' claim that James' sometimes aggressive public statements about investigating Donald Trump, including a pledge that ""we're definitely going to sue him,"" illustrated the ""impropriety"" of her probe.
Engoron said the spark for the investigation was not James' dislike of the former president, but rather congressional testimony from Donald Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen that the Trumps were ""cooking the books.""
The judge also noted Trump's history of investigations by the attorney general's office, including ""significant settlements"" with James' predecessors concerning a namesake university and charitable foundation.
Trump is suing to try to stop James' investigation. He has not said whether he will run for president again in 2024.
Engoron ruled after Trump's longtime accounting firm Mazars USA decided last week to cut ties with him and the Trump Organization, saying it could no longer stand behind a decade of financial statements despite finding no material discrepancies.

The Trump Organization said Mazars' findings effectively rendered James' and Bragg's investigations ""moot.""
Washington D.C.'s attorney general is separately suing the Trump Organization and Trump's inaugural committee over the alleged misuse of $1.1 million of charitable funds. A Sept. 26 trial date was set on Thursday.

(Reuters) - Details about former U.S. President Donald Trump's new social media app are trickling out as about 500 beta testers have begun using an early version of “Truth Social,” two sources told Reuters. 
The testing of Truth Social comes a year after Trump was banned from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube. His new media and technology venture, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), has pledged to deliver an “engaging and censorship-free experience” on the app, which Chief Executive Devin Nunes has said will launch by the end of March.
TMTG remains shrouded in secrecy and is regarded with skepticism by some in tech and media circles. It remains unclear whether the app's goal of freedom of expression can co-exist with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s and Google's app store policies. TMTG was not immediately available to comment. 
Liz Willis, a correspondent and vice president of operations at Right Side Broadcasting Network, told Reuters she received an email Tuesday stating that “T Media Tech LLC has invited you to test Truth Social.” 
Willis was able to download the app on her iPhone through the beta testing site TestFlight, the Apple-owned product that developers use prior to launching their apps in the App Store. Users have been posting on this version of Truth Social for the past 24 hours, Willis said Wednesday morning. 
Wayne Dupree, founder of WayneDupree.com and host of a conservative podcast, is also among the app's beta testers. 
""I can see my participation in Truth Social outgrowing Twitter because it seems I am not suppressed like I have been on Twitter, since 2016,"" said Dupree, who added there was currently no edit button.
""I want to share my single dad chronicles. I want my followers to see I am more than politics and I feel Truth Social is going to allow my audience to see me as Twitter purposely does not.""
Twitter has repeatedly denied its platform is politically biased.
By late Wednesday, Trump's account on Truth Social had 317 followers, according to a screenshot viewed by Reuters. Trump had 88 million followers before Twitter banned him.
Truth Social allows users to post and share a “truth” the same way they would do so with a tweet. There are no ads, according to Willis and a second source familiar with TMTG. 
Users choose who they follow and the feed is a mix of individual posts and an RSS-like news feed. They will be alerted if someone mentions or begins following them.
According to a screenshot, the app says that “A new direct messaging experience will be available soon. Please stay tuned.” 
Several conservative media personalities also have accounts, according to a screen shot reviewed by Reuters. Reuters could not immediately reach those individuals for comment. 
Trump’s account shows one “truth” that he posted three days ago, verified at the account of @realDonaldTrump with a red check and with the message: “Get Ready! Your favorite President will see you soon!” 
Donald Trump Jr on Twitter highlighted his father's first post on Truth Social. 
TMTG released an updated version, “Truth Social 0.9,” Wednesday morning. It is testing for bug fixes for “re-truths,” which is what it calls a retweet, “image aspect ratios and compression, improved error handling and account creation.”
On Wednesday morning Nunes, who joined the app on Feb. 10, posted: “Good morning Truth testers. Please screenshot any bugs when the screenshot preview comes up.” 

If a tester sees anything that they don't like, they can screenshot it and report it to the developers. 
A message says: “Beta feedback and device information is collected and shared with the developer and it will be linked to your email address.”

The company proposed a 16% rise in its gross dividend to 2.90 Swiss francs per share. Sika expects annual sales to surpass 10 billion Swiss francs for the first time in 2022, driven by a more than 10% sales jump in local currencies.
Sika, whose products are also used by carmakers as adhesives, also said it expects an annual sales growth of 6-8% in the years up to 2023 and an operating profit margin of 15-18% from 2021. 

After making seven acquisitions last year, Sika said it was aiming to increase its share of the construction chemicals market from around 10% now to 12% by 2025.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Intel Corp expects its profit margin to drop this year and then be steady for several years as it invests in new technologies and factories to meet rising chip demand, but added it forecasts climbs from 2025.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger also said Intel would be interested in participating if a consortium emerges to own the British semiconductor and software design company Arm Ltd.
Gross margins are set to drop to 52% this year from nearly 58% last year on a non-GAAP basis, Intel said at its Investor Day conference on Thursday. It saw levels of 51-53% in 2023-2024 before a climb back to 54-58% the following years.
Intel predicted a revenue increase of 1.7% to $76.0 billion in 2022, then mid-to-high single digit percentage point growth in 2023-2024, followed by gains of 10-12% for 2025-2026.
Shares fell about 1% in after hours trading. 
""I think the vision and strategy are strong, but there are still questions about their ability to execute,"" said Bob O'Donnell, an analyst for TECHnalysis Research. ""The progress and time lines they laid out do seem reasonable.""
David Zinsner, Intel's new chief financial officer, promised rising revenue and profit. ""We're going to instill financial discipline through this company."" That includes using more outside capital for expansion as well as relying on local government grants, he said.
Intel's investment announcements over the past year include $20 billion for a new greenfield chip factory in Ohio. This week it said it would buy Israeli chipmaker  Tower Semiconductor  (NASDAQ:TSEM) for $5.4 billion. Those investments will help Intel ramp up a business to build chips for other companies.
Gelsinger told Reuters on Thursday that the Tower deal doesn't change its plans for investing in Europe and reiterated that an announcement would come soon.
On Arm, he said there had been talk in the industry about forming a consortium even before Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp proposed to buy Arm from SoftBank Group Corp. That deal, valued at up to $80 billion, officially collapsed last week. SoftBank cited regulatory hurdles and said it will seek to list the company.

Gelsinger said Intel would be happy to see Arm do an IPO or be owned by a consortium. 
""We're not big users of Arm, but we do use Arm. We're going to get to be bigger users of Arm as we make it part of our IFS (foundry business) agenda as well,"" he told Reuters. ""So if a consortium would emerge, we would probably be very favorable to participate in it in some manner.""

As other countries relax restrictions, China has maintained a zero-tolerance approach, shutting down transmission routes whenever they arise, ordering mass testing programmes and maintaining mask mandates. 
Some analysts have forecast a decline in economic growth this year, saying the challenge posed by the more infectious Omicron variant would significantly raise containment costs and further disrupt China's supply chains.
But the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the ruling Communist Party's corruption watchdog, said in an article posted on its website that existing policies had proved cost-effective by isolating affected communities and allowing others to operate normally.
It said the shift to a more ""precise"" and targeted approach to locking down outbreaks had ""reduced the impact on economic and social development"".
China's ""zero-COVID"" policies have put it increasingly at odds with the rest of the world, and some experts say that years of isolation will leave the population vulnerable to more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants once restrictions are finally eased.
CCDI said the ""destructive power"" unleashed by the easing of restrictions had become very evident in other countries, including the United States.
Overseas experts are divided about the impact that a sustained ""zero-COVID"" approach will have on China's economy, and on its ambitions to switch to low-carbon growth.
""Even with a more targeted approach, the simple fact of more transmissible variants means that China is likely to have to stay pretty stringent,"" said Michael Hirson, China head of the Eurasia Group consultancy, which has launched an index measuring the economic impact of zero-COVID policies.
""It means a recovery that's more driven by industry and investment and less driven by consumption and services, which are a cleaner form of growth,"" he added. 

ANZ said this week that China's supply chain problems were not caused by its ""zero-COVID"" strategy and had originated overseas. 
But although China's approach was ""not as restrictive as perceived"", with its more localised measures helping to reduce the economic impact, service sectors continued to struggle, the bank said in a note.

1437,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 10:46PM ET</span>","Next U.S. aviation safety chief will face Boeing, reform challenges","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The next head of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will face challenges overseeing Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and a series of reforms mandated by Congress in the wake of two fatal 737 MAX crashes.
The job opened late Wednesday when the FAA announced administrator Steve Dickson, 64, would resign effective March 31, about halfway through his five-year term. 
Among those mentioned by congressional and industry officials as potential replacements are former pilots C. B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger and Lee Moak. 
Sullenberger, the current U.S. representative on the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), rose to fame in 2009 when he safely landed an Airbus A320 on New York's Hudson (NYSE:HUD) River after hitting a flock of geese - known as the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" flight. 
Moak, a former president of the Air Line Pilots Association, is currently a member of the U.S. Postal Board of Governors.
Dickson headed the FAA as it oversaw a comprehensive review of the then-grounded Boeing 737 MAX. He took a hard line, warning in late 2019 that Boeing was pursuing ""a return-to-service schedule that is not realistic.""
Dickson even piloted the plane in September 2020 for a test flight before approving its return that included extensive training and software updates. 
The best-selling, single-aisle airplane was grounded for 20 months after two crashes killed 346 people in the space of five months, returning to service in late 2020.
Congress approved sweeping legislation in December that year, boosting the FAA's oversight of aircraft manufacturers, requiring disclosure of critical safety information and providing new whistleblower protections.
Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said in a statement on Thursday ""there is much work still to do to maintain America’s leadership in aviation- implementing congressionally-mandated safety reforms, training a workforce skilled in advanced technology, and furthering aerospace research and development.""
The incoming administrator will also face the headache of the deployment of 5G wireless on the C-Band spectrum, an issue that saw major international airlines scramble to cancel or rejig U.S flights last month amid warnings the network could interfere with sensitive aviation electronics like radio altimeters.
Telecommunications companies AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) agreed to keep 5G towers off last month's network rollout, postponing their deployment until early July, and to take ""additional steps to minimize energy coming from 5G base stations – both nationwide and to an even greater degree around public airports and heliports.""
The FAA recently conducted test flights with active 5G, carrying AT&T and Verizon engineers onboard, and the agency is ""still doing the analytics right now,"" Dickson said. ""It's really unprecedented for us to be working with an industry that we don't regulate.... That is part of what needed to happen.""
Dickson said on Thursday Boeing has made significant changes in recent years and with the FAA the airplane manufacturer ""really improved the discipline within their engineering organization and I am confident in our oversight of their product.""
The FAA is still scrutinizing a number of issues involving Boeing airplanes and on Tuesday said it would not allow Boeing to self-certify 787 Dreamliners.
Boeing agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department in January 2021 including $2.5 billion in fines and compensation stemming from the 737 MAX crashes.

House Transportation Committee chair Peter DeFazio said President Joe Biden ""must now nominate a new leader committed to the highest standards of aviation safety"" and ""hold Boeing accountable for the tragic consequences of their decision to put profits over people when rolling out the 737 MAX.""
Dickson said Thursday his safety team ""knows that I have their back.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Friday morning, extending a selloff as the ongoing tensions over Ukraine decreased investors’ risk appetite.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.38% by 9:18 PM ET (2:18 AM GMT). Data released earlier in the day showed that the national core consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.2% year-on-year, while the national CPI grew 0.5% year-on-year, in January.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.25% and in Australia, the ASX 200 fell 0.56%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.34%.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.11% while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.42%.
The U.S. continued to warn that Russia is planning an attack on Ukraine, which has been flatly denied by Russia. However, Ukrainian government forces and Moscow-backed separatists in the conflict in the eastern part of the country accused each other of breaking cease-fire rules.
Global shares are set for a second week of losses, due to the tensions in Ukraine and the likelihood of tighter U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy. Some $2.2 trillion worth of option expirations set to hit the market Friday could also heighten volatility.
Bets that the Fed will start hiking interest rates in March 2022 have eased somewhat as the tension in Ukraine grabs the spotlight. However, investors continue to mull the impact of tighter monetary policy on the economic recovery.
“We’ve been calling for a long time for increased volatility, but when it finally comes it’s nerve-wracking for everybody,” BMO Family Office LLC deputy chief investment officer Carol Schleif told Bloomberg.
“It’s important to remember that the Fed isn’t going to start pulling back its support for the economy, either in terms of the balance sheet purchases or interest-rate raises, if they weren’t trying to cool a very strong economy,” she added.
Meanwhile, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Thursday that bringing down inflation could require the central bank overshooting a neutral target interest rate, which he sees as about 2%. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester added that she supports hiking interest rates in March and tightening monetary policy at a faster pace if needed to curb inflation.
Other Fed officials, including Charles Evans, Christopher Waller, and Lael Brainard, will speak at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum later in the day.
U.S.-China tensions were also in the spotlight, with China’s  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. (HK:9988)-owned online marketplace AliExpress, and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.'s (HK:0700) WeChat messaging platform, added to a U.S. list of markets notorious for counterfeiting and piracy.

""The company is in the final stage of launching a new expansion initiative to complement all these capabilities we have in the Pesqueria facility,"" said Maximo Vedoya, Ternium's chief executive told analysts on Wednesday.
The investment will go towards expanding a Mexican plant located near Monterrey known as Pesqueria, a facility dating back to 2013 which recently added a hot-rolling mill to serve the automotive, appliance and construction sectors. 
The expansion plan includes a second cold rolling mill, a third galvanizing mill, and several finishing lines.
The steel production company, which operates in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, the United States and Central America, posted $4.3 billion in net income in the fourth quarter, up from $867 million in the same period a year before.
However, Ternium's shipments amounted to 2.8 million tons in the last quarter of 2021, down 8% compared with 2020, mainly as a result of lower steel shipments in Mexico.

The company's shipments in Mexico, one of its main markets, dropped more than expected during the fourth quarter due to supply chain constraints and a semiconductor shortage for vehicle manufacturing. The auto industry represents one fourth of its sales volume. 
Ternium's Chief Operating Officer Pablo Daniel Brizzio, said he expects finished steel shipments in the region to increase during the first quarter.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slid on Thursday, with the S&P 500 marking its biggest daily percentage drop in two weeks, as investors shifted to defensive sectors and safe havens such as bonds and gold as geopolitical tensions between Washington and Russia over Ukraine flared.
After Ukrainian forces and pro-Moscow rebels traded fire in eastern Ukraine, U.S. President Joe Biden said there was every indication Russia was planning to invade in the next few days and was preparing a pretext to justify it.
Russia accused Biden of stoking tensions and released a strongly worded letter saying Washington was ignoring its security demands and threatening unspecified ""military-technical measures"".
On Wall Street, the growth-oriented technology and communication services sectors were among the hardest hit. Financials also declined as U.S. Treasury yields moved lower.
Developments in Ukraine have added to uncertainty about the path of the Federal Reserve's tightening plans to fight inflation. 
""There's a lot of nervousness out there and as we approach the weekend nothing’s been settled between Russia and Ukraine,"" said Michael James, managing director, equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. 
""The continued weakness, especially in the growth names, is indicative of elevated nervousness and sellers continuing to swamp buyers in just about every stock.""
The defensive utilities and consumer staples sectors were Wall Street's only advancers, with staples getting a lift from a 4.01% jump in Walmart (NYSE:WMT) after it posted record holiday sales. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 622.24 points, or 1.78%, to 34,312.03, the S&P 500 lost 94.75 points, or 2.12%, to 4,380.26 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 407.38 points, or 2.88%, to 13,716.72.
The drop for the Dow was the biggest daily percentage decline since Nov. 30 while the Nasdaq's decline was its largest percentage fall since Feb. 3. 
With the end of earnings season on the horizon, chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) tumbled 7.51% as flat gross margins and concern about its exposure to the crypto market overshadowed an upbeat current-quarter revenue forecast, and helped give the Philadelphia Semiconductor index its first daily decline this week.
TripAdvisor Inc (NASDAQ:TRIP) lost 2.50% after the hotel search website operator posted a surprise fourth-quarter loss.  Albemarle  (NYSE:ALB) Corp plunged 19.91% as the lithium producer forecast downbeat annual earnings.
As risk aversion pushed bond yields lower, big banks including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) all lost ground. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) fell even after positive outlooks from the lenders.
Gold was another beneficiary of the move toward safer assets, touching an eight-month high of $1,900.99 an ounce.
Among other big movers, DoorDash Inc shot up 10.69% after it reported upbeat quarterly revenue as food delivery demand showed no sign of slowing.
 Hasbro Inc  (NASDAQ:HAS) gained 2.09% after activist investor Alta Fox Capital Management nominated five directors to the toymaker's board and urged changes including a spinoff of its unit housing games such as ""Dungeons & Dragons"".

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.81-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.63-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 6 new 52-week highs and 19 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 27 new highs and 249 new lows.

In a letter released by Buffett's office on Thursday, Buffett said one of his investment managers paid about $77 per share for Berkshire's 14.7 million Activision shares, acquiring about 85% of his position in October and the rest in November.
Buffett also said Berkshire had ""no prior knowledge"" that Microsoft was working on a $68.7 billion takeover of Activision, whose franchises include ""Call of Duty"" and ""Candy Crush,"" announced on Jan. 18.
He did not say which investment manager, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, made Berkshire's approximately $1.1 billion investment.
Buffett sent his letter to various media that had reported on the investment, after one incorrectly said Berkshire paid an average of $66.53 per share for its Activision stake, not $77.
That report was later corrected.
Buffett said his investment manager could have amassed his stake after the merger was announced, when Activision sometimes traded at around $78 per share. ""His purchase was no bonanza of any sort for him or Berkshire,"" Buffett wrote.
Activision shares fell in November amid accusations concerning sexual harassment of employees and misconduct by several top managers.
The shares closed Thursday down 49 cents at $80.97, below Microsoft's $95 per share takeover offer. Analysts expect the merger will get tough antitrust scrutiny.

Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger on Wednesday called Activision chief Bobby Kotick ""one of the smartest business executives I know.""
Munger spoke at the annual meeting of Daily Journal Corp, the newspaper publisher and legal software company he chairs.

""We will not turn a blind eye to providers that have not done enough to protect consumers from spoofed robocalls,"" said FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, saying the FCC had referred the companies to the commission's Enforcement Bureau.
The FCC is overseeing compliance with provider phone companies to implement standards designed to help prevent unwanted phone calls, required by June 2021.
The standards, known as ""STIR/SHAKEN"", provide a common information sharing language between networks to verify caller ID information and help prevent robocalls.
Under a Congressional directive, providers meeting early implementation goals 2020 were granted some conditional leniency. 
The FCC said Vonage is not verifying caller ID information for all authenticated calls it receives, as required by FCC rules.
Vonage did not immediately comment. 

Bandwidth said it was an early adopter of the standards ""to prevent robocalling"" but acknowledged it still operates ""some legacy equipment that supports a small amount of traffic that cannot support the STIR/SHAKEN standards at this time.""
Bandwidth added it is ""working diligently to move this traffic off of this legacy equipment so we can be fully compliant with STIR/SHAKEN standards.""

The company, which got a boost during the pandemic with people stuck at home, has lately seen demand for streaming services ease with curbs put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 being rolled back.
Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) last month forecast weak first-quarter subscriber growth.
Roku said on Thursday it expects current-quarter revenue of $720 million, compared with analysts' estimates of $748.5 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Issues caused by constraints in the global supply chain such as chip shortages and rising freight costs have affected the production of televisions among other electronics, raising prices of end products such as Roku's streaming device.
The company said acquiring customers will remain a priority and it will not pass on higher costs to customers. Roku's gross margins fell about 3% in the reported quarter.
Delayed advertising spend in verticals affected by supply chain issues will continue into 2022, affecting how it monetizes content, Roku said.
Sales of televisions are likely to remain below pre-pandemic levels affecting the rate at which it acquires active customers, according to the company.

Roku reported fourth-quarter revenue of $865.3 million, compared with estimates of $894.01 million. 
The company's shares were trading at $116.60 on the Nasdaq.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Tesla Inc and its Chief Executive Elon Musk on Thursday accused the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of harassing them with an ""endless"" and ""unrelenting"" investigation to punish Musk for being an outspoken critic of the government.
The accusation came in a letter to U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan, who presided over a 2018 SEC settlement stemming from Musk's tweet about a potential buyout of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
""Mr. Musk and Tesla respectfully seek a course correction,"" wrote Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk and Tesla. ""Enough is enough."" 
The SEC declined to comment. In a one-sentence order, Nathan directed the regulator to respond by Feb. 24.
Thursday's letter escalates Musk's battle with regulators as they scrutinize his social media posts and Tesla's treatment of workers, including accusations of discrimination.
It followed Tesla's disclosure on Feb. 7 that it had received a subpoena from the SEC about its compliance with the 2018 settlement.
The SEC sued Musk in August 2018 after he tweeted he had ""funding secured"" to potentially take his electric car company private at $420 per share. In reality, a buyout was not close.
Tesla and Musk settled by agreeing to each pay $20 million in civil fines, and to let Tesla lawyers vet some of Musk's communications in advance, including tweets that could affect Tesla's stock price. Musk also gave up Tesla's chairmanship.
The latest subpoena was issued on Nov. 16, 10 days after Musk polled his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) followers on whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stake, triggering a sell-off.
CHILLING SPEECH
In Thursday's letter, Spiro accused the SEC of ignoring its commitment to distribute to shareholders the $40 million in fines, while instead ""devoting its formidable resources to endless, unfounded investigations"" into Musk and Tesla.
""Worst of all, the SEC seems to be targeting Mr. Musk and Tesla for unrelenting investigation largely because Mr. Musk remains an outspoken critic of the government; the SEC's outsized efforts seem calculated to chill his exercise of First Amendment rights,"" Spiro wrote.
Spiro asked Nathan to schedule a conference to find out why the SEC is ""issuing subpoenas unilaterally"" without court approval, and why the money isn't being distributed.
If the SEC found that Musk violated the settlement, it could ask Nathan to throw it out and reopen the case, or pursue new charges.
The letter was filed eight days after California's Department of Fair Employment and Housing sued Tesla over allegations by Black workers that it tolerated racial discrimination at its Fremont, California, plant.
Tesla called that lawsuit misguided. It is also trying to reduce or throw out an approximately $137 million jury award to a Black former elevator operator for subjecting him to a hostile work environment at the Fremont plant.
Separately on Thursday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal probe into 416,000 Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles after receiving complaints about unexpected braking tied to its Autopilot system.
Tesla has issued 10 recalls since October, including some under pressure from the NHTSA.

Shares of Tesla closed $47.04, or 5.1%, lower on Thursday to $876.35 on Nasdaq.
The cases are SEC v Musk, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-08865; and SEC v Tesla Inc in the same court, No. 18-08947.

The FTC has previously gone after companies such as Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc in 2017 and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) last year but has been prevented from tackling recent similar cases because of a Supreme Court ruling in April 2021 that said the agency had inappropriately used its rule-making powers to claw back ill-gotten gains. 
The commission - made up of two Democrats and two Republicans - voted unanimously to begin the long process of creating a rule regarding companies that are deceptive about how much a consumer might earn from a gig job, from a multilevel marketing company, or a degree from a for-profit school, among others. 
Republican Commissioner Noah Phillips noted in particular the proliferation of multi-level marketing companies during the coronavirus pandemic. ""The problem does not show signs of waning any time soon,"" he said.
But Democrats on the commission failed to win needed Republican support for a study on pharmacy benefit managers, like CVS Caremark, which serve as intermediaries between drug manufacturers, health insurance plans and pharmacies to negotiate prescription drug prices. Other major companies are UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH)'s OptumRx and  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI)'s Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX).
""I have to say I'm really disappointed by this outcome,"" Chair Lina Khan, a Democrat, said after the 2-2 vote. A tie vote means that the matter does not go forward.

Both Phillips and Christine Wilson, the other Republican, indicated a willingness to revisit the matter.
Independent pharmacists have complained bitterly about PBMs, saying they steer patients to their pharmacies or to mail-order, and offer reimbursements that are sometimes less than the cost of the drug to the independent pharmacist, among other concerns.

Musk sent the tweet on Wednesday just before midnight in California, and had deleted it by midday on Thursday, without explanation. He did not respond to a request for comment.
Musk, the chief executive of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, in late January tweeted support for the Canadian truckers, who have shut down roads and bridges, drawing international attention to their opposition to health policies pushed by Trudeau's government. 
Responding to a tweet describing how Trudeau's government had ordered banks to help cut funding to the protesters, Musk posted a meme of a photo of Hitler, with ""Stop comparing me to Justin Trudeau"" written above his head and ""I had a budget"" below it.
The tweet came as Musk and Tesla on Thursday accused the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of an ""endless"" investigation to punish Musk for criticism of the U.S. government.
Musk has 74 million followers on Twitter, making his one of its most prominent accounts. That is often seen as a marketing boon for electric car maker Tesla.
Musk is known for edgy humor and blunt assessments, but his comparison of Trudeau with the Nazi leader, who was responsible for the genocide of millions of Jews and starting World War Two, went too far for many Twitter users. 
""@elonmusk making a disgusting comparison of Trudeau to Hitler. Don’t do this kind of stuff. You just look dumb,"" wrote @ElliotMalin. At midday on Thursday, in place of the original tweet was the notice ""This Tweet was deleted by the Tweet author.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Gold prices jumped to an eight-month high and safe-haven debt rose on Thursday after U.S. President Joe Biden said there was every indication Russia planned to attack Ukraine, while Moscow accused Washington of ignoring its security demands.
A gauge of global equities fell more than 1% despite strong corporate earnings in Europe as the Ukraine standoff deepened. Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces accused each other of firing shells across a cease-fire line and Britain, as well as the United States, said Russia sought to fabricate a pretext to invade.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the United Nations Security Council that Russia was preparing to attack its neighbor in the ""coming days."" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Vershinin called the comments regrettable and dangerous. 
U.S. and German government bond yields fell and oil slid as talks to resurrect a nuclear deal with Iran entered their final stages, which could boost crude supplies. Losses were capped by the tension between the West and Russia, a top energy exporter.

Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said due to a U.S. holiday on Monday the weekend was long and added to the heightened uncertainty in the market.
""You as a market participant are not incentivized to be fighting the risk-off mood ahead of the weekend when anything can happen,"" Chandler said.

The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose last week, while freezing weather depressed homebuilding in January. 
The Ukraine crisis has unnerved investors who also must watch the Fed and efforts by other central banks to fight soaring global inflation.
""There's a lot of confusion right now and everybody's crystal ball is pretty cloudy,"" said George Mateyo, chief investment officer at Key Private Bank, speaking of both of Ukraine and how the Fed might tighten monetary policy.
The U.S. economy has weathered COVID-19's hit on the economy well, with GDP and corporate earnings at peak levels, which bodes well for the market, Mateyo said.
""It's going to be a challenging year, but not a dire year,"" Mateyo added. ""Expect some volatility this year, but don't abandon risk altogether, don't get super defensive. There's a lot of missed opportunities inside the market.""

The announcement comes against the backdrop of an ongoing chip shortage and global supply chain issues, with chipmakers struggling to keep up with unprecedented demand.
The company's Arc graphics chips, that help video games and other content look more realistic, will compete with rivals Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc.
Intel said in August last year the graphics chips for PCs would arrive in the first quarter of 2022.

Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are introducing notebooks with Intel Arc graphics for sale in the first quarter of 2022, the company said, ahead of its annual investor meeting on Thursday.

Investing.com -- Rising tensions over the situation in Ukraine sent U.S. stocks plunging on Thursday as diplomatic efforts to prevent an outbreak of war continued.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank more than 600 points at the low point of the session and was still trading down 560 with less than a half an hour of trading left.
Russia expelled the second highest-ranking official at the U.S. embassy in Moscow, and President Joe Biden said chances are very high that Russia would invade Ukraine within days. 
Russia-backed rebels and Ukrainian forces earlier exchanged fire across a frontline that divides them, Reuters reported, quoting officials saying that it appeared to be a possible pretext created by Moscow to invade. 
Markets have had a volatile week on the outlook for peace or war in Ukraine, as Russia claims it is pulling troops back from the region. U.S. officials and other Western officials have said they see evidence of the opposite happening.
Making matters worse for U.S. investors, the Federal Reserve is seen likely to hike interest rates by 50 points when it meets in March to get a hold of inflation that has run hotter and longer than expected. 
That has weighed on the tech giants, with the Nasdaq falling 2.7% on Thursday. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Nvidia earnings
Though it reported Wednesday evening, shares of the biggest U.S. chip maker by market value fell again on Thursday. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported flat margins in the most recent quarter, raising concerns over its exposure to cryptocurrency mining.
The chipmaker has set lofty expectations, and the lack of change in its adjusted margin left participants unimpressed. Revenue from cryptocurrency mining processors in the quarter was $24 million, less than a fourth of sales in the previous period.
2. Deere earnings
Agricultural equipment maker Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) will release its first-quarter numbers Friday. The company is expected to report revenue of $8.28 billion and profit per share of $2.24, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.
3. DraftKings earnings
DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG) is seen reporting a loss per share of 80 cents with revenue at $445.87 million. But more and more states are allowing mobile sports betting, so analysts are eager to hear about its outlook.

1456,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 03:48PM ET</span>",Walmart posts record holiday sales as spending remains firm,"By Arriana McLymore and Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) -Walmart Inc fought off snarled supply chains and rising inflation to post its largest-ever holiday season sales and forecast more gains in 2022, a sign the retailer expects consumers to keep spending in its stores.
The world's largest retailer said fourth quarter revenue exceeded $150 billion for the first time, as shoppers bought groceries, apparel and health and wellness services, two years into the pandemic.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s investments over the past year, which included chartering ships, raising worker wages three times, and developing alternative streams of revenue, helped the company prepare for the holiday season without suffering higher costs, analysts said.
On a post-earnings call, Walmart said it also had a ""competitive advantage"" over other businesses struggling with supply chain constraints as it sources over two-thirds of its products from the United States, helping it grow inventories by 28% in the quarter.
Walmart has a customer base that ""is fairly loyal,"" Dave Harden, president of Summit Global Investments, with $50 million in shares of Walmart stock.
""Walmart grows in times of panic and inflation and war and everything else. Problems bring people to Walmart and we know that they take advantage of that.""
The U.S. business got a boost from higher grocery sales as the retailer was able to offer lower prices at a time its competitors were passing on higher input costs to shoppers, the company said.
While Walmart, too, has raised prices on some products, it still undercuts rivals due to its scale and negotiating power with suppliers, helping it gain market share. 
Over 56% of Walmart's total revenues come from grocery.
""Given how dynamic the operating environment is, their resilience and ability to be nimble in managing it has been very impressive,"" Stephens analyst Ben Bienvenu said.
Despite higher product prices, U.S. Commerce Department data showed that consumer spending has remained strong with U.S. retail sales rising by the most in 10 months in January. 
Walmart also said sales in January, the last month of its fourth quarter, were its best on a two-year basis, citing customers who are ""in good shape with a strong balance sheet."" 
Overall, U.S. comparable sales grew 5.6% in the quarter and are expected to rise 3% in fiscal 2023, topping analysts' expectations. 
The company also forecast higher overall earnings and sales for the year. 
MARGIN CONTROL
The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said supply-chain costs were higher than it expected at the start of the quarter, with COVID-19 specific paid-leave costs increasing due to the Omicron variant.
Still, it was able to eke out higher margins in the United States, due to increased sales from apparel and its Walmart Connect advertising business and as more people filled prescriptions at its drug stores.
Walmart sells digital ad space to consumer product companies and other advertisers through Walmart Connect, a service launched in January 2021. On Thursday, Walmart said the business generated $2.1 billion in sales.
By contrast, rival Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) generated $31 billion in ad revenue last year, while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube generated $28 billion.
Sundaram said Walmart's alternative online businesses including Walmart Connect, market place and financial services helped keep gross margins strong because they ""are very asset light and margin accretive to Walmart's overall business.""
Walmart shares rose 2.3% in morning trading. 

U.S. e-commerce sales grew just 1% in the quarter, but were up 70% since the pandemic began. 
""Walmart is really about stores and having the ability to be in ecommerce, whereas Amazon is about e-commerce with the ability to have stores, so it's not a huge negative,"" said Randy Hare, director of equity research at Huntington National Bank, which owns more than $40 million in Walmart shares.

(Reuters) -Ubisoft, the maker of the blockbuster ""Assassin's Creed"" video game franchise, said on Thursday it expected to post full-year results at the lower end of its guidance despite seeing growth in its current fourth quarter. 
""We can still achieve the high side of (the guidance) because we have a lot of content to be released and upside is possible, but it's fair to say for now the forecast is in the lower side of the guidance,"" Chief Financial Officer Frederick Duguet said in a conference call. 
The company cut its targets last October to ""flat to slightly down"" net bookings and non-IFRS operating income of between 420 million euros and 500 million euros.
It is nevertheless expecting a strong fourth quarter - for Ubisoft the period spanning January to March - saying that the period will see ""very strong growth"" boosted by its back-catalog, new releases, partnerships and post-launch content. 
Gaming companies saw a jump in demand in 2020 as people were restricted to their homes during coronavirus-related lockdowns but some, including Ubisoft, are now facing production delays. 
The French group in October pushed back the release of free-to-play title ""Tom Clancy's The Division Heartland"" and further postponed ""Rocksmith+"" and ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"", two titles that had already been delayed.
Ubisoft reported net bookings of 746.1 million euros ($848.09 million) in its October-December third quarter compared to the 725-780 million euros it had guided for and 1 billion euros in the year earlier period.

Net bookings cover sales of products and services sold digitally or sold physically as well as revenue from licence fees and other agreements.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. authorities filed criminal and civil charges against the founder and former chief investment officer of investment adviser Infinity Q Capital Management LLC, alleging he engaged in a fraudulent scheme to inflate the value of assets the firm advised.
Infinity Q was forced last year to liquidate its mutual funds after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found that James Velissaris made potentially unreasonable adjustments to a pricing model used to value fund investments. 
The Southern District of New York (SDNY) on Thursday also filed charges against Velissaris for inflating the value of the funds by $1 billion. As a result, he received management and performance fees -- totaling at least approximately $26.9 million since 2019 -- to which he was not entitled.
According to the SEC, Velissaris inflated the valuations by manipulating computer code in the third-party pricing service valuation models the company used to value the funds; he entered inputs he knew were incorrect into the pricing service; selected certain valuation models that he knew could not properly value the relevant positions; and knowingly cherry-picked one of the key valuation inputs.
""Velissaris' pricing manipulations materially inflated the mutual fund's net asset values and the private fund’s total assets, as well as reported performance,"" the SEC said in its charge.
""The manipulations were so pervasive that Velissaris could not keep up with his deceptions,"" it added.
He also falsified investor compliance manuals before providing them to investigators, the SDNY said in its charges, adding that Infinity Q and Velissaris disseminated materially false and misleading information to investors.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also filed a complaint in SDNY on Thursday similarly alleging Velissaris manipulated the pricing model to overvalue derivatives held by pooled funds.
Reuters could not immediately reach Velissaris for comment.
Mark Schonfeld, a lawyer for Velissaris, told Reuters that his client managed investments at Infinity Q with the ""highest integrity.""
""We look forward to vindicating James, who has been scapegoated by others who will have to answer in court for their own compliance failures and the losses incurred by their irresponsible liquidation of the portfolio,"" Schonfeld said.
Thursday's charges come amid a push by regulators to boost hedge fund and private equity fund disclosures in a bid to guard against fraud, increase oversight of the private funds industry and better monitor systemic risks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday ordered a new review of a decision not to block United Airlines from enforcing a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for workers.
The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 to return the issue to a U.S. district judge who had rejected a request for an injunction blocking the mandate while employees argue their case against it. Chicago-based United was the first major air carrier to issue a vaccine requirement.
Judges Jennifer Walker Elrod and Andrew S. Oldham ruled United's policy forces employees to choose ""between pay and adhering to religious convictions.
The majority reversed the district court conclusion suing employees ""have not demonstrated irreparable injury absent an injunction"" and sent it back for ""consideration of the remaining preliminary injunction factors.""
United said Thursday ""there’s no doubt our vaccine requirement has saved lives and kept our employees out of the hospital.... We will continue to vigorously defend our policy."" 
In a scathing dissent, Judge Jerry E. Smith said the majority wanted to ""play CEO of a multinational corporation"" and ""shatters every dish in the china shop,"" adding ""for every conceivable reason that the (employees) could lose this appeal, they should.""
He added: ""Nothing, especially not the law, will thwart this majority’s plans.""
In December, United Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) defended the employee mandate: ""We did this for safety. We believe it saved lives.""

Kirby said about 200 of United's 67,000 employees did not comply and were fired. He added about six pilots were fired out of about 13,000.
""Sickness is bad for business—and for unvaccinated pilots, who are more likely to die from the coronavirus than are their vaccinated colleagues,"" Smith wrote.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The head of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) who is leaving halfway through his five-year term said on Thursday that he was not pressured by the White House to resign.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson, a pilot and former Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) executive who was tapped for the job by President Donald Trump in 2019, told a small group of reporters he had decided to leave effective March 31 because of family reasons.
Asked if Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg or the White House had pressured him to step down, Dickson said no, ""in fact, they asked me to stay.""
Dickson, 64, held up a photo of his family on his cell phone when asked why he is departing. ""It's been a tough couple years for my family. I just need to go home,"" he said.
""I am very proud of what we've done at the agency the last couple years to reinvigorate the safety culture.""
Dickson faced criticism from people inside the Biden administration over a 5G aviation standoff. Airline CEOs on Jan. 17 warned of a ""catastrophic"" aviation crisis that could have grounded almost all traffic because of the 5G deployment.
Hours before the planned Jan. 19 deployment, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) agreed to delay deploying about 510 5G wireless towers near airports. That did not prevent dozens of foreign airlines from canceling U.S.-bound flights over concerns 5G signals could interfere with planes, and cast the U.S. regulatory system in a bad light.

A White House official told Reuters in an email it was ""not true, unequivocally, that (the White House) or anyone asked him to resign. Over anything.""
Buttigieg praised Dickson's tenure in a statement on Wednesday. ""Steve has been the FAA’s steady and skilled captain, and his tenure has been marked by steadfast commitment to the FAA’s safety mission,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Goldman Sachs on Thursday upgraded its key profitability targets and set new goals for its asset management, transaction banking and consumer businesses as it laid out its strategy for the next three years.
Wall Street's premier investment bank is reshaping itself after a turbulent decade during which profit at its core trading businesses was crimped by tougher regulations enacted after the 2007-09 financial crisis. 
Chief Executive David Solomon pointed to progress made over the past two years and said the bank would build on that despite headwinds such as inflation and an anticipated slowdown in investment banking and trading activity.
""We believe we have the right plan in place that will enable us to serve clients, drive returns and unlock significant value for our shareholders,"" Solomon said in a presentation at the  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Financial Services Forum in Florida.
The bank said it expects a 15-17% return on tangible equity (RoTE) over the next three years, up from its previous mid-term guidance of 14%. It expects a return on equity of 14-16%, compared with 13% previously.
That target is behind goals set by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), which is targeting an RoTE of at least 20% over the longer term, and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), which has set a medium-term RoTE goal of 17%.
Despite Goldman's record profit in 2021, Solomon is still trying to win over some analysts and investors skeptical about whether it can sustain its strong performance when market conditions normalize.
The traditional investment banking and trading businesses benefited from a deal-making boom and rising asset prices when the Federal Reserve pumped trillions of dollars into financial markets. 
Solomon acknowledged the market backdrop is changing but said Goldman is nimble enough to adapt.
""It's good to see that they are admitting that 2021 was a windfall year that is almost impossible to repeat,"" said Viola Risk Advisors founder David Hendler. ""Steady progress in the newer areas like asset management, consumer and wealth should make their activities more predictable.""
JMP Securities analyst Devin Ryan said Solomon had made a strong case for why his strategy is the right one.
""We are encouraged to see the firm pushing forward on its strategic goals,"" he said.
Goldman shares were down 2.4% in afternoon trading, in line with the U.S. banking sector, which was hit by escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine.
The shares currently trade at 1.3 times the value of Goldman's assets while rivals Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan trade at close to double book value. 
Goldman reiterated its efficiency ratio goal of 60%, which effectively means it is running the business at a 40% operating margin.
The bank also set new deposit and revenue goals for transaction and consumer banking.
It expects transaction banking deposits of more than $100 billion by 2024 compared with $54 billion last year. Transaction banking revenues are expected to rise to $750 million by 2024 from $226 last year, the bank said. 

Consumer banking deposits are expected to grow to more than $150 billion by 2024 compared with $110 billion last year. Consumer banking revenues are expected to rise to more than $4 billion by 2024 from $1.5 billion last year.
In asset management, the bank is targeting fees of more than $10 billion by 2024, including more than $2 billion derived from alternative assets such as private equity and real estate.

1465,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 01:26PM ET</span>",Canada's clampdown on protest funding may be a challenge for financial sector,"By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) -Canada roped in banks to help cut funding to protesters against COVID-19 mandates this week, but the requested speed and broad scope of the measures leaves financial institutions to their own devices in enforcing most of them, industry-watchers said. 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday invoked the rarely used Emergencies Act, imposing sweeping measures that require banks to freeze accounts linked to the protest without court orders, ask insurers to suspend coverage on vehicles used in blockades, and bring crowdfunding platforms under terror financing oversight.
Regulations released late on Tuesday widened that net, ordering banks, credit societies, investment firms, crowdfunding and donation platforms to stop providing financial services to people suspected of furthering the protests.
The Canadian Bankers Association said all financial institutions ""will need to diligently implement the required measures"", adding it would not affect the majority of customers.
Protestors against Canada's pandemic restrictions have gridlocked the nation's capital and blocked U.S. border crossings, prompting Trudeau to turn to the emergency powers to take control of the situation.
Canadian law enforcement has been sharing information with financial institutions, who have already taken action based on it, Deputy Prime Minster and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters on Thursday. 
""The emergency measures we put in place are being used,"" she said. ""They are having an impact and they will have a growing impact in the days to come."" 
But some industry-watchers expressed concerns with, and confusion about, the measures.
""It is framed in a very vague way ... it's a broad transfer of responsibility from the government to the private sector,"" said Marius Zoican, assistant professor of finance at the University of Toronto. ""This would not be easy on the banks. They're caught in between the order and public opinion."" 
The rules are framed similarly to existing regulations dealing with sanctioned individuals or entities, said Jacqueline Shinfield, co-lead of the Financial Services Regulatory group at law firm Blake, Cassels & Graydon.
But the challenge lies in the speed with which it comes into effect - essentially immediately - Shinfield said. The lack of clarity around which clients would be subject to the measures and who makes this determination is also a potential hurdle, she said. 
MULTILAYERED INCREASE
To comply, banks must ensure payment processors are abiding by the regulations; payment processors in turn will want to ensure crowdfunding platforms do the same, creating a ""multilayered increase of regulation"" that companies will need to meet in a short period of time, said Vanessa Iafolla, financial crime consultant with Antifraud Intelligence Consulting.
Trudeau said the emergency measures, which need to be approved by Parliament within seven days and cannot exceed 30 days, will be time-limited. 
""This is going to be ... probably more symbolic than something with a lot of teeth to it,"" said Brian Madden, chief investment officer at First Avenue Investment Counsel. 
""This creates a short-term urgent project. But it's not of such a magnitude and duration that (financial institutions) start hiring 500 people to do anti-truck blockade compliance regulation."" 
Even so, banks will have to update their systems to flag and manually scour transactions, particularly those related to cryptocurrencies and crowdfunding platforms, that would not have been deemed suspicious earlier, Zoican said, which could lead to some short-term costs. 
The lack of defined parameters, such as on dollar-amount thresholds for suspicious transactions, mean banks' actions are unlikely to be as exhaustive as the government would like, both Madden and Zoican said. 

""If you donate C$10,000 or C$20,000, then you're really involved; if you're just putting C$25 in a GoFundMe account, you can't really be treated as a terrorist financier,"" Zoican said.
""This is taking a hammer to swat at a fly.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday the agency needs a ""systemic fix"" from Boeing (NYSE:BA) to address 787 Dreamliner production issues but said a new agency directive would not be a ""choke point"" for deliveries.
The FAA on Tuesday said it would not allow Boeing to self-certify individual new Boeing 787 planes.
Outgoing FAA Administrator Steve Dickson told a small group of reporters on the sidelines of an event Thursday that the agency needs from Boeing ""a systemic fix to their production processes. They've got to produce the quality on their production line that we're looking for and that they've committed to.""
The FAA said Tuesday it will retain the authority to issue airworthiness certificates until it is confident ""Boeing’s quality control and manufacturing processes consistently produce 787s that meet FAA design standards.""
Boeing did not immediately comment.
Dickson said retaining certification authority ""will increase the confidence we have in the stability of their processes, because we will actually be there looking at the results of each airplane as it comes off the line.
""I think they are putting processes in place and we're working with them to make sure that these kind of random quality issues don't come up,"" he said. The FAA approval of individual airplanes ""is not going to be a choke point but it's going to give an additional check and balance.""
Boeing suspended deliveries of the 787 in late May after the FAA raised concerns about its proposed inspection method. The regulatory agency had issued two airworthiness directives to address production issues for in-service airplanes and identified a new issue in July.
Deliveries have remained halted as U.S. regulators reviewed repairs and inspections. Deliveries are expected to remain frozen months longer. Dickson declined to forecast when Boeing might be able to resume deliveries.
The FAA said earlier it wants Boeing to ensure it ""has a robust plan for the re-work that it must perform on a large volume of new 787s in storage"" and that ""Boeing’s delivery processes are stable.""
The 787 program remains at a low production rate, with an expected gradual return to five per month over time, Boeing said.

The company disclosed a $3.5 billion charge due to delivery delays and customer concessions, and another $1 billion in abnormal production costs, related to production flaws and related repairs and inspections on the advanced composite jet.
Dickson said Boeing is improving. ""I have not had any issues with Boeing leadership in the last year -- I definitely think they are headed in the right direction,"" he said.

DETROIT (Reuters) -Nissan Motor Co said on Thursday it will invest $500 million to retool its U.S. assembly plant near Canton, Mississippi, to build two new electric vehicles, and a top executive said the automaker is looking for a U.S. site to build a battery factory.
Nissan (OTC:NSANY) said it plans to assemble electric vehicles for its Nissan and Infiniti brands in Mississippi starting in 2025. The automaker said it aims to have electric vehicles make up 40% of its U.S. sales by 2030. Nissan has outlined plans to invest $18 billion to expand its global electric vehicle fleet through 2030.
""We are investigating the right location and the right timing"" to build the U.S. battery factory, Nissan Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta said in an interview. ""It should be soon.""
Nissan operates two assembly lines in Canton, one building light trucks including the Nissan Frontier and the other assembling Altima mid-sized sedans. 
Gupta said the Altima assembly line will be redesigned to build both electric and combustion vehicles. Additional space in the Canton factory will be repurposed for battery pack assembly and other operations as Nissan aims for more vertical integration.
The 19-year-old Canton complex employs 5,000 people. Nissan said it will retrain 2,000 workers as part of the new investment.
The proposed models will have new lightweight architectures designed for battery-electric powertrains, and autonomous driving technology, Gupta said.
""A significant amount of time and money (will be) spent on upskilling the workforce,"" he said.
The automaker said the investment in Mississippi is ""one of several"" planned over the next five years to expand electric vehicle production in the United States.
Nissan's Mexican operations should also receive new investment related to electric vehicles, Gupta said. ""Obviously, Mexico will be a part of it.""
Nissan is investing as it sees markets becoming ready for electric vehicles, he said. ""We are not going for a big bang.""
Nissan has outlined plans to deliver 23 new electrified vehicles globally by 2030, including 15 battery electric models. 

Nissan builds its compact Leaf electric vehicle at its complex in Smyrna, Tennessee, which gets electric motors from a Nissan factory in Decherd, Tennessee. 
The Leaf, launched in 2010, put Nissan in the forefront of established auto manufacturers in the emerging electric vehicle market. But the Leaf, with 226 miles (364 km) of range, has been eclipsed in sales by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Model 3 sedan which has 358 miles of driving range per charge, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The agency, which voted unanimously to oppose the deal, said it and the Rhode Island attorney general's office were concerned the merger would create a ""healthcare conglomerate with outsized power.""
""This proposed merger is a bad deal for patients who are likely to see higher hospital bills, lower quality of care, and fewer cutting-edge medical services,"" said FTC Bureau of Competition Director Holly Vedova in a statement.
The FTC said its complaint would allege that the deal would give the combined company at least 70 percent of the Rhode Island market for treatments that require a hospital stay and an equally high share of the market for in-patient behavioral health services. 
Care New England President James Fanale said in a statement that the companies were disappointed. ""I will say that we can truly know that we did everything we could over the past few years of hard work to get this done.

(Reuters) - Global farm chemicals and seeds maker Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) will launch a corn variety in the United States next year that it says will better tolerate heavy winds associated with climate change, estimating future sales in North America as high as 1 billion euros.
The corn, which grows one-third shorter than current varieties, will be planted by 150 U.S. farmers in a commercial trial in 2023, then released to the broader market the following year, the company said at a media presentation on Thursday.
Short-stature corn is the latest crop variety bred to withstand increasingly volatile weather associated with climate change, joining a growing list that includes drought and heat tolerant corn and soybeans.
Bayer said initial plantings of its short corn will be from traditionally bred seeds. Biotech traits and gene edited varieties will be rolled out in 2027 or later in North America and other geographies including Latin America, Asia and possibly Europe, with global sales expected to peak in the 2030s.
""We see a fit of short-stature corn across every corn acre around the globe,"" said Bob Reiter, head of research and development for Bayer's crop science division.
Bayer says the crop will also be easier to farm because the shorter plants will allow for simpler mid-season applications of fertilizer, pesticides and other farm chemicals. The shorter plants will also make the crop more resilient in windy conditions such as the derecho that leveled millions of corn acres in Iowa in 2020.

PARIS (Reuters) - Carmaker Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY), a sponsor of Novak Djokovic, is glad the tennis star has told his story about his expulsion from Australia and expects its logo to be on his shirt when he competes in Dubai this month, a source close to the Peugeot brand told Reuters.
Djokovic, world number one men's tennis player, was deported from Australia in January after a standoff over the country's COVID-19 regulations and his unvaccinated status.
Djokovic's attempt to compete in the Australian Open without getting vaccinated provoked anger in some quarters - though his supporters rallied to his side - and focused attention on how his sponsors would respond.
""We anticipate the Peugeot brand will be represented at the tournament in Dubai on Mr. Djokovic's shirt,"" the source close to Peugeot told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
The player spoke for the first time about the Australia affair this week, telling the BBC he was not an anti-vaxxer, but has taken a personal decision not to get the jab, and that he understood that could affect his tennis career.
""Peugeot has taken note of Mr. Djokovic's statements and is glad that he has expressed himself,"" the source said.
Asked about the long-term future of the sponsorship, the source said discussions on relations between the brand and the player were continuing in good faith.
Djokovic is scheduled to compete at the Dubai tournament which starts on Feb. 21, in what will be his first competition on the ATP world tour after the deportation from Australia.

Another Djokovic sponsor, watchmaker Hublot, which is owned by French luxury conglomerate LVMH, declined to comment on its relationship with Djokovic. 
A third sponsor, clothing brand Lacoste, did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent on Thursday.

1474,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 12:32PM ET</span>",Hard bargains as European retailers take on food giants,"By Richa Naidu
LONDON (Reuters) - European retailers are locked in extended price negotiations with giant food companies - including the world's biggest, Nestle - as they fight to retain shoppers and protect their profits.
Major consumer products companies across the world have announced plans to boost prices at a faster pace than last year as they too seek to curb the impact of soaring raw materials costs on their margins.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde early this month flagged rising food prices as a significant contributor to January's unexpectedly high overall inflation in Europe, which she said caught the ECB off-guard.
Ahold Delhaize - the owner of more than 20 retail brands including Albert Heijn in the Netherlands and Stop & Shop in the United States - told Reuters on Wednesday it had kept underlying operating margins stable at 4.4%, in part, by negotiating prices.
The company's Albert Heijn chain - the largest Dutch supermarket - earlier this year removed Nestle products, including Maggi, KitKat and Nescafe from its stores because Nestle increased prices.
""We did have some tough negotiations with Nestle...it was a place where we said we just don't take prices if they're not acceptable proposals,"" Ahold finance chief Natalie Knight said in an interview, adding the supermarket had reached a ""good conclusion"" with Nestle.
""I think we've been very successful, so far, in making sure only the most necessary costs are passed onto customers,"" Knight said.
Knight, and also industry experts, said negotiations were taking longer than usual because of the complexity of factors.
Consumer goods companies typically agree annual pricing contracts with retailers towards the end of each year in many parts of Europe. Four industry experts told Reuters that, in many cases, negotiations have stretched into 2022, or have been re-opened after having in theory been concluded.
A spokesperson for Nestle said the pressures included more expensive raw materials, packaging, energy, logistics, and labour. The impact has eroded Nestle's margins. On Thursday it reported a 30 basis point decline in its full-year underlying trading operating profit margin to 17.4%.
Nestle said it raised overall prices by 3.1% in the fourth quarter, and by 2.5% in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. The company increased quarterly prices by 5.2% in the Americas.
When asked if Nestle had found it difficult to raise prices quickly, CEO Mark Schneider said the way contracts were structured meant there were ""certain dates where you can reset prices"".
Belgian low-cost supermarket chain Colruyt told Reuters it was among those still in talks with some food makers.
""Pressure in the sector is high, but we are not giving up on our lowest price guarantee. If that means that our profit margins may come under pressure for one, two or more quarters, then so be it,"" a Colruyt spokesperson told Reuters. 
Unilever (NYSE:UL), Nestle input cost inflation surges - https://graphics.reuters.com/EUROPE-FOOD/INFLATION/myvmnjbympr/ 
As negotiations dragged on, the chain late last year removed 400-gram jars of Italy's Ferrero Spa's Nutella hazelnut spread from some of its stores, choosing to stock only large jars that were better value for families with kids, the supermarket's main customers. 
Ferrero said is did not want to speculate about future price developments.
RECORD-HIGH INFLATION
For shoppers across the euro zone, the issue is how quickly and by how much prices for everyday staples will rise.
Overall euro zone inflation hit a record of 5.1% in January, well above the ECB's projections. Food, alcohol and tobacco inflation rose to 3.6% from 3%.
The battle between packaged food makers and retailers will only do so much to counter that. The processed food component of food inflation makes up very little of the overall consumer price index that is largely driven by rising energy prices across sectors.
In the autumn, several packaged food companies hiked European prices for some products by 5%-7%, financial advisory firm Rabobank estimated. 
Cyrille Filott, head of Rabobank's consumer foods team, said some food makers had later demanded a further 3%-5% increase as commodity prices continued to rise.
""There's a big fight right now in continental Europe between retailers and food companies,"" Filott said.
Unilever finance chief Graeme Pitkethly said the company, whose brands include Knorr seasonings and Magnum ice cream, has had to limit the number of promotions in Europe as an ""extremely difficult"" pricing environment in parts of the region has kept it from raising prices to the degree it has elsewhere in the world.
German members-only wholesale retailer Metro cited a roughly 5% increase in food inflation, some of which will be passed on.
Its CFO Christian Baier told the media last week his company is ""able to hand over relevant parts of the price increases to our customers"".
France, meanwhile, was named as ""a key area of pricing challenge"" by Unilever on its results day last week.
French supermarket major  Carrefour  SA (OTC:CRRFY) said it was seeing price inflation in the low to mid-single digits, similar to the 3%-5% that its rivals have noted.
""We have many advantages in negotiations with suppliers due to our market share and due to the dynamics of our revenues,"" Chief Executive Alexandre Bompard said on a post-earnings call on Thursday.

The company's finance chief had said in October that Carrefour (PA:CARR) was ""planning to be very aggressive"" as it entered price negotiations, and that suppliers demands would be rejected.

Investing.com – Fastly stock (NYSE:FSLY) plunged 32% to a 52-week low of $19.66 Thursday after the internet content delivery company’s losses widened and the 2022 guidance didn’t hold out much hope.
The stock is now down to less than a fourth of its high of $87.61, struck a year ago.
An adjusted loss per share for 2022 is forecast to be 55 cents at the center of the guidance range, wider than previous guidance for a loss of 48 cents.
Quarterly revenue rose more than 18% from a year ago to about $98 million, but margins eroded and losses widened. Adjusted gross margin was down by 7.9 percentage points to 55.8%. On a per share basis, adjusted net loss came in at 48 cents compared to 18 cents in the same period a year ago.
At least four brokerages slashed their price targets for the stock. This included Piper Sandler, RBC, BofA and Morgan Stanley.
Fastly runs a content-delivery network to push data quickly around the internet. It hosts a service that large enterprises use to serve content to millions of users simultaneously.
Rather than hosting all website content on a single set of servers in one location, Fastly puts cloud infrastructure in dozens of locations to let people download from a server closest to them. It supports major websites like The New York Times, Reddit, that of U.K. government, The Verge and Bloomberg.
The company had a tough year as the impact of June outages at several of the global websites it supports lingered. At one point, the company had guided for annual revenue of $385 million at center of its guidance range, which it later revised to $345 million. It closed the year at just over $354 million.    
Full-year revenue is now seen at $405 million at center of its guidance range, over 14% higher year-on-year. This compares with 22% growth in 2021.

Europe's biggest utility said on Thursday that Comal would build the factory to make tracker devices - which allow solar panels to follow the sun throughout the day - at the Montalto di Castro power plant in southern Italy.
The move is part of  Enel  (MI:ENEI)'s plans to redevelop disused power plants and create new renewable energy and storage facilities alongside other business projects.
Enel, which has pledged to phase out its coal-fired plants by 2027, is looking to cut its global emissions by 80% from 2017 levels by 2030 and aims to have a wholly green power portfolio by 2040.
Comal's tracker factory will be built in a 30,000 square metre (322,917 sq. ft) area at the site, which is gradually being wound down.
The aim is to produce tracker devices able to support solar production of up to 1 gigawatt a year and help create an Italian renewable energy supply chain. 

Enel, which had 12.4 gigawatts of conventional capacity in Italy as of the end of last September, has applied for permits to build a 10 megawatt solar plant at the site which used to have a gross capacity of around 3.6 GW.
Oil-fired capacity at Montalto di Castro has already been mothballed but gas-fired turbines still generate power when needed by the grid.

PARIS (Reuters) - Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) said on Thursday it was on the hunt for possible acquisitions and might expand in more U.S. cities, after a sales surge showed resilience in demand for luxury goods even as inflation soars.
The luxury industry has fast recovered from the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, with sales for most groups now exceeding their pre-crisis levels, and thanks to strong demand has room to further increase prices in the face of rising costs.
Sales at Kering - whose brands also include Yves Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga - jumped by nearly a third in the last three months of 2021 to 5.41 billion euros ($6.14 billion), powered by a surge of the same magnitude at Gucci that was almost double a 17% average analyst forecast.
The strong comeback by Gucci after a disappointing third quarter is a big relief for Kering - the label accounts for 60% of its revenue and around 70% of its profit. The group also said recurring operating income rose 60% last year, to a record high of just over 5 billion euros, helping send its shares 7% higher by 1400 GMT.
After cutting advertising as the pandemic struck in 2020, Kering increased marketing spending to boost its star brand in 2021 and this paid off particularly in the final part of the year, with the arrival of the new Aria collection in stores.
A broader offer and a sharper focus on high-end fashion and accessories - executives said the average sale price for Gucci had increased substantially - were behind the revenue surge, with U.S. and Chinese growth driving sales.
The release in November of Ridley Scott's film ""House of Gucci"", although not directly linked to the brand, also helped increase the visibility of its designs.
Kering Chairman and CEO Francois-Henri Pinault said Gucci, which enjoyed stellar growth in 2015-2019 but has since been under market scrutiny as its momentum slowed down, had started 2022 in line with the solid trend seen at the end of 2021.
The group's other brands also did well. Yves Saint Laurent, its second-largest label, saw fourth quarter revenue rocket 47%. 
Pinault gave his strongest indication yet that Kering, which had a free cash flow of nearly 4 billion euros in 2021 and almost zero debt, may soon embark on a takeover. 
""For sure, acquisitions could make sense in the near future for the group,"" he said. 
He added that he didn't see Kering expanding into hospitality, but that jewellery was an area with high potential, possibly through acquisitions.
Fuelled by its reliance on Gucci, speculation has swirled that Kering might contemplate major purchases to diversify its portfolio - especially as larger rival LVMH last year expanded with its $15.8 billion purchase of U.S. jeweller Tiffany.
With the U.S. luxury market booming, Pinault said Kering was considering expanding its store network in second- and third-tier cities such as Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville and Austin.
""We are revisiting our geographic coverage of stores to cover these zones that are new for us,"" he said, adding that new stores include a Gucci store in Austin, Texas.
Kering's finance chief Jean-Marc Duplaix said Gucci - which increased prices twice in 2020 and in 2021 - would again raise prices in a ""targeted manner"" this year, and flagged price increases for the group's other labels too. 

The group's shares have gained 28% in the past year and Duplaix said that despite higher raw material and transport costs, the group was confident it could keep improving its profitability. Rival Louis Vuitton lifted prices this week to protect margins.

1481,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 11:36AM ET</span>",Purdue Pharma mediator to recommend ways to end bankruptcy,"By Tom Hals and Dietrich Knauth
(Reuters) -A mediator will soon outline recommendations for ending Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy which is expected to provide billions of dollars to address the opioid crisis that the OxyContin maker has been accused of fueling, a company lawyer said on Thursday.
The Sackler family owners of Purdue and attorneys general from eight states and the District of Columbia have been negotiating in court-ordered mediation since early January.
The mediator will file a report with the court late on Thursday or early Friday, Purdue attorney Marshall Huebner told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain during Thursday's hearing in White Plains, New York.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman, the mediator, said in court filings in recent weeks that the parties were close to an agreement and that the Sacklers would make a ""substantial"" additional contribution. She has twice asked Drain to extend the deadline for the mediation, which in the latest court order expired on Wednesday.
Drain granted a Purdue request to extend a legal shield through March 3 that prevents opioid lawsuits from going forward against members of the Sackler family.
The legal shield, which Purdue has said is needed while the parties try to work out a settlement, has been in place since 2019.
The nine attorneys general led the opposition to a previous $4.33 billion settlement that was rejected in December on appeal by a U.S. District judge in Manhattan. The attorneys general had argued that the Sacklers should contribute more in return for the legal releases they obtained through the bankruptcy plan.

Purdue filed for bankruptcy in 2019 in the face of thousands of lawsuits accusing it and Sackler family members of helping cause the U.S. opioid epidemic through deceptive marketing that played down addiction and overdose risks.
The company pleaded guilty to misbranding and fraud charges related to its marketing of OxyContin in 2007 and 2020. The Sacklers have denied wrongdoing.

(Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and Geely Automobile’s Volvo Cars will join battery recycling startup Redwood (NYSE:RWT) Materials in developing processes, starting in California, to collect end-of-life batteries from electric and hybrid vehicles and recover the materials for use in new batteries, the companies said Thursday.
Redwood Materials, co-founded by former Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) executive JB Straubel, formed an earlier partnership last fall with Ford to develop a “closed loop” or circular supply chain for electric vehicle (EV) batteries, from raw materials to recycling.
On Thursday, Redwood Materials said it would work directly with dealers and dismantlers in California to identify and recover end-of-life battery packs. The materials in those packs will be recovered and recycled at Redwood Materials facilities in northern Nevada.
U.S. automakers Ford and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) have said the battery recycling effort is crucial in efforts to develop a domestic supply chain to meet increasing EV demand.

GM and battery partner LG Energy Solution last year announced a partnership with startup Li-Cycle to recycle battery scrap material from Ultium Cells, the GM-LG joint venture that is building battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Michigan.
Redwood Materials has similar partnerships with battery makers Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) in Nevada and Envision AESC in Tennessee, as well as with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Ford and Amazon are among the investors in Redwood Materials.

PARIS (Reuters) -Airbus marked a turning point in its pandemic recovery with its first dividend in two years and higher profits from businesses including defence and space as the European group also confirmed a review of defence strategy on Thursday.
The world's largest civil planemaker predicted higher profit and deliveries for 2022 but cautioned that supply chain tensions and a spike in inflation remained challenges for now.
""The pandemic is not yet fully behind us,"" Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said while reiterating that the jet market would recover between 2023 and 2025.
""It has been clear that people want to fly again and do so as soon as restrictions are relaxed.""
The company, which also makes fighter jets and troop planes, also confirmed it was carrying out a review of its defence strategy after Reuters reported on Wednesday that its board was leading an exercise likely to open the door to more strategic partnerships.
Faury said that Airbus remains ""committed to a strong position in defence"" but declined to elaborate on the review, which he described as a regular exercise.
Airbus ended a two-year dividend drought after swinging to a record net profit of 4.213 billion euros ($4.8 billion) in 2021, boosted by the end of production of its A380 superjumbo and a partial reversal of earlier COVID-19 charges.
The company proposed a dividend of 1.50 euros per share.
Shares in Europe's largest aerospace company dipped 0.5% against a fractionally stronger market.
Analysts said the results beat profit expectations, though some were disappointed that the company was predicting stable cashflow in 2022 after a sharp turnaround to 3.5 billion euros generated last year from a negative 6.8 billion euros the previous year.
Jefferies analysts said ""conservatism is typical"" for the first forecast of the year, but they noted that the stable forecast stood in contrast to higher deliveries and earnings.
Airbus predicted 720 deliveries in 2022, up from 611 last year, and adjusted operating profit of 5.5 billion euros. The closely watched profit figure soared to 4.865 billion euros in 2021 from 1.706 billion a year earlier as revenue rose by 4%.
A380 BOOST
The company's net cash rose more than 75% to 7.6 billion euros, on its way back to a pre-crisis level of 12.5 billion euros.
Airbus earnings were boosted by 274 million euros clawed back from money previously set aside for the closure of Europe's largest building, the A380 production plant in Toulouse, which will now be used to assemble in-demand narrowbody planes.
The company reaffirmed plans to lift narrowbody production to 65 planes a month by the summer of next year, from about 45 now, but some analysts said it signalled a slightly softer tone on its ambitions to raise that to as high as 75 a month by 2025.
Faury said that Airbus expects a decision by mid-year, adding that the supply chain would be the main factor rather than demand, on which Airbus is more confident.
Airbus has been at odds with sceptical engine makers and some leasing companies over the plans, and some senior industry sources say that the Omicron coronavirus variant means all parties may in practice be willing to let a decision drift by a few months.

The reversed A380 charge almost halves a bill of 463 million euros announced when Airbus halted production of the world's largest jetliner because of a shift in demand towards smaller jets. The last A380 was delivered in December to Dubai's Emirates.
On the negative side, Airbus took another charge of 212 million euros on the A400M military airlifter, adding to billions written off on Europe's largest defence project.

1486,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 11:17AM ET</span>",Two U.S. Big Tech antitrust bills backed by publisher trade group,"By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A group representing publishers such as News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) and National Public Radio wrote to leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday to back two bills targeting Big Tech, including one that would open up smartphone app stores to more competition.
Digital Content Next, whose members also include the New York Times and Associated Press, wrote to Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, a Democrat, and Senator Chuck Grassley, the top Republican, to back a bill aimed at reining in app stores owned by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google.
The group also backed a measure that would bar giants like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) from giving preference to their own businesses when customers search their platforms.
The two bills were voted out of the committee in recent weeks. They have also been approved by the House Judiciary Committee. 
""Platforms should be able to moderate their services to protect consumers, police IP theft and prevent security lapses. However, some dominant platforms have leveraged their privileged status as gatekeeper to unfairly compete in other markets,"" Digital Content Next executives Jason Kint and Chris Pedigo wrote in the letter.
They also expressed concern about any potential move to put the publishers themselves in with companies covered by the bills - currently a small number of giant firms.
Publishers, whose news budgets have been squeezed as advertising dried up, have been battling search and advertising giant Google over what they see as the company's unfair siphoning off of badly needed ad revenues.
Smartphone maker Apple, a target of the app store bill, has urged that it not be adopted because it supports practices such as ""sideloading,"" essentially using a non-Apple app store, which would mean that consumers lose privacy protections that Apple offers, among other concerns.

Google, for its part, lowered its Play Store fees for subscription apps last October, following criticism about 30% fees.
U.S. lawmakers in both parties, some concerned about outsized market power and others about allegations that conservative voices have been stifled, have scrutinized the biggest technology companies, including Meta Platforms Inc's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). A long list of bills is aimed at reining them in, but none have become law.

1487,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 11:11AM ET</span>",Airbus hopes for amicable solution in deadlocked Qatar dispute,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) -Airbus hopes to reach an amicable solution in a row with Qatar Airways over damage to the surface of A350 passenger jets, Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said on Thursday.
The companies have been locked in a months-long dispute over paint erosion and deterioration to anti-lightning protection on the long-haul jets, which Airbus has acknowledged need attention while insisting the problems do not put safety at risk.
Qatar Airways has sued Airbus for more than $600 million andis refusing to take delivery of further A350s until itsregulator receives formal analysis of the problem. 
Airbus has said Qatar Airways has mischaracterized the problem as a safety issue and misinterpreted the contract. Airbus moved recently to revoke contracts for two of the jets and a separate order for 50 smaller A321s.
""We had to make the decision to exercise our rights,"" Faury told a results briefing. ""This decision followed many attempts to find mutually beneficial solutions and we continue to hope for an amicable solution.""
Qatar Airways declined to comment. Both sides have pledged to defend their positions in what is seen as an exceptionally rare public dispute in the secretive planemaking industry.
While Faury's remarks left the door open to a negotiated agreement, people familiar with the matter said there were few if any signs of progress in the dispute.
Qatar Airways is expected to seek a ruling that would prevent Airbus from cancelling the A321 deal, while Airbus is preparing to give its own defence.
The dispute over the scaly or damaged appearance of some Qatar Airways A350s, and the extent to which gaps in lightning protection material pose a safety risk, has gripped the industry for months and could affect long-term business ties.
Qatar has placed orders for Boeing (NYSE:BA) jets.
Asked whether Airbus was prepared to lose Qatar Airways as a customer for good, Faury said, ""I don't like the situation, but we take it seriously and we want to defend our product at a time where we think what is said is not appropriate.""
AIRLINE DISCUSSIONS
A Reuters investigation in November revealed that paint and anti-lightning problems, originally presented as an isolated issue related to Qatar's heat, had spread to at least five other carriers and that Airbus planned a design change.
Airbus has increasingly shifted its description of the problem away from paint to broader ""surface degradation"" and has acknowledged other airlines are affected, while maintaining that any damage is non-structural and does not make any jets unsafe.
""We are in discussions with all airlines when it comes to so-called surface degradation and are being super-transparent in explaining the situation to all of them. I am happy to say no other airline sees it as an airworthiness issue,"" Faury said.
Industry executives say Airbus' decision to revoke the separate contract for the in-demand A321 took many in the industry by surprise, prompting the International Air Transport Association to warn planemakers not to exploit market strength.
Airbus can resell the in-demand A321s or decide not to produce them to relieve pressure on its supply chain, while finding homes for the remaining A350s on order by Qatar would be difficult since long-haul demand remains low, analysts say.
Faury rejected any suggestion that Airbus was being swayed by commercial interests in its handling of the dispute. 
""It is not self-serving; it comes from the contractual situation with Qatar Airways. We are now in a legal dispute and we have to take steps which are really linked to that very specific situation,"" he said. 

Airbus has also faced reports that it has taken a tough general line on deliveries during the crisis, though its sales chief emphasised at an air show this week that it had worked with airlines to accommodate hundreds of changes to schedules.
""I would like to say as well that for us at Airbus the relationship with our customers is of the utmost importance and we will continue to work hard to service them,"" Faury said.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Ericsson informed the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) about an internal investigation into payments in Iraq when it signed a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) in 2019 to settle separate corruption probes, sources familiar with the matter said. 
The Swedish company's shares fell 14% on Wednesday over concerns that it might be subject to another fine by the DoJ following the disclosure of its Iraq investigation that found evidence of misconduct.
One of Ericsson (BS:ERICAs)'s largest shareholders, Cevian Capital, told Reuters the company's actions were ""unacceptable"" after disclosure that some payments made in Iraq may have reached militant organisations, including Islamic State.
""The information that has now emerged is serious and the company’s actions are, of course, unacceptable,"" Christer Gardell, Cevian's managing partner and co-founder said in a statement to Reuters. 
""As we understand the situation, the DoJ was informed about the internal investigation at the time of the so-called Deferred Prosecution Agreement, and Ericsson losing almost SEK 50 billion in market value yesterday is a strong overreaction,"" he said.
The DoJ did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
An Ericsson spokesman said it does not comment on dialogue with the U.S. authorities under the terms of its DPA. 
Analysts said if Ericsson had not shared its findings with the DoJ, this could have posed serious financial risks for the company.
'OLD MISMANAGEMENT'
Ericsson went through several rounds of restructuring over the past decade and it faced a U.S. investigation into its anti-corruption programme.
""What has emerged with the 'Iraqi situation' is a remnant of this old mismanagement, "" Cevian's Gardell said.
Swedish investment company Investor AB and Industrivarden are two of the largest investors in Ericsson with big voting rights and a say on how the company is operated. 
An Investor AB spokeswoman said Ericsson's Board and management had its full support. Industrivarden did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Ericsson started to turn around under CEO Borje Ekholm, who had served for a decade as CEO of the Wallenberg family-backed investment firm Investor AB. 
""The company today takes these issues very seriously and has invested significant resources in solving the historical problems and ensuring that no new issues arise,"" Gardell said. ""It needs to urgently address the remaining complexity and loss making businesses to help reduce such mismanagement in the future."" 

Ericsson's shares have doubled in the last five years, but Gardell thinks the valuation is still low. Cevian, which started investing in Ericsson in 2017, currently holds around a 4.55% stake based on stock market disclosures.
""With a valuation below 8x 2022's expected operating profit, the company is one of the cheapest large caps in Europe,"" Gardell said.

Total quarterly revenue grew 34% year-over-year to $433 million. Commercial revenue was up 47%, reflecting the company’s focus on bagging more of those contracts, as commercial customers tripled from a year ago. And revenue from government grew by 26% year-over-year.
""You are starting to see that the U.S. commercial business is starting to dominate the business. Two years ago, it was 6% of revenue and now it is 13% of the revenue,"" Sankar told Reuters.
On an adjusted basis, profit per share was 2 cents compared to 3 cents last year, falling short of estimates.

While the promise of a world-changing quantum computer is still years away, the last year has seen several quantum computer companies go public on the stock market, and many new players, hardware and software, have been coming out of the research labs and getting venture capital funding. 
Quantum computers use the phenomena of quantum mechanics and hope to eventually operate millions of times faster than today’s advanced supercomputers.
Classiq has raised a total of $48 million now, only 20 months after it was started. The company declined to share its latest valuation. This round also included personal investments from Lip-Bu Tan and Harvey Jones - well known executives and investors in the chip industry.
Classiq has a software platform that other quantum software developers can use to build specific applications, such as financial asset optimization tools or tools for testing the properties of new molecules for drug discovery.
“In the last couple of years, we see many enterprises in various fields, in finance, in automotive, chemistry, establishing quantum software teams,” Nir Minerbi, co-founder and CEO at Classiq told Reuters. “They want to be able to prepare the software, to create the IP (intellectual property) by themselves.” 
Minerbi said software developed on Classiq’s platform will be able to scale up along with quantum computers’ developments.
Today’s quantum computers are still in the early stage with a limited number of quantum bits, or qubits, which is the computer’s processing power. Late last year  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) said it had a 127 qubit Eagle processor. 

Still, researchers say quantum computers will need thousands of qubits before they can run algorithms that are game-changing.

The fourth-largest U.S. bank has been in regulators' penalty box since 2016 when a sales-practices scandal came to light, and it has paid billions in fines and restitution.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) is also operating under an asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve in 2018, which has crimped its ability to boost interest income by improving loan and deposit growth.
The bank had said previously that it would need the asset cap to be lifted in order to achieve its goal.
""The question will be where rates go and then what impact that has on the economy and the environment we’re in,"" Chief Financial Officer Mike Santomassimo said at a conference hosted by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). 
""We said a year ago we would need that lifted to get there. But rates have changed. We feel really confident that the business we have should be able to get there.""
Santomassimo said the expectation was that short-term rates will continue to increase. 
When interest rates are higher, banks make more money by taking advantage of the difference between the interest banks pay to customers and the interest they can earn by investing.

Santomassimo added that the cap made it harder for the bank to set an efficiency target.
""It's a little bit hard to do that when you're in a world where you're constrained from growth,"" he said.

(Reuters) -Palantir Technologies Inc missed quarterly profit estimates and forecast weaker margins on Thursday, as the data analytics software company boosts spending to rebuild its platform and bolster a growing commercial business. 
Shares of Denver-based Palantir dropped more than 12% and were the most traded across U.S. exchanges, after the company said it expects an adjusted operating margin of 27% in fiscal 2022, lower than 2021's 31%.
However, it forecast current-quarter sales above estimates after a steady flow of government contracts and a strong U.S. commercial portfolio boosted fourth-quarter revenue. Palantir also tripled its commercial customer count to 147 in 2021. 
""I'm not surprised to see margins coming down, it feels like they 'overearned' and now are going to invest more aggressively,"" said RBC analyst Rishi Jaluria.
Known for its work with the U.S. Army, the Central Intelligence Agency and other government bodies, Palantir's next leg of growth is widely expected to come from commercial contracts with large businesses. 
""You are starting to see that the U.S. commercial business is starting to dominate,"" Chief Operating Officer Shyam Sankar told Reuters in an interview.
The company, which is looking to expand into Europe this year, has also been building its sales force to close more deals quickly. 
Palantir, backed by tech billionaire Peter Thiel, forecast first-quarter revenue of $443 million, above a Refinitiv IBES estimate of $439.2 million.
Experts have raised concerns over Palantir's reliance on large deals with a few customers and its dependence on government contracts, which make its revenue flow uncertain.

Addressing the concerns, COO Sankar said the company's net dollar retention rate reveals the ""stickiness"" of its software with customers. Palantir disclosed the metric for the first time, reporting a rate of 131% in fiscal 2021.
Excluding items, the company posted quarterly earnings of 2 cents per share, lower than an estimate of 4 cents.

The company's 34% revenue rise, although slower than the blistering pace recorded a year earlier, indicated that people still preferred getting their meals and other items such as groceries delivered to their doorstep. 
If the stock holds its gains, it would be DoorDash's best day in nine months and a bounce back from a record low close a day earlier. 
""This steady growth shows a heightened consumer interest and demand for delivery in non-restaurant categories, with DoorDash well positioned to take advantage of it,"" Needham analysts said.
Shares of other pandemic winners, including gaming company Roblox and e-commerce firm Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Inc, have comer under pressure this week on disappointing forecasts, triggered by more people returning to their pre-pandemic routines.

A gauge of European stay-at-home stocks by index provider Solactive has reversed nearly all its gains made since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in 2020 and is down around 30% from its peak.

However, food-delivery companies' focus on chasing revenue growth through aggressive expansion is squeezing their margins. 
DoorDash reported a wider-than-expected loss, prompting some analysts to cut their price targets.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's new ""yoke"" steering wheel installed in Model S sedans and Model X sport utility vehicles is so difficult to use that it dropped the most valuable automaker's position in the Consumer Reports annual car brand rankings by seven spots to 23rd place - below average, the independent testing organization said on Thursday.
""It makes driving these vehicles frustrating all the time,"" said Jake Fisher, senior director of automotive testing for Consumer Reports. 
The more conventional Tesla Model 3 is ranked as ""average"" by Consumer Reports.
Overall, Fisher said, “reliability has to do with the frequency of unrolling new technology. The brands at the top tend to very methodically roll out new technology.""
Japan's Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) Corp was No. 1 in the latest Consumer Reports ranking - a brand known for efficient all-wheel drive systems and safety-oriented marketing but not for pushing technology to the edge. 

Other mainstream brands including Honda, Toyota, Hyundai and Ford earned above-average scores on the brand ranking. 
""There isn't much daylight between mainstream brands and luxury brands,"" Fisher said. ""These luxury automakers try to differentiate themselves"" with new designs for controls or complex dashboard displays, Fisher said. ""They make the driving experience more stressful.""

Warren, others urge U.S. Justice Dept to oppose Sanderson chicken deal if antitrust violation found","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Senator Elizabeth Warren, backed by some dozen other U.S. lawmakers, told the Justice Department that a plan to merge chicken producer  Sanderson Farms  (NASDAQ:SAFM) with smaller rival Wayne Farms ""raises significant antitrust concerns.""
Commodities trader Cargill Inc and Continental Grain Co announced in August that they would buy Sanderson Farms, the third largest chicken producer, and combine it with Continental's Wayne in a deal worth some $4.53 billion.
Chicken prices have risen sharply in the previous year, and the Justice Department has been pursuing price-fixing in the sector but the market shares for the combined company isn't as large as is usually seen in merger challenges.
In the letter, sent on Wednesday to Jonathan Kanter, head of the department's Antitrust Division, Warren, Representative Mondaire Jones and others said the poultry industry has a history of colluding to fix prices for consumers.
They said that because of consolidation among chicken producers which do the slaughtering, farmers who actually raise chickens may have just one or two producers in a particular region to do business with. The pay of a typical chicken farmer fell more than 6% between 1988 and 2015, Warren said. 
""This mega merger, in a sector already plagued with consolidation and illegal behaviors that harm farmers and consumers alike, represents a new threat to building a competitive agricultural industry,"" the lawmakers wrote. ""We respectfully urge the DOJ to scrutinize the proposed Sanderson-Wayne transaction to determine whether it violates the antitrust laws, and the DOJ should oppose the merger if it does.""
Cargill and Continental Grain said in a statement that the planned deal would create a new player ""which will be in an ideal position to expand options and increase supply for consumers.""
""This new company plans to pursue new investments to expand its operations, creating new high-quality jobs, and benefiting local communities in seven U.S. states,"" they said in a statement.

In addition to Warren and Jones, among those signing the letter were Democratic Senators Cory Booker and Richard Blumenthal, independent Senator Bernie Sanders and Democratic Representatives David Cicilline, Hank Johnson and Katie Porter.
Warren in November had called on the Justice Department to investigate the impact of price-fixing and consolidation in the poultry sector on consumers and farmers. She had also urged the department's Antitrust Division to review ""with suspicion"" any large mergers in the industry after Cargill and Continental in August announced the Sanderson deal.

Investing.com -- Shares of freelancer platform Fiverr International (NYSE:FVRR) rose 12% Thursday following its fourth-quarter earnings report. 
Fiverr announced earnings per share of 22 cents on revenue of $79.76 million. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of 11 cents on revenue of $76.96 million.
The company's shares and revenue were also boosted by its active buyers. As of Dec. 31, 2021, active buyers on the platform grew to 4.2 million, compared with 3.4 million as of Dec. 31, 2020, an increase of 23% year over year. Spend per buyer was also up to $242.
The company is clearly benefitting from the rise in freelancers and freelance work. A report conducted by  Upwork  (NASDAQ:UPWK) — another freelance platform — showed the number of freelancers in the U.S. hit 59 million in 2021, making up around one-third of the U.S. workforce. 
“Our growth has been exceptional over the last two years at 178%, and our fourth quarter alone saw an increase in revenue of 43% year over year to $79.8 million,” said Ofer Katz, Fiverr’s president and CFO. 
“Fiverr continues to see growth across all metrics with predictable cohort behavior, giving us confidence to provide strong guidance for the year ahead,"" added Katz.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Thursday as fears of war in Ukraine returned to center stage, amid reports of tank fire and the expulsion of a senior U.S. diplomat by Russia. 
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba was quoted by newswires as saying that two Ukrainian servicemen had been injured by shots fired from breakaway republics in eastern Ukraine, which were set up by Russia in 2014 after its first invasion of the country. Kuleba's statement followed one from Moscow saying it had expelled the U.S.'s deputy ambassador in Russia, a move labeled by U.S. officials as a ""deliberate escalation.""  U.S. President Joe Biden said the risk of a full-blown invasion was ""very high.""
The Russian government also issued a rejection of the U.S.'s latest proposals on security cooperation, saying they had failed to meet a central demand regarding Russia's security guarantees. The Kremlin has been pushing for a commitment that Ukraine will never join the U.S.-led NATO alliance. 
The news compounded nerves already on edge after some disappointing forecasts from a handful of market darlings including chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and lithium miner  Albemarle  (NYSE:ALB).
By 9:50 AM ET (1450 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 336 points, or 1.0%, at 34,598 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.2%.
Nvidia stock, one of the star performers of recent years, fell 6.9% after the chipmaker said that the surge in demand for its chips wouldn't result in higher operating margins in the current quarter. Some analysts expressed concern that its exposure to crypto miners, who hoard computing power, could be a two-edged sword if the boom in cryptocurrencies cools off. Nvidia stock is now down some 24% from its December peak.
Albemarle stock, meanwhile, fell 17% after it posted a net loss in the fourth quarter, despite sky-high prices for the metal that is integral to most rechargeable batteries. The company's forecast of around 50% growth in adjusted earnings this year also fell short of expectations. 
There was the familiar sound of a 'profitless tech' company going 'thud' after reporting quarterly earnings - cloud services company Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) becoming the latest to pay the price for disappointing guidance. Fastly stock fell 30% and is now down some 85% from its 2020 peak. Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) stock also fell 13% after its net loss widened in the fourth quarter.
There was better news from DoorDash, which posted a record quarter for revenue at the end of last year, defying fears that the reopening of restaurants would hurt the food delivery business. DoorDash (NYSE:DASH) stock rose 20%, leading Uber (NYSE:UBER) - which is increasingly a food delivery company rather than a taxi app - up by 2.1% in sympathy.
Earlier, the Labor Department had reported a surprise increase in initial jobless claims to 248,000 last week, a development that most analysts passed off as likely to be a blip. Separate data showed that U.S. housing starts, which have been at their hottest since the subprime boom of 2006 in recent months, cooled slightly in January."
1500,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 09:43AM ET</span>",Factbox-Russian gas pipeline exports to Europe,"(Reuters) - Europe's gas market remains volatile amid tensions between Moscow and the West over Ukraine, a key route for Russian gas, as Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), source for 40% of Europe's needs, sends gas under its contractual obligations but does not add much more. 
Following is a summary of key Russian gas export data and routes
EXPORTS
* Kremlin-controlled Gazprom had likely missed its target on gas exports to Europe last year as its total gas exports outside the former Soviet Union increased by 5.8 billion cubic metres (bcm) to 185.1 bcm. This included some 10 bcm exported to China, while it had initially planned to deliver to Europe 183 bcm in 2021.
This was down from record-high 201 bcm supplied to Europe in 2018, but still the fourth highest annually in Gazprom's history. 
* The completed Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany has annual capacity of 55 bcm and the operator says it can deliver enough energy to supply 26 million households per year. The project is still awaiting regulatory approval.
* Russia also raised gas pipeline supplies to Turkey by 63% in 2021 and to Germany by 10.5%. Exports have also risen to Italy by 20.3%.
* Gazprom's 2021 total natural gas production rose by 62.2 bcm to 514.8 bcm, its highest in 13 years, while domestic gas supplies rose by 31.9 bcm to 257.8 bcm, more than half the total production.
KEY ROUTES 
* Urengoy-Uzhgorod 
Part of the Ukrainian gas pipeline network with annual capacity of more than 100 bcm. Supplies travel via Slovakia and Hungary. 
Russia and Ukraine signed a new five-year transit deal on Dec. 31, 2019, with Russia pledging to ship 65 bcm of gas via Ukraine in 2020 and 40 bcm annually from 2021 to 2024.
Ukraine has refused to buy Gazprom's gas directly since 2015 after Moscow's annexation of Crimea and pro-Russian insurgency in its eastern regions.
Gazprom cut its daily volume of gas transit via Ukraine to Europe to about 53 million cubic metres (mcm) in January 2022. The volume stood at an average 124.6 mcm in 2021, according to Ukraine's pipeline operator.
Gazprom has rights to participate in auctions for additional pipeline capacity for transit via Ukraine. 
Gazprom also did not book extra gas transit capacity for exports via the Sudzha and Sokhranovka crossing points into Ukraine for the second quarter.
Nor did it book capacity via the Velke Kapusany interconnection point on the Slovakia-Ukraine border for the April-June quarter.
* Yamal-Europe
Annual capacity is 33 bcm. The pipeline runs from the Arctic region of Yamal, rich with hydrocarbons, via Belarus, Poland and terminates in eastern Germany. 
The route has been working in a reverse mode, shipping gas from Germany to Poland since Dec. 21.
Gazprom did not book capacity to export gas via the Yamal-Europe pipeline in the second and third quarter, as well as for February and March.
* Nord Stream 
The operational pipeline runs via the Baltic Sea to Germany, with annual capacity of 55 bcm. Nord Stream 2, running in parallel to Nord Stream, which is awaiting approval from Germany's energy regulator, would double capacity. 
* Russia's natural gas exports to Germany via the existing Nord Stream pipeline crossing the Baltic Sea totalled 59.2 bcm in 2021, in line with record volumes a year earlier.
* Blue Stream
This pipeline goes to Turkey via the Black Sea and has annual capacity of 16 bcm.
* Turkstream
Another Black Sea pipeline to Turkey, this has two lines with annual capacity of 15.75 bcm each. One line is designed to feed the Turkish domestic market while the other exports gas to southern Europe.
ELECTRONIC SALES PLATFORM (ESP)

* Gazprom set up the ESP in 2018 for gas sales to Europe in addition to the existing long and mid-term contracts. It sold more than 40 bcm of gas on the platform in the first two years.
* Gazprom Export, the exporting arm of Gazprom, has not offered natural gas for delivery on ESP since late August.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Private equity firms are increasingly investing in behavioral services for troubled youth, according to a new report released on Thursday by the nonprofit Private Equity Stakeholder Project. 
Services private equity firms are buying into include those for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities as well as for those enrolled in foster care, juvenile justice, autism and troubled teen programs, the report said.
Youth behavioral health services have typically been provided by non-profit organizations. But increasingly that is changing, according to the report, entitled, ""The Kids Are Not Alright: How Private Equity Profits Off of Behavioral Health Services for Vulnerable and At-Risk Youth."" 
The report cites what it calls private equity's ""troubling"" track record in youth services, saying a reliance on unlicensed staff, inadequate training and failure to maintain facilities has led to ""abuse, neglect, and unsafe living conditions for youth under the care of those companies.""
The report claims private equity's business model exacerbates problems because firms often aim to double or triple their investment within as little as four years.
As an example, it says that within two years of taking ownership of foster care and disability services provider The Mentor Network, Centerbridge Capital and the Vistria Group have taken almost half a billion dollars in debt-funded dividends from the company. 
Elsewhere it says Alaris Royalty, which owned foster care and troubled teen company Sequel Youth & Family Services, reported generating a $71 million profit, or 23% annual return, on its investment in the company.
The Mentor Network, which rebranded in September as Sevita Health, has come under fire for numerous allegations of widespread abuse, neglect, and deaths at its foster care and residential programs, according to the report.
Sequel Youth & Family Services has also faced criticisms. 
As recently as November, Sequel garnered attention when it announced the sudden closure of its Bernalillo Academy in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which treated youths with behavioral and developmental challenges. Local investigators found that the facility failed to background check employees or ensure that they had adequate training, and local media reported incidents involving abuse of children by staff.
Sequel has faced such criticisms, and closures, at other facilities it operates around the country.
Sevita and Sequel did not respond to requests for comment.

Investing.com – AutoNation stock (NYSE:AN) rose 2.5% in premarket trading Thursday after multiple tailwinds powered it to another estimate-beating quarter.
The pandemic-induced supply crunch of new vehicles has driven consumers, unwilling to wait for fresh models, to used ones. The fear of the virus has also meant a preference for personal transportation. The company sells both new and used vehicles, one segment insulating it from the upheavals of the other.
“We expect consumer demand for personal vehicle ownership to remain strong for the foreseeable future,"" CEO Mike Manley said in a statement.
AutoNation is now acquiring 90% of the used vehicles it sells through trade-ins or by buying vehicles from consumers, thus mostly bypassing the price volatility of auto auctions, Reuters quoted Manley as saying. The company said it plans to open 12 more AutoNation U.S. used vehicle stores during the year.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose 14%, to $6.6 billion, with new vehicle revenue declining 7% compared to a 55% rise in sales from used vehicles. The company’s profit from both new and used vehicles rose 132% and 32%, respectively, on a per vehicle basis. However, unit sales of new vehicles fell.
Adjusted profit per share rose 137%, to $5.76, and easily beat estimates.

LONDON (Reuters) - NatWest Group is facing a 2 million pound-plus ($2.7 million) compensation claim after a London tribunal ruled it had discriminated against an employee and unfairly dismissed her two days after cancer surgery, her lawyer said on Thursday.
Adeline Willis, a 44-year-old risk and compliance officer who had worked at the bank for more than six years, said she was physically and emotionally in turmoil after being made redundant in 2020, eight months after a bowel cancer diagnosis.
But the tribunal ruled a recorded telephone call a few weeks after her diagnosis, in which Willis's managers sought advice from the human resources department about terminating a secondment early because she was due to take time off for cancer treatment, was clear evidence of discriminatory intent.
""This has been a harrowing experience for my client who did not deserve the appalling treatment that she endured at the hands of one of this country's largest and best resourced employers,"" said Will Clayton, a lawyer at Constantine Law, who represents Willis.
""The next step is to ensure that Ms Willis is fully compensated for her losses and the discrimination that she has suffered,"" Clayton said, adding the case had a potential value in excess of 2 million pounds. 
Natwest said it recognised the ""extremely difficult personal circumstances in this case,"" adding it was reviewing the judgment and considering its position.
The London Central Employment Tribunal rejected the bank's allegations that Willis's 160,000 pound-per-year job was redundant, ruling that Willis's dismissal had been ""tainted with discrimination.""
Cancer is listed as a disability under the UK Equality Act 2010, protecting sufferers from discrimination.

If the two sides cannot agree on the level of damages, the court has pencilled in a further hearing for April 25 and 26.

""According to several sources, the State (...) had decided in favour of a rapid reinforcement of the group's equity, via the injection of more than 2 billion euros"", the daily financial paper said on Thursday, adding that a formal decision had yet to be taken.
The finance ministry and EDF declined to comment on the report. 
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire this week said that decisions on EDF's financial future will be made public soon, with the debt-laden company facing larges-scale investment to build at least six next-generation nuclear reactors. 
French President Emmanuel Macron has previously said that France's nuclear renaissance, a major policy shift that consists of extending the lifespan of old reactors while building up to eight new EPR2 reactors, will be led by EDF.
But the utility's shares have lost almost 40% of their value as curbs to shield French consumers from soaring power prices added to a series of technical setbacks that forced the utility to halt a number of its nuclear reactors.
Tens of billions of euros in public financing would be used to finance the projects and safeguard EDF's finances, Macron said.

The French government this week said that all options were being discussed regarding the future of EDF, including full nationalisation.

(Reuters) - Universal Music Group (AS:UMG) has struck a partnership with NFT platform Curio to develop non-fungible token (NFT) collections for its record labels and artists, the companies said on Thursday.
The deal is a major move into a potentially new revenue stream by the world's largest music company, which, like its rivals, depends heavily on streaming music for its financial survival.
Universal Music said it plans to work with Curio to develop digital artwork and other collectibles for the company and its artists. Curio also will serve as an online outlet where fans can buy officially licensed NFTs, starting in March with a collaboration from Capitol Music Group and the British singer-songwriter Calum Scott.  
   Michael Nash, Universal Music Group’s executive vice president of digital strategy, said NFTs and Web3, the coming generation of the internet built on blockchain technology, present an opportunity for labels and artists to create unique digital products for fans at a time when streaming has made access to music ubiquitous.
""We have an opportunity, with Web3, to have ownership on top of access,"" Nash told Reuters in an interview. NFTs are unique data files that can be music, art and more.
""With all the innovation happening around Web3 and NFTs, you’ve got the opportunity to make all kinds of digital products available that provide that ownership ... And you have technologically enforced scarcity, so you can appeal to collectors,"" Nash said.
Universal has been actively exploring ways to capitalize on the growing popularity of digital collectibles, going so far as to form a music group, Kingship, made up entirely of simian characters from the NFT brand Bored Ape Yacht Club. The animated apes, which live as unique items on the digital blockchain, have become coveted prizes for Hollywood celebrities and other collectors. 
In Curio, Universal found an executive well acquainted with its business as co-founder and co-Chief Executive Officer Ben Arnon previously worked at Universal Music Group. One of Curio's advisors, Marc Geiger, is the former head of music at William Morris Endeavor talent agency.
The partnership represents a milestone for Curio, which was founded in 2020 and dropped its first NFT last February. The company has subsequently released more than 75,000 digital collectibles working with music, films and television industry partners. 

The platform features NFTs inspired by Neil Gaiman's ""American Gods"" television series and Universal Pictures' 2010 cult classic ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World."" 
Arnon said to Reuters he built its NFT marketplace so it would be accessible to mainstream consumers, including those who have never used cryptocurrency.

(Reuters) -No. 1 U.S. auto retailer AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN) beat Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter profit and revenue on Thursday on robust demand for used vehicles boosted by consumer preference for personal transportation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Shares of the company were up as much as 5% in premarket trading.
The results cap off a year of breakneck profit growth for the auto retail industry, with sales surging as consumers, flush with cash, scramble to buy cars at record high prices.
""We expect consumer demand for personal vehicle ownership to remain strong for the foreseeable future,"" Mike Manley, who took over as AutoNation's chief executive officer on Nov. 1, said in a statement.
Manley told Reuters that AutoNation's results reflect structural improvement in the profitability of its finance and insurance and after-sale service operations. The company is also benefiting from its approach to the used vehicle market, he said.
AutoNation is now acquiring 90% of the used vehicles it sells through trade-ins or by buying vehicles from consumers, allowing the chain to largely bypass the price volatility of auto auctions, Manley said. The company said it plans to open 12 more AutoNation USA used vehicle stores during the next 12 months.
AutoNation also has ""an active interest in M&A"" to add to its portfolio of new vehicle franchises, Manley said.
Rising interest rates, which increase monthly payments for consumers buying on credit, are ""certainly something we are going to watch,"" Manley said. But now, Manley said ""We've got a degree of pent-up demand that will be fulfilled.""
Strong consumer demand during the pandemic coinciding with vehicle production cuts forced by shortages of semiconductors sent average vehicle transaction prices to record highs last year, according to auto industry consultants.
AutoNation said incoming new vehicle inventory, for the most part, had already been preordered by customers.
The company said retail gross profit per used vehicle was $2,063 in the quarter, up 32% from the year-ago quarter, while retail gross profit per new vehicle was $6,450, up 132% from last year.
Excluding items, it earned $5.76 per share, beating estimates of $4.96 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The Fort Lauderdale-based company said revenue from the sale of used vehicles rose 55% from a year earlier.
However, retail unit sales of new vehicles fell 20% in the quarter ended Dec. 31.

Net income rose to $387.1 million, or $5.87 per share, in the quarter, from $151.5 million, or $1.73 share, last year.
AutoNation's revenue rose 13.8% to $6.58 billion. Estimates came in at $6.37 billion.

Investing.com –  Albemarle  stock (NYSE:ALB) lost more than a tenth of its value in premarket trading Thursday after the lithium producer’s annual earnings forecast failed to live up to its lofty valuation.
Albemarle’s full-year adjusted earnings forecast of $5.65-$6.65 per share fell short of expectations, despite implying a rise of 50% from last year's $4.04.  EPS in the fourth quarter were $1.01.
Investors “were hoping it’d be a blowout because the spot lithium prices are so high,” Bloomberg quoted KeyBanc Capital Markets senior analyst of U.S. chemicals Aleksey Yefremov as saying. He called the guidance “surprisingly low”, according to the agency.
Lithium is the most critical element in batteries that power electric vehicles. With the shift toward electric vehicles gaining momentum, lithium prices have skyrocketed in recent months, driving Albemarle stock up accordingly.
The 10% drop, if validated at the opening, would leave Albemarle still trading at 35 times its central earnings forecast for this year.
Net sales in the fourth quarter rose 2% to $894 million but the company posted a loss of $3.8 million, blaming cost overruns, labor- and pandemic-related issues at its Kemerton project in Australia. On an adjusted basis, profit per share was $1.01.
Current-year net sales are seen between $4.2 billion and $4.5 billion.

Seen as the problem child at Traton, in which Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has a 89.72% stake, MAN said in March last year it was targeting 8% margins to finance its transition to electric vehicles but did not specify when it aimed to reach the target.
Despite posting first half margins of 3.3% in 2021, the MAN bus and trucks unit is on track to hit its goal, CEO Alexander Vlaskamp told Reuters in an interview published on Thursday.
""We are confident we can reach our targets in coming years... and make a very good contribution to the Traton Group,"" Vlaskamp said.

In June 2021, MAN had announced it would start series production of its first electric truck model e-LGTM in early 2024 but said it did not expect deliveries to start until 2025.

Nordea two weeks ago raised its profitability target thanks to increased demand for mortgages and asset management, but warned costs would be higher this year.
The biggest Nordic lender now aims for a return on equity (RoE) above 11% in 2022 and above 13% in 2025. It was 11.3% in 2021.
Nordea added investments and cost inflation would mean an increase to the cost-to-income ratio, which it now expects to rise to 49-50% from 47% last year.

1512,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 08:01AM ET</span>",Walmart Gains on Boost From Guidance Amid Cost Pressures,"By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Walmart stock (NYSE:WMT) traded 3% higher in premarket Thursday after the company guided for a 3% rise in total net sales this year.
Adding to the gains in the stock was its 49th consecutive year of dividend increases and the announcement of plans to allocate at least $10 billion to buying back shares this financial year.
The guidance follows a quarter when net sales rose 0.5% to near $153 billion, signaling the pandemic-fueled demand is still holding up, and that Walmart can pass on cost pressures.
The U.S.'s biggest traditional retailer nonetheless assumes Covid-related costs pressures and supply chain disruptions will ease as the year progresses.
Walmart's domestic sales grew 5.7% quarter-on-quarter to top $105 billion in the three months through January. 
Walmart International net sales took a hit of about 23% due to divestitures in China and Mexico. Flipkart, the company’s online format in India, delivered strong growth, Walmart said.
The company closed the year with inventory up 26%, as it prioritized in-stock levels for its ‘Everyday Low Price’ offers. That meant costlier goods and in-transit shipments, but the company used its size and negotiating heft to ensure that operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, only inched up.  
Adjusted profit per share in the quarter was $1.53 and beat estimates. EPS in the current year is seen up around 5%."

A pandemic-driven trend of spending more time indoors and remodeling homes has continued, boosting demand for tools and other home-related items. People also spent more on Halloween and Christmas decor.
The Toronto, Ontario-based company said easing restrictions on in-store shopping also led to higher sales. The retailer, however, said its e-commerce sales suffered as a result.
Canadian Tire's retail segment revenue rose 5.4% to C$4.83 billion and total revenue rose 5.4% to C$5.14 billion ($4.05 billion) in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 1, beating analysts' average estimate of C$4.76 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Net income attributable to shareholders rose to C$508.5 million, or C$8.34 per share, from C$488.8 million, or C$7.97 per share. Excluding items, Canadian Tire earned C$8.42 per share, beating estimates of C$6.70 cents per share.

The comments come after Manager Magazin reported Adidas expects sales in China to be down 400 million euros ($455 million) in 2022, without citing its sources.
Asked about the article, an Adidas spokesperson said: ""Our business in China grew in 2021 and our business in China will grow in 2022 as well.""
Adidas's third-quarter sales fell 15% in Greater China, although they were up 15% in the first nine months of the year. The company reports full-year 2021 results on March 9.
Western brands have come under fire in China for saying they would not source cotton from Xinjiang after reports of human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims in the region. Beijing denies any abuses.
Adidas said last year it had launched an action plan to try to revive its fortunes in China, long its most important growth market. It has set up a dedicated studio for marketing and is increasing its creation of products just for the Chinese market.
Manager Magazin said the situation was seen as so critical that Adidas sales chief Roland Auschel had travelled to China in January despite quarantine requirements.

Rival  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) said in December supply issues and fresh COVID-19 lockdowns led to a 20% fall in revenue in Greater China in its fiscal second quarter.

1516,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 07:45AM ET</span>",Walmart Bucks Supply-Chain Snarls With Upbeat Annual Outlook,"(Bloomberg) -- Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. surpassed Wall Street’s quarterly profit expectations and unveiled an upbeat sales outlook for the current fiscal year despite persistent cost pressures and flagging consumer sentiment.
Comparable sales at U.S. Walmart stores will post a percentage gain “slightly above 3%” excluding fuel during the current fiscal year, which ends in early 2023, the retailer said in a statement Thursday as it reported earnings. That suggests a better performance than the 2.7% average gain expected by analysts. 
The results underscore Walmart’s efforts to navigate scarce transportation capacity, a labor squeeze and rising fuel costs that are combining with robust demand to spur the fastest growth in U.S. consumer prices in four decades. U.S. retail sales in January rose the most in 10 months, signaling resilient demand despite surging inflation and the weakest consumer confidence in a decade.  
The shares rose 2.7% in premarket trading at 7:36 a.m. New York time. Walmart had fallen 7.7% this year through Wednesday, compared with a 2.4% drop in an S&P index of consumer staples companies. Last year, Walmart dramatically underperformed retail stock indexes and rivals such as  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT) and Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST). 
The results are likely to be seen as a bellwether as other large U.S. retailers prepare to release earnings.  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD)., Macy’s Inc. and Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) Cos. report next week, followed the week after by Target, Costco and  Best Buy  Co (NYSE:BBY).  
Walmart leaders are scheduled to discuss the company’s fourth-quarter results and outlook for this year on a conference call at 8 a.m. New York time.
Walmart’s adjusted earnings climbed to $1.53 a share in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended in late January. That topped the $1.51 average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 0.5% to $152.9 billion, while Wall Street had expected $151.7 billion.
The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer, which for decades has based its strategy on everyday low prices, is vying for more customers as the rising inflation rate prompts shoppers to look harder for bargains. But higher costs for merchandise, transportation and labor pose a growing threat to profitability. 
That’s raising the stakes as Walmart and other retailers decide how much vendor price increases they will pass along to consumers. Last quarter, comparable sales at Walmart’s U.S. stores rose 5.6% with market share gains in the grocery business, while analysts had predicted 5.5%. 
Walmart is also trying to develop businesses in digital advertising, financial services and health care, and it’s investing heavily in e-commerce. The company is planning capital expenditures in the current fiscal year to be at the upper end of 2.5% to 3% of net sales with a focus on supply chain, automation, customer-facing initiatives and technology.
Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce sales, a closely watched metric, rose 1% in the fourth quarter while analysts were looking for a 2.2% gain. Online sales got a substantial boost during pandemic lockdowns, but demand has been slowing as shoppers venture back into stores. 
To further boost its e-commerce business, the retailer last year debuted Walmart+, an online subscription offering, to compete with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).’s Prime program. Walmart has said little about the initiative’s performance, even downplaying its importance.

Tinkoff, which has more than 20 million customers as of mid-February, has earmarked up to $200 million for its South East Asia expansion drive. In November, the bank said it was in dialogue with regulators in three countries.
Tinkoff hopes BPC's more than 15 years of experience in the Philippines and its own technological offering will help it succeed, George Chesakov, international expansion lead at Tinkoff, said in a statement. 
JP Morgan analysts consider Tinkoff's Asia push a smart and well-balanced move. 
""The Philippines is an attractive market with a large, digitally native, and financially underserved population,"" analysts said in a note in September, describing the market as ripe for digital disruption. 
""The central bank has recently been granting new banking licences to foster healthy competition and improve financial accessibility and inclusion,"" the two companies said. 
BPC, headquartered in Switzerland, said Tinkoff would use its software-as-a-service (SaaS) cloud payment services for the planned expansion, with its processing company Radar Payments managing the end-to-end payment experience for prospective Tinkoff customers in the Philippines.

1518,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 07:20AM ET</span>","U.S. investigates 416,000 Tesla vehicles over unexpected braking reports","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Thursday it is opening a formal investigation into 416,000 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles over reports of unexpected brake activation tied to its driver assistance system Autopilot.
The preliminary evaluation covers 2021-2022 Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in the United States after the agency received 354 complaints about the issue over the past nine months. NHTSA said the vehicles under review have a advanced driver assistance system that Tesla calls Autopilot that allows them to brake and steer automatically within its lanes.
NHTSA said: ""Complainants report that the rapid deceleration can occur without warning, at random, and often repeatedly in a single drive cycle."" 
Owners say they have raised concerns with Tesla, which has dismissed the complaints saying the braking is normal, and some have called it ""phantom braking"".
The owner of a 2021 Tesla Model Y told NHTSA in October that while driving on a highway at 80 miles per hour ""the car braked hard and deceleated from 80 mph to 69 mph in less than a second. The braking was so violent, my head snapped forward and I almost lost control of the car.""
NHTSA in August opened a formal safety probe into Tesla's Autopilot system in 765,000 U.S. vehicles after a series of crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles. 
Earlier this month, NHTSA confirmed it was reviewing consumer complaints that Tesla vehicles were activating the brakes unnecessarily. A preliminary evaluation is the first phase before NHTSA could issue a formal recall demand.
In May, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk said dropping a radar sensor from its partially automated driving system would address ""phantom braking,"" which some Tesla drivers have long complained about. Tesla, which disbanded its media relations department, did not respond to a request for comment.
Tesla has come under increasingly scrutiny from NHTSA, which is investigating several issues and the electric vehicle manufacturer has issued 10 recalls since October, including many for software issues and some under pressure from the agency.
Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association, the group that represents state highway safety agencies, said on Twiter ""another day, another issue with Tesla. Good to see NHTSA being more active in reigning this company in.""
In November, Tesla recalled nearly 12,000 U.S. vehicles sold since 2017 because a communication error may cause a false forward-collision warning or unexpected activation of the emergency brakes.
The recall was prompted after a software update on Oct. 23 to vehicles in its limited early access version 10.3 Full-Self Driving (FSD) (Beta) population.
FSD is an advanced driver assistance system that handles some driving tasks but Tesla and NHTSA say it does not make vehicles autonomous.
The recall came after NHTSA in October asked Tesla why it had not issued a recall to address software updates made to its Autopilot driver-assistance system to improve the vehicles' ability to detect emergency vehicles.

Last week, Tesla recalled 578,607 U.S. vehicles because pedestrians may not be able to hear a required warning sound of an approaching car due to loud music or other sounds played by its ""Boombox"" feature.
Musk said last week on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) ""the fun police made us do it (sigh).""

1520,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 07:01AM ET</span>","Nvidia Falls on Flat Margins, Exposure to Crypto Chips Market","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Nvidia stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) traded 3.3% lower in premarket Thursday after the chipmaker reported flat margins in the fourth quarter, raising concerns over its exposure to cryptocurrency mining.
The chipmaker has set lofty expectations, and the lack of change in its adjusted margin left participants unimpressed. Nvidia’s 67% margin compares unfavorably with 72% at  Analog Devices  (NASDAQ:ADI), a much smaller company.
“Volatility in the cryptocurrency market including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies or method of verifying transactions, such as proof of work or proof of stake, can impact demand for our products and our ability to accurately estimate it,” Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress told analysts in a conference call.
Revenue from cryptocurrency mining processors in the quarter was $24 million, less than a fourth of sales in the previous period.
Persistent supply chain problems at automotive clients also translated into lower revenue at the segment for Nvidia, both on a year-on-year basis and sequentially.
According to Bloomberg, Chief Executive Jensen Huang expects the company’s own supply issues to improve. Huang suffered a setback recently when the company had to shelve its deal to buy chip designer ARM in the face of regulatory pushback. The CEO said Nvidia will increase the number of ARM-based processors it makes.
Nvidia expects revenue in the current quarter to be $8.1 billion, up around 43% on the year. In the fourth quarter, it had grown 53% on the year to $7.6 billion. Adjusted profit per share climbed 69% to $1.32 on higher margins and beat estimates.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Thursday, as investors monitor developments on the Ukraine border as well as the Federal Reserve minutes ahead of the release of weekly jobless claims and more corporate earnings.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 175 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 23 points, or 0.5%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 90 points, or 0.6%.
The fraught situation in Eastern Europe continues to weigh on market sentiment, with the optimism of earlier in the week - when Russia claimed it was returning some troops to barracks - having largely dissipated. 
Western countries, and NATO, dispute that there has been a significant withdrawal, although Russia's Defense Ministry said that troops recently drilling in Crimea would return to their bases hundreds of miles away in the North Caucasus. The United States said thousands more troops were still arriving.
Tensions were ramped up Thursday after Russian-backed rebels claimed Ukrainian forces had shelled their positions in eastern Ukraine, a claim denied by Ukrainian officials. Such events have become reasonably commonplace over the eight years of the conflict, but fears are growing that it could be used as justification for Russia to invade. Ukrainian authorities posted pictures of a kindergarten hit by separatist artillery overnight.
Back in the U.S., investors will study more data on the labor market in the form of the weekly jobless claims, at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT). The number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the first time in the U.S. is seen falling for the fourth straight week to 219,000.
This follows the minutes of the January Federal Reserve meeting showing on Wednesday that policy makers were in favor of promptly hiking interest rates and reducing the central bank's balance sheet.
Turning to the corporate sector, retail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings during the session, and analysts will be listening for its outlook on supply chains and the labor market.
Additionally, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will be in the spotlight after the online retail giant ended its dispute with Visa (NYSE:V) over card fees, meaning its customers will continue to be able to use the payment cards in the U.K. and that other surcharges imposed in Australia and Singapore, introduced last year, will be dropped.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) will also be in focus after Google said it will stop cross-app tracking, another blow to Facebook's ability to sell targeted ads.
DoorDash (NYSE:DASH) stock surged premarket after the food delivery company reported strong growth in its quarterly revenue as the demand generated in the pandemic showed no signs of slowing. 
Oil prices weakened Thursday following comments by France suggesting an agreement to salvage Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers was within reach, potentially releasing the Persian Gulf country’s crude output onto the global market.

1523,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 06:27AM ET</span>",Nvidia Underwhelms in First Results Since Scrapping Arm Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp., which walked away from a $40 billion acquisition of Arm Ltd. earlier this month, failed to impress investors with its latest forecast, a sign of the lofty expectations for the most valuable U.S. chipmaker.
Though the company topped Wall Street estimates with its latest quarterly results -- and projected strong growth for the current period -- the shares fell more than 3% in pre-market trading on Thursday. 
Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Jensen Huang has turned a niche business -- graphics cards for gamers -- into a chip empire worth more than $600 billion. But investors have high hopes for the company, and even a record-setting quarter can leave them underwhelmed.
In the “weird world” of Nvidia, investors’ expectations are always different than the consensus estimate, Vital Knowledge analyst Adam Crisafulli said in a note. Investors may have been looking for more upside, but within the next day or so, they’ll probably come back to the realization that Nvidia has “some of the best fundamental prospects in tech,” he said.
There were some weak spots last quarter. Sales of Nvidia’s auto chips were lower than projected. And its adjusted gross margin came in at 67% -- shy of the 67.1% analysts estimated and below what some chipmakers have reported recently.  Analog Devices  Inc (NASDAQ:ADI). had a margin of 72% when it delivered its quarterly results earlier Wednesday.
Supply constraints also are weighing on Nvidia’s data-center chip business, but the situation is improving, Huang said in a conference call with analysts. Companies like Nvidia that rely on outsourced chip manufacturing need to change the way they work with suppliers, Huang said. Making supply plans one quarter in advance doesn’t work at a time when the industry is expanding rapidly, he said. 
“We all have to recognize that the market size, our market footprint, is much larger than it used to be,” he said in an interview. “We have to plan with a much larger horizon.” 
Nvidia is bouncing back from its failed attempt to acquire Arm, a deal that faced regulatory opposition around the world. It terminated the transaction on Feb. 8 and expects to write off $1.36 billion this quarter to account for prepayments it pledged to Arm’s owner, SoftBank Group Corp. Huang said Wednesday that he gave the deal his “best shot.”
Nvidia had touted the purchase as a chance to expand its reach into many devices, including smartphones.
But even without Arm, Nvidia has been growing more quickly than projected. Revenue in the fiscal first quarter will be about $8.1 billion, the company said Wednesday. That compares with a $7.2 billion average analyst estimate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Huang said that Nvidia will increase the number of Arm-based processors it makes, and the current Grace model is only the beginning. He remains convinced that the technology, increasingly a rival to  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC).’s X86, will carve out a bigger role for itself in computing. Arm chips are already pervasive in power-constrained technologies, such as smartphones.
Nvidia’s stock, which ended 2015 at $8.24, closed at $265.11 on Wednesday. But the shares have taken a hit lately, part of a broader decline for semiconductor stocks. They’re down almost 10% this year.
The Santa Clara, California-based company has pushed into the booming field of artificial intelligence computing, where its processors are used to handle an ever-growing flood of data. That’s turned Nvidia’s products into essential equipment for data centers, rather than just gaming computers.
Nvidia posted sales of $7.64 billion in the fourth fiscal quarter, topping the $7.4 billion average prediction from analysts. Earnings came in at $1.32 a share, excluding some items, compared with an estimate of $1.22.
Revenue in Nvidia’s data-center business rose 71% in the fourth quarter to $3.26 billion, ahead of the $3.2 billion estimated by analysts. Its main gaming business generated sales of $3.42 billion, compared with an estimate of $3.36 billion.

MADRID (Reuters) - Aggravated by fiddly financial apps, retired urologist Carlos San Juan got more than he bargained for when he began a campaign for a more user-friendly service from Spain's banks.
The 78-year-old kicked off a revolt dubbed 'I'm old, not an idiot' online at the end of December and by mid-February had more than 640,000 signatures, forcing a change of tack.
Now Madrid has given Spanish banks until the end of the month to address the needs of the elderly, with services such as withdrawing money from ATMs or being able to operate remotely.
""I'm asking that they treat their customers from whom they make money with humanity and courtesy, no matter how old they are,"" San Juan told Reuters.
Among Spain's more than 9 million over-65s, who represent almost 20% of the total population, many have struggled to manage their finances since bank branches started vanishing from the high street.
The problems lay bare the disconnect between pursuing profits through massive layoffs and servicing the needs of a section of the population struggling with cheaper channels.
San Juan says urgent measures such as a face-to-face customer service throughout office hours were among the priorities, before embarking on financial education.
Despite more than halving the number of branches since the financial crisis in 2008, Spain still has one of the densest banking networks in the world, with slightly more than 45.5 outlets per 100,000 adults.
""It's not a problem about a lack of branches, it's about banks not assisting (the) elderly properly,"" Patricia Suarez, head of Spanish consumer association Asufin said.
San Juan's campaign has now spread to Germany, where close to 30% of the 83 million people are 60 or older.
Nicola Roehricht of the German National Association of Senior Citizens' Organisations is on a similar mission.
Roehricht travels the country, speaking to policymakers at conferences and senior citizens in their homes about the importance of making cyberspace more inclusive.
""We tell seniors, 'Ask the banks to help you with banking' We mustn't be ashamed that we have a smartphone and we don't know how it works. You must show up and say, 'I don't understand your strange English expressions. So help me',"" she said.
EXCLUSION 
While traditional banks in Spain, such as Caixabank, have cut thousands of jobs to cope with ultra low interest rates, those with a pure digital approach have been able to better cope with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Spanish and Portuguese unit of Dutch bank ING, this week said it had increased its return on equity (ROE) to 12% at the end of 2021 compared to 7.4% a year ago. That compares to an average ratio of 6.9% in Spanish banking.
The ING unit said that its cost of managing deposits, loans and investment products was roughly a third lower than the Spanish average as it has just 1,400 employees in Iberia.
In digital-laggard Italy, the elderly can still find all the help they need in a branch but as banks close outlets, problems are looming FABI union leader Lando Maria Sileoni said.
Italy's biggest bank Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY), which plans to cut 22% of its branches in the next four years, has struck a partnership to provide basic services such as bill payments through 45,000 cafes and tobacconist kiosks.
And in Britain, the government plans legislation to ensure that the digital banking drive does not cut older people adrift.
COMPLEX
In Spain, AEB banking association head Jose Maria Roldan recently thanked San Juan for highlighting a ""problem that was much more complex and more permanent than we thought"".
Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri, chairman of Spain's biggest bank by domestic assets, said that a quarter of Caixabank clients over 70 used remote channels compared to 85% in their thirties.
A draft document seen by Reuters from joint voluntary proposals shows Spanish banks plans to extend over-the-counter services, dedicate staff to engage with the elderly and make apps more user-friendly.
Other senior Spanish bankers, including BBVA (MC:BBVA) chairman Carlos Torres, say that technological exclusion does not only affect older people but is an issue of ""digital skills"".
Santander (MC:SAN), BBVA, Sabadell and smaller lender Abanca have recently announced they will extend or have already extended cashier services in their networks.
But none plan to hire any extra staff, something that Asufin and Comisiones Obreras, Spain's biggest union in the sector, say may increase the workload of overstretched employees.
Antonio Luque Delgado, a banking employee for more than 25 years, said that hiring would be key to address this, especially after banks have cut 100,000 jobs since the financial crisis.
""When you force a 70-year-old person to download an app, you know that it is not going to work. You know that the customer will be back in the office the next day because he has forgotten the password, because he has entered it wrongly,"" Luque said.

For San Juan, the battle for inclusion is just beginning.
""This is not the end. Good causes fail because of fatigue, we will go on,"" he said.

1527,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 06:06AM ET</span>",Nestle confident cost inflation won't take a bite out of margins,"By Silke Koltrowitz
ZURICH (Reuters) -Food group Nestle is confident of defending its profit margins against mounting cost pressures this year, planning more price increases after they helped it beat sales and earnings expectations in 2021.
Consumer goods companies are grappling with surging costs for commodities, energy, transport and labour, prompting rival Unilever (NYSE:UL) last week to warn of a drop in margins as it struggles to lift prices enough to offset the extra expenses.
""It is a safe assumption that our input cost increases for 2022 will be higher than 2021, that is something that we have to reflect in our pricing,"" Nestle CEO Mark Schneider told reporters on Thursday, declining to give a precise inflation forecast in a ""super volatile environment"".
""There is almost no place in the company that is exempt of inflation now,"" he said.
Nestle, which has added more high-value products alongside staples such as Nescafe instant coffee and Maggi bouillon cubes, is confident it can keep raising prices without losing too many customers.
It recently bought a majority stake in protein powder maker Orgain to boost its health science business that grew 13.5% last year. Its Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) coffee sales were also up over 17%, showing that buyers of these products are ready to pay more.
Nestle stepped up price increases throughout the year to 3.1% in the fourth quarter and said it would continue this year, while seeking efficiencies in the business.
It expects a broadly stable underlying trading operating profit margin of 17.0%-17.5%, after delays between cost inflation and price hikes saw it dip to 17.4% last year.
""Is this (margin guidance) conservative? Yes, it is because being conservative in a volatile environment with significant inflation around us and uncertainty about what will happen later this year is the right way to approach it,"" Schneider said.
Nestle typically increases its guidance over the course of the year to avoid disappointing investors.
Vontobel's Jean-Philippe Bertschy said Nestle's fundamentals had rarely been as strong, widening the gap to the competition. ""Considering the ongoing market uncertainties, we believe that Nestle is a must have.""
Nestle shares, which trade at a premium to Unilever and Danone, were flat at 1010 GMT, in line with the food sector. 
Schneider said 2022 had started well and the company was well positioned for sustained mid-single-digit growth and margin improvements in the medium term. It is also open to acquisitions, but will be disciplined, Schneider said. 
Underlying or organic sales, which strip out currency swings and acquisitions, are expected to grow by around 5% this year, after an unexpectedly strong fourth-quarter rise of 7.2% and full-year growth of 7.5%, exceeding expectations.
Net profit rose 38% to 16.9 billion francs ($18.3 billion) last year, prompting the company to propose a 5 cent higher dividend of 2.80 francs per share.
Schneider repeated the group was committed to its infant nutrition business, where difficulties in China led to an impairment charge of around 2 billion Swiss francs.

Nestle nominated Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) chief financial officer Luca Maestri and Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) chief marketing officer Chris Leong for election to its board of directors.

1528,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 06:00AM ET</span>",Amazon accepts Visa credit cards in global truce over fees,"By Shivani Tanna and Mrinmay Dey
(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc has reached agreement with  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) to accept its credit cards across its network, ending a standoff between the two that threatened to disrupt e-commerce payments and deal a blow to the U.S.-based payments processor.
Details of the deal were not disclosed but Visa and other payments cards have faced increased pressure about their fees as more shoppers have turned online during the pandemic. The spat had highlighted the growing clout of retailers in the fee battle. 
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) had said in November it was considering dropping Visa as partner on its U.S. co-branded credit card, after earlier confirming it would stop accepting Visa credit cards in the UK because of high transaction fees.
The agreement announced on Thursday means Amazon customers can continue using Visa credit cards in its stores, the e-commerce group said in a statement.
Neither side said what fees would be levied in future - an issue which came to the fore particularly in Britain after an EU-enforced cap on card fees is no longer in place following Brexit.
The dispute between Amazon and Visa in the UK was seen as a bad sign for the card industry by some analysts, who argued it could presage a fight in the much bigger U.S. market.
British lawmakers said last month they planned to scrutinise increases in the fees Visa and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) charge businesses after the country's payments regulator found no evidence to justify the rises.
Last October, Visa began charging 1.5% of transaction value for credit card payments made online or over the phone between the UK and EU, and 1.15% for debit card transactions, up from 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively.
Average credit card processing fees across the industry range between 1.5% and 3.5%, according to analysts.
Retailers have in the past accepted credit card processing charges as an inevitable cost, but that could be changing because of innovations and increased consumer choice in the payments sector.
Credit cards accounted for a third of North American e-commerce spending in 2020, according to payments giant WorldPay, but mobile payment options like Venmo and ""buy now, pay later"" (BNPL) financing plans are gaining ground.
While alternative payments have been growing for years, the pandemic accelerated a downward trend in credit card applications and boosted the popularity of BNPL financing.
Credit cards' share of North American e-commerce spending declined 7% last year, according to WorldPay, while BNPL's share increased 78%.
Other big retailers have in the past settled fee disputes with Visa after announcing they were going to quit taking Visa credit cards in narrow segments of their businesses.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's unit in Canada, for example, said in 2016 it would stop accepting Visa credit cards after being unable to reach agreement on fees. Seven months later the companies said they had settled the matter.

Visa said it was pleased to have reached a broad, global agreement with Amazon.
""This agreement includes the acceptance of Visa at all Amazon stores and sites today, as well as a joint commitment to collaboration on new product and technology initiatives,"" a Visa spokesperson said in an email.

Investing.com –   Kering  (PA:PRTP) stock climbed 6.5% in Paris trading Thursday as its flagship Gucci brand posted an impressive comeback on its 100th birthday.   
The luxury retailer made full use of the surging demand with prices hikes in select brands to overcome cost pressures. Chief Financial Officer Jean-Marc Duplaix is not ruling out more price hikes this year, according to Bloomberg.
Gucci powered Kering’s 32% jump in comparable fourth-quarter revenue to 5.41 billion euro ($6.14 billion) and according to Bloomberg, the company’s biggest brand will probably make targeted price hikes in 2022, after boosting prices twice last year. Quarterly revenue was up some 13% from pre-pandemic levels in 2019. Operating margin for the year widened by 4.5 percentage points to exceed 28%.
Gucci’s own revenue rose 32% in the quarter, which the company attributed to “intense schedule of events and new product launches.”
The reference to ‘intense schedule of events’ relates to the September release of Gucci’s Aria ready-to-wear collection that generated buzz and sales, while Lady Gaga-starrer “House of Gucci,” also drew attention to the brand.
Gucci accounted for 57% of the group’s revenue in 2021. Revenue at Yves Saint Laurent, Kering’s second-biggest brand, rose 47% in the final quarter of 2021.
Kering has underperformed rivals LVMH and Hermes all through the pandemic, and has spent heavily on Gucci in particular in the last year to reinject momentum into the business and close a widening gap in relative valuations.

The company, previously called TowerJazz, earned diluted earnings per share of 55 cents excluding one-time items in the fourth quarter, up from 34 cents a year earlier. Revenue rose 19% to $412 million, with organic growth up 28%.
Chipmakers are seeing a surge in demand as economies recover more quickly than expected from the pandemic, with some sectors, such as automaking, reporting shortages.
Tower was forecast to earn EPS of 46 cents on revenue of $425 million, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
For all of 2021, Tower earned an adjusted $1.37 per diluted share, versus 76 cents in 2020. Revenue gained 19% to $1.51 billion. Analysts had forecast EPS ex-one offs of $1.53 on revenue of $1.51 billion.
Tower, which specialises in analogue chips used in cars, medical sensors and power management, has said it would invest in equipment at its manufacturing sites in Israel, Texas and Japan to boost capacity for 200 and 300 millimetre chips.
Intel on Tuesday said it would buy Tower for $53 a share, or $5.4 billion to give it access to more specialised production as it positions to take advantage of the soaring semiconductor demand. 

Tower typically issues a quarterly outlook but it said it would not due to the deal, which is expected to close in about 12 months. 
Tower's shares have risen more than 40% since Intel's announcement.

The administration has made fighting inflation a priority as U.S. consumer prices rose solidly in January, leading to the biggest annual increase in inflation in 40 years.

The division is making existing investigations a priority if it appears that competitors may have used supply chain disruptions, potentially caused by the coronavirus pandemic or shipping woes, as a way to hide collusion, the department said.

PARIS (Reuters) -Air France-KLM plans to raise up to 4 billion euros ($4.6 billion) as it seeks to repay state pandemic handouts, the airline said on Thursday, overshadowing robust earnings on a recovery in air travel and sending its shares down more than 4%. 
The airline - which in 2020 received 10.4 billion euros in loans backed by France and the Netherlands, its two biggest shareholders - confirmed the need for a cash call it had been mulling in October at the time of its third-quarter results.
However it gave no detail about the terms and timing of any fundraising. ""Air France-KLM intends to remain flexible on the transaction structures, as well as on the sequencing and the sizing of each instrument depending on market conditions,"" it said.
The money to be raised compares with the group's current market value of just below 3 billion euros. Its shares, which on Wednesday reached a three-month intraday high, were down around 4.5% at 4.267 euros by 0926 GMT. 
The fourth-quarter performance was helped by a recovery in transatlantic travel, as the United States reopened to vaccinated travellers in November. 
The group added it had started to see a pickup in bookings this quarter as Omicron restrictions start to ease. 
Fourth quarter core profit or EBITDA reached 827 million euros, up from a Q3 figure of 796 million and the second straight quarter of profitability at that level since the outbreak of the pandemic. 
INCREASED CAPACITY
For the year EBITDA reached 745 million euros, beating analysts forecasts, and the company's own guidance of a ""slightly"" positive figure.
Steven Zaat, chief financial officer, said the airline increased capacity on long-haul in the fourth quarter despite a resurgence of coronavirus cases due to the Omicron variant, which hurt short- and medium-haul travel in Europe.
For the first quarter of this year, the company forecasts EBITDA to break even, while available seat kilometres for the group's network passenger activity is seen at 73%-78% of 2019 levels, with the quarter impacted by the Omicron variant and a slowdown of business travel as companies still predominantly exercise a work-from-home model.
""We do not believe competition will sit on its hands, so high yields might not be reached, especially as business travel continues to suffer,"" Mulder added, referring to the group's ambition to reach 2019 capacity levels by 2024 and an ""ambitious"" outlook on margins and debt. 
Since last week, however, Zaat said bookings have started to catch up, including for the summer period.

The company posted a better-than-feared net loss of 3.29 billion euros. Revenue of 14.32 billion outpaced the average estimate in a Refinitiv poll of 13.97 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) - France's CNP Assurances will no longer finance new oil and gas projects or invest more money in companies planning to do so, joining the growing ranks of insurers taking a more pro-active approach to tackling global warming. The company said it was acting in response to scientificreports, including one by the International Energy Agency, whichsaid new projects weren't needed if the world wanted to limitglobal warming to 1.5 degree Celsius above pre-industrial norms. ""To achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement (on tackling global warming), it is necessary to gradually reduce the use of fossil fuels,"" Olivier Guigné, CNP's group investment director said in a statement on the company's website dated Feb. 16. ""The measures adopted today by CNP Assurances aim tocontribute to this.""
Under the new plan, however, CNP said it would still finance subsidiaries of energy companies dedicated exclusively to renewable projects, and invest in green bonds.
Going forward, CNP said it would publicly disclose its holdings in the oil and gas sector on an annual basis.
At a U.N. climate conference in November, banks, insurers and investors with $130 trillion at their disposal pledged to put combating climate change at the centre of their work.
French public bank Banque Postale committed in October to stop providing services to the oil and gas sector by 2030. However, most banks and insurers continue to finance the sector with no restrictions.
For those companies in which it has an existing stake, CNP said it would ask them to immediately stop any new exploration or production of oil or gas, and lobby governments to end subsidies to the sector and help curtail demand for the fuels.
On thermal coal, a leading cause of manmade global warming, CNP said it would stop new direct investments in companies that do not have a plan to phase out its use by 2030 in OECD countries and 2040 in the rest of the world.
""By requesting that companies they invest in immediately halt oil and gas expansion, CNP Assurances’ policy becomes best practice and a case in point that serious engagement strategies and ambitious exclusions go hand in hand,"" said Guillaume Pottier, stewardship campaigner at Reclaim Finance.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) swung to better than expected fourth-quarter and annual net profit despite a major overhaul, the German lender said on Thursday and painted a rosy picture for its 2022 outlook. 
Profit this year will exceed 1 billion euros ($1.14 billion), Commerzbank said, beating analyst forecasts. It added that it would pay a dividend for the year and said share buybacks are possible as early as next year.
Results were partly helped by revenue at its CommerzVentures venture capital funds, commission from its securities trading business and a decrease in provisions set aside to cushion the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The profitable finish to the full year at Germany's No. 2 bank marks a victory for CEO Manfred Knof, who joined the company at the start of 2021 to carry out a 2 billion euro restructuring programme involving hundreds of branch closures and 10,000 job cuts to get back on a path to profit.
""In the first year of the transformation, we have delivered on our promises. This increases our confidence that we will achieve our ambitious goals for 2024,"" Knof said.
Still, Knof has a long way to go, with agreements for 4,000 of the planned job cuts still outstanding. 
Nevertheless, bank's shares were up 4.9% by 0915 GMT.
Commerzbank reported a fourth-quarter net profit of 421 million euros versus a loss of 2.7 billion a year earlier, which reflected restructuring charges.
That beat the 81 million euros expected by analysts in a poll provided by Commerzbank.
For the full year, the bank swung to a net profit of 430 million euros from a loss of 2.9 billion euros.
A provision made at its Polish mBank subsidiary announced in January was a drag on the fourth quarter. 
Ahead of Thursday's outlook revision, analysts had expected the bank to post a profit of about 900 million euros, which would be its biggest since 2015.

The prospect of higher interest ratein s Europe could give a significant lift to interest income, the bank's chief financial officer told analysts.

By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - An Omicron-specific booster could be ready by August, the CEO of U.S. biotech firm  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) told Reuters, but the firm is still gathering clinical data to determine whether that vaccine would offer better protection than a new dose of the existing jab. 
Last month Moderna began clinical trials for a booster dose specifically designed to target Omicron but initial results from studies in monkeys show the Omicron-specific shot may not offer stronger protection than a new dose of the existing vaccine.
Moderna chief executive Stephane Bancel said in an interview the company aimed to have a booster ready by August 2022, before next autumn when he said more vulnerable people may need it.
Moderna's vaccines use mRNA technology to provoke an immune response, similar to the shot developed by Pfizer/BioNTech.
""We believe a booster will be needed. I don't know yet if it is going to be the existing vaccine, Omicron-only, or bivalent: Omicron and existing vaccine, two mRNA in one dose.""
He said a decision would be made in the coming months when clinical data becomes available.
Bancel also confirmed that under the best-case scenario Moderna would have ready by August 2023 a so-called pan-vaccine which would protect simultaneously against COVID-19, flu and other respiratory diseases.
He added that pricing for this vaccine under development would be ""very similar"" to that applied to the current high-dose flu vaccine. 
BOOSTING SALES IN EUROPE
Separately, Moderna announced plans to expand its commercial network in Europe in a bid to increase sales on the continent.
""Moderna plans to establish a commercial presence in Belgium, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden to support the delivery of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics locally,"" the company said in a statement.
These new European subsidiaries will be added to commercial offices in Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and Britain. Moderna is also boosting its commercial presence in Asia.
In Europe, Moderna produces its vaccines through manufacturing partnerships which include Lonza in Switzerland and the Netherlands, ROVI in Spain and Recipharm in France.

The company shipped last year more than 800 million COVID-19 shots globally and has deals with EU countries for the supply of up to 460 million doses.
Besides vaccines, Moderna is also developing mRNA drugs against a range of conditions including cancer, cardiovascular and rare genetic diseases.

Investing.com -- European stock markets traded in a mixed fashion Thursday, as investors digest the fraught situation on the Ukraine border, the minutes of the last Federal Reserve meeting, and a slew of corporate earnings.
By 4 AM ET (0900 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France climbed 0.2% while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 fell 0.6%.
Investors continue to closely monitor the tense situation in Eastern Europe, with sentiment hit after Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine accused government forces of shelling their territory with mortars. 
Ukraine's military denied the accusations and such incidents are reasonably common, but this clash comes with Russia massing more than 100,000 troops close to its neighbor’s borders and such an event could be used as a reason to invade.
Look at the European corporate sector, the earnings season continues apace Thursday.
 Carrefour  (PA:CARR) stock rose 4.10% after the French supermarket giant reported record cash generation in 2021 and a confident outlook for 2022, reflected in a new share buyback plan of 750 million euros ($852 million).
Staying in France, Orange (PA:ORAN) stock rose 1.3% after the telecoms operator expressed confidence in returning to core profit growth in 2022 after difficulties last year.
Airbus (PA:AIR) stock fell 0.8% despite Europe’s largest aerospace group posting a record net profit for 2021 and restarted its dividend for the first time in two years. The company is set for an expensive legal battle with Qatar Airways over damage to the surface of some of its A350 passenger jets.
Elsewhere,  Reckitt Benckiser  (LON:RKT) stock soared 4.9% after the British consumer goods company forecast that its profit margin would grow this year despite significant cost pressures.
Nestle (SIX:NESN) stock fell 0.6% after the Swiss food group said it expects sales to slow this year after posting a strong 7.2% rise in the fourth quarter.
In the banking sector, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) stock rose 4.1% after the German lender posted a better-than-expected fourth-quarter and 2021 net profit despite undergoing a major overhaul, while  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) stock fell 3.5% despite announcing a $750 million share buyback after 2021 profits disappointed.
The minutes from the last Fed meeting, released late Wednesday, provided some support for the market as they suggested that while the central bank intends to shortly begin raising interest rates to fight inflation, a hefty 50 basis point hike wasn’t a done deal.
Oil prices weakened Thursday following comments by France suggesting an agreement to salvage Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers was within reach, potentially releasing the Persian Gulf country’s crude output onto the global market. 
However, the market has received some support from the increased tensions on the Ukraine border.
Data from the Energy Information Administration, released late Wednesday, showed a build in U.S. crude inventories of just over 1 million barrels last week, largely matching the numbers from the American Petroleum Institute the day earlier.
By 4 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% lower at $92.36 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.4% to $93.52.
Additionally, gold futures rose 1.1% to $1,891.25/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1363.

CEO Bill Winters, who repaired StanChart's balance sheet and cut thousands of jobs after he took charge in 2015, is under pressure to boost growth and lift the bank's flagging share price. Its London-listed stock is around 45% below the level when Winters became CEO.
StanChart's shares fell 4% on Thursday, the second worst performers in the benchmark London FTSE index as the bank's 2021 profits missed expectations and investors digested a growth strategy reliant on rate hikes and cost cuts.
The results on Thursday from the emerging-markets focused lender, the first major British bank to report annual earnings, gave an early indication of how rising central bank interest rates will help banks to improve performance.
StanChart, which earns most of its revenue in Asia, said its statutory pre-tax profit doubled to $3.3 billion in calendar 2021 from $1.6 billion in 2020, but missed the $3.8 billion average estimate of 16 analysts, as compiled by the bank.
""Confidence in our overall asset quality and earnings trajectory allows us to return significant capital to shareholders,"" Bill Winters said in a statement.
The London-headquartered bank expects revenue to grow by an extra 3% per year as it benefits from rising interest rates.
That will help it bring forward a goal of hitting double-digit returns to 2024, from a previously unspecified timeframe.
Analysts were doubtful the bank could hit its new targets, given its track record of undershooting in the past.
""StanChart's track record might warrant some skepticism in analyst forecasts,"" Citi analyst Yafei Tian said.
The bank made a statutory pre-tax loss of $208 million in the fourth quarter versus a profit of $996 million in the third quarter and compared with the $288 million average estimate of 16 analysts, as compiled by StanChart.
Full-year income from Hong Kong, its biggest market, fell 2%. Many Asian economies are reopening after the pandemic but Hong Kong is now introducing its toughest measures, hitting its economy.
Winters said StanChart was not transferring staff from Hong Kong but warned that the Chinese territory would suffer in the longer run against other regional hubs if mobility remained curbed.
UNDERPERFORMING
StanChart's London-listed shares have gained 12% over the past year versus a 28% surge in HSBC and a 26% rise in  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
Analysts said StanChart, which has a presence in 59 markets and employs 82,000 staff, lacks the heft of larger, more well-capitalised rivals in commercial banking and has missed out on a pandemic-related trading boom compared with U.S. rivals which have bigger investment banks.
StanChart has, however, been building a portfolio of digital banking platforms and invested heavily in technology. 
""While the pandemic brought about considerable challenges and, as a result, the turnaround is taking longer than previously anticipated, it is clear to us that the refreshed strategic priorities we set out at the start of 2021 are right,"" Chairman Jose Vinals said.
StanChart said it would invest a further $300 million in China as it competes with HSBC to increase its share of banking business in the world's second-largest economy.
StanChart also suffered a $300 million writedown on the value of its investment in China's Bohai Bank, and took a $95 million ""management overlay"" against further expected charges in the troubled real estate sector.

It announced a $750 million share buyback, starting imminently, and a 12 cents per share dividend for 2021, up a third on 2020.
The bank, which bases its business on capturing trade flows between its key markets of Asia, Africa and the Middle East, reported credit impairment charges of $263 million, versus $2.3 billion a year earlier.

The chains, among China's largest coffee players, raised prices by between 1 yuan and 3 yuan ($0.16 and $0.47), according to menus on mobile apps and media reports, with the topic going viral on Chinese social media on Thursday.
Although a nation of tea drinkers, China is one of the world's fastest growing coffee markets, with nearly 110,000 shops in larger cities by April, consultants Deloitte have said, as young people drive consumption, which lags the United States and Europe, however.
Starbucks said it had adjusted on Wednesday the prices of some of items after ""comprehensive evaluation and consideration of multiple factors"" such as operating costs, in the first increase since 2018. 
A Starbucks Americano costs 30 yuan after the price increase, up from 28 yuan.
Packaged coffee beans and merchandise such as mugs were not affected, however, the company told Reuters in a statement. 
China's Luckin Coffee raised the price of some beverages by about 3 yuan, taking into account operational costs such as rent, manpower and raw material, the state-backed Shanghai Securities Journal said. 
Luckin did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
Tim Hortons declined to comment.
Starbucks hiked menu prices in October and January and plans further raises this year, Chief Executive Kevin Johnson has said, in part to offset soaring labour and goods costs, but he did not specify individual products.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Next month's mammoth stock market debut for India's Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) has battered shares in other insurers as investors trim their holdings to make room for the state-owned giant, fund managers and analysts said.
The flotation, potentially raising $8 billion, likely will continue to drag on LIC's competitors for about a year and could spread to other sectors, they said.
The government filed draft papers on Sunday with India's market regulator to sell 5% of the company's shares in what could be the world's third-biggest insurance IPO ever and one of this year's biggest Asian share sales, according to Refinitiv data.
""This is the biggest one and you have to make space for this,"" said a fund manager who asked not to be named. ""Historically, market leaders are the first ones that list. This is a rare moment when a large player is being listed very late.""
The 66-year-old company, dominating India's insurance industry with more than 280 million policies, is the fifth-biggest global insurer in terms of insurance premium collection in 2020, the latest year for which statistics are available. It had 39.56 trillion rupees ($527 billion) of assets under management as of September.
""For any fund manager, having a player that owns over 60% of the market share instead of individually owning those that have 10%-11% market share is a very natural aspiration,"" said Vidya Bala, co-founder of PrimeInvestor, a stocks and mutual funds research firm.
Fund managers have already started reducing their exposure to the three listed private life insurers, the fund manager and Bala said.
Shares in ICICI Pru have dropped 10.4% this year, while HDFC Life is down 9.7% and SBI Life 6.2%, compared with a marginal 0.2% decline in the blue-chip Nifty 50 index for the period.
LIC's listing could dump the equivalent of nearly 60% of the three insurers' free-float capitalisation on the market, Macquarie said in a report this week, adding that the outlook for them remains challenging.
If LIC's valuation is attractive, the pressure could spread beyond insurers, weighing on consumer goods firms and some non-banking financial companies, two fund managers said.

""When IPOs of this big size come, they suck out the liquidity from the system,"" one of the fund managers said. ""If there's room full of people at a party and a big guy comes in, you have to create space for him.""

1545,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 03:15AM ET</span>",Waiting for earnings tailwinds in rough waters,"A look at the day ahead from Danilo Masoni.
Beneath the surface of the wild swings that have gripped markets this year, there is a strong trans-Atlantic current of rising corporate profits steadily beating estimates.
The question is, when will asset prices take notice?
Investors are still busy navigating their way out of the rough waters of Ukraine war scenarios and rate hike whirlpools, but once the geopolitical and macro storms clear up, they might find favourable tailwinds in calmer waters awaiting them.
The rate of earnings beats on Wall Street has come above the typical quarter at 78%. Even in Europe, where the fourth-quarter reporting season peaks this week, it is cruising above usual averages, at over 62%, per Refinitiv data.
And what's more, 2022 could be another year where profits smash initial estimates. Swiss bank UBS sees 15% EPS growth this year for Europe, double the actual consensus, betting firms will keep passing rising costs on to customers.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) reported fivefold fourth quarter beat, Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) raised its core profitability goals and promised extra payouts, and Airbus saw core profit almost trebling on a partial recovery in jet deliveries.
So stocks could offer an inflation hedge, but tread softly. Roblox fell 26% in the latest display of how the tide has turned for high-flying tech and pandemic darlings that don't keep up with expectations. Remember Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Delivery Hero?
For now markets remain on edge after Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine accused government forces of attacks and the U.S. said Russia's claim of withdrawing troops was false, although on the positive side, the Fed minutes soothed worries over a supersized rate hike next month.
European and U.S. stock futures are heading south, government bonds are catching a bid and gold is nearing 8-month highs.

PARIS (Reuters) -Orange, France's biggest telecoms operator, expects a return to core profit growth in 2022 after lower returns from co-financing deals and high competition in the Spanish market hit earnings last year.
The state-controlled former monopoly struggles to maintain strong upward momentum in revenue, caught between the need to upgrade networks while contending with competition in a fragmented European telecoms market. 
Orange expects earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation after leases (EBITDAaL) to grow by 2.5% to 3% in 2022, compared with a drop of 0.5% in 2021.
It also expects cash flow from telecoms activities to be higher than 2.9 billion euros, an improvement from the 2.4 billion cashed in last year. 
Revenues were up 0.8% in 2021 from a year earlier to 42.5 billion euros. 
Orange braces for a governance revamp as its new chief executive officer, Christel Heydemann, is slated to take over on April 4 following a 12-year tenure of Stephane Richard.
Richard's departure was precipitated after a court convicted him of complicity of misuse of public funds. Richard denies any wrongdoing. 
Heydemann will take the reins of the group, whose stock performance is lagging behind peers, as it pursues a turnaround of the Spanish division and amid high market expectations for deals in the mobile towers business. 
In a call with reporters, Chief Financial Officer Ramon Fernandez said Orange's Totem division, which regroups about 26,000 tower sites in France and Spain, was well positioned if any deal were to happen this year. 
He confirmed the target of a return to core operating growth in Spain, its second-biggest market after France, in 2023.

Orange maintained its dividend policy of 0.70 euro per share in 2022 and confirmed an organic cash flow from telecom activities of at least 3.5 billion euros next year.

The largest insurer in the Netherlands said favourable business conditions almost doubled its operation capital generation in the last six months of 2021 to 804 million euros.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian retail conglomerate Wesfarmers Ltd said first-half profit slumped and cut its dividend after most of its businesses were hit by successive COVID-19 outbreaks and supply chain upheaval, sending its shares sharply lower.
Normally seen by investors as a strategic advantage, the conglomerate's diversified interests proved a weakness at a time when Australia spent months under lockdown due to the Delta variant, followed by spiralling worker absenteeism as the Omicron strain saw case numbers explode.
The company's star unit which brings 70% of profit, home improvement chain Bunnings, produced a rare profit decline as inflation linked to supply chain blockages pushed up costs of core materials like timber and steel, while government-mandated store closures effectively froze physical retail.
CEO Rob Scott said that while pandemic restrictions were being lifted ""we're certainly seeing inflation pressure across the board"".
Aside from company costs, fuel prices remained ""at very high levels and that also does have an impact on families as they're trying to balance the budget"", he told journalists.
For the six months to end-December, overall net profit fell 14.2% to A$1.21 billion ($871 million), in line with its previous guidance.
But that relied on property sales and a better-than-expected contribution from its industrial chemicals unit. The company declared an interim dividend of 80 cents, from 88 cents in the previous December half.
Shares of Perth-based Wesfarmers, Australia's 11th-largest company by market capitalisation, were down 7% by mid-afternoon, their biggest decline in two years and against a 1% gain on the broader market.
""The result is the harbinger of things to come in traditional retail land,"" said James McGlew, executive director of corporate stockbroking at Argonaut Securities, which holds Wesfarmers shares.
""Conditions are challenging and the online retailers are biting at and eating the market share of the old-world players. The drop in dividend has not been well-received, although predictable given the results.""
While the headline result was flagged, ""we view the detailed release as negative"", wrote analysts at brokerage Jefferies in a client note.
Wesfarmers's stationery supplies chain, Officeworks, an initial beneficiary of the pandemic-driven rush to working from home, saw profit decline 18% due to stock shortages and store closures.

Its discount department store unit Kmart, which is unrelated to the U.S. Kmart and includes Target-branded stores, had the biggest profit decline, down 63%, due to the same factors. The unit lost about a quarter of its store trading days in the period.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Kyndryl, the former infrastructure services business of  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), signed a deal with Nokia (NYSE:NOK) to help automate factories by bringing in cloud computing and artificial intelligence over wireless networks.
After getting spun off from IBM in November, Kyndryl has started building its wireless network business and has already signed pacts with cloud providers such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
The separation from IBM was important because it was difficult to go and announce big partnerships with companies that would be viewed as IBM's competitors, Paul Savill, Kyndryl's Global Practice Leader, said in an interview.
""The announcement we are making with Nokia is an important one for us because it's kind of our beachhead announcement, and it's where we are going to start building our (private network) business,"" he said.
Private 5G networks in particular bring high-speed connections to businesses as they don't share bandwidth with others, making it ideal for applying technologies such as machine learning, robotics and artificial intelligence.
The global private 5G network market is expected to reach $14.28 billion by 2028, according to Grand View Research. 
Nokia, which has its own set of partnerships and working on providing private 5G gear, has more than 400 customers and is looking to jointly target Kyndryl's 4,000 business customers.

""Manufacturing is by far the largest market... we estimate about 10 million factory sites,"" Chris Johnson head of Nokia's enterprise business said in an interview.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - As a depleted Singapore Airshow winds down, delegates reported growing optimism as the hard-hit Asian aerospace market begins to recover despite emerging concerns around labour shortages, rising costs and supply chain challenges.
Organisers had estimated attendance of more than 13,000 ahead of the four-day show - still a shadow of previous years - but attendees said that even on Tuesday, the busiest day, only a few thousand people appeared to be at the show. Final numbers are yet to be compiled, organisers said.
Still, repeat visitors such as Eric Noel, an executive at a flight training centre in Arizona, said the atmosphere was livelier than the last show in February 2020, when late exhibitor dropouts due to the emergence of COVID-19 left empty spaces and half-finished booths, giving an eerie feel to the display hall at a time of significant market uncertainty.
Attendees at the show on Thursday ventured outside into the scorching midday sun to watch the final set of flying displays, including a flyby of a U.S. B-52 bomber, a design that first flew in the 1950s.
This year's show was the largest event of any kind in Singapore since the start of the pandemic, though the low turnout was a prime example of the devastating effect that strict health and border controls have had on the aviation industry over the last two years. 
Yet there is optimism about a reopening in Asia, with host country Singapore on Wednesday announcing an opening to quarantine travel from more countries after an initial pause when the Omicron variant emerged late last year.
""People want to get back face to face because we have all figured out Zoom is fine, but it doesn't really make it happen,"" Domhnal Slattery, chief executive of aircraft lessor Avolon, said at the show. 
His firm on Wednesday signed a deal to lease at least 100 flying taxis to AirAsia Aviation Group, which aims to launch an air ridesharing business in Southeast Asia.
With passenger travel down during the pandemic, Asian airlines have relied on the cargo market for survival, and freight was the star of the show in terms of major deals. 
Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) on Wednesday finalised an order for seven Airbus A350 freighters, while Etihad Airways placed a provisional order for seven of the same model.
Singapore Technologies Engineering also racked up more orders for passenger-to-freighter conversions, a business that has helped keep its hangars and workforce occupied during the slowdown in passenger travel.
On the defence side, there were no major deals but manufacturers were hopeful of a rebound as Asian countries emerge from the economic rubble of COVID-19 and look for cost-effective ways to upgrade their militaries.
As demand begins to bounce back, there are growing concerns about cost inflation and difficulties in the supply chain, for both commercial and defence manufacturers.
Sean Padfield, senior vice president, aerospace at seatbelt manufacturer SCHROTH Safety Products said his lead times for parts from his company's suppliers had doubled, making it harder to meet customer commitments.
""We're really trying to smooth out by adding some robustness to our supply chain, like having multiple suppliers for the same parts,"" he said on the sidelines of the show. ""But one thing we realised in the aviation space, some of these parts are so specialised, it takes a long time to get another supplier up and running to deliver at the same quality and quantity.""

Other industry challenges revolve around labour after major workforce cuts made when demand collapsed in 2020, leading led some workers to retire or change industries.
""There is a general labour shortage and the only way to get labour back to work is higher rates,"" said Kailash Krishnaswamy, senior vice president of aftermarket services at Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR). ""Where we have the opportunity we are trying to pass off that pricing to the customer. We are trying to build in automation where needed if possible.""

1557,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 11:46PM ET</span>",FAA administrator who oversaw Boeing 737 MAX return resigning,"By David Shepardson and Eric M. Johnson
WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) -The head of the Federal Aviation Administration who oversaw the return of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX after two crashes grounded the plane, and the agency's zero tolerance toward unruly passengers, will resign on March 31, the agency said on Wednesday.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson, who took over in August 2019, has faced criticism over the standoff between aviation and telecommunications industries over the deployment of the 5G wireless spectrum.
Dickson, 64, a former Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) executive and pilot, was appointed by former President Donald Trump and is about half-way through his five-term as the head of the 45,000-employee agency that oversees U.S. airspace.
In late 2020, Dickson personally flew the 737 MAX after requiring Boeing to make training and software improvements before he allowed it to return to operations and has repeatedly said Boeing must do more to improve.
He has also taken a tough line with Boeing on a number of safety issues as the FAA implements reforms to aircraft certification mandated by Congress after the 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people.
Representative Sam Graves, the top Republican on the House Transportation Committee, said Dickson worked ""to restore public confidence in our aviation system while implementing important bipartisan improvements to the aircraft certification process.""
Dickson, who previously served in the U.S. Air Force, said his decision was for family reasons.
""After sometimes long and unavoidable periods of separation from my loved ones during the pandemic, it is time to devote my full time and attention to them,"" Dickson wrote in an email to staff.
But Dickson has faced criticism from people inside the Biden administration over the 5G aviation standoff, as well as from the wireless industry. Airline CEOs on Jan. 17 had warned of a ""catastrophic"" aviation crisis that could have grounded almost all traffic because of the 5G deployment. 
Hours before the planned Jan. 19 deployment, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) agreed to delay deploying about 510 5G wireless towers near airports, but that did not prevent dozens of countries from canceling flights to the United States because of concern that 5G signals could interfere with airplane systems, and it cast the U.S. regulatory system in an ugly light.
'SKILLED CAPTAIN'
Dickson this month conceded before a House panel that the 5G ""process did not serve anyone well ... It did not serve the aviation community well, certainly the FAA, and it also did not serve the telecommunications industry well. And we certainly need to do better as a country.""
Dickson has taken a hard line in the face of a dramatic spike in unruly passenger cases since early 2021 and has appeared in video messages at airports around the United States urging passengers to behave.
Under Dickson, the FAA has issued new drone rules and overseen a dramatic jump in commercial spaceflights as he emphasized safe operations. On Monday, the FAA said it was extending its environmental review of a proposed SpaceX program in Texas.
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Dickson ""has been the FAA’s steady and skilled captain, and his tenure has been marked by steadfast commitment to the FAA’s safety mission.""
It is not clear who the Biden administration will tap but some congressional and airline officials say one possibility is C. B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger, who was confirmed in December to be U.S. representative on the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations air safety body.
Sullenberger rose to fame in 2009 as a commercial pilot who safely landed an Airbus A320 on New York's Hudson (NYSE:HUD) River after hitting a flock of geese - known as the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" flight.

Dickson has repeatedly noted the U.S. aviation safety record - no major U.S. commercial airline has had a fatal crash since 2009.
""Safety is a journey, not a destination,"" Dickson said. ""Our mantra must be continuous improvement, because what we did yesterday will simply not be good enough tomorrow.""

Shimao proposed to creditors on Wednesday it would repay the onshore trust loan in states in the next three years, of which 1.3 billion yuan ($205.36 million) would become due on Thursday, sources told Reuters.
The trust loan was used to finance a large mixed-used development in Shenzhen. Financial news website Cailianshe reported 178 unsold apartments in the development have been frozen by judicial authorities. 
Hong Kong-listed shares of the company eased 1.4% by noon, narrowing from a 3% drop earlier. This compared to a 1.1% loss in the Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index.
Shimao's plan to extend loan payments is yet to be approved by creditors, and some creditors said they were not happy with the proposal that did not offer any credit enhancement. 
The Shanghai-based developer, which defaulted on a trust loan last month, has been scrambling to extend debt with creditors and dispose of assets to raise funds. 

The firm also said in the Wednesday meeting that it was in talks, facilitated by the Shenzhen government, with state-owned enterprises to introduce strategic investors in the development.

(Reuters) - Australia's biggest casino operator Crown Resorts Ltd reported on Thursday a third consecutive half-yearly loss, as long spells of pandemic-related restrictions and regulatory costs continued to hurt operations.
The company, which recently backed a $6.5 billion offer from private-equity firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc, is struggling to rebuild its image following multiple enquiries after allegations it enabled money laundering at its casinos.
A Victoria state enquiry last October found Crown unfit to hold a gambling licence in Melbourne, but allowed it to run its biggest-earning casino under supervision.
Crown posted a net loss of A$196.3 million ($141.22 million) for the six months ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of A$120.9 million a year earlier.
It said the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant in Victoria and New South Wales, home to its casinos in Melbourne and Sydney, respectively, hurt its trading performance at the start of 2022.
Crown's domestic casinos in Melbourne and Perth are back in operation as it looks to bounce back from pandemic-driven closures.
However, its gambling operations in Sydney are still suspended after an inquiry in 2021 found it had alleged dealings with organised crime groups among other governance failings.
""While we do not underestimate current headwinds facing Crown, there is growing confidence we have turned the corner,"" said Chief Executive Officer Steven McCann.
He added that the Blackstone deal reinforced the ""attractiveness"" of its business and assets.
Earlier this week, Crown backed a buyout from Blackstone, giving billionaire James Packer an exit route from the company.
Smaller peer Star Entertainment Group Ltd's first-half loss widened to A$73.7 million from A$51.2 million a year earlier, hurt by pandemic-related property shutdowns.

Shares of Crown and Star were flat in early trading, while the broader market advanced 0.6%.

1561,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 10:11PM ET</span>",Tesla sued over alleged suspension failure in fatal Florida crash,"San Francisco (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has been sued over an alleged suspension failure in a crash that killed the driver and a passenger in Florida last year and sparked a federal probe.
The 2021 Model 3 vehicle had a ""defective and unreasonably dangerous suspension that may cause loss of control during ordinary and foreseeable driving conditions,"" according to the lawsuit filed by the driver's family in a Florida state court last week. The case was first reported by legal information site Plainsite.
The lawsuit said that four days before the accident in September, the driver, Nicholas G. Garcia, brought the vehicle to a Tesla Store due to problems with ""controllability/steering, suspension, battery and electronic system, and an ability to open the doors.""
The lawsuit accused a Tesla service manager of ""negligently"" inspecting the affected model.
The National Transportation Safety Board, which is probing the accident, said in a preliminary report in November that the car was speeding before crashing into two trees and catching fire.
Garcia, 20, and front-seat passenger Jazmin Alcala, 19, sustained injuries and ""traumatic life ending burns,"" according to a Coral Gables Police Department report. 
The lawsuit seeks damages of over $30,000 each from Tesla and the service manager.
Tesla was not immediately available for comment.
The vehicle's under-body struck the roadway after going over a ""hump"" in the center of an intersection, according to the police report seen by Reuters. The driver lost control and drove off the roadway before the collision.

In October, Tesla recalled nearly 3,000 2020-2021 Model Y and 2019-2021 Model 3 vehicles in the United States over a suspension issue. Tesla recalled 21,599 China-made Model Ys in December, saying a suspension link may fall out of the steering knuckle under extreme stress conditions.
In 2020, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into around 115,000 Model S and Model X vehicles over a front suspension safety issue.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed on Thursday morning, as some countries cast doubt on Russian claims that its troops are withdrawing from the border with Ukraine.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.27% by 9:24 PM ET (2:24 AM GMT). Trade data released earlier in the day showed that exports grew 9.6% year-on-year, while imports grew 39.6% year-on-year, in January. The adjusted trade balance was at -JPY930 billion ($8.05 billion), while the trade balance was at -JPY2.19 trillion.
South Korea’s KOSPI jumped 1.37%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.69%, with data released earlier in the day showing that the employment change was 12,900 and the full employment change was -17,000, in January. The unemployment rate was 4.2%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.22%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.03% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.32%.
Safe-haven assets, including U.S. Treasuries and the Japanese yen, benefitted from investors’ decreased risk appetite. The U.S. led views that Russia had not withdrawn any troops, but instead added as many as 7,000 troops to encircle Ukraine. However, Russia continues to deny any plans to attack Ukraine and dismissed the U.S. claims as “hysteria”.
Investors also digested the minutes from the last U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, released on Wednesday. The minutes showed that the central bank would hike interest rates soon and continue to monitor inflation levels. However, they provided very few new clues on balance-sheet runoff plans.
Some were concerned that tighter monetary policy could impact the economic recovery and destabilize markets even further.
“The fear that investors had coming into the release of the minutes was a very aggressive conversation potentially around balance-sheet reduction or maybe more chatter about a 50-basis point rate hike in March,” John Hancock Investment Management co-chief investment strategist Emily Roland told Reuters.
“I don’t think that any of those fears of even more aggressive hawkish language came through in today’s minutes.”
In the latest comments from Fed officials, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said aggressive interest rates hikes would risk a recession, adding “my caution to my colleagues and myself is let’s not overdo it.” Kashkari’s colleagues, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard will speak later in the day.
More Fed officials, including Charles Evans, Christopher Waller, and Lael Brainard, will speak at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum on Friday.
Across the Atlantic, the European Central Bank is “quite likely” to hike interest rates in 2022 but should not “rock the boat” as it tightens monetary policy, according to Governing Council member Martins Kazaks. G-20 finance ministers and central bank governors will also meet from Feb. 17 to 18."

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Walmart's Mexico unit on Wednesday said its fourth-quarter net profit grew more than 5% from the year-earlier period with the gross margin helped by new business lines, even as higher expenses ate into earnings.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) de Mexico, the biggest retailer in Mexico, said its net profit rose to 13.3 billion pesos ($646.3 million) from the prior October-to-December period. Revenue increased 9.5% to reach 214.6 billion pesos.
However, the company also reported a more than 13% jump in costs, and its EBITDA margin fell to 11% from 11.4% a year before.
""We're seeing an increase in the cost of doing business in areas such as salaries, along with strategic investments,"" Walmex said in a report. 
Analysts at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) said Walmex shares were likely to underperform on Thursday, noting that its earnings before interests, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) came in at 23.6 billion pesos, which the bank said was 5% below consensus.
""2021 was tough to predict in every aspect, even more so on the e-commerce front,"" Chief Executive Guilherme Loureiro said in an online presentation accompanying the results report.
The retailer stressed positive performance in online shopping after an uncertain year in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.
E-commerce net sales increased 24% in the fourth quarter and made up 1.2% of total sales growth. They now represent almost 5% of sales in Mexico compared with 1.5% in 2019, before the pandemic spurred a jump in online shopping.
Investments in 2021 included converting 75 Superama grocery stores into the Walmart Express format, part of more than 20 billion pesos the company spent in 2021, up 22% from the year before. 
Nonetheless, the company spent 8% less than planned because it decided to delay some logistics projects until this year, it said.
Walmart Express's rebranding dampened the growth of same-store sales, but it is 85% completed, the Citigroup analysts said.
The company said in a report that same-store sales were solid across Mexico and Central America, and new businesses such as advertising platform Walmart Connect and rental income helped the gross margin, which grew 10 basis points to just over 23%. 
Another brokerage, Mexico's Intercam, said Walmex results had fallen short because of a 450 million peso expense related to the adjustment to the royalties paid by the Central American region to Walmart.
Walmex executives reiterated that the company is considering what it has called ""strategic alternatives"" to its operations in Central America, as announced last month. 
However, they said the process is still just beginning and there was still the possibility of not executing any changes at all.
The company continued its expansion in physical stores too, opening 51 sites in the quarter in its main Mexico market. The retailer opened 131 locations in the full year.

Executives said the company would focus on productivity and managing expenses to compensate for ongoing costs, including planned investments.

1564,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 09:15PM ET</span>","Third Point sees more value in Amazon, likes some 'old' tech stocks","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) -Hedge fund Third Point LLC said it added new positions and bulked up on names it already owned when markets sold off earlier this year and said that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is at an ""inflection point"" that should lead to a higher share price.
The New York-based firm, whose investments are closely watched by rivals, also said certain technology stocks often referred to as ""old"" tech like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) ""deserve a second look.""
Third Point, which oversees roughly $18 billion, has invested in Intel and Amazon for some time but said it had ""significantly increased"" the size of its investment in Amazon recently, betting new management will move the company forward with new initiatives.
Third Point's founder, billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, wrote about the moves in a letter sent to shareholders on Wednesday evening and reviewed by Reuters.
The outlook for Amazon, valued at $1.6 trillion, was described in the letter as especially bright, as Loeb expects some of the excess costs associated with the coronavirus pandemic, including labor shortages and supply chain disruptions, to disappear as the environment normalizes.
He wrote that he was happy to see Amazon's board buy back shares in January for the first time in a decade, and expects that Amazon may start returning more capital to shareholders.
Loeb also applauded the company's decision to break out advertising revenue and detail capital expenditures by category, calling the steps ""shareholder friendly moves"" as the company's new CEO, Andy Jassy, makes his mark.
The letter called it rare for an investors to get to buy a company like Amazon at a 30% to 40% discount to what it should be worth before an expected uptick in growth that should give Amazon ""an almost unlimited runway of potential to compound in value."" 
Amazon's stock price surged during the pandemic in 2020 as people avoided shopping in stores, but grew less forcefully last year, laying the groundwork for Third Point to add to its position.
On a call with investors held earlier in the day, Loeb said the market is not fully recognizing the value of Amazon's two businesses; the e-commerce business and its Amazon Web Services cloud business, a person familiar with the content of the call said.
Third Point also invested in IT services company Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and is betting that its market share gains will ""sustainably accelerate"" amid growing demand for IT services and shifts to digital transformation.
Loeb also praised Intel's new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who was appointed early last year after Third Point pushed for changes and said the company appears to have ""turned the corner"" with talent coming back, an improving product suite and a willingness to invest for growth.

Last year the firm reported a 22.7% gain in the Third Point Offshore fund, even though the fund lost 5.2% during the last quarter.
Electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive, which listed shares last year, was a big winner during the last quarter and Third Point expanded its holdings when the share price dipped below the $78 IPO price.

Apple will hold its annual shareholder meeting in the first week of March.
""There are significant concerns regarding the design and magnitude of the equity award made to CEO Cook in FY21... Half of the award lacks performance criteria,"" ISS said in a letter on Wednesday. 
Cook took home $3 million in salary in 2021. In addition, he received $82.3 million in stock awards, $12 million for hitting Apple's targets, $1.4 million for air travel, 401(k) plan, insurance premiums and others. 
In total, he earned $98.7 million in 2021, compared with $14.8 million a year earlier.
He received 333,987 restricted stock units, in his first stock grant since 2011 as part of a long-term equity plan. He will be eligible to receive additional units in 2023.
ISS valued Cook's 2021 equity award at $75 million. His pay was 1,447 times that of the average employee at the tech giant, according to a filing disclosed in January. 

""Half of the $75 million award is purely time-based, and the award would continue to vest in full in the event of his retirement,"" ISS wrote. 
Apple declined to comment and referred to the company's proxy filing detailing Cook's performance-based compensation.

(Reuters) -Chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp on Wednesday forecast current-quarter revenue above analysts' estimates, banking on strong demand for data centers.
But flat gross margins from the previous quarter and concern about Nvidia's exposure to the crypto market pushed shares down 2.8% in after-hours trading.
Nvidia expects first-quarter revenue of about $8.1 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $7.29 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Data center revenue grew 71% to a record $3.26 billion in the fourth quarter.
Chief Executive Jensen Huang also told analysts on a call that business was constrained by supply but he expected that to improve.
With tech firms venturing into the ""metaverse"" and a spike in demand for data centers, revenue is surging for Nvidia, the world's largest maker of graphic and artificial intelligence chips, and for other chip makers.
Nvidia reported fourth-quarter revenue of $7.64 billion, a record, compared with estimates of $7.42 billion. Its net income rose to about $3 billion in the fourth quarter from $2.46 billion a year earlier.
Still, the company said it sold $550 million in crypto-specific cards in fiscal 2022 ended Jan. 30, and only $24 million in the fourth quarter. Fourth-quarter gaming revenue was a record $3.42 billion, up 37% from a year ago. 
""A meaningful part of its gaming sales do include crypto-mining which we think could be volatile. Our most recent industry check does indicate a significant weakness in crypto-mining demand,"" said KinNgai Chan, analyst at Summit Insights Group.
Chan also said he was disappointed that Nvidia's gross margin did not rise in the fourth quarter from the third, despite the data center business outgrowing other units. Gross margin in the fourth quarter remained unchanged at 67.0% from the previous quarter.
The results come on the heels of SoftBank Group Corp's collapsed deal to sell chip designer Arm to Nvidia due to regulatory hurdles. 
Huang told analysts on the earnings call that Nvidia nevertheless is moving ahead in using the Arm architecture in its products. It is a licensee of the technology, and Nvidia aims to make Arm-based CPUs, the traditional brains of computers, to complement the graphics processors for which it is known.
""We're just thrilled that Arm is now growing into robotics and autonomous vehicles and cloud computing and super computing,"" said Huang. ""In all these different applications, we intend to bring the full spectrum of Nvidia's accelerated computing platform to Nvidia Arm CPUs."" 
Meanwhile, chip-making equipment supplier Applied Materials Inc (NASDAQ:AMAT) also posted record quarterly revenue on Wednesday, driven by customers including Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
Applied Materials' chief executive, Gary Dickerson, said the supply environment remains challenging and the company is doing everything it can to deliver for customers. The company expected second-quarter revenue of $6.35 billion, marginally below analysts' estimates, according to Refinitiv data.

""Since we are already close to being sold out for the year, we also have a positive growth outlook for 2023,"" Dickerson told analysts on a conference call, adding demand is very strong and spending on wafer fabrication equipment could reach $100 billion in 2022. 
Applied Materials' shares rose more than 3% in after-hours trading.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) convinced a California federal judge on Wednesday to throw out a lawsuit accusing the tech giant of ripping off another company's multiracial emoji and violating its intellectual property rights.
Cub Club Investment LLC didn't show that Apple copied anything that was eligible for copyright protection, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria said.
Chhabria gave Cub Club a chance to amend its lawsuit but said he was ""skeptical"" it could succeed based on several differences between its emoji design and Apple's.
Texas-based Cub Club's 2020 lawsuit said that its founder Katrina Parrott created and launched the ""iDiversicons"" app in 2013, calling it the world's first emoji with diverse skin tones.
Cub Club said Parrott discussed a potential partnership with Apple representatives in 2014, and that Apple created its own set of multiracial emoji after declining to work with her. It said Apple's emoji infringed its copyrights and trademark rights, arguing they copied iDiversicons' five skin tones and other features.
Chhabria said in a Wednesday order that even if the complaint was true, Apple at most copied Cub Club's unprotectable ""idea"" of diverse emoji. 
""There aren't many ways that someone could implement this idea,"" Chhabria said. ""After all, there are only so many ways to draw a thumbs up.""
Cub Club only owns weak copyrights in the unique expressive aspects of its designs, and Apple's emojis weren't similar enough to infringe them, Chhabria said, citing differences in their coloring, shapes, and other features.
Chhabria also found that Cub Club didn't have protectable trademark rights for its emoji.
Apple and attorneys for both companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 

The case is Cub Club Investment LLC v. Apple Inc, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 3:21-cv-06948.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street bounced off session lows Wednesday with the S&P 500 crossing into positive territory by the closing bell after the U.S. Federal Reserve released meeting minutes, which said that while the central bank intends to begin raising interest rates to combat inflation, its decisions would be made on a meeting-by-meeting basis.
The minutes showed that while policymakers agreed that it would ""soon be appropriate"" to raise the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate from its near-zero level, they would re-asses the rate hike timeline at each meeting.
""The fact the Fed was not more hawkish than previously thought seems to have rescued stocks for the moment, anyway,"" said Lou Brien, strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago. ""The market was worried the aggressive policy stance of (St. Louis Fed President James) Bullard was more widespread but this doesn't seem to be the case.""
All three major U.S. stock indexes spent most the session deep in negative territory, as investors contended with shifting geopolitical tensions and a raft of data suggesting that the U.S. economy is heating up, thereby bolstering the Federal Reserve's case for aggressive rate tightening. 
But after the release of the Fed minutes, the indexes gyrated, eventually erasing losses. The Nasdaq and the Dow closed modestly lower.
""It seems like the Fed didn’t rock the boat too much,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""It didn’t throw that hawkish curve ball we saw six weeks ago and that was a relief to a lot of investors."" 
A raft of economic data on Tuesday showed a sharp rebound in retail sales, stronger than expected industrial output, and core import prices reaching an all-time high. 
""Today's retail sales number was extremely strong,"" Detrick added. ""It confirms the consumer is still very healthy and that's a good sign for the economy going forward."" 
The United States and NATO are still concerned about Russian troops near the Ukrainian border, refuting Russia's claim on Tuesday that it was withdrawing troops and questioning President Vladimir Putin's stated desire to negotiate a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
Even so, geopolitical tensions appear to have abated somewhat.
""It might be a 'no news is good news' scenario,"" Detrick said. ""Global markets have calmed as the headline risk continues to decline over last two days.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 54.57 points, or 0.16%, to 34,934.27, the S&P 500 gained 3.94 points, or 0.09%, to 4,475.01 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 15.66 points, or 0.11%, to 14,124.10.
Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors posted gains on the day, with energy stocks enjoying the largest percentage gain. Tech and communication services were the only percentage losers, with financials flat on the day.
Shares of ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) tumbled 17.8% after the media conglomerate missed quarterly profit expectations.
Short-term rental company Airbnb advanced 3.6% following its better-than-expected first-quarter revenue forecast, driven by a strong rebound in travel demand.
 Devon Energy  Corp (NYSE:DVN) gained 4.7% after the oil producer reported fourth-quarter results above Wall Street estimates.
 Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) rose 1.2% after being selected to develop prototype next generation U.S. Marine Corps 5G communications.
Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) gained more than 5% in after-hours trading after the networking equipment maker beat quarterly revenue expectations.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.87-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.07-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 16 new 52-week highs and 7 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 45 new highs and 103 new lows.

The agreement lays out the election's timing and how to vote, the NLRB said, without providing details. According to labor organizer Christian Smalls, workers at Amazon's ""JFK8"" warehouse in Staten Island will vote in person March 25-30.
The news puts Amazon on track to face two closely watched labor elections in the same week. The NLRB on March 28 plans to start counting ballots from Alabama workers who are deciding whether to unionize in a re-run of last year's failed organizing campaign with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.
A majority vote to unionize at either facility would mark Amazon's first organized warehouse in the United States and a milestone for those seeking to invigorate the American labor movement.
In a statement, Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said the retailer is skeptical there are enough worker signatures in New York to justify a vote. ""But since the NLRB has decided the election will proceed, we want our employees to have their voices heard as soon as possible,"" she said.

Smalls, looking to create the Amazon Labor Union, said the election comes on the two-year anniversary of his and colleagues' protest of the company's pandemic protocols that led to his firing. Amazon has said he violated a paid COVID-19 quarantine.
The election agreement between Amazon and the New York workers still needs to be finalized, the NLRB said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday dismissed a proposed class action lawsuit by consumers who accused  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) of failing to disclose the presence of cancer-causing agents in Chantix before recalling the anti-smoking drug.
U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan found no plausible allegations that Pfizer had a duty to disclose that Chantix was contaminated by a type of carcinogen known as a nitrosamine, or was unfit to help consumers quit smoking. She also found no proof that Pfizer's labels were misleading. 
Plaintiffs Roslyn Harris, of Jersey City, New Jersey, and Mary Allen, of Warrensburg, New York, claimed that Chantix was ""worthless"" because of the contamination, and that they would not have bought the drug had they known about it.
A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Pfizer said it was pleased with the decision. ""We continue to stand behind the safety and efficacy of Chantix, which has helped millions of Americans quit cigarette smoking,"" it said in a statement.
Cote said that because Pfizer offered full rebates for unused Chantix, the lawsuit sought damages only for tablets that the plaintiffs consumed.
Pfizer began recalling Chantix last July, and extended the recall nationwide in mid-September.

The New York-based company won U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in 2006 for Chantix to help adults quit smoking. Sales dropped 57% last year, reflecting the recall, Pfizer said this month.
The case is Harris et al v Pfizer Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 21-06789.

The company forecast annual adjusted profit between $10.20 and $11.80 per share, above analysts' average estimate of $9.46 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Prices of potash - a crucial crop nutrient - are near multi-year highs in the United States and Brazil following Western economic sanctions against a major potash supplier in Belarus.
The company said it expected the supply issues to continue into 2022, including additional restrictions imposed on Belarus potash transported through Lithuania.
Its earnings last year also benefited from record global potash demand of around 70 million tonnes, helping Nutrien post a nearly fourfold jump in profit for the fourth quarter. 
The fertilizer maker expects strong corn and soybean prices, along with prospective crop margins that are well above the 10-year average, to encourage growers to invest in their crops.

It declared a quarterly dividend of 48 cents per share, an increase of 4% from a year earlier, and also announced a share repurchase of up to 10% of its public float.
On an adjusted basis, the company posted a profit of $2.47 per share, beating estimates of $2.35 per share.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A total of 80 unruly airplane passengers have been referred to the FBI for potential criminal prosecution, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Wednesday, as onboard disruptions rose sharply in 2021, many over COVID-19 mask requirements.
The U.S. Justice Department has pledged to take a tough line and some airlines and labor unions have called for a ""no-fly"" list that would ban passengers with a record of disruptions.
The increase in cases is tied to pandemic restrictions that have prompted friction on airplanes.
The FAA, which said last year it had referred 37 passengers to the FBI for review, said about 4,600 of the 6,400 unruly passenger reports it has received since the start of 2021 through Feb. 15 involve passengers not wearing a mask as required.
The Justice Department said Wednesday it was prosecuting a record number of passengers for interfering with flight crews.
In the 2019 budget year 20 defendants were charged, followed by 16 in 2020 and a record 21 in 2021. The department said 9 have been charged in the first four months of the current budget year.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) Chief Executive Ed Bastian this month asked U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland to place passengers convicted of on-board disruptions on a national ""no-fly"" list that would bar them from future travel on any commercial airline.
Bastian said the action would ""help prevent future incidents and serve as a strong symbol of the consequences of not complying with crew member instructions on commercial aircraft.""
Delta has placed nearly 1,900 people on its ""no-fly"" list for refusing to comply with masking requirements and submitted more than 900 banned names to the Transportation Security Administration to pursue civil penalties, Bastian said.
Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA representing nearly 50,000 flight attendants at 17 airlines, said her union urges ""the creation of a centralized list of passengers who may not fly for a period of time after being fined or convicted of a serious incident.""
The Justice Department said it is giving priority to investigations and prosecutions of people who commit crimes that threaten the safety of passengers, flight crews and flight attendants.

Airlines have been holding discussions for months with federal agencies on the possibility of a nationwide ""no-fly"" list but there is no indication of any imminent action.
A group of eight Republican senators on Monday https://www.lummis.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/22.02.14-DOJ-Consolidated-No-Fly-List.pdf wrote Garland, criticizing Delta's ""no-fly"" proposal. They said it would ""result in a severe restriction on the ability of citizens to fully exercise their constitutional right to engage in interstate transportation.""

1575,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 06:31PM ET</span>","Explainer-Regulators are probing block trading on Wall St, but what is a block?","(Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether certain banks may have broken the rules by tipping off hedge funds ahead of large sales of shares, or ""block trades,"" a source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Tuesday.
The scrutiny is part of a years-long investigation into block trading by some of Wall Street's biggest players. Here is a primer on block trading. 
WHAT IS A BLOCK TRADE?
The New York Stock Exchange defines a block as at least 10,000 shares or a quantity of stock having a market value of $200,000 or more, whichever is less.
If a seller such as an individual shareholder, a company or a private equity firm were to put a large block onto a public exchange, the order, depending on its size and the liquidity of the underlying stock, could cause the price of the shares to move away from them, driving up costs. 
Instead, blocks are usually sent to a wholesale broker, such as an investment bank, that breaks the block into smaller ""child orders"" and executes them over time with the aim of minimizing the price impact, or shops the order to parties, like hedge funds, it thinks might be interested in taking the other side. 
WHAT HAS REGULATORS CONCERNED?
According to media reports, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice are investigating whether Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) may have broken the rules by tipping off hedge funds ahead of large sales of shares. Goldman and Morgan Stanley have not commented.
The SEC scrutiny is part of a long-running inquiry by the agency into block trading practices, predating the current administration, a source told Reuters.
The probe was given renewed focus after the spectacular collapse of family office Archegos Capital Management in March, which led to a number of large block trades that investors said caused material drops in the stocks of several companies that were linked to the investment fund, according to Bloomberg.
Goldman Sachs faces ongoing lawsuits over alleged insider trading related to its role in the unwinding of Archegos' fund.
Under current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, the regulator has focused on initiatives such as tightening up insider trading rules and improving market transparency, including around hedge fund and private equity disclosures.
HOW COMMON ARE BLOCK TRADES?

Broker-dealers frequently buy and sell blocks of shares, either on behalf of clients or as part of a hedging strategy, which are large enough to move underlying share prices. During times of volatility, block trades tend to be more common.
U.S. block trades hit a five-year high in terms of value last year, at $71.8 billion, according to data from Dealogic.

(Reuters) -DoorDash Inc reported quarterly revenue on Wednesday that beat estimates as food delivery demand showed no sign of slowing, indicating ordering habits have changed permanently, sending the company's shares up 24% after the bell.
Analysts have said people have grown accustomed to having food delivered to their doorsteps after frequently ordering in during the peak of the pandemic. They expect DoorDash and rivals Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats and Grubhub to show strong growth for several years even as people venture out more.
Uber's shares rose 1%, while the U.S.-listed shares of Grubhub parent Just Eat Takeaway.com NV gained 2%.
""It's very possible to eat at a restaurant and get delivery because we eat three times or more maybe per day, and that's over 100 shopping moments per month,"" Chief Executive Officer Tony Xu said on an earnings call.
In the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, higher-than-expected consumer retention and new customer growth helped DoorDash's revenue jump 34% to $1.30 billion and beat estimates of $1.28 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""To the extent that pent-up demand for dining in would eat into revenue, it would only serve to dampen some growth temporarily, not reverse it for long periods,"" Guru Hariharan, CEO of e-commerce management platform CommerceIQ, said.
San Francisco-based DoorDash also forecast first-quarter marketplace gross order value, the total value of all app orders and subscription fees, between $11.4 billion and $11.8 billion, versus $11.2 billion in the reported quarter.
Even in the face of inflation, consumers' persistent willingness to pay for the convenience of delivery should support demand, M Science analyst Matthew Goodman said.

DoorDash has also doubled down on non-restaurant offerings, including grocery, pet food and alcohol to attract more users. It has tied up with a number of retailers, including Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) and PetSmart.
DoorDash also forecast core earnings in a range of break-even to $500 million for fiscal 2022, compared with estimates of $455.1 million.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden is expected to ask Congress for a U.S. defense budget exceeding $770 billion for the next fiscal year as the Pentagon seeks to modernize the military, according to three sources familiar with the negotiations, eclipsing the record budget requests by former President Donald Trump.
Ongoing budget talks between Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the White House's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) have coalesced around a proposed defense request of higher than $770 billion for the 2023 fiscal year starting Oct. 1, the sources said. Negotiations are ongoing within the administration and the final amount could change before the budget request is made in the coming months, the sources added.
Two of the sources said that about $773 billion was going to be available for the Department of Defense and other needs would go on top of that, potentially pushing a total above $800 billion. 
The Pentagon referred queries to the OMB, which declined to comment.
The national defense ""top line"" budget includes the Pentagon's budget for spending on salaries, tanks and stealthy F-35 jets made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) as well as funds for the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons programs and defense-related activities at other agencies. 
The White House last week responded to the Pentagon's proposed budget request with a figure that was more or less on par with Austin's request, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Among the top priorities for this budget are shipbuilding, developing capabilities in space, missile warning and modernizing the nuclear ""triad"" of ballistic missile submarines, bombers and land-based missiles, one of the sources said.
The budget would benefit the biggest U.S. defense contractors including Lockheed,  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) and General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD). 
Another of the sources said that the nuclear modernization effort is seen as ""must pay"" in addition to Pentagon plans to continue to invest in research and development of weaponry to fight any potential future wars against China and Russia.
The Pentagon also plans to trim costs by retiring older weaponry like Littoral Combat Ships that are expensive to operate and older planes like the A-10, which the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan last year has made less essential because they are vulnerable to more sophisticated enemies. 

The national defense budget request crafted during Trump's final year in office was for $752.9 billion. Congress then increased that number by $25 billion, ultimately landing at $778 billion for fiscal 2022.
One of the sources said it is anticipated that Congress would once again increase the president's national defense budget request, but the 2023 budget cycle is only beginning. Biden's State of the Union address to Congress, scheduled for March 1, is viewed as the kickoff.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Marriott and Hilton, two of the biggest U.S. hotel chains, told investors they expect people to resume packing their bags for business and leisure this year at rates not seen since before the pandemic. 
Hotel and other travel-related companies delivered rosy outlooks in this week's quarterly results, citing rising vaccination rates and falling COVID-19 cases in the United States after the winter surge of the Omicron variant. 
Countries are also lifting travel restrictions, with Canada set to ease entry for fully vaccinated international travelers starting on Feb. 28.
Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) Inc's and Airbnb Inc's latest quarterly results topped Wall Street estimates, while  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (NYSE:HLT) Inc's revenue nearly doubled.
On Tuesday, Marriott CEO Anthony Capuano told investors that group cancellations increased late last year and this year due to Omicron. Now, cancellations have slowed and new group bookings are gaining momentum.
Capuano pointed to a Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) meeting in New York City last week as evidence of strong demand for U.S. group bookings as Omicron cases fall. The meeting involved 25,000 room nights across 11 Marriott properties.
Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) CEO Craig Billings said on Tuesday that customers at its Las Vegas resort are ""spending again with a vengeance.""
""2021 was the recovery year, and 2022 will push past COVID and become a strong growth year for the sector,"" said Jamie Lane, vice president of research at vacation rental research firm AirDNA.
In January, AirDNA recorded about 58,000 new short-term rentals in the United States, the most added since the start of the pandemic, and the number is growing daily, Lane said. AirDNA data also shows a 35% increase in short-term rental nights booked in the United States in January 2022 from the same period in 2019, and a 12% increase from 2019 globally.
Omicron-related disruptions to Hilton's business bookings were largely contained to the first quarter of 2022 with most events rescheduled for later in the year, Hilton CEO Christopher Nassetta told investors. The hospitality company expects group business bookings to accelerate through the rest of 2022.
Similarly, online travel agency  Expedia  Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE). reported last week that bookings have ""strongly rebounded"" since the Omicron surge.
LONGER STAYS
With many workers embracing the flexibility that comes with permanent remote work, Airbnb said people using its short-term rental site booked longer stays during the just-ended quarter. 
About half of the nights booked in the fourth quarter were for stays of one week or longer, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky told investors during the earnings call on Tuesday.
""People are spreading out to thousands of towns and cities, staying for weeks, months or even entire seasons at a time,"" Chesky said. ""People are less tethered to an office, so they can now live anywhere.""

Erin Francis-Cummings, CEO of tourism market research firm Destination Analysts, said the rosy outlook for travel is ""not a short-term blip,"" adding the shift to longer stays is likely to be sustained.
She cautioned, however, that future COVID variants and surges could dampen the outlook, even if just temporarily.

Shares of the company rose about 5% in extended trading after the networking firm announced a $15 billion increase to its stock repurchase program and reported better-than-expected quarterly results.
The company, which sells routers, switches, security services and software products, has been heavily investing in its cloud offerings to keep up with the pandemic-fueled surge in demand for its videoconferencing platform Webex, virtual private network and cybersecurity products.
""We're seeing progress as we drive the continued shift to more software and subscription revenue delivering growth,"" Chief Financial Officer Scott Herren told analysts.
The company, however, warned that pandemic-induced supply challenges, which have added to costs, would persist in the second half of its fiscal year. 
Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is reportedly making a $20 billion bid for Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) Inc, which makes software for searching and monitoring big data gathered from websites, applications and devices. 
""(The buyback) perhaps signals that Splunk is not going to happen because if they're giving $15 billion back, I would think they're not going to spend $20 billion on a company,"" said Scott Raynovich, principal analyst at Futuriom.
Executives on the call declined to comment to an analyst's question on the deal and said the company was ""constantly evaluating potential opportunities.""

Cisco forecast fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings between $3.41 and $3.46 per share, compared with prior projection of $3.38-$3.45. Revenue is expected to grow between 5.5% and 6.5% versus prior forecast of 5% to 7%.

1581,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 05:51PM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs to refresh targets and set path to growth,"By Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) will on Thursday update its main financial targets and detail growth plans for the next three to five years, hoping to win over investors yet to be convinced by its long-term strategy.
Wall Street's premier investment bank is reshaping itself after a turbulent decade during which profit at its core trading businesses was crimped by tougher regulations brought in after the 2007-09 financial crisis. 
The firm plans to upgrade some existing targets and add new ones, people familiar with the plan say. Key profitability targets will be lifted and new goals set for the growth of the bank's nascent consumer business. Reuters reported on the upcoming targets in December.
The bank achieved a record profit last year, helped by a deal making and trading bonanza fueled partly by the Federal Reserve pumping liquidity into capital markets to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The favorable market backdrop has helped Goldman track ahead of key goals set at its first-ever investor day in January 2020. At that time, Chief Executive David Solomon set out his vision for rejuvenating a bank which had underperformed rivals since the 2007-09 financial crisis. 
The initial plan aimed to diversify Goldman into businesses with more predictable revenue streams, such as consumer and transaction banking, and reshape its trading and investment banking businesses to produce more consistent revenues.
Two years on from investor day, Solomon will look to build on those foundations when he provides an update on the firm's strategy and goals at a conference hosted by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in Florida, people familiar with the matter say.
Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
The presentation comes at a critical time. The value of the bank's shares more than tripled between the start of the pandemic in March 2020, hitting an all-time high on August 27 2021. However, they have declined by 14% since as analysts questioned how the business will perform when market conditions normalize. Rival  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is down 4% in that period while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is down 5%. 
Goldman's shares currently trade at 1.3 times the value of the bank's assets while Morgan Stanley, traditionally its biggest rival, trades at close to 2 times its book value.
That leaves Solomon facing a battle to convince investors his strategy will lead to a re-rating over time.
""Morgan Stanley's well-diversified and proven business lines put it way ahead of Goldman's work-in-process diversification plays in consumer finance, credit cards, wholesale lending and payments,"" said David Hendler, founder of Viola Risk Advisers. 
The bank will set new medium term return-on-equity (RoE) and return-on-tangible-equity (RoTE) targets of at least 15%, compared with the previous goals of 13% and 14% respectively, Reuters reported in December. 
Goldman will outline new growth targets for its consumer business, people familiar with the matter say. However, it will no longer set a target for when that business will break even. Instead, it is focusing on generating top-line growth. 
The consumer business, named Marcus after the bank's founder, launched in 2016. It was originally expected to make a profit in 2021, but the cost of investing in new products and acquisitions have pushed that timing back.
In an effort to accelerate the growth of its consumer business, Goldman purchased GreenSky, a fintech platform that provides home improvement loans, last September in a $2.2 billion deal. It is also investing in the launch of a Marcus checking account later this year.
The bank is also trying to make its core trading and investment banking revenues more durable.
In trading, it is doing more business with the top 100 institutional clients globally. That has helped it pick up market share which executives are confident it will hold on to.
In investment banking, Goldman has added to its additional strength in advising blue-chip companies on deals by taking a bigger market share advising mid-market companies.
The bank has also grown its asset management and wealth management businesses.

Those initiatives justify the bank raising its medium-term RoTE target despite trading and investment banking activity slowing, people within the bank say.

(Reuters) -Thailand's interest in  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT)'s F-35 stealth fighters is genuine, but clearance to buy the jets is a matter for the U.S. government, a senior executive from the defence giant said on Wednesday.
Speaking on the sidelines of the Singapore Airshow, Tim Cahill, Lockheed Martin's senior vice president for Global Business, confirmed Thailand had expressed interest, but said there was ""nothing official that I am aware of that has come relative to that.""
In January, the Southeast Asian country's air force set aside about $413 million for procuring four of the jets. Earlier, Air Chief Marshal Napadej Dhupatemiya said Thailand would be interested in buying as many as eight F-35s.
""This will be a U.S. government policy decision,"" Cahill said. ""I think there is some promise there, but I honestly don't know where the U.S. government will come down on that.""

A U.S. State Department spokesperson said it does not confirm or comment on proposed defence transfers or sales until they have been formally notified to Congress.
The F-35, one of the world's most advanced fighter aircraft, is considered a highly sensitive export, sold only to the United States' closest allies. In the Indo-Pacific region, only Australia, Japan, South Korea and Singapore fly the jet.

(Reuters) - Charlie Munger, the longtime business partner of Warren Buffett, on Wednesday said it is ""massively stupid"" for tensions to escalate between the United States and China, and separately said cryptocurrency should have been banned, calling it ""beneath contempt.""
Munger, 98, spoke while fielding nearly two hours of questions at the annual meeting of Daily Journal Corp, the Los Angeles newspaper publisher and provider of software to courthouses that he chairs.
He is better known as vice chairman of Buffett's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc since 1978. 
Munger is a longtime bull on China, spearheading Berkshire's investment in electric car maker BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF) and recently doubling Daily Journal's stake in e-commerce company  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.
But asked about political pressures from China, he said recent deterioration in U.S.-China relations wasn't justified by their different systems of government, or because one country does some things better than the other.
""We wish that China and the United States got along better,"" he said. ""Think about how massively stupid both China and the United States have been to allow the existing tensions to rise.... They should like us and we should like them.""
He showed no such mercy for cryptocurrency, saying he wished it had been banned from the start.
""I'm proud of the fact that I avoided it. It's like some venereal disease,"" Munger said.
""I just regard it as beneath contempt. Some people think it's modernity, and they welcome a currency that's so useful in extortions and kidnappings (and) tax evasion.""
Munger also predicted that Berkshire holding Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) will be ""really strong"" 50 years from now.
He said he thought incorrectly a half-century ago that would also be true for newspapers, and lamented their being displaced by media telling people on both sides of the political spectrum only what they want to hear.
""This is no substitute for Walter Cronkite and all those great newspapers of yesteryear,"" Munger said, referring to the legendary CBS News anchor.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index fell on Wednesday as a record drop in the shares of e-commerce heavyweight Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Inc offset gains for resource shares.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index ended down 118.91 points, or 0.55%, at 21,383.64. 
""Most of these tech companies coming into earnings, the bar was set pretty high,"" said Elvis Picardo, portfolio manager at Luft Financial, iA Private Wealth.
""Even if they met expectations, there was still disappointment they did not do more ... Shopify is the latest example of this.""
Shares of Shopify, which has the third-largest market capitalization on the TSX, fell 17.1% after the company forecast a slowing pace of revenue growth in the first half of the year and said it was ramping up spending on a network of fulfillment centers.
It was the biggest decline for the shares since the company went public in 2015, while the closing level was the lowest since May 2020.
The technology group was down 3.9%, while the consumer staples group was also a drag, ending 0.7% lower.
In contrast, the materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 1.8% as gold prices climbed.

It included a gain of 7.1% for Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) Corp after the miner announced a share repurchase of up to $1 billion and a bigger dividend payout as fourth-quarter results beat analysts' estimates. 
The energy sector was up 0.7% as oil prices rose. U.S. crude oil futures settled 1.7% higher at $93.66 a barrel, with investors weighing conflicting statements on the possible withdrawal of some Russian troops from around Ukraine.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil and gold rose on Wednesday after NATO and the United States said Russia was increasing its troop build-up near Ukraine, while a dovish reading of minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting helped stocks close mostly flat on Wall Street.
Stronger-than-expected U.S. retail sales data and higher inflation readings from Canada and Britain added to the outlook for tighter monetary policy worldwide, but geopolitical tensions kept markets for the most part focused on the Ukraine standoff.
Fed policymakers agreed it was time to raise interest rates but that any decision would depend on an analysis of inflation and other data each time they met, minutes from their two-day meeting in late January showed.
""The reading of the Fed minutes is less hawkish, less aggressive rate hikes, at least initially,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. 
""The minutes are little bit more dovish than we heard (Fed Chair Jerome) Powell talk in the post Fed meeting press conference in January,"" Ghriskey added.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.16%, the S&P 500 gained 0.09% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.11%. All 11 sectors of the S&P early in the session were higher, with the exception of the energy index, but stocks pared losses after the Fed minutes came out.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe reversed course to post a 0.32% gain, while its emerging markets index rose 1.23%.
Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) gains earlier in Asian equity markets on Tuesday's news that Russia was withdrawing some troops faded in the European session, with the STOXX 600 pan-European index ceding some early gains to close barely up 0.04%. 
NATO questioned Moscow's stated willingness to negotiate a solution to the crisis, one of the deepest in East-West relations in decades, and accused Russia of increasing its massive military build-up surrounding Ukraine.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken backed the assessment, an outlook that lifted the price of safe-haven gold and boosted crude oil along with related assets as supply would be further constrained by an invasion.
""There are not really any signs of de-escalation. That's going to put commodities likely on firmer footing given that extent supply and inventories are really low,"" said Bipan Rai, North America head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets.
U.S. crude futures rose $1.59 to settle at $93.66 a barrel, while Brent settled up $1.53 at $94.81.
The Russian ruble gained 0.64% to 75.12 per dollar as fears of immediate military action waned, for the moment.
Earlier, U.S. retail sales rebounded sharply in January amid a surge in purchases of motor vehicles and other goods, but higher prices could blunt the impact on economic growth this quarter. [L1N2UR17V]
Data showed retail sales rose 3.8% last month, almost double the consensus forecast by economists of a 2.0% gain. 
Spot gold, which on Tuesday hit the highest level since June 2021 at around $1,879 per ounce, added 0.8% to $1,867.51. 
U.S. gold futures settled down 0.8% at $1,871.50.
Inflation was still a market concern as data in Britain showed consumer prices increased at the fastest annual pace in nearly 30 years, reinforcing chances that the Bank of England will raise rates for a third meeting in a row.
Canada's annual inflation rate accelerated again in January to hit a fresh 30-year high of 5.1%, bolstering the case for a steady series of interest rate hikes.
U.S. Treasury and euro zone government bond yields extended their decline. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 0.5 basis points to 2.040%. 
The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, fell 3.4 basis points to 1.535%. Earlier it touched a low of 1.496%. 

The dollar index fell 0.215%, with the euro up 0.18% to $1.1376.

1589,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 04:46PM ET</span>",Ex-Goldman banker testifies 'greed and ambition' motivated 1MDB bribery,"By Luc Cohen and Jody Godoy
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) partner testified on Wednesday that ""greed and ambition"" drove his involvement in a bribery scheme that looted billions of dollars from Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund.
Tim Leissner, the former chief of Goldman's Southeast Asia operation, is a star witness in the criminal trial of Roger Ng, the bank's former head of investment banking in Malaysia. The trial began on Monday in federal court in Brooklyn.
Prosecutors have accused Ng, 49, of receiving millions of dollars in kickbacks for helping embezzle funds from 1MDB. Ng has pleaded not guilty to conspiring to launder money and to violate an anti-bribery law.
Leissner, 52, in 2018 pleaded guilty to similar charges and agreed to cooperate with the government's investigation.
Leissner said on the stand on Wednesday that Ng was Goldman's lead banker on 1MDB and had cultivated a relationship with Malaysian financier Jho Low starting in 2008, who was the key intermediary between the bank and 1MDB.
Bringing in 1MDB business to Goldman, which ultimately sold $6.5 billion in bonds for the fund and reaped $600 million in fees, ""instantaneously made us heroes"" within the bank, Leissner said.
""My greed and ambition took over,"" Leissner said, adding that the fallout from his actions had destroyed his life.
He also said bankers at Goldman were expected to be hired on every one of their clients' deals, and that missing one was considered ""unacceptable.""
""The main focus for me was whatever it takes to get these transactions done for Goldman Sachs,"" he said.
Ng's defense lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said in his opening statement that Ng had no role in the scheme allegedly perpetrated by Leissner and Low.
U.S. prosecutors say $4.5 billion of funds raised from the deals was diverted. The bank in 2020 paid a nearly $3 billion fine and arranged for its Malaysian unit to plead guilty in U.S. court.
Leissner said that at a meeting in London in 2012, Low listed individuals in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi that he said would need to be bribed for a plan to raise $1.75 billion in debt for 1MDB to win approval. An Abu Dhabi-based company was acting as a guarantor for 1MDB on the deal, Leissner said.
That list included Najib Razak, Malaysia's then-prime minister, and Sheikh Mansour, deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, who Low said ""wouldn't get out of bed for anything less than $100 million,"" according to Leissner's testimony.
Najib, who was voted out of office in 2018, is accused by Malaysian authorities of receiving more than $1 billion traceable to 1MDB. Najib, who has appealed a 12-year prison sentence, has consistently denied wrongdoing.
A spokesperson for the UAE Consulate General in New York did not respond to a request for comment.
Prosecutors have acknowledged that Leissner, who has not yet been sentenced, will receive a lighter punishment as a result of his cooperation, but said Leissner's testimony will be backed up by other evidence.
Agnifilo has countered that Leissner lied to prosecutors about Ng's involvement. He spent much of his opening statement attacking Leissner's credibility, portraying him as a socialite who stole to finance a lavish lifestyle. 

A lawyer for Leissner declined to comment. 
Low, the accused mastermind behind the scheme, was indicted in the United States alongside Ng in 2018. He has not been arrested by U.S. or Malaysian authorities. Low's U.S. lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.

(Reuters) - Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Inc deepened its investment in podcasting with the acquisitions of Podsights and Chartable, two services that provide greater insights for advertisers and podcasting publishers, the Swedish company said on Wednesday. 
Podsights helps marketers gauge the effectiveness of their ads, one area that Spotify said has been a major challenge. Chartable provides audience insights that help podcast publishers measure the effectiveness of their growth campaigns.
Financial details of the transactions were not available.
""Our acquisitions of podcast technology players Podsights and Chartable are helpful in our pursuit of up leveling digital audio measurement insights,"" said Khurrum Malik, head of ads business marketing at Spotify.
Stockholm-based Spotify has been investing heavily in podcasts as unlike the music business, which is largely commoditized and low margin as it pays out a part of the revenue to the rights holders, podcasts engage listeners for hours on end, creating valuable advertising inventory that has underpinned the optimism by Wall Street over its long term future.
Since it announced its ""Audio-First"" initiative in 2019, signaling its push into podcasting, Spotify has acquired podcast networks such as Gimlet Media and Anchor, negotiated exclusive deals with popular personalities including Joe Rogan and ""Call Her Daddy"" host Alex Cooper, and invested in underlying technology. 
Rogan has emerged as Spotify's most popular podcast in 90 markets, even as he has become a lightning rod for criticism for views on COVID-19 and use of racist language. He has apologized and more than 100 episodes of his show have been removed.

Spotify has been working to modernize podcast advertising through such features as the real-time ad insertion and acquisitions like Megaphone, which helps podcast publishers earn more from their content. It is hoping to capture a share of the $2 billion that eMarketer predicts will flow into podcasting by 2023.
""We're really excited about bringing this service to advertisers across the United States,"" Malik said. ""But then we want to expand their coverage to international markets.""

1591,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 04:37PM ET</span>","Disney to develop U.S. residential communities, with local themes","By Dawn Chmielewski
(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co will design U.S. residential communities in deals with property developers, capitalizing on fans' enthusiasm for the brand beyond its theme park and entertainment businesses. 
Disney on Wednesday announced its first development -- Cotino, a residential community with 1,900 housing units including single-family homes and condominiums in Southern California's Rancho Mirage. Shops and a beachfront hotel will ring a 24-acre lagooon. Some neighborhoods will be reserved for residents age 55 and older.
Fans of Disney are passionate about the company's control of detail and elaborate escapist experiences. In the residential communities, the company aims to create similar magic that it says will expand storytelling to ""storyliving."" 
Disney park designers will develop the creative concepts for the communities, drawing inspiration from each region, and employees will run a community association that offers entertainment, activities, beach access and Disney programming. 
The owner of Disneyland and Disney World formed a new business unit, Storyliving by Disney, to create the master-planned communities in partnership with landowners, developers and home builders. The Cotino project is with DMB Development.
The effort is reminiscent of Celebration, a master-planned community in Florida founded by Disney in the 1990s and turned over to its residents. More recently, Walt Disney World Resort built a luxury residential community called Golden Oak, a sold-out development with a private clubhouse and an array of amenities, including golfing. 
Those earlier resort communities are located close to Walt Disney World. The coming residential developments will have no such theme park connection and will be designed to reflect the history and art of the places where they're located, said a Disney spokesperson.
""As we prepare to enter our second century, we are developing new and exciting ways to bring the magic of Disney to people wherever they are,"" Disney parks Chairman Josh D'Amaro said in a statement Wednesday.

A Disney spokesperson declined to say how much capital the entertainment giant plans to invest in the residential initiative.
Developers and home builders will handle construction and set pricing. Disney will handle marketing and also operate the voluntary club.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 cut losses to close flat Wednesday, following an intraday turnaround as the release of the Fed minutes eased fears of aggressive rate hikes ahead, though ongoing Russian-Ukraine tensions kept a lid on gains. 
The S&P 500 rose 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.16%, or 5 points, the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1%.
Federal Reserve officials were in favor of increasing interest rates and initiating a ""significant"" reduction in the size of balance sheet that could begin later this year, the Fed’s January meeting minutes showed Wednesday.
The minutes also showed that members would only favor faster rate hikes if the pace of inflation doesn't subside, cooling expectations somewhat of aggressive Fed action. The minutes, however, were somewhat stale as they preceded recent economic data showing a stronger labor market, and inflation that remains at multi-decade highs.      
The two-year U.S. Treasury yields, which is sensitive to expectations Fed rate hikes, eased slightly. 
""The reason the market reacted positively after the minutes is that there really wasn't anything negative in the release that spooked the market,"" Eric Green, Chief Investment Officer of Equity at Penn Capital told Investing.com on Wednesday. ""There wasn't anything in the minutes showing that other Fed officials were more hawkish or that the Fed was changing course.""
The Fed minutes boosted sentiment on stocks offsetting fresh geopolitical tensions. 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there weren’t any signs of a “meaningful pullback"" of Russian forces from the border with Ukraine. That cooled expectations for de-escalation in Ukraine-Russia tensions after Russia on Tuesday claimed that it had pulled some of its troops from the Ukraine border.
Cyclicals sectors including materials, industrials and energy led the rebound broader higher, on data signaling economic strength as U.S. retail sales rose by a more than expected 3.8%, the strongest monthly pace since March, 
Tech moved off session lows, though social media stocks were under pressure after Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s Google said it would limit ad-tracking on android powered smartphones.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), which earlier this month flagged slowing user growth due to Apple’s privacy changes, fell more than 2%. Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) were also down more than 2%.
NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) pared losses to end flat as it announced a partnership with Jaguar Land Rover to build automated driving systems.
Tech or growth corners of the market, which tend to have long duration cash flows, will likely continue face headwinds.  
""Just like with bonds, the present value of these [high valuation] growth stocks with long duration cash flows will be lower in a rising interest rate environment."" Green said. 
""We're in a cycle in which the more value-oriented industries such as financials, energy, materials and industrials perform a lot better than some of the growth sectors,"" Green added."

1594,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 04:26PM ET</span>",Generali chairman to quit in April amid investor tensions,"By Valentina Za
MILAN (Reuters) -The chairman of Italy's biggest insurer, Generali (MI:GASI), plans to step down in April after 11 years in the job, saying that current tensions among investors were a source of regret.
Gabriele Galateri di Genola told the board he would continue as chairman only until a shareholder meeting when investors are due to vote on a new team of directors.
His departure comes at a delicate time for Generali, with some influential investors opposed to Philippe Donnet staying on as chief executive for another term, although its top shareholder backs him.
""I will leave the board in full harmony,"" Galateri, who is 75 and a former Fiat chief executive, wrote in a letter seen by Reuters on Wednesday. 
He indicated it was time to allow a more independent chair to take the position after such a long time in the role.
""I have done the sums and it's almost amazing to realise I have been chairman for 11 years,"" he added, noting he had also previously served for seven years as vice-chairman.
He did not directly link his departure to pressure for reform at Generali from investors Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and his fellow Italian billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio.
However, he expressed ""regret for recent tensions in the shareholder base that Generali certainly doesn't deserve.""
The insurer later on Wednesday said in a statement its board appreciated Galateri's decision, which was in line with plans to pick a future chairman who fully met independence criteria.
Under Italian corporate governance rules, a board member can no longer be considered as independent after three mandates. 
Construction magnate Caltagirone and Del Vecchio, founder of eyewear company Luxottica, have both opposed plans by Generali's board to retain Donnet, who has been CEO since 2016.
The pair want the insurer to be more ambitious in expanding via acquisitions. 
Donnet retains the support of Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY), the leading Generali investor, ahead of a shareholder meeting at the end of April. 
It is not clear who will succeed Galateri in the chairman's role, with independent Generali director Diva Moriani seen as a possible candidate.
Generali's board is working on a slate of candidates for the new board to be put to a shareholder vote in April.

After discussing an initial list of more than 25 names, the board on Wednesday examined a short list of 15 to 20 candidates. 
It is expected to meet again on Monday to discuss criteria for the composition of the board before finalising the list in March.

(Reuters) - Shares of ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc, rebranded as Paramount Global, plunged 21% on Wednesday to their lowest in over a year, after the media company's earnings miss and its move to ramp up investments in streaming raised questions over its ability to stay profitable.
The company was a late entrant to the crowded video streaming industry, where Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney+ have already carved out a big slice of the market by pouring billions of dollars into original content like ""Money Heist"" and blockbuster franchises like ""Star Wars"". 
ViacomCBS said on Tuesday it would invest more than $6 billion by 2024 to create new content, $1 billion more than it had previously committed.
The steady stream of investments required to grow the business, including Paramount+, Showtime and BET+, will ""limit margin expansion more than previously expected,"" Morningstar analyst Neil Macker wrote in a note.
Despite having a string of shows and films in the pipeline, including new installments of ""The Quiet Place"" and ""Mission Impossible"", the company's forecast to exceed $9 billion in revenue by 2024 in its direct-to-consumer (DTC) segment seems to have failed to impress.
MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman said Paramount's losses will continue to mount, peaking at 2023 before improving as its content investment grows, while its traditional network TV business will come under pressure, limiting the company's ability to fully invest in streaming. 
""Despite the big announcement of ViacomCBS changing its name to Paramount ... we are left with a similar question as we had last year: will the company be able to grow EBITA and FCF again to match prior levels?"" Fishman said. 

BofA analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich, who downgraded the company's stock to ""neutral"", noted that her earlier ""bullish thesis"" was predicated on ViacomCBS being an attractive acquisition target amid a wave of media consolidation. 
""It does not appear a potential sale is imminent, given the size of its investment in streaming,"" she said.

1596,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 04:26PM ET</span>",AIG profit beats estimates on general insurance strength,"(Reuters) - U.S. insurer American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) topped fourth-quarter profit expectations on Wednesday as it benefited from strong underwriting and lower catastrophe losses at its general insurance business. 
Catastrophe losses came in at just $189 million in the quarter to Dec. 31 and mainly stemmed from tornadoes in southern U.S. states and wildfires. The year-ago figure was $545 million, including $178 million in estimated COVID-19 losses. 
AIG and its global peers have been inundated with COVID-related claims since start of the pandemic in 2020, but the pressure has started easing in recent months due to the wider availability of vaccines. 
The drop in catastrophe-related claims helped AIG's general insurance business post an underwriting income of $499 million, compared with an underwriting loss of $171 million a year earlier. 
Gross premiums written for the general insurance business rose 12% to more than $8 billion. 
The company's adjusted after-tax income attributable to its common shareholder soared 57% to $1.3 billion. It earned $1.58 on a per-share basis, trouncing analysts' average estimate of $1.19 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The general insurance accident year combined ratio was 89.8, an improvement of 3.1 points from a year earlier. The metric excludes catastrophe losses and a ratio below 100 signifies that the insurer earns more from premiums than it pays out in claims. 

AIG's life and retirement unit, its other large source of income, posted a 6% decline in adjusted pre-tax income to $969 million. 
The company said it had made significant progress in its plans to separate the life and retirement unit. AIG had sold a 9.9% equity stake in the unit to Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc for $2.2 billion in July last year.

""We need a senior leader at the level of myself (for our products) and Sheryl (for our business) who can lead and represent us for all of our policy issues globally,"" Zuckerberg wrote, referring to Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg.
Clegg, who was a British deputy prime minister from 2010 to 2015, joined Facebook in 2018 to run its global policy organization. He has led on issues like Facebook's content policy and elections and spearheaded its establishment of the company's independent content oversight board. 
""Nick will now lead our company on all our policy matters, including how we interact with governments as they consider adopting new policies and regulations, as well as how we make the case publicly for our products and our work,"" Zuckerberg said in the post. 
The CEO said the change would allow him to focus more on leading the company as it builds new products while Sandberg focused on the success of its business.
Clegg's elevation to the role of ""president, global affairs,"" reporting to both Zuckerberg and Sandberg, comes ahead of U.S. midterm elections in November.

Clegg will also be tasked with handling regulatory issues as the company focuses on building the metaverse, a futuristic idea of immersive virtual environments.
""The next few years will be a crucial time for our company and our industry as new rules for the internet are written all over the world, and as we set out on our journey to help build the metaverse,"" Sandberg wrote in a post.

The investment bank lost nearly $1 billion last year when Bill Hwang's Archegos failed to meet margin calls, forcing several investment banks including  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to attempt recouping losses by liquidating shares and assets. 
Block trades were already under scrutiny when the highly leveraged family office imploded, the report said on Wednesday. 
Morgan Stanley, shares in which were down 2.3%, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Broker-dealers frequently buy and sell blocks of shares, either on behalf of clients or as part of a hedging strategy, which are large enough to move the company's share price.
Block trading tends to increase during times of volatility as institutional investors rebalance their portfolios. Information on such share sales ahead of time could be extremely valuable. 
Federal investigators began focusing on trades carried out by Morgan Stanley a day before the wider sell-off wiped out $35 billion from the value of Archegos' holdings https://bloom.bg/3LGBXlA, Bloomberg said.
That led to a wider inspection of multiple trades brought to market by Morgan Stanley, and whether its clients illegally profited from trading in advance of those transactions, according to the report. 
It also led to scrutiny of Pawan Passi, a senior executive at the bank who spoke about various block trades, the report said. 
Reuters and other media outlets reported on Tuesday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was probing whether financial executives broke the rules by tipping off hedge funds ahead of large sales of shares.

The SEC subpoenaed financial institutions in recent weeks to ask about particular block trades, including some dating back to 2019, according to a source familiar with the probe. 
The sweep appears aimed at the broker-dealers involved in the trades as well as protocols the firms have to prevent misuse of the information, the source said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Jana Partners has nominated four directors to the board of Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN), arguing the company must be rehabilitated after an unpopular attempt to buy Momentive Global, parent of web-survey company SurveyMonkey, according to a regulatory filing.
Jana Partners launched the proxy contest a week before Zendesk shareholders are scheduled to vote on the company's proposed acquisition of Momentive Global on Feb. 25. 
It also comes only a few days after Zendesk said it had rebuffed an approximately $17 billion bid from a consortium of private equity firms looking to acquire the customer service software company.
Even with the Momentive deal facing a likely rejection by shareholders, Jana said in the letter that lasting damage had been done. 
""We believe the board must either be replaced with capable fiduciaries, or reverse course and engage with interested strategic and financial buyers to sell the company,"" Jana Partners Managing Director Barry Rosenstein wrote to the Zendesk board on Wednesday.
The activist nominated Quincy Allen, Felicia Alvaro and Jeffrey Fox, executives with expertise in the software and technology industries, as well as experience in mergers and acquisitions and finance.
It also nominated Scott Ostfeld, a partner and a co-portfolio manager at Jana Partners.
Zendesk said it welcomes input from all shareholders and will ""review and evaluate"" Jana Partners' nominees ""carefully."" The company also said it will stick by its commitment to independence, diversity and shareholder perspective, noting the board ""has been built by balancing the benefits of tenure and experience with the need for fresh ideas and perspectives.""
The four candidates would run against Zendesk's four directors who are slated for election this year, including two of the three Zendesk directors who served on a transaction committee that spearheaded the Momentive transaction.
PERSISTENT DISCOUNT 
The company's 10-member board has eight independent directors but only a portion stand for reelection each year.
""We believe the board has all but assured that Zendesk will suffer a persistent discount to its intrinsic value,"" the letter said.
In October, Zendesk agreed to buy Momentive in an all-stock deal worth roughly $4 billion. Zendesk's stock price fell after the acquisition announcement and remained more than 20% below its pre-deal price until Nov. 30, when Jana wrote a letter publicly opposing the plans and urged the company to abandon the acquisition.
Other Zendesk investors, including Janus Henderson, Neuberger Berman and Florida's pension system Florida State Board of Administration, also said they would vote against the acquisition, citing procedural, strategic and financial concerns. 
Proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis last week advised Zendesk investors to vote the deal down.
It is unusual for Jana to run a proxy contest as the firm has spent more than two decades cementing a reputation for working collaboratively and behind the scenes with target companies.
The prospect of a potential proxy fight is already resonating with some investors. 
A portfolio manager at a prominent mutual fund company, who is not authorized to speak about the matter publicly, has told Reuters he would support replacing board members and would also like to see management replaced.

Investing.com -- Stronger than expected retail sales in January may give Federal Reserve policymakers more reason to cut rates more quickly starting next month, but that made for a choppy day in the stock market on Wednesday.
While Russia and Ukraine continued their standoff, fears over a war subsided some more. The U.S. is ratcheting up the diplomatic pressure with threats of severe sanctions if Russia starts a military action. 
Retail sales jumped 3.8% in January, a sharp reversal from the prior month. Consumers bought vehicles and other items, but analysts had expected just a 2% increase.
Fed officials were in favor of reining in accommodative monetary policy measures with a faster pace of rate increases and a ""significant"" reduction in the size of its balance sheet that could begin later this year, the central bank’s January meeting minutes showed Wednesday. 
Tech shares sold off on the prospects of faster rate increases.
More data on employment comes out on Thursday with the release of jobless claims for last week. Retail earnings continue with Walmart in the morning.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Walmart earnings
Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) will declare its fourth-quarter numbers Thursday. Revenue for the period is seen at $151.74 billion and profit per share at $1.49, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. Analysts will be listening for Walmart’s outlook on supply chains and labor.
2. Nestle earnings
Food giant Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) is scheduled to report full-year 2021 earnings on Thursday, with sales expected to come in around $93.9 billion and net profit expected in the neighborhood of $13.3 billion. 
3. Jobless claims
The number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the first time in the U.S. is seen falling for the fourth straight week to 219,000.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -ViacomCBS Inc missed Wall Street profit forecasts on Tuesday as the company announced it will change its name to Paramount and unveiled a broad range of new programming in the battle for viewers in the crowded streaming market.
Shares of the media conglomerate that owns CBS, Showtime, Comedy Central, MTV and other networks, which initially fell 3%, slipped to a 6% loss as the company's two-hour presentation of its streaming strategy continued after the markets closed.
ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) reported adjusted earnings per share of 26 cents for October through December, below analyst projections of 43 cents. 
The switch to Paramount, effective on Wednesday, was announced as the company made a presentation to drum up excitement among investors about its future strategy and programming. 
""We know the opportunity at hand is massive, and we've got the passion, the ambition and the discipline to deliver,"" Chief Executive Bob Bakish said. 
The company forecast it will have 100 million subscribers to its streaming services by 2024, raising earlier guidance of 65 million to 75 million customers. To get there, spending on new streaming programming will grow to more than $6 billion per year in 2024, the company said.
Executives announced a large slate of programming to help draw new online customers who have several options from Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co and others. 
Among them, ViacomCBS ordered a second season of upcoming video game TV adaptation series ""Halo,"" a ""Yellowstone"" spinoff called ""1932,"" and two animated ""South Park"" movies every year through 2027.
Starting in 2025, all ""South Park"" episodes will be exclusively available around the globe on Paramount+, executives said.
For younger viewers, the company will produce a ""Baby Shark"" movie and a new ""Dora the Explorer"" series.
Tom Cruise, star of Paramount's ""Top Gun"" and ""Mission: Impossible,"" franchises, appeared via video, saying he was ""very, very proud"" of his 37-year relationship with the movie studio as an actor and producer. ""Top Gun: Maverick"" is scheduled to hit movie theaters in May. 
Starting in 2024, Paramount+ will become the exclusive home for all of the company's theatrical movies after they play in cinemas. 
The new Paramount name ""will help advance our strategy of harnessing all our strength and breadth in building the businesses of tomorrow,"" Bakish and Chair Shari Redstone said in a memo to employees. 
Earlier on Tuesday, the company said it added 9.4 million global streaming subscribers in the fourth quarter, taking its total count to 56 million subscribers. 
The company also benefited from the resumption of live sports and a rise in affiliate revenue at its cable networks, which refers to the fees collected from cable and satellite operators and online distributors. 

Revenue rose 16% to $8 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with analysts' estimates of $7.51 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Operating income rose to $2.66 billion from $1.08 billion a year earlier.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's self-driving technology unit Waymo and truck fleet operator C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc said on Wednesday they would team up to test automated trucks with safety drivers behind the wheels in Texas in the coming months.
The partnership will allow C.H. Robinson to be among the earlier users of Waymo's automated trucking technology when it is ultimately deployed, said Chris O’Brien, Chief Commercial Officer of C.H. Robinson. 
O'Brien said development of autonomous long-haul trucks will provide welcome relief to fleets that struggled with hauling capacity restraints and chronic driver shortages even before the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the situation.
A number of self-driving firms are scrambling to forge partnerships with truck makers, operators and customers, accelerating the race to put automated trucks on the road. 
Long-haul trucks should be easier to automate than robotaxis because major highways are less challenging environments than bustling city roads. Still, Waymo was cautious how fast they can ramp up. 
""We also have a lot of humility that our technology solution is just one piece of a very complex puzzle,"" said Charlie Jatt, head of commercialization for trucking, Waymo Via.
""It is going to take a gradual evolution to scale this to the full benefit,"" he said. 
Waymo has been developing autonomous driving technology for over a decade, but it has yet to scale up the technology. It initially focused on robo-taxis but in 2017 set up Waymo Via to build technology for automated trucking and delivery services. The company also has partnerships with Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s truck unit, long-haul trucker JB Hunt (NASDAQ:JBHT) and package carrier UPS. 

Waymo is integrating its self-driving software and sensors with Daimler trucks. It has been testing with JB Hunt and UPS in Texas where Waymo hopes to deploy fully autonomous trucking technology in the next few years.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 cut some losses Wednesday, as the release of the Fed minutes didn't provide further signs that a 50 basis point rate hike in March was in play, though upside was kept in check by ongoing Russian-Ukraine tensions.
The S&P 500 rose 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.12%, or 42 points, the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2%.
Federal Reserve officials were in favor of increasing interest rates and initiating a ""significant"" reduction in the size of balance sheet that could begin later this year, the Fed’s January meeting minutes showed Wednesday.
The minutes also showed that members would only favor faster rate hikes if the pace of inflation doesn't, cooling expectations somewhat of aggressive Fed action. The minutes, however, were somewhat stale as they preceded recent economic data showing a stronger labor market, and inflation that remains at multi-decade highs.      
The two-year U.S. Treasury yields, which is sensitive to expectations Fed rate hikes, eased slightly. 
The Fed minutes boosted sentiment on stocks offsetting fresh geopolitical tensions. 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there weren’t any signs of a “meaningful pullback"" of Russian forces from the border with Ukraine. That cooled expectations for de-escalation in Ukraine-Russia tensions after Russia on Tuesday claimed that it had pulled some of its troops from the Ukraine border.
Cyclicals sectors including materials, industrials and energy led the rebound broader higher, with the latter supported by rising oil prices.
Tech moved off session lows, though social media stocks were under pressure after Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s Google said it would limit ad-tracking on android powered smartphones.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), which earlier this month flagged slowing user growth due to Apple’s privacy changes, fell more than 2%. Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) were also down more than 3%.
NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) gave up some its gains from Tuesday, even as it announced a partnership with Jaguar Land Rover  to build automated driving systems.

1607,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 02:56PM ET</span>",Private prison company to test U.S. house arrest program for immigrants,"By Ted Hesson and Mica Rosenberg
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A private prison company will run a new U.S. pilot program that would place hundreds of migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border under house arrest, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told Reuters, an approach that critics say is an extension of for-profit detention.
BI Incorporated, a subsidiary of the private prison company GEO Group, will operate the so-called ""home curfew"" pilot program, a DHS spokesperson and two U.S. officials said. Immigrants enrolled in the program would be confined to their place of residence in the United States for 12 hours a day and monitored electronically while waiting for their court hearings.
Reuters and other outlets reported last week on the new program, which will generally require immigrants to remain in their residences from 8 p.m. until 8 a.m. 
The Biden administration has greatly expanded so-called ""alternatives to detention,"" such as ankle bracelets and monitoring via mobile phone. The selection of a private prison company to run the home curfew pilot shows how companies could retain a strong foothold in the world of immigration enforcement.
GEO Group declined to comment and instead referred questions to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)), which oversees immigration detention and falls under DHS. When asked about the program, a DHS spokesperson referred to the program as part of ""impactful detention reforms.""
U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, signed an executive order shortly after taking office in January 2021 phasing out private prison contracts for federal jails to ""reduce profit-based incentives"" to incarceration and tackle systemic racism.
So far, however, Biden has failed to deliver on a campaign promise to do the same for immigration detention. 
There are currently 21,000 immigrants in federal detention facilities, up from 19,000 on Sept. 30, 2020, before Biden took office. Immigration detention centers are operating at reduced capacity due to COVID-19.
The current detention population is still much smaller than the pre-COVID levels under former President Donald Trump, a Republican and immigration hardliner. 
The Biden administration has closed two immigration detention centers and told ICE to narrow who it targets for arrest, with a focus on serious criminals.
'SHAPE SHIFT'
Amid Biden's executive order on jails and the prospect of fewer immigrants in detention, two of the country's largest private prison companies, CoreCivic (NYSE:CXW) and GEO Group, have been looking at detention alternatives, including remote monitoring as a continued source of revenue, according to transcripts of recent conference calls. 
About 164,000 immigrants are currently in alternative-to-detention programs, according to ICE data, roughly double the total on Sept. 30, 2020, before Biden took office. The administration is asking Congress for funding for up to 400,000 enrollees, Reuters reported last week.
BI was awarded a $2.2 billion federal contract in 2020 to administer such programs, according to federal contracting records. CoreCivic disputed the contract, saying it had proposed a lower price for the service, a subsequent U.S. government report said - a sign of growing competition in the market of remote monitoring.
In his first year in office, Biden grappled with a record-high number of attempted border crossings, which has become an attack line for anti-immigration Republicans in the run-up to the Nov. 8 midterm elections. 
While a COVID-19 public health order in place at the border allows officials to rapidly expel most people who cross illegally, thousands are still entering the country to pursue immigration claims. Adult asylum seekers will be among the several hundred migrants in the house arrest pilot program, which will be tested in Houston and Baltimore, according to an ICE memo recently sent to lawmakers and seen by Reuters.
Immigrant rights advocates contend ankle bracelets and other forms of monitoring are expanding surveillance of immigrants without significantly cutting back detention. 

The Biden administration is repurposing the federal government's three family detention centers to hold only adults, the ICE memo added. But two of those facilities in Texas are managed by CoreCivic and GEO Group, which will continue to run them. 
""It's a step in the right direction,"" said Jacinta Gonzalez, a campaign organizer for Mijente, an immigrant advocacy organization. "" (But) the idea was for them to close down, not for them to shape shift.""

On a recent earnings call, Tesla stated that the company is not currently working on a $25K car, but Sacconaghi said without offerings that address mass-market price points — under $30k — they ""struggle to see how Tesla will be able to grow at 50%+ beyond 2023, which implies 3M units in 2024 and nearly 5M in 2025.” 
""We note that during its hyper growth period, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s R&D spending lagged, leading to a period of fewer product introductions and weaker growth – and we worry about that potential risk at Tesla,"" the analyst added.

PARIS (Reuters) -  Carrefour  SA (OTC:CRRFY) said on Wednesday it looked to 2022 with confidence after Europe's largest food retailer delivered record free cash flow of 1.23 billion euros ($1.40 billion) and a 7.7% rise in operating profit for 2021.
Chairman and Chief Executive Alexandre Bompard said cash generation would remain above one billion euros in 2022 and good commercial momentum would continue despite inflationary pressure.
He also said he would unveil his new strategic plan for the group in autumn.
Strong results and cash generation allowed Carrefour (PA:CARR) to hand investors an 8% dividend hike to 0.52 euros per share and launch a new share buyback plan of 750 million euros for 2022.
""It is an exciting time for us with a new plan in the fall. We have great confidence for this year,"" Bompard told analysts.
Cash is also key to the French food retailer's plans to step up digital commerce expansion without the extra financial resources that would have been on hand if two planned tie-ups last year had not failed - one with Canada's Couche-Tard and one with France's Auchan.
Carrefour reported a 7.7% rise in 2021 recurring operating profit to 2.27 billion euros at constant exchange rates, driven notably by its core French market.
The performance reflected cost cuts and 2021 sales which grew 2.3% on a like-for-like basis to 81.245 billion euros, with market share gains in key countries France, Brazil and Spain.
In France, where Bompard has made reviving flagging sales at hypermarket stores a priority, operating profit rose 20% to 757 million euros on sales that rose 1.8%.
Carrefour said it expected its French operations to further improve their operating margin to 3% of sales in the mid-term, from 2.1% in 2021.
With inflation accelerating, Carrefour said it would intensify cost savings. 
It raised its cost-cutting goal to 2.7 billion euros on an annual basis in 2021-23 from an initial target of 2.4 billion, having achieved 930 million in cost savings in 2021.
Carrefour is in the last leg of a five-year plan launched in January 2018 to cut costs and boost e-commerce investment to improve profits and sales, as it seeks to tackle online rivals such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and discounters like Lidl and unlisted retailer Leclerc.
Bompard, whom Carrefour reappointed in May 2021 to lead for another three years, is working on a new strategic plan and conducting an asset review as part of the process.
In November, Carrefour pledged to spend 3 billion euros between 2022 and 2026 to step up digital expansion, one of the pillars of the future strategy plan.

Carrefour shares have gained 7% so far this year but still trade 20% below their level when Bompard took over in July 2017.

The move, formally announced after the parties secured approval from Brazilian antitrust authorities for the deal, comes as Yara aims to derive 25% of its sales from online channels by 2025, Yara Americas Vice President Cleiton Vargas said in an interview. 
""Orbia was a perfect fit,"" Vargas said. 
Orbia's CEO Ivan Moreno said Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) and Brazil's Bravium were equally diluted to accommodate Yara as a partner, with the German company now owning 68.8% of Orbia and Bravium holding a 17.2% stake. 
Orbia believes a new generation of younger farmers will increasingly buy inputs online and wants to capitalize on it. 
Moreno said Yara's investment in Orbia, which also gives it a seat on its board, will allow the company ""to take a leap forward.""
""Yara's presence as a partner highlights the credibility of Orbia's business model,"" Moreno said. 
On Orbia's marketplace farmers can buy seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. They can also trade in soy, corn and coffee. 
The company projects sales on Orbia will more than triple to 3 billion reais ($580.5 million) this year from 2021, Moreno said.

(Reuters) - Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) Corp on Wednesday announced a share buyback of up to $1 billion as the miner's fourth-quarter results beat analysts' estimates following strong production at its Nevada mines and a smaller tax take than expected.
Barrick's U.S.-listed shares rose around 5% at the open. Net earnings more than doubled from the previous quarter to $726 million, while adjusted earnings per share were $0.35, beating expectations of $0.30 from analysts who had anticipated a higher fourth quarter tax rate.
While costs across Barrick's copper and gold operations climbed in 2021 and were forecast to rise further this year, CEO Mark Bristow said the impact of inflation could be mitigated.
""The gold industry is facing inflation, but that's good for gold. It is what it is, we have to manage it,"" he said in a telephone interview, adding there were ""opportunities to mitigate the price increases"".
Investors often use gold as a hedge against inflation, and prices of the precious metal have risen slightly since the start of 2022.
Bristow said energy was the biggest driver of cost increases, and Barrick's solar power facilities at mines in Nevada and Mali would help reduce its power costs.
Announcing the share buyback, Bristow said the share price did not reflect the value of the company's assets. 
Barrick shares surged in 2020 when gold prices spiked in response to the global pandemic, but the stock has performed less well since, falling 15.6% in 2021. 
Asked if Barrick planned to buy back the full $1 billion amount, Bristow said it would depend on the market. 
Peer Newmont announced a buyback of the same amount a year ago.
""We believe Newmont has benefited from its capital allocation policy over the past year (in terms of its stock performance), and we think Barrick is trying to receive similar credit,"" Keybanc Capital Markets analyst Adam Josephson wrote.
The miner declared a dividend of 10 cents per share, an increase of 11% from the previous base quarterly dividend. 
PRODUCTION DOWN, COSTS UP
Over the year, Barrick's gold production fell by 6.8% to 4.437 million ounces of gold from 4.76 million ounces in 2020. Copper production was also lower in 2021, at 415 million pounds compared to 457 million pounds in 2020. 
Barrick's costs also climbed during 2021.
All-in sustaining costs (AISC) - a measure of total cost of mining - at Barrick's copper mines jumped by 17.5% to $2.62 per pound in 2021 from $2.23 per pound in 2020. Costs at Barrick's gold operations rose by 6.1% to $1,026 per ounce from $967 per ounce in 2020.

Barrick said it expected all-in sustaining costs to climb again to between $1,040 and $1,120 per ounce of gold in 2022, with cash costs between $730 and $790 per ounce.
""Barrick had previously indicated ~3-5% inflation year on year, and the 2022 cash cost guidance implies ~4.8% inflation,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Fahad Tariq said.

1614,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 01:32PM ET</span>",Carson Block's Muddy Waters among short sellers being probed by U.S. Justice Dept,"By Jody Godoy, Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Chris Prentice
(Reuters) -U.S. short seller Carson Block is being probed by the Justice Department as part of a wide-ranging investigation into short-sellers and hedge funds focused on suspected coordinated manipulative trading, according to two people familiar with the matter.
The Justice Department early last year issued subpoenas to dozens of firms, which included requests for funds' trading records, as part of the probe, Reuters and other media outlets reported in December. The agency issued a second round of subpoenas months later, Reuters reported.
Block, the high-profile short seller behind privately held investment research firm Muddy Waters (NYSE:WAT) Research LLC, is among those being probed, according to the people. Block was subpoenaed and served with an FBI search warrant last year, one of those people said. The Wall Street Journal reported Block was under scrutiny earlier on Wednesday. 
Block, who made his name by exposing accounting problems at a slew of Chinese companies including Sino-Forest, and a spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment. 
Reuters reported in December that Andrew Left of Citron Research was also being probed. Bloomberg News, which was first to report the probe, previously reported that Anson Funds and Marcus Aurelius Value are also under scrutiny.
In a December statement, Citron Research said it knew of ""no wrongdoing"" and had ""cooperated fully with the government's investigation.""
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also involved in the probe, according to a third person with knowledge of the matter. The SEC did not respond immediately to request for comment. 
The sweeping probe is being led by a team based at the agency's Washington headquarters that focuses on rooting out market manipulation, one of the first sources and two other people said. It is exploring relationships among the hedge funds and short-selling firms that publish negative reports on publicly-traded companies.
Short-sellers make profits by betting stocks will fall. 
The practice of touting negative research and profiting when the stock falls has been criticized by public companies and some academics who say the allegations can be false and the traders are artificially deflating share prices to the detriment of shareholders. 
Academics at Columbia Law School who have researched the issue have dubbed the practice ""short and distort."" Block and other short-sellers who publicize their bearish views say they are protecting investors by exposing fraud or other problems. 
For the Justice Department, the inquiry marks new territory for a team that has been building up its use of data surveillance to detect more sophisticated forms of market manipulation, according to one of the sources. 

The agency is looking into whether the coordinated trading is designed to create boost trading volumes and drive prices down on news of the short report, two of the sources said.
That would be akin to so-called ""spoofing"" practices seen in the futures market, one of the sources said. Spoofing is a type of market manipulation where traders put in bids or offers to create the false impression of either demand or a lack of demand and profit when the market moves in response -- misconduct the Washington-based Justice Department has been focusing on over the past few years.

1615,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 01:31PM ET</span>",Will Kering and Hermes follow Louis Vuitton's lead on prices?,"By Mimosa Spencer
PARIS (Reuters) -When Gucci-owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and Hermes report earnings this week, investors will be looking for signs that the big luxury fashion groups are confident that wealthy shoppers are willing to pay higher price tags for designer accessories.
Rival Louis Vuitton, the world's largest luxury label, raised its prices on Wednesday, citing higher manufacturing and transport costs - one of the first major luxury brands to do so this year. 
The LVMH-owned label increased prices worldwide by around 7% overall, and by around 8% for leather goods, analysts at Exane BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) said. The price of popular handbags like the Coussin, Neverfull and Capucines rose by 20-25%, the analysts said. 
The gap between the brand's prices in Europe and China -- where luxury goods from Europe tend to cost more -- remained relatively unchanged, at an average of 41% versus 40% previously, the analysts added.
Luxury goods groups often cite efforts to reduce price differences between regions as a justification for any adjustments.
Pricing power could emerge as a key driver of revenue growth again in 2022 for the top tier of the fashion and leather goods industry, following a string of price hikes in 2021 and 2020. 
Consumers came out of lockdowns eager to spend their cash on luxury fashion and accessories, after months of being stuck at home. Brands are taking advantage of that spending power to make their wares even more costly and exclusive. 
Bloggers on China's social media platform Xiaohongshu are forecasting higher prices from Kering profit engine Gucci from as soon as Friday. Gucci's small Marmont shoulder bag, which currently costs 16,500 yuan ($2,602), is seen going up around 3%, while other Gucci accessories could climb 10-15%. 
Users of the Xiaohongshu site, known in the industry as Little Red Book, often cite sales associates for the fashion labels and have a track record of correctly predicting price increases but do not always specify their sources. 
Kering's Balenciaga already raised prices in early January in China, according to the Xiaohongshu site. The cost of the label's curvy Hourglass handbags in size small and extra-small, for instance, has risen by 3.5-4% to 17,500 yuan and 11,550 yuan respectively. 
Kering declined to comment, noting it is in a closed period ahead of its annual earnings on Thursday.
Hermes told Reuters it would be likely to address the pricing issue when it reports earnings on Friday, denying analysts' reports that the company had already increased prices last month by 3% to 10%. 
Chanel raised the prices of some of its most sought after handbags three times last year, with its small classic handbag now costing around $8,200, or 60% more than in 2019.
""This year is likely to bring a virtuous circle of pricing power and brand desirability,"" UBS said in a note to clients. 
Kering is expected to report organic sales growth of 20% over the fourth quarter, HSBC has forecast, helped by marketing investments generating buzz around Gucci's 100th anniversary last year. 

Sales at Hermes are expected to rise 12% at constant foreign exchange rates over the period, HSBC said.

Investing.com --  Roku  Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) shares declined over 4% on Wednesday after Morgan Stanley reiterated an underweight rating.
Analyst Benjamin Swinburne said in a client note that while Roku continues to be the leading streaming TV platform in the U.S., with its engagement share up 41%, they see two headwinds regarding U.S. active account growth.
""First, smart TV sales in the US are likely flat to potentially down in '22 due to 2020 pull forward of sales and continued supply chain impacts on inventory and TV prices,"" explained Swinburne.
Adding that the second headwind is the company's most important original equipment manufacturer partner, TCL ""continues to gradually introduce more Google TV SKU's which, all else equal, puts downward pressure on Roku powered TCL TVs.""
The analyst said the market overvalues active accounts, as ""the relationship between active accounts and revenue is somewhat tenuous,"" but ""KPI's are drivers of share performance and Active Accounts are likely the most important KPI.""
Earlier this week, Wedbush cut the price target on Roku shares to $220 from $365, based on the belief that the company's active account growth ""meaningfully decelerated"" over the second half of 2021."

The hype around cryptocurrencies last year spilled over to NFTs, a form of speculative investment that has attracted fans including former U.S. first lady Melania Trump and Jamaican sprint great Usain Bolt.
Companies involved in this sector have also been backed by heavyweights  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and SoftBank Group Corp.
If the NYSE launches a new marketplace, it would compete with SuperRare, Rarible and NFT markeplace giant OpenSea, which was valued at $13.3 billion after its latest funding round.

""(The NYSE) regularly considers new products and their impact on our trademarks and protects our intellectual property rights accordingly,"" the spokesperson added.
NFTs have left many baffled as to why so much money is spent on items that do not physically exist. Some also believe the industry is saturated by scammers and too often rewards viral art of low quality.

1620,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 12:36PM ET</span>","Trump's longtime accounting firm cuts ties, cannot stand behind statements - filing","By Karen Freifeld
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The accounting firm that handled Donald Trump's company's financial statements dropped it as a client and said it could no longer stand behind a decade of statements, a court filing showed on Monday.
Mazars USA, in a Feb. 9 letter made public on Monday, told the Trump Organization, the former president's New York-based real estate business, that its financial statements for 2011 through 2020 should no longer be relied on.
The disclosure was made as part of New York Attorney General Letitia James' civil investigation into the Trump Organization, which could result in financial penalties. That probe partially overlaps a criminal investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney, which James joined in May, into the company's practices.
Mazars said it had based its conclusion on a January filing by the New York attorney general, its own investigation and information from internal and external sources. 
""While we have not concluded that the various financial statements, as a whole, contain material discrepancies, based upon the totality of the circumstances we believe our advice to you to no longer rely upon those financial statements is appropriate,"" Mazars said in the letter addressed to the chief legal officer at the Trump Organization, Alan Garten.
In the letter, filed in New York state court, Mazars said that it had ""performed its work in accordance with professional standards.""
The accounting firm also said it would no longer work for the Trump Organization. 
New York state's attorney general has accused the Trump Organization of repeatedly misrepresenting the value of its assets to obtain financial benefits.
A Trump Organization spokesperson said in a statement the company is ""disappointed that Mazars has chosen to part ways."" But the spokesperson added the letter confirms that ""Mazars' work was performed in accordance with all applicable accounting standards and principles"" and that the statements of financial condition ""do not contain any material discrepancies."" 
The New York attorney general filed the Mazars letter in support of its efforts to compel the production of outstanding documents from Trump and his company as well as testimony by him and two of his adult children, Donald Trump Jr. And Ivanka Trump.
In a memorandum also filed on Monday, the attorney general noted media reports that Trump had destroyed documents covered by the Presidential Records Act and wants him to supply a sworn statement on whether the files produced for her probe are complete and how they may have been destroyed and by whom.
Trump has decried the probe as political. 
In Monday's filing, James' office said the accounting firm's statement and actions further supported the legitimacy of the investigation.

James has been investigating whether the Trumps inflated real estate values to obtain bank loans, and reduced values to lower tax bills. In one example, she said Trump's annual financial statements said an apartment he personally owned in Trump Tower was 30,000 square feet(2,787 square meters), when it was in fact a third that size.
Neither Trump nor his children have been accused of criminal wrongdoing.

DENVER (Reuters) -U.S. shale producer  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) on Wednesday said it was anticipating a 15% rise in costs this year compared to 2021 due to inflation and supply chain constraints.
U.S. oil prices have climbed to their highest levels in seven years, trading at nearly $95 a barrel, as activity has come roaring back amid a recovery in demand. However, many oil companies are being hit by shortages in labor and critical supplies such as sand, which has driven up their costs.
""Inflationary pressure and supply chain disruptions are a reality,"" Clay Gaspar, Devon chief operating officer, told investors during the company's fourth-quarter conference call. 
Devon's capital spending for the fourth quarter came in slightly above analysts' expectation but was within the upper end of the company's guidance range. Upstream spending was driven higher by roughly 10 well spuds being moved up to the fourth quarter and rising costs. 
Shares of Devon were up about 5.4% to $54.23 at midday, outpacing gains in rivals, after the company boosted its fixed dividend by 45% and increased a share repurchase program by 60% to $1.6 billion. 

In the fourth quarter, Devon's free cash flow was $1.1 billion. The company generated a record $2.9 billion of free cash flow for the full-year 2021.
Devon has currently hedged about 25% of its oil sales and around 35% of its natural gas sales, executives said on Wednesday.

1624,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 12:12PM ET</span>",U.S. banks urge regulators to be flexible on climate-risk rules,"By Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. banks this week welcomed a regulatory proposal to incorporate climate change risks into their daily operations, yet said they opposed prescriptive risk management and lending criteria, exposure disclosures and capital penalties.
Banks pushed back on the suggestion by President Joe Biden's administration that they should be required to report climate risk exposures publicly or to regulators. They noted that many banks are already engaged in voluntary reporting efforts. 
Environmental groups and climate activists are pressing governments and corporations to intensify planning for the effects of climate change such as rising sea levels, worsening floods and fires. These disasters, along with policies transitioning away from carbon-heavy industry, could destroy trillions of dollars of assets around the globe. 
U.S. banks also face intensifying pressure to reduce lending to oil companies, pipelines and other fossil fuel producers. Many lenders have pledged to transition away from fossil-fuel lending. 
In December, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) sought feedback on draft guidelines requiring banks to incorporate climate change risk across their businesses. 
The sweeping proposal applies to lenders with over $100 billion in assets. It touches on everything from board room governance, liquidity, credit and operational risk management, to the way banks project hypothetical future losses on their books and their ability to service poorer communities.
Responses to the proposal were due Monday. In them, groups representing JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) among others staked out positions on hot-button climate risk issues that Biden's regulators have zoomed in on. 
Chiefly, banks called for the OCC to take a flexible principles-based stance, given the complexity of identifying, gathering and modeling financial and non-financial climate-related data over a range of long time horizons.
""It would be premature...to require banks to establish and apply quantitative limits or thresholds for climate-related financial risk,"" the Bank Policy Institute (BPI). 
It recommended allowing banks to develop and adapt internal risk criteria and decide how to integrate climate risks into their existing risk-management framework. It opposed prescriptive lending limits. 
Citing data and modeling challenges, the industry rejected the notion that lenders' climate change risk assessments should affect capital or liquidity.
While banks should assess how their books would perform under different climate change scenarios, the groups said climate change risks should not be added to stress tests that determine bank capital plans.
""It would be inappropriate for banks to experience adverse regulatory consequences as a result of quantitative assessments that rely on currently available data and methodologies,"" wrote the Financial Services Forum which represents the largest eight U.S. banks.
As for lending to the oil and gas industry, BPI said lenders should be allowed to support clients transitioning to low-carbon business plans. For instance, some producers are cutting greenhouse gas emissions at wells and pipelines or investing in carbon-capture technology. 

The Institute of International Finance also warned that regulators' increasing focus on climate risks, in particular pilot scenario analyses being conducted by multiple countries, was sucking up resources banks should be devoting to internal capacity building.
""It would therefore be helpful...for supervisors to take an explicitly proportionate, phased, and incremental approach,"" it wrote.

Investing.com – Vacasa stock (NASDAQ:VCSA) surged 14% Wednesday after JPMorgan JPM analyst Doug Anmuth said it is a better bet than Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB).
Anmuth initiated coverage of the stock with an overweight rating a target of $11, citing attractive valuations. The target also happens to be the stock’s 52-week high, reached in December. The stock touched a high of $8.30 in the session that’s still underway.
Vacasa now has a market cap of $3.5 billion compared to Airbnb’s $120 billion. The latter was up 5% today on robust fourth-quarter earnings and an optimistic outlook.
Vacasa is a new entrant to the vacation-rental market dominated by Airbnb.
According to reports, JPMorgan believes Vacasa has scaled well to become the largest vacation rental management platform in the U.S.
According to the analyst, Vacasa's ""solid execution"" across supply acquisition, and distribution leading up to Covid-19 and during the pandemic as well helped it benefit from strong demand for alternative accommodations.
The analyst said Vacasa will remain a valuable strategic partner to Airbnb, Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) and  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE), while its vertically integrated approach provides opportunities for differentiation.

(Reuters) - Sage Therapeutics Inc's drug helped improve depressive symptoms after three days in a late-stage study, but investor concerns over how long the treatment's effect would last sent the drug developer's shares down 17% on Wednesday. 
In a study among 440 patients with major depressive disorder, the drug, zuranolone, taken along with an antidepressant also showed a statistically significant improvement in symptoms over a two-week period, the company and partner Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) said on Wednesday.
Analysts, however, said the near-term durability of the oral drug would likely be the key to broader commercial success.
""The clinical benefit is modest and the effects are not durable,"" said Truist Securities analyst Joon Lee, adding that the regulatory process for the drug is likely to be ""wrought with noise, controversy"" over the next 12-18 months. 
The trial results come after a separate late-stage trial in June raised similar concerns about how long the symptom improvement would last.
Major depressive disorder affects over 16 million American adults every year and is mainly treated with antidepressants, which could take up to six weeks to show effect.
Sage, which has a postpartum depression drug on the market, said it plans to file for U.S. approval of the drug this year. Sage signed a deal worth up to $1.5 billion with Biogen in 2020 to develop zuranolone along with another experimental drug.

While zuranolone showed greater reduction in symptoms than placebo after three days, the difference was still lower than Street expectations, Guggenheim analyst Yatin Suneja said. 
But Suneja added that the drug remains approvable and he had expected its effect to wane over time as the company had decided to evaluate the results at day three for the main goal instead of at day fifteen as it had done in the June trial.

The material will come from Liontown's new A$473 million ($337 million) Kathleen Valley Lithium Project in Western Australia.
The deal is for an initial five years and is set to begin in 2024.
Tesla will purchase 100,000 dry metric tonnes in the first year, increasing to 150,000 per year in subsequent years.
Liontown said major construction work at the project is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter 2022.
While no financial details were disclosed, Liontown said pricing was determined using a formula-based mechanism referencing market prices for lithium hydroxide monohydrate.
Liontown has now contracted over half of its anticipated production from Kathleen Valley during the first five years of operation, while it is continuing negotiations with other potential customers for the remaining output.

The sweetened offer was not in Cedar Fair's ""best interest"", the company said on Wednesday, sending its shares down about 6% to $58.
Cedar Fair Chief Executive Officer Richard Zimmerman said the company had first received a $60-per-share offer, which SeaWorld (NYSE:SEAS) later informally raised to $63. Cedar Fair then rejected the revised bid, which had valued it at $3.58 billion.
SeaWorld, a Florida-based theme park and entertainment company, had earlier this month offered to buy Cedar Fair for $3.4 billion in cash, according to a person familiar with the matter.
At the time, Sandusky, Ohio-based Cedar Fair confirmed it had received an unsolicited proposal but did not disclose the offer price. 

In 2019, Cedar Fair rejected a takeover offer of $4 billion, or about $70 per share, from larger peer Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) Entertainment Corp.

Revenue rose 42.6% from the same period last year, while it achieved record revenue for the full year of $2.31 billion, a 66.9% increase from 2020.

The company's forecast indicated the e-commerce boom seen during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic was cooling as more shoppers return to stores, prompting retailers to shift their focus to brick-and-mortar operations from online.
In their quest to make the online-shopping experience more rewarding during the pandemic, small and medium retailers splurged on spiffy websites, robust networks and faster delivery using software tools and payment services provided by companies such as Shopify.
But as that growth softens, Shopify is trying to create an integrated e-commerce model that focuses on logistics and warehouses to support its main businesses.
""We are shifting the network model really to larger capacity hubs, and we want to operate more of them ourselves,"" Shopify President Harley Finkelstein said. 
""Being able to offer (fulfillment services) to 90% of the U.S., 2-day affordable shipping, that really is the goal."" 
Shopify said it was estimating capital expenditure of $200 million in 2022 as it ramps up operations and was likely to spend about $1 billion on warehouse hubs in the following two years. 
Though Shopify's investment spending forecast for 2022 was greater than expected, its focus on fulfillment centers is a logical one, D.A. Davidson analyst Thomas Forte said. 
For the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, revenue rose 41% to $1.38 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $1.33 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Excluding items, it earned $1.36 per share, 9 cents above estimates.

(Reuters) -Kraft Heinz Co said on Wednesday it would raise the prices of its snacks and condiments further to counter soaring costs of raw materials and transportation, after posting quarterly earnings above market expectations. 
Shares of the Chicago-based company rose as much as about 6% in morning trading.
Packaged food makers were among the biggest pandemic winners last year as stuck-at-home consumers stockpiled on frozen meals, sauces and soups. 
A strained supply chain, however, has driven up freight and labor expenses and aggravated problems for companies like Kraft, Conagra and Kellogg (NYSE:K) that are grappling with surging costs of grains, meat and edible oils. 
""Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) is doing a better job of navigating rising costs and driving demand than we thought,"" Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said, adding that the company has laid a good foundation by lowering costs and divesting sluggish businesses.
Kraft, whose brands include Philadelphia Cream Cheese and Heinz ketchup, said it raised prices by 3.8 percentage points in the fourth quarter when demand for its products was also robust. Margins in 2021, as a result, were higher than in pre-pandemic 2019.
The company expects inflation to be in the low-teens percentage range for 2022, with higher levels in the first half than in the second, said Chief Financial Officer Paulo Basilio.
Kraft also sees full-year organic sales growing by a low-single-digit percentage, compared with a 1.8% rise in 2021.

(Reuters) - Global non-financial companies have issued the lowest debt volumes in three years in the first six weeks of 2022, deterred by rising interest rates as governments start scaling back their pandemic-era stimulus assistance. 
According to Refinitiv data, global non-financial companies have raised $207 billion between Jan 1. and Feb. 12, the lowest amount borrowed in that period since 2019. That compares with $318 billion collected in the last year. 
Global non-financial corporate debt issuance falls this year - https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-MARKETS/movanyrrkpa/chart.png 
The data includes high yield, investment grade and emerging market bonds issued by public and private companies in both local and foreign currencies
""In anticipation of the Federal Reserve tapering and initiating rate increases in March, market interest rates have already begun moving higher, increasing borrowing costs,"" said Jeff Bryden, portfolio manager at RMB Capital.
""Adding to these factors is the uncertainty and impact on economic growth that will accompany higher rates.""
The energy sector led this year's borrowing, issuing $46.6 billion worth, while companies in the industrial and real estate sectors raised $42.2 billion and $28 billion respectively. 
Global corporate debt issuance this year - https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-MARKETS/zjpqkallrpx/chart.png 
Since the start of the pandemic in 2020, global firms have borrowed heavily in debt markets, with weaker ones raising money for survival, while the stronger issued debt to fund consolidation and M&A activities. 
However, this year's rise in bond yields driven by expectations of Fed tightening has raised borrowing costs. 
The yield indicated on the ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA U.S. corporate index, which tracks dollar denominated investment grade rated corporate debt, rose to 3.1% on Wednesday, compared with 2.34% at the end of 2021.
Meanwhile, global companies' massive cash piles are also seen as another reason for lower bond issuance this year. 
""With roughly $3 trillion of cash and short-term securities on their balance sheets, non-financials have room to manoeuver without as much reliance on debt issuance,"" Nick Kraemer, head of S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings Performance Analytics, said in a report.
He also said Chinese issuers' deleveraging efforts would have a negative effect on global corporate debt borrowing this year. 
Chinese issuers account for roughly 24% of global non-financial and financial service issuance, according to the S&P Global data. 

Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at consulting firm RSM, said the lower debt issuance will have a cooling impact on economies as corporations slow expansion plans.
""We expect that this will be evident in the second half of the year in general and the final quarter of 2022 in particular,"" Brusuelas said.

1638,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 10:27AM ET</span>",Airbus reviews defence business as pressures mount,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has launched a review of its defence strategy that could open the door to more strategic partnerships as Europe's arms makers juggle security threats and pressure from some investors, people familiar with the matter said.
The most far-reaching examination of defence goals in years is being spearheaded by the company's board in a sign of growing independence from its government shareholders, though any major changes would need political backing of France and Germany.
Top management of Europe's biggest aerospace group strongly backs defence as a source of stable revenues, political support and access to R&D funding. But the mainly independent board has the final say on strategy, subject to national security.
The business faces a number of challenges, with France and Germany struggling to finalise plans for a costly new combat jet involving Airbus and Dassault Aviation, and the industry facing growing pressure from investors increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters.
In 2020, Airbus pledged to follow the path of aerospace firms that ""nurture a substantial defence and space element in their portfolio to gain synergies and increase stability.""
But the board, led by former Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) chief Rene Obermann, is carrying out a deeper than usual dive as part of a rotating study of Airbus businesses, the people said, declining to be named over confidential discussions. 
Airbus said it does not comment on any board discussions.
No immediate decisions are expected, though the people did not rule out more reliance on joint ventures or ""strategic partnerships"" to deliver on collaborative programmes.
The ESG issue came to the fore in September when Airbus was only able to join the enlarged DAX share index in Germany after a debate over inclusion of firms handling certain types of arms. 
Airbus builds launchers for France's nuclear deterrent but stresses it does not make warheads. Defence firms have also sought to draw a distinction between arms that preserve national security and more controversial weapons like landmines. 
Anti-arms industry groups reject such distinctions.
The issue weighs especially heavily as the European Union draws up a crucial list of socially sustainable investments.
""We have the first financial institutions that say we don't want to invest in such companies any more,"" Airbus Defence & Space CEO Michael Schoellhorn told journalists in November.
Chief Executive Guillaume Faury, who also heads France's main aerospace lobby, is leading an industry fightback and has questioned the logic of squeezing firms involved in national security at a time when the industry is also tackling emissions.
""There will be no decarbonisation if the world is in conflict ... if we don't ensure security,"" Faury told Reuters in November. ""We think security is at the core of ESG values.""
STEADY REVENUE
Airbus was born as a jetliner consortium in 1969 but today's group springs from a merger of civil and defence assets in 2000.
The creation that year of a new parent group, EADS, reflected the belief that Europe's fragmented arms sector needed to punch its weight against newly merged U.S. defence giants.
But efforts to balance civil and defence portfolios collapsed with the failed takeover of BAE Systems (OTC:BAESF) in 2012 and EADS was eventually folded into the core civil planemaker under a board that was handed greater independence from governments.
France and Germany maintain 11% each of the shares and a veto over certain strategic interests. 
Defence revenues across divisions have been broadly steady since Airbus sold its defence electronics business in 2017 to help pay for losses on the A400M airlifter, totalling just under 11 billion euros ($12.5 billion).
Although the lack of growth has attracted critics, such stability was welcomed when the pandemic slashed civil demand. France, Germany and Spain have also placed new defence orders.
Defence revenues as a percentage of the group total - 21% - was 4 percentage points higher in 2020 than in 2017 and matched levels last seen in 2012 when Airbus tried to forge Europe's largest defence company by buying BAE Systems.
That's in contrast to the situation in 2019 when a pre-pandemic boom in civil jets pushed defence revenues down to 14% of the total, the lowest share in at least a decade.
Threats have meanwhile expanded to included the crisis in Ukraine. Arms spending by European Union states rose 5% to 198 billion euros in 2020, according to the European Defence Agency. 
Although based in France, Airbus mainly represents Germany and Spain in European defence projects, with Germany's Green-backed coalition seen as less friendly to defence exports. 
""It is not an option for Airbus to get out of defence, it would cut the rope that provides backup from its core nations,"" a senior European defence source said.
However, some European defence sources and analysts say Airbus faces challenges to deliver its vision of a digitally interconnected ""combat cloud"" for Europe's new fighter jet project on its own after selling off electronics.
Airbus and Dassault have yet to agree a detailed work plan. ""(This) delay highlights far deeper tensions in the overall programme,"" Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa wrote in a note on Wednesday, adding France was increasingly considering a go-it-alone option to replace its Rafale warplanes.

Her departure follows a network investigation into the conduct of Chris Cuomo, a primetime CNN anchor fired in December for allegedly assisting his brother, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who was accused of sexual misconduct.
Jeff Zucker resigned as CNN president earlier this month, telling staff he had failed to disclose a consensual relationship with a colleague. CNN anchor Brian Stelter said at the time that the relationship was with Gollust, the chief marketing officer for the network.
WarnerMedia confirmed Gollust's resignation in a statement on Tuesday.
It said an investigation, performed by an independent law firm and led by a former federal judge, concluded over the weekend that Zucker, Gollust and Cuomo had violated company policies.
It was based on interviews with more than 40 people and a review of more than 100,000 texts and emails. 
""I realize this news is troubling, disappointing, and frankly, painful to read. These are valid feelings many of you have,"" Kilar wrote in the memo. 
""We have the highest standards of journalistic integrity at CNN, and those rules must apply to everyone equally. Given the information provided to me in the investigation, I strongly believe we have taken the right actions and the right decisions have been made.""
In a statement to Reuters on Wednesday, Gollust called WarnerMedia's statement ""deeply disappointing"" and ""an attempt to retaliate against me and change the media narrative in the wake of their disastrous handling of the last two weeks.""
A spokesperson for Chris Cuomo issued a statement on Tuesday asserting that Zucker and Gollust were both aware and ""fully supportive"" of what he was doing to help his brother. 
""The still open question is when WarnerMedia is going to release the results of its investigation and explain its supposed basis for terminating Mr. Cuomo,"" the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

Zucker could not immediately be reached for comment.

Earlier this month, SoftBank sought to list Arm after scrapping plans to sell the company to U.S. chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp in a deal valued at up to $80 billion.
Britain's Arm, which named a new chief executive last week, said it would go public before March 2023 and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son indicated that would be in the United States, most likely the Nasdaq.
The margin loan financing will be linked to Arm's initial public offering (IPO) stock and is one option under consideration, according to the report. 
Such loans allow companies to borrow money against the value of securities owned. SoftBank in 2020 revealed plans to borrow up to 500 billion yen ($4.33 billion) from 16 domestic and foreign financial institutions by using almost a third of its stake in telco SoftBank Corp as collateral.
For Arm, banks are planning to pitch IPO valuations of more than $50 billion, the report said.
SoftBank did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
The Japanese conglomerate acquired Arm, whose technology powers Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhone and nearly all other smartphones, in 2016 for $32 billion.
Arm licenses its architecture and technology to customers such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, Apple and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd which design chips for devices from mobile phones to computers.

Kraft expects 2022 organic sales to grow by a low-single-digit percentage, compared with a 1.8% rise in 2021. Adjusted earnings at the base operating level are seen at $5.9 billion at the center of its guidance range.
Net sales fell 3.3%, to $6.7 billion, owing to an impact from acquisitions and divestitures.
The company booked a net loss of $257 million in the quarter, mainly due to non-cash impairment losses. However, on an adjusted basis, it booked a profit, and on per share basis, it came in at 79 cents to beat estimates.

1642,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 10:06AM ET</span>",Bank of America's CEO says consumer spending levels continue to grow,"By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said on Tuesday that consumer spending has continued to grow so far in February, indicating that the recovery the bank has seen in restaurant and other spending categories is ongoing.
""When you look at the core spending levels of consumers, they continue to be very strong,"" Moynihan said in an interview on CNBC. ""We said January (spending) was up 15% to 20%. We're seeing that continue into February.""
Moynihan, who leads the second-largest U.S. bank, said customers are spending more across the board, including at restaurants, as concern over the Omicron variant of COVID-19 wanes. 
In January, combined credit and debit card spending by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) customers was up 16% to $65 billion compared to January 2021, with credit card spending alone up 28%, the bank said earlier this month.

The amount of money customers have in their checking and savings accounts in January was also up 15% year-over-year.
Moynihan said these and other trends are broadly positive for the economy. On the subject of corporations, he said that current corporate debt levels do not pose any significant economic threat.

Investing.com -- Shares of Wix.Com Ltd (NASDAQ:WIX) plunged more than 27% Wednesday after the company reported its earnings before the opening bell, missing revenue expectations and not providing annual guidance due to higher volatility in demand. 
The cloud-based website builder announced a loss per share of 37 cents on revenue of $328.34 million. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated a per-share loss of 37 cents on revenue of $331.95 million.
However, the company said that due to heightened volatility in demand for online services over the last year and a half because of Covid, it is not able to provide a forecast ""with the same level of confidence"" as it has historically been able to pre-Covid, despite fundamentals remaining strong.
They added: ""as of today, we expect total revenue in Q1 2022 to be $338M - $343M, representing 11% - 13% y/y growth. Given Q1 2021 saw revenue grow 41% y/y, it is the most difficult y/y comparable we face in 2022, and we expect y/y growth of total revenue to accelerate each quarter through the end of 2022.""
The report prompted Guggenheim analyst Ken Wong to immediately downgrade the stock to neutral from buy. The analyst said in a note that he interprets the lack of guidance as a sign of ""sub-seasonal growth"" despite acceleration expectations, and he believes Wix shares will be categorized as a ""value trap"" for the foreseeable future.

1644,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 09:52AM ET</span>",Wall Street Opens Lower as Retail Sales Revive Inflation Fears; Dow Down 120 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Wednesday after economic data regained center stage, reminding participants of pervasive inflation and a likely tightening of monetary policy in response. 
The Commerce Department said retail sales rose by 3.8% in January, their strongest monthly gain since March, when households were still receiving large amounts of income support from the government. That figure was well ahead of expectations and confirmed the impression that households are having to spend more as inflation spreads across the U.S.  The numbers made for an awkward prelude to the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting, which are due at 2 PM ET. 
By 9:50 AM ET (1450 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 123 points, or 0.4%, at 34,866 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.7% and the NASDAQ Composite was down 1.3%. 
""The strength of this rebound adds credence to the idea that December sales were weak largely because people pulled holiday purchases forward, fearing shortages of popular items,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics. They then reverted to the mean in January. As a result, he argued, first-quarter GDP estimates are likely to be revised sharply higher, giving the Fed greater confidence that the economy can cope with a rapid tightening of policy to bring inflation back down.  The picture of an economy taking the disruptions of the Omicron Covid-19 wave in its stride was further rounded out by figures showing industrial production rose 1.4% in January, well ahead of estimates. 
Considerations as to what the numbers meant for the likely path of interest rates were obvious in the reactions to below-par reports from two long-duration technology names. Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) stock fell 24% while Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) stock fell 16.5% after both companies reporting slowing growth in the fourth quarter. Companies like Roblox and Shopify, whose valuations have depended on assumptions of easy money well into the future, are particularly sensitive to any suggestion of rising interest rates.
On a heavy day for earnings, medical technology company Masimo (NASDAQ:MASI) also fell 33% after it announced the acquisition of Sound United, a deal that was poorly received due to the perceived lack of overlap between the two businesses. Website design company Wix (NASDAQ:WIX) also fell 27% after a disappointing forecast for the current quarter, while ViacomCBS Inc (NASDAQ:VIAC) stock fell 20% after its earnings revived fears that its need to invest heavily in its streaming platform will be a drag on earnings for several quarters, if not years. 
Stocks with better present cash flow performed markedly better in early trading. Shale oil and gas company  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) rose 6.8% after it raised its dividend and increased its buyback, and chose not to increase capital spending and production this year.  Kraft Heinz  (NASDAQ:KHC) stock rose 4.1% after it too reported better-than-expected earnings, while Heineken (OTC:HEINY) ADRs rose 0.3% after the world's second-largest brewer said its strategy of premiumization had helped it to absorb higher input costs in the fourth quarter.

Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust's (BREIT) all-cash offer of $25 per share is nearly 40% higher than Preferred Apartment's stock close on Feb. 9, a day before media reports on the company exploring strategic options including a sale. 
The real estate investment trust's shares shot up 7% to $25.04 before the bell following the news. 
Blackstone's offer comes at a time when a strong economic recovery, ultra-low interest rates and continued demand for bigger homes have driven up home prices in the United States. The private equity giant also bought Home Partners of America in a $6 billion deal last year.
 Preferred Apartment Communities  (NYSE:APTS) is a rental apartment owner that primarily owns and operates multifamily properties, with investments in grocery-anchored shopping centers as well. 
BREIT invests in stabilized, income-generating U.S. commercial real estate across key property types including residential, industrial, hotel, retail and office. 

The terms of the deal include a 30-day ""go-shop"" period expiring on March 18, during which Preferred Apartment is allowed to seek alternate bids.
The deal is expected to close towards the second quarter of this year.

Even after being caught up in the selloff that’s pummeled fast-growing technology stocks, Nvidia trades at about 50 times projected profit and is 2-1/2 times more expensive than the Philadelphia semiconductor index average, according to Bloomberg data.
Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson expects a “strong” fourth-quarter and outlook when the maker of graphics processors reports later on Wednesday. “Our concern remains predominantly tied to valuation,” he said.
The stakes have never been this high for Nvidia as the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hike path has roiled stocks with extreme valuations. The shares have been a star performer over the past decade, returning a whopping 7,000%, although more than $170 billion in market value was wiped out in the recent selloff.
What’s more, analysts see more gains: 39 of the 47 that cover the stock have buy ratings and the average price target points to 30% upside in the next 12 months. However, the combination of rapid revenue growth and a lofty valuation has made Nvidia prone to violent swings, such as the final three months of 2018 when it tumbled more than 50%.
Rising Estimates
Investors will be looking for forecasts and commentary in the earnings that show Nvidia is expanding at a clip that can support its valuation, especially in its data center business. Despite the recent share-price drop, analyst estimates for revenue and profit in the current fiscal year have crept up in the past two months, according to Bloomberg data.
For the fourth quarter, Nvidia is projected to deliver earnings per share excluding some items of $1.22 on revenue of $7.4 billion. That would represent year-on-year growth of 58% and 48%, respectively.
“Nvidia is very expensive, but it is expected to grow much faster than other names in the space,” Deepon Nag, senior research analyst for technology hardware at Clearbridge Investments, said in an interview. “The near-term setup looks pretty favorable.”
Tech Chart of the Day
The NYSE Fang+ Index, home to the likes of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., is underperforming the benchmark S&P 500 Index in the first quarter to date. If losses hold, it will mark a third straight quarter of decline. Investors have been reducing bets on these fast-growing stocks as central bankers prepare to raise rates rapidly.

1648,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 09:32AM ET</span>","Google keeps Android ad tool into at least 2024, exploring other options","By Paresh Dave
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google on Wednesday said it would keep alive for at least two years a tracking technology on its Android phones that is relied upon by advertisers, easing speculation about its plans after Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) frustrated the ad industry by restricting a similar tool.
Google said it would give ""substantial notice"" before axing what is known as AdId. But it will immediately begin seeking feedback on its proposed alternatives, which Google said aim to better protect users' privacy and curb covert surveillance. 
Advertisers, app makers and hundreds of small ad tech companies had expected changes to AdId after Apple last April forced software makers to seek user permission to track behavior across multiple apps through its comparable tool, called IDFA.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms Inc said this month it expects to lose $10 billion in ad sales this year due to Apple's change, one of a number of companies that have reported hits from the move. IDFA and AdId help in determining relevant ads and identifying subsequent purchases. But as users declined tracking, advertisers pared spending.
Google and Apple, which make the dueling operating systems used in most of the world's smartphones and tablets, have faced pressure over the past few years from regulators and new laws to give users greater control over the data apps collect.
Google said it would work with app makers such as  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) and Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) to design tools that support targeting ads and logging clicks while limiting access to personal information.

An earlier move by Google to eliminate tracking technology in its Chrome browser by the end of 2023 led some of the company's ad tech rivals to complain to competition authorities.
Last week, Google finalized a deal to have the U.K. antitrust regulator monitor the Chrome project. Google said it would apply the agreement's principles, including treating itself the same as any rival, to the Android work.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Luxury automaker Jaguar Land Rover and Silicon Valley artificial intelligence company Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) said Wednesday they will collaborate to develop the computer brains and nervous systems for Jaguars and Land Rovers launching in 2025 and beyond. 
The companies did not disclose financial terms of their multiyear agreement. The collaboration is a high-profile win for  Nvidia Corp 's effort to expand its reach in the auto industry, building on its base in gaming, artificial intelligence and high-powered chips and software used in servers. 
For Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc, the partnership with Nvidia gives it a well-funded ally as it tries to catch up with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and other luxury vehicle rivals in a digital technology arms race.
""We can now accelerate our in-vehicle software,"" Francois Dossa, JLR's executive director for strategy, said during a conference call.
Working with Nvidia engineers, Jaguar Land Rover plans to develop vehicles that can drive themselves under certain conditions, park autonomously and provide more information and software-powered features to drivers, the companies said. The new Jaguars will be upgradable - as Tesla vehicles are today. The automaker said it will use Nvidia technology to power simulations used to train autonomous vehicles.
Jaguar Land Rover has a previous deal with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo unit to deploy autonomous driving technology. Dossa said the Waymo collaboration was limited to the Jaguar I-PACE electric SUV. The Nvidia alliance covers all Jaguar and Land Rover models to be launched from 2025.
Nvidia technology will act as the brains and the nervous system of Jaguar Land Rover vehicles starting in 2025, said Nvidia's vice president of automotive, Danny Shapiro.

Nvidia last month announced deals with several Chinese electric vehicle brands. The company has said it has $8 billion in automotive business booked over the next six years. Shapiro said the company will update the figure during an investor day scheduled for March 22. 
Jaguar Land Rover, a subsidiary of India's  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM) Ltd has been struggling with rising costs and semiconductor shortages. Jaguar Land Rover reported a narrow pretax profit for the quarter ended Dec. 31, but Tata Motors reported a larger quarterly loss than expected.

O'Leary told reporters in Lisbon that the airline still expected prices to be lower than 2019 levels from March to May but said they would increase starting from June, when schools will shut for holidays and families travel abroad. 
""After that it will depend on what happens with the world economy, the price of oil and if there are any COVID developments,"" he said.

1651,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 09:23AM ET</span>","Wall Street eyes Walmart results for signs of tighter margins, slower growth","By Arriana McLymore and Siddharth Cavale
NEW YORK, NY (Reuters) - When Walmart (NYSE:WMT) on Thursday reports how it fared during the holiday quarter, investors also will want to see how higher labor, transportation and materials may affect the retailer's margins, given its ""Everyday Low Price"" strategy. 
Refinitiv estimates total gross margins to be 23.90% in the fourth quarter, down from 25.26% in the prior quarter, while revenue is expected to fall 0.6% to $151.15 billion.
Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner said on a November call with analysts that Walmart would be ""the last"" major retailer to raise prices on its merchandise, thanks to its relationships with suppliers. 
""We've got so many suppliers to work with, and choose from ...that can do things"" to keep prices low despite inflation, he said. ""As the months progress, we expect to find more"" suppliers willing to roll back prices, he said at the time.​
But some investors questioned whether Walmart suppliers would be receptive to keeping prices low. Walmart's total gross margins have fallen in each of the last two quarters and were particularly weak in the United States in the previous quarter, its first decline since the start of the pandemic, D.A. Davidson analysts said in a note. 
""In an inflationary environment, we think that ... there is going to be a significant margin pinch at Walmart,"" said Josh Smith, lead portfolio manager at Capital Wealth Planning LLC. 
Although Walmart was one of Smith's top holdings since 2020, his fund sold its shares in early February. ""For a stock trading over 40 times earnings and for a company that is not growing at 15% per year ... we just think it is expensive and there are better alternatives right now,"" he said.
Walmart CEO Doug McMillon previously has described the 4,700 U.S. store chain as an ""inflation fighter"" that provides shoppers with bargains without having to wait for special promotions and sales events. 
The spread of the Omicron variant in the United States late last year has further strained supply chains and led to higher costs. 
U.S. inflation rose 7.5% year-over-year in January, marking the largest annual gain in four decades. Across the U.S. online retail landscape, prices for groceries jumped 5.8% in January, a record high, according to the Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Digital Price Index.
Advertising revenue gleaned by Walmart could cushion some of the hit to its gross margins. Walmart sells digital ad space to consumer product companies and other major advertisers, through Walmart Connect, launched in late January 2021. Keybanc analysts expect Connect to earn over $3 billion in pre-tax earnings over time, helping Walmart offset higher costs. 
Analysts are also watching any impact to Walmart Plus, the grocery-delivery subscription service that is open to shoppers who pay $12.95 per month. Rival Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently increased the monthly fee for Prime to $14.99 from $12.99. 
Walmart's shares are down 8% for the year through mid-February. In comparison, Costco (NASDAQ:COST)'s shares are down 11%, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) shares are down 15% and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) TGT.N> shares are down 10%.
Dave Harden, chief investment officer at Summit Global Investments, which holds more than $50 million shares of Walmart stock, said when the market is volatile, ""it performs well.""
Randy Hare, director of Equity Research at Huntington Private Bank, said that if the economy goes into a recession, ""that's the type of environment where we really like Walmart,"" Hare's firm owns more than $40 million in Walmart shares.

""When you get a slowing economy,"" shoppers become ""a little bit more price conscious,"" and more likely to seek out bargains at Walmart, he said.

Investing.com --  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) stock rose 1.8% in premarket trading on Wednesday after the company resisted the temptation to cash in on the current boom in oil prices by pumping more. 
Instead, the company kept its production guidance for the year unchanged, with a slight dip in the first quarter expected due to severe weather. 
The shale oil and gas producer reported late on Tuesday that its operating cash flow tripled and free cash flow hit an all-time high of $2.9 billion last year, as crude prices rebounded from the initial shock of the pandemic. Revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $1.39 were both more than 10% ahead of expectations.
However, it chose to use the windfall to reward long-suffering shareholders, who had seen the stock lose over 90% from its 2014 high by the middle of 2020. The board increased the company's share buyback program by $600 million to $1.6 billion, and also raised the fixed component of its dividend by 45% to 5 cents a share - a sign that it sees an improvement in its medium-term cash generation potential. The overwhelming majority of the dividend is tied to free cash flow, and the improvement on that score took the total dividend to $1.00 a share.
Devon said it had made no changes to its capital spending plans for the year, which will stay in a range of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion. As such, it expects output to be between 570,000 and 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. That's below the 611,000 barrels a day it had produced in the fourth quarter. 
Devon's results may provoke dismay in Washington, D.C., where the administration of President Joe Biden is facing increasing political pressure because of the rise in gasoline prices over the last year.

Higher inflation and a return to offline shopping are also expected to keep Shopify’s revenue growth under pressure.
The company rode the pandemic to help merchants set up online stores through subscription-based software tools, while offering services for shipping and payments. That growth is set to ebb now.
""We believe that the Covid-triggered acceleration of ecommerce that spilled into the first half of 2021 in the form of lockdowns and government stimulus will be absent from 2022, and there is caution around inflation and consumer spend near term,"" the company said in a statement.
The company also warned about changes in its partnership terms with apps and theme developers hurting its subscriptions solutions revenue in the first half, particularly in the first quarter.
As a result, it expects 2022 revenue growth to be lower than the 57% rise in 2021.
December-quarter revenue was 41% higher at $1.4 billion, beating estimates.
Gross merchandise volume, a metric defining the total value of all transactions on an online platform, jumped 31% to exceed $54 billion.
On an adjusted basis, Shopify earned $1.36 per share, beating estimates.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's Saipem is set to take a more cautious approach to new green business after delays to a wind farm project helped to tip the energy contractor into issuing a profit warning, two sources close to the matter said on Wednesday.
Saipem, a market leader in subsea exploration and construction and provider of services to the oil industry, has been looking to offshore wind as part of a shift in focus to meet a growing client focus on green technologies.
But the transition is difficult as renewable energy requires a different set of skills to guarantee the kind of returns Saipem has achieved from its traditional fossil fuel business.
Last month, Saipem downgraded its earnings by one billion euros ($1.14 billion) due to a ""significant deterioration"" in margins for some contracts including offshore wind. 
Its Chief Executive Francesco Caio was forced to pull a plan only presented in October and the company is racing to draw up a turnaround strategy, with adviser Rothschild.
Speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, one of the sources said Saipem needed to focus more on its legacy business where its expertise is established and take more time to learn new skills needed for the renewables business.
A second source said that while margins in offshore wind could be better, the risks were higher for a company that needed time to build up experience.
Saipem declined to comment.
Saipem's problems have focused attention on the difficulties faced by energy contractors as they try to manage the transition to servicing renewable energy products without sacrificing other parts of their business.
Problems over seabed foundations led to delays at the Neart na Gaoithe wind farm off Scotland that Saipem is helping France's EDF (PA:EDF) and Ireland's ESB build. 
On Wednesday Italy daily Il Sole 24 Ore said Saipem's new general manager had outlined to the board steps needed to turn the contractor round, including a renewed focus on legacy work.
""We believe the market would appreciate the focus on the de-risking of the backlog,"" Banca IMI (LON:IMI) analyst Roberto Ranieri said in a research note. 
Saipem, controlled by energy group Eni and state lender CDP, will present a revised business plan on March 16 that is expected to include a capital increase and debt restructuring.

One of the sources said asset disposals were also being considered but cautioned any sale could be difficult in current market conditions. Saipem has previously said it was open to bringing partners on board for its drilling business

SEOUL (Reuters) - Unionised workers of Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) have threatened what would be an unprecedented strike at the tech giant if their demands for higher pay and better working conditions are not met.
Union representatives held a rally on Wednesday near Samsung (KS:005930)'s headquarters in midtown Seoul after government arbitration broke down earlier this week. They are calling for wage gaps among employees to be narrowed, more paid leave and better health benefits.
""There are many options, one of which is a strike,"" said Kim Hang-yeol, head of one of the four unions representing Samsung Electronics workers. 
""We will continue to fight to ensure wage negotiations and collective bargaining with not only Samsung Electronics, but also all unions of Samsung affiliates."" 
Union officials sought a direct meeting with the top management of the sprawling conglomerate's flagship chipmaker and world's top smartphone manufacturer.
The potential impact on the company's operations is not clear as the largest of the four unions, the National Samsung Electronics Union, has roughly 4,500 members, about 4% of the 114,373 employees in the country.
Union members are also wary of antagonising the public at a time of growing discontent over working conditions and pay inequity. 
""We don't want a strike at a chip line. If I said we want to stop a chip line that would make us into a public enemy,"" said Lee Hyun-kuk, another union official. 
The unions declined to comment on how many of their members were in the chip division. 
Samsung Electronics said in a statement: ""The company continues to engage in dialogue with the unions and is making every sincere effort to come to an agreement.""

The company, founded in 1969, avoided unionisation until the end of 2010s. Its leader Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee has since pledged to ""establish a sound labour-management culture.""
""South Korea's culture and economic situation has changed,"" said Taeyoon Sung, Professor of Economics at Yonsei University. ""Samsung Electronics, which was not affected by union activities in the past, must view unions as a partner, while unions may find it difficult to strike due to negative views against strong labour responses.""

1658,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 08:36AM ET</span>",Cathie Wood’s ARKK Is a Year From Its Peak and Still Struggling,"(Bloomberg) -- Cathie Wood’s flagship exchange-traded fund peaked on Feb. 16, 2021. One year and a 53% drop later, there could still be plenty of pain ahead for her beloved disruptive-tech chasing strategy.
The ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) has stabilized since a precipitous decline last month -- it’s roughly flat in February -- but the headwinds facing its speculative growth picks are only growing. Not only are yields rising as investors prepare for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates -- bad news for unprofitable companies -- but the economic reopening is hammering many of the businesses which thrived in the pandemic.
Top ARKK holdings like  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc., Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) Health Inc. and  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc. -- winners in the work-from-home era -- are down as much as 74% in the past 12 months. 
Small wonder short bets against ARKK jumped to a fresh record of 11.4% of shares outstanding this week, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd. The Tuttle Capital Short Innovation ETF (NASDAQ:SARK), which famously delivers the inverse of ARKK’s performance, now has more than $300 million in assets.
“Those stocks are supported by speculation and when the Fed is raising rates, speculation doesn’t pay as much,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co. “A lot of what’s happening in the market reminds me of what happened in the late 1990s, where parts of the market were bid up to levels based upon what people thought they’d be in the future.”
Parallels with that era and the dot-com bust that followed are increasingly used in discussions of ARKK because its price chart is eerily similar to that of the Nasdaq index of tech stocks more than two decades ago.
“Today marks the 253rd trading day from ARKK’s all-time high and on the same day in 2001 the Nasdaq was down 60% from its dot-com bubble peak,” Jessica Rabe,  co-founder of DataTrek Reserach, wrote in a Tuesday note. “If the 2000/2001 analog continues, we can expect ARKK to continue trending lower over the next three weeks. The Nasdaq dropped 18.7% over the following 16 trading days.”
The good news for investors and Wood is that there could be some temporary relief after that. Back in 2001 the Nasdaq then rallied 41% over the course of around six weeks, before resuming its declines.
A spokesperson for Wood’s ARK Investment Management didn’t respond to a request for comment. 
Working in ARKK’s favor: Most of its $15 billion decline in assets has stemmed from performance. Since it hit an intraday high of $159.70 a year ago Wednesday, investors have pulled only about $465 million from the fund, and ARKK’s net flows in 2022 are actually positive despite a more than 20% slump. 
This remarkable loyalty helps prevent a greater unwind, and buys Wood’s strategy time to rebound. The star manager has kept conviction in many top picks and continuously stressed that her funds have a five-year investment horizon.
But to Schutte, the downturn makes sense because so many of its biggest bets, like Teladoc and Zoom, are getting less relevant as Covid ebbs.
“During the pandemic there were all kinds of questions about what would become of society, how would we go about life after the pandemic,” he said. “You attracted new investors into the market who were more about ‘what are the themes of the future that I should invest in’? And I just think you’ve had a wash out of that.”

Verdun's owner, the buyout firm EnCap Investments LP, had agreed to take over rival EP Energy's assets in the Eagle Ford and Uinta basins around August last year in a $1.5 billion deal.
However, Reuters reported on Tuesday that U.S. antitrust regulators, in a rare move, threatened to block EnCap's takeover of the EP Energy assets, citing concerns about the buyout firm's dominance in the Uinta shale play.
To resolve the regulator's concerns and avoid a legal challenge, EP Energy put the oil-producing acreage in Utah for sale again, according to the report.
Crescent said on Wednesday its acquisition of the assets will immediately add to its cash flow. The company plans to operate two rigs in the basin for the rest of the year after the deal closes, which is expected in the first half of 2022.
Houston, Texas-based Crescent Energy was formed last year by a merger between buyout firm KKR's Independence Energy and Contango Oil & Gas Co.

Hospitality companies around the globe have benefited from higher travel demand during the fourth quarter with more people checking into hotels during the holiday period, boosting occupancy rates to near pre-pandemic levels. 
Hilton reported comparable RevPAR (revenue per available room) of $84.14 for the fourth quarter, as occupancy rates across its hotels rose to 61.3% from 20.7% a year earlier.
Peer Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) Inc also topped analyst estimates for quarterly results on Tuesday, with occupancy rates in its U.S. and Canada region jumping to 60% from 35.1% a year earlier.
Occupancy at Hilton's U.S. and Canada region nearly tripled to 63.3% in the quarter. 
Hilton Chief Executive Officer Christopher Nassetta said he remains confident about a recovery across segments in 2022, despite facing a short-term impact from newer variants of COVID-19 in 2021. 

The company reported net income attributable to shareholders of $147 million, or 52 cents per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared to a net loss of $224 million, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, Hilton earned 72 cents per share compared with Refinitv IBES estimates of 70 cents per share, while fourth-quarter revenue nearly doubled to $1.84 billion compared to estimates of $1.83 billion.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's Atos aims to double its global market share in supercomputing to about 16% by around 2026, one of its executive said, stepping up European competition in a field dominated by the United States and China. 
The technology and IT consulting firm presented on Wednesday a new generation of supercomputer, dubbed BullSequana XH3000, able to perform up to one billion operations per second. 
This level of calculation capacity will help with challenges ranging from simulating the effects of new drugs and nuclear fission to forecasting weather and climate change, it said. 
""It's basically like a chassis that will carry any engine, and link it to other chassis in order to carry more load,"" said Arnaud Bertrand, the head of strategy and innovation at Atos' cybersecurity and supercomputing unit BDS. 
Bertrand said Atos was aiming to double its global market share in supercomputing over the next three to four years from about 8% currently. The group doesn't disclose its financial targets for the activity. 
Atos's supercomputer, designed and made in the city of Angers in western France, delivers six times more computing power than its previous version, the company said. 
Today's heavyweights in supercomputing are U.S. firm Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) and China's Lenovo Group (OTC:LNVGY), Bertrand said. Other rivals include China's Sugon and Japan's Fujitsu. 
Atos is the only major European manufacturer of so called high performance computing products (HPC), a technology deemed strategic by France and the European Union, which co-finances EuroHPC, a joint venture between European countries and private organisations.
EuroHPC is one of Atos' top three clients, along with France's atomic energy commission CEA and the government of India. 

Key components of Atos' supercomputers still come from Asia and the United States, however. The group is aiming to relocate part of the production in Europe, Bertrand said. 
""We can't ask China and the United States for their authorization if tomorrow we want to know the impact of human activity on climate or if we want to develop the next generation of drugs,"" he said.

Investing.com – Roblox stock (NYSE:RBLX) tumbled 16% as its fourth-quarter numbers disappointed, reflecting slowing growth at the gaming platform.
The platform gained popularity in the last two years as home-stuck players used its tools to create their own games and play with others. With most of its users in the 9-12 age group, the return to school for many, and lifting of restrictions, means the platform is now in far less use.
“Specifically, users, engagement hours, payers, and bookings, are all at (or near) all-time high levels, but growth rates have declined as we are comparing, in some cases, to quarters last year in which certain key metrics doubled or even nearly tripled,” CEO and Founder, David Baszucki said in a letter to shareholders.
The results mark Roblox’s first full-year disclosures since it listed in March 2021.
Growth in both bookings and daily active users fell short of expectations.
Bookings refer to Roblox's virtual currency ‘Robux’ that players buy to upgrade their avatars by buying in-game items such as clothing, pets, collectibles or accessories. They rose 20% to $770 million.
Average daily active users rose by a third year-on-year to almost 50 million.
Overall, fourth-quarter revenue jumped 83% to $569 million. Adjusted loss per share was 25 cents and wider than expected.
The company gave some numbers for January as well. DAUs rose 32% to near 55 million, with revenue seen between $203 million and $206 million. Bookings growth was up 2%-4% from a year earlier."

Investing.com -- Wynn Resorts Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) stock fell in premarket trading on Wednesday after the casino operator signaled that the pandemic isn’t yet done with it.
Wynn said it will sell the land and buildings associated with its Encore Boston Harbor casino to the Real Estate Investment Trust  Realty Income  (NYSE:O) for $1.7 billion to free up capital after two years in which the casino business has been among the worst hit by health restrictions both in the U.S. and China.
Wynn’s rent for the Encore Boston Harbor will start at $100 million annually.
Wynn had spent $2.6 billion getting Massachusetts’ first casino up and running, but it was only able to operate for a year before the pandemic struck.
There were the expected signs of a rebound in business in Wynn’s fourth-quarter earnings, which were also released late on Tuesday. The company’s net loss declined to $177 million from $269 million a year earlier, but was still around 10% wider than expected at $1.37 a share. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization more than doubled to $149 million. 
However, the company is still withholding guidance for the coming year, saying that the outlook is simply too unclear. 
“Given the evolving conditions created by and in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, measures that have been lifted may be reintroduced if there are adverse developments with respect to Covid-19, and management continues to be unable to reasonably estimate the impact of such developments to the company’s future results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition,” the company said in its earnings release.
Wynn’s stock has risen some 12% since the start of the year despite the latest wave of Covid-19 providing a temporary setback to visits. That’s mainly because Chinese regulators have indicated they are not likely to make major changes to the licensing regime in Macau, which would allow it to continue operating there largely as it does at present. A final decision is due in June.  "

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Wix (NASDAQ:WIX).com, which helps small businesses build and operate websites, reported on Wednesday a wider fourth-quarter loss and said it could not provide estimates for 2022 due to uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
""We have experienced a much higher level of volatility in demand for online services over the last year and a half due to COVID,"" Wix said. ""As a result, we are not able to forecast our business with the same level of confidence as we have historically been able to pre-COVID, even as fundamentals remain strong.
""As long as we are in a period of heightened volatility, we will not be providing annual guidance for bookings, revenue or free cash flow,"" it said, noting it would still provide quarterly outlooks as well as forward expectations in quarterly earnings releases.
The Israeli company reported a quarterly net loss excluding one-time items of 37 cents per share, compared with a loss of 3 cents a year earlier. Revenue grew 16% to $328.3 million.
Analysts had forecast Wix would lose 38 cents per share ex-items on revenue of $331 million, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
For all of 2021, Wix posted a net loss ex-items of $1.39 per share, versus a 48 cent loss in 2020 and expectations of a loss of $1.41. Revenue grew 29% to $1.27 billion.
""We exited 2021 with fundamentals of our business at much higher levels than when we entered the pandemic, positioning us for success in the coming years, and we are clear on what needs to be done to maintain this momentum,"" said CEO Avishai Abrahami.
The company said it expected first-quarter revenue of $338-$343 million, growth of 11-13% over the same period in 2021.

At the end of 2021, Wix had 222 million registered users, up 13% over 2020. It added 478,000 net premium subscriptions to reach 6 million, an annual gain of 9%.
The company's shares are down 27% so far this year after a 37% drop in 2021.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Shares of Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) fell more than 12% on Wednesday after the Swedish telecom gear maker disclosed results of an internal investigation that detailed suspect payments and misconduct in Iraq.
The company's investigation had identified payments made to use alternate transport routes in connection with circumventing Iraqi Customs, at a time when militant organisations, including Islamic State, also known as ISIS, controlled some routes.
While Ericsson said it could not determine if any employee was directly involved in financing such organisations, it noted that as a result of the investigation several employees had left the company.
Ericsson CEO told Reuters in an interview that when the investigation closed in 2019 the company did not find it material enough to disclose the findings. 
The company revisited its stance after enquiries about the probe from media outlets, including from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).
The ICIJ said Ericsson did not address specific questions in relation to a wide range of corrupt behaviour in connection to its business in Iraq and elsewhere.
""At any point in time, there are multiple investigations taking place,"" Ekholm said. ""There are some who want to take advantage of the system. So the key is to have in place a compliance system that uncovers them very quickly, and that we can take swift remediation actions on those.""
The company had faced fines from the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) earlier to resolve a separate series of probes into corruption, including involving the bribing of government officials. 

If the U.S. DoJ finds reason to look into it, this could result in large fines, according to Mads Rosendal, an analyst with Danske Bank Credit Research.
""We believe the key is what may come out of the investigation and if there is any reason for authorities to have a closer look,"" he said.

The company had said last year it would build a new state-of-the-art car factory close to its headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, to raise its game as electric-vehicle rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) builds a plant near Berlin.
The factory is part of VW group's Trinity project, under which the carmaker wants to build a flagship electric sedan in Wolfsburg from 2026, a move the VW works council - the company's union - hopes will secure the site's future as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) prepares to stop selling internal combustion-engine cars in Europe from 2035.
""We are fighting for Trinity production right here in Wolfsburg, which means either on the factory site or in the direct vicinity of the main plant,"" works council head Daniela Cavallo said in a statement.
Volkswagen's share price tumbled in the last quarter of 2021 but has partially recovered in recent months, rising slightly on Wednesday's news from 187.8 euros ($213.81) at the opening to 188.14 euros.
The works council said Volkswagen produced 330,000 fewer vehicles than originally planned at the Wolfsburg plant last year due to a lack of semiconductors, with just under 400,000 vehicles rolling off the production line.
The carmaker said in early February that night shifts at Wolfsburg would be cut on some production lines because of the lack of chips.
Despite the chip supply challenges, Chief Executive Herbert Diess said in another statement on Wednesday he hoped to increase production in the second half, with top models of Volkswagen's premium brands already sold out for all of 2022, and its truck businesses also seeing well-filled order books.

""The coming months will be hard, but we will carry on being the leading plant for the whole Volkswagen Group here in Wolfsburg. This is where we set the direction for the company,"" Cavallo said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Wednesday, handing back some of the previous session’s hefty gains as doubts emerge about the veracity of Russia’s claims that it was withdrawing some troops from the Ukraine border.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 40 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 5 points, or 0.1%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 10 points, or 0.1%.
The major indices posted strong gains on Tuesday as geopolitical tensions eased after the Russian defense ministry published footage to show it was returning some troops to base after exercises.
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped over 400 points, or 1.2%, while the broad-based S&P 500 gained 1.6% and the Nasdaq Composite outperformed, soaring 2.5%.
However, this optimistic tone took a blow Wednesday after NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called into question the Russian troop movement claims.
""It remains to be seen whether there is a Russian withdrawal ... What we see is that they have increased the number of troops, and more troops are on the way,"" he said at the start of a two-day meeting of NATO defence ministers at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels.
Away from Eastern Europe, investors are cautiously awaiting the release of the minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting, at 2 PM ET (1900 GMT), for clues as to the policymaker's thoughts about raising interest rates aggressively in March.
Producer price data showed a greater than expected increase in January on Tuesday, another sign of lingering inflationary pressures, and comes after consumer prices rose to the highest annual level in 40 years last week.
Retail sales are also due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), and are seen rising by 2% month-on-month in January after their higher-than-expected fall of 1.9% in December.
Turning to the corporate sector, earnings are due from the likes of tech conglomerate Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), hotel chain Hyatt (NYSE:H), theater chains AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and chip maker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
Additionally, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock will be in the spotlight after the home rental company’s fourth-quarter results reinforced a trend toward longer stays and higher average spending by guests.
ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) will also be in focus with investors fretting that the media giant’s bet on the streaming business will need a hefty investment to compete with big players Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney+ (NYSE:DIS).
Oil prices rose Wednesday, regaining some ground after the previous session’s sharp losses on the easing of tensions on the Ukraine border. 
Elsewhere, crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, released on Tuesday, showed a draw of just over 1 million barrels for last week. Investors now await crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due later in the day.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% higher at $93.35 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.4% to $94.62. Both benchmarks fell over 3% on Tuesday, the biggest one-day loss this year.

(Reuters) -Schindler warned of lower profit in 2022 and contraction in its China business due to construction delays and other issues after the maker of elevators and escalators posted lower quarterly earnings.
The Swiss firm expects a ""significant"" profitability drop of around 20% for the first half of the year, Chief Financial Officer Urs Scheidegger said on a conference call.
""If the overall profitability of the group is dropping now in the first half year, you can see this is also the case for our China profitability,"" Scheidegger added.
Regulatory curbs on borrowing have driven China's property sector into a liquidity crisis, highlighted by China Evergrande Group, the world's most indebted property firm.
The Chinese market makes up 14% of Schindler's sales.
Schindler shares were down 5% as of 1130 GMT and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts in a note described the margin indication for the first half as ""concerning"".
However, they noted there is a degree of conservativeness in the company's messaging as well as a reassuringly explicit focus on margin improvement.
Scheidegger said the company was working on a strategic plan to close the margin gap with peers, which should be announced ""in the summer by the latest"".
This month, Finnish rival Kone reported slightly weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter core earnings, warning that reduced liquidity in the Chinese property sector and rising supply chain costs could weigh on its 2022 profits.
Schindler's fourth-quarter net profit fell 15% to 192 million Swiss francs ($208 million) but beat the 184 million francs expected by analysts.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's drive for ""common prosperity"" to ease inequality could be a positive catalyst for the local wealth management industry, as it leads to expansion of the middle-income group and healthy development of capital markets, according to a UBS report.
The wealth management market in the world's second-largest economy could hit 214 trillion yuan ($34 trillion) in investable assets by high net worth individuals in 2030, said the report by the Swiss bank issued on Wednesday.
But the revenue pool for private banking service providers is seen within a wide range of between 224 billion yuan and 1.03 trillion at that time, as the common prosperity drive could bring more uncertainties to entrepreneurship, it said.
""Common prosperity"" is a policy drive by President Xi Jinping to narrow the gap between rich and poor. Beijing has been encouraging companies to share wealth as part of the effort to ease inequality.
The drive has sparked some concerns as Beijing since last year started to tighten regulations targeting sectors that have accumulated sizable wealth, such as China's booming tech industry.
The UBS report said concerns about policy uncertainties amid Beijing's ""aim to 'reasonably regulate and adjust excessively high income'"" could boost demand for geographic diversification and offshore asset allocation by high net worth individuals.
Entrepreneurship and innovation could be dampened if the call for voluntary donations is implemented in a way that is close to the government's directive and becomes an ""implicit cost"" for businesses, it added.
The positive factors of the common prosperity drive included easing households' living costs, limiting monopolistic practices from forcing out small businesses, and encouraging the healthy development of capital markets, the report said.
The number of high net worth individuals in China has jumped from 0.3 million in 2008 to 2.6 million in 2020, the UBS report said, adding the growth was still the primary driver for the rise in overall investable assets.
Chinese households' financial assets as a percentage of nominal gross domestic product is expected to rise from 161% in 2019 to 225% in 2030 in the most optimistic scenario, the report noted.

The swelling China onshore wealth has lured foreign firms, including UBS itself, to look for tie-ups with domestic lenders which are considered best-positioned to benefit, as well as the country's brokerage firms.
UBS has moved towards forming majority-owned wealth management ventures with China's largest insurer China Life, following other institutions such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Amundi,  Schroders  (LON:SDR) and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).

Investing.com – ViacomCBS stock (NASDAQ:VIAC) traded 9.7% lower in premarket Wednesday, a day after its fourth-quarter earnings fell short of estimates.
The media giant’s bet on the streaming business is also weighing on the stock, given that a serious play in an industry dominated by Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney+ (NYSE:DIS) will need billions of dollars in investments.
The company aims to have 100 million subscribers on its streaming services by 2024. Spending on new streaming programming will grow to more than $6 billion per year in 2024 compared to $4 billion estimated earlier, the company said.
From today, the company is changing its name, and will now be known as Paramount.
ViacomCBS added 9.4 million global streaming subscribers in the fourth quarter, closing December with more than 56 million. That compares with Disney+ Hotstar’s nearly 130 million and Netflix’s nearly 222 million. In quarterly subscriber additions, ViacomCBS was second only to Disney+ Hotstar’s 11.8 million.
The strong growth in subscriber additions drove the company’s revenue higher by 16% to $8 billion and the share of the business in the top line past 16% from 13% a year ago.
The company has laid out a large slate of programming to help draw new online customers. It is using two of the most famous animated series in TV history, South Park and Beavis and Butt-Head. Domestic streaming of future South Park episodes starting with season 27 will debut in 2024 while the international launch on the platform happens this year.
A “Beavis and Butt-Head” movie, planned for later this year, will now debut on Paramount+ as well, rather than Comedy Central, Bloomberg said.
Adjusted profit per share fell 75% to 26 cents due to a surge in costs and the absence of last year’s one-off gains.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Heineken cast doubt on its mid-term profit margin target due to the uncertain impact of spiralling inflation on beer consumption, after reporting stronger than expected earnings in 2021 from higher prices and cost savings.
The world's second-largest brewer said on Wednesday the COVID-19 pandemic would still affect 2022 revenue, with a protracted recovery in bar trade in Europe, and said the impact of inflation and supply chain pressures would be significant.
The maker of brands including Tiger, Sol and Strongbow cider - as well as Heineken (OTC:HEINY), Europe's top-selling lager - said it would offset input cost increases with higher prices, but this could lead to lower beer consumption.
Chief Executive Dolf van den Brink said emerging markets had typically proven more resilient in absorbing price hikes.
""These kind of price increases and inflation, I think we have not seen in a generation,"" he told Reuters. ""The big unknown is how this will affect the more developed markets that have not seen this kind of pricing before.""
Heineken shares, which had dropped early this week to their lowest so far this year, were trading 1.7% higher by 1030 GMT.
Bernstein Securities analyst Trevor Stirling said the results indicated a faster recovery than expected, with margins already higher than pre-COVID levels in Africa and the Americas, with scope for improvement in Europe and Asia coming out of lockdowns. Yet the outlook, he said, erred on the side of caution. 
The Dutch brewer said input costs would rise by a mid-teens percentage rate, with barley double its price of a year ago and aluminium up by some 50%. Energy and freight costs have also risen sharply.
It said it expected its operating profit margin in 2022 to be equal to or modestly above the 15.6% achieved in 2021.
Van den Brink said the company was pretty confident on the outlook for the rest of the year, but was less clear on 2023.
Heineken was still aiming for an operating profit margin of 17% in 2023, but there was ""increased uncertainty"" given inflation and its impact on consumer spending. Heineken plans to update its 2023 guidance later in the year.
Heineken launched a 2 billion euro cost-saving programme a year ago to boost margins by 2023, with the 1.3 billion euros achieved to date already swelling profits.
It sold 4.6% more beer in 2021 than in 2020, with increases in all regions except Asia, and price increases and a shift to more expensive beers driving net revenue up 12.2%

The company's operating profit rose 43.8% higher on a like-for-like basis to 3.41 billion euros, above a company-compiled consensus for 3.30 billion, but still below the pre-pandemic 2019 level.

""We will continue to build, continue to invest. This year the Metinvest company will invest $1 billion in new production,"" Akhmetov, Ukraine's richest man and business magnate, said in the eastern city of Mariupol where most of its production facilities are located.
The firm produces about 40 million tonnes of iron ore and around 13-14 million tonnes of crude steel a year.
Akhmetov also said the company planned to build a new university and do ""everything possible"", including wages increases, to raise living standards in Mariupol, a major Azov Sea port which is near the frontline between the Ukrainian military and pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country.
Last month, company's CEO Yuriy Ryzhenkov said Metinvest needed to invest $20 billion to $30 billion in the coming years to replace four coal-fired blast furnaces with new equipment to cut carbon emissions.
The company also aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 15% by 2030 and by 40% after another 10 years.

Investing.com -- Heineken (OTC:HEINY) stock rose 1.8% in European morning trading on Wednesday, outperforming the broader market, after releasing quarterly figures that suggested pent-up demand for socializing more than compensated for rising costs last year.
However, it warned that “the speed of recovery remains uncertain and we face significant inflationary challenges.”
Brewers around the world are facing increased cost pressures from various sources, not least barley, energy and transportation. In an interview with the Financial Times, chief executive Dolf van den Brink expressed the issue much more starkly, saying:
“In my 24 years in the business I’ve never seen anything like it, not even close…Across the board we are faced with crazy increases.”
Van den Brink was also more cautious than many industry colleagues about current trends, saying that risks of product shortages are “going up daily because of the global supply chain disruption.”
As such, the company said it will put off giving guidance for 2023 until the second half of this year. For 2021, net profit rebounded by 80% to 1.15 billion euros, after a 2020 scarred by heavy one-off charges. Operating profit rose by 44% and net revenue rose 12%.
Heineken, the world’s second largest brewer, has managed to offset that in part by ‘premiumization’: average revenue per hectoliter sold last year rose by 8.3%. That strategy, which is a response to the long-term decline in beer demand across the developed world, predates the pandemic. It is set to continue this year, as the company makes “fewer, bigger bets on premium local brands.”
However, the strategy faces a stern test this year from the squeeze on consumer incomes. With prices rising across the board, consumers may increasingly think twice before buying a premium beer over one that satisfies the same demand for less money.
Despite problems with rising input costs, the company said it managed to achieve 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) of running cost savings last year, keeping it on track to meet its 2023 target of 2 billion euros."

""The supply situation is getting better, but even in 2022 we will not be able to build all the cars we could sell. But we 
see opportunities for further production increases, especially in the second half of the year,"" Diess said in a speech.
Carmakers around the world have been hit by a shortage of semiconductors caused by COVID-19 supply-chain disruptions as well as soaring semiconductor demand at consumer electronic companies.

Volkswagen said in early February that night shifts at Wolfsburg would be cut on some production lines because of the lack of chips. Diess said capacity adjustments would also be needed in the medium term.
Diess said the supply of chips was the only major challenge at the moment, with top models of its premium brands already sold out for the whole of 2022, while its truck businesses also have well filled order books.

The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) had sent a report to the electric vehicle (EV) maker stating that it had exaggerated the mileage of some of its models, including Model 3, in violation of the Act on Fair Labeling and Advertising, the official said. 
""We plan to hold a general meeting to review and determine the extent to which the automaker has violated the law and decide the level of sanctions,"" an official at the KFTC told Reuters, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
Tesla, on its website, says its Model 3 can travel 528 km (328 miles) on a single charge. The KFTC says however that the range may fall short of that should the temperature drop below freezing.
Analysts said most electric vehicles could generally experience some loss of driving range in cold weather. 
Separately, the KFTC is also weighing whether to impose penalties against Tesla for not refunding deposits to customers who cancelled online purchases before their vehicle orders were put in place for release.
In South Korea, Tesla requires customers to pay a deposit of 100,000 won ($84) when purchasing Tesla cars online, but deposits were not refunded upon customers' order cancellations, according to Yonhap news agency. 

Tesla was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Reuters.

1681,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 04:46AM ET</span>","Airbnb Gains as Guests Look to Spend More, For Longer","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Airbnb stock (NASDAQ:ABNB) traded 3.5% higher in premarket Wednesday as the home rental company’s fourth-quarter results reinforced a trend toward longer stays and higher average spending by guests.
The shift to longer stays was fueled by the pandemic as guests looked to travel but not too far from home. That change is becoming entrenched as more companies routinely permit remote work.
“People are spreading out to thousands of towns and cities, staying for weeks, months, or even entire seasons at a time,” Airbnb said in a letter to shareholders, while also pointing out that guests are now returning to cities.
Revenue in the fourth quarter grew 78% to $1.5 billion, easily beating 2019 levels. Annual revenue hit $6 billion, making Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky call it “the best year in our company’s history.”
Almost half of the number of nights booked in the fourth quarter were for stays of a week or longer, and one in five nights were for stays of a month or more, the company said.
Nights and experiences booked jumped 59% to exceed 73 million. A higher number of bookings along with better pricing led to gross booking value crossing $11 billion, up 91%.
The company swung back to a net profit of $55 million in the fourth quarter from a loss of $352 million a year ago.
Airbnb now expects the number of nights and experiences booked in the first quarter to “significantly exceed” the first-quarter levels of 2019. Current-quarter revenue is expected to be around $1.45 billion."

Glencore's sale, years in the works and due to be finalised in the first half of 2022 pending regulatory approvals, capped two decades of investments which saw it trading millions of barrels of Russneft's oil even as it witnessed some of Russia's top corporate and political battles.
Glencore did not disclose the buyer or the value of the transaction, but Kommersant cited sources as saying that Gutseriyev was expected to become the beneficiary of the stake, which it said was worth nearly 11 billion roubles ($146 million).
SAFMAR Financial Investments, an investment holding via which Mikhail Gutseriyev's family holds stakes in a number of assets, owns a 11.1% stake in Russneft. 
Gutseriyev was sanctioned by the European Union last year for close links with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.

Sanctions created difficulties for Russneft's oil exports, with Glencore skipping purchases for several months.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - AirAsia Aviation Group on Wednesday unveiled plans for a low-cost air ridesharing service in Southeast Asia after signing a non-binding deal with lessor Avolon for at least 100 Vertical Aerospace VX4 electric vehicles.
Tony Fernandes, chief executive of AirAsia parent Capital A, said flights could start by 2025, with regulators in Malaysia and Singapore likely to approve operations far more quickly than in Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines.
He said the air ridesharing services would be bookable through AirAsia's mobile app and offered at an accessible price point, just as the budget carrier had done for its regular flights.
""We don't want this to be an exclusive product,"" Fernandes told reporters. ""We want everyone to be able to use this product.""
Avolon ordered 500 VX4 aircraft from Vertical Aerospace last year and has since placed 90% with AirAsia, Japan Airlines and Brazil's Gol and Grupo Comporte.

The four-passenger, one-pilot VX4 is expected to have a range of more than 100 miles (160 km) and is one of a growing number of entrants in the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) sector.

Investing.com -- European stock markets traded higher Wednesday, continuing the previous session’s positive tone after Russia announced it had pulled some troops back from the Ukraine border.
The move raised hopes that armed conflict in the region can be avoided.
By 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the CAC 40 in France climbed 0.4% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.1%.
Global stock markets surged on Tuesday, with both the DAX and the CAC 40 climbing approximately 2%, as the Russian defense ministry published footage to show it was returning some troops to base after exercises.
The gains are more subdued Wednesday, with General Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s chief, warning that the military alliance has so far “not seen any sign of de-escalation on the ground from the Russian side”, while hours after Moscow's announcement, Ukraine said the online networks of its defense ministry and two banks were overwhelmed by a cyber attack.
Elsewhere, the European earnings season continued Wednesday, with  Heineken  (AS:HEIN) stock up 0.5% after the world’s second largest brewer in the world reported higher earnings than expected in 2021, helped by cost savings and by consumers shifting to more expensive beers.
Ahold (AS:AD) stock slumped 4.4% after the Dutch supermarket retailer warned that its underlying earnings would return to historical levels in 2022 even after it reported a strong fourth quarter, as the Covid-19 pandemic drove robust online sales.  
FDJ (PA:FDJ) stock rose 6.6% after the French lottery company posted strong full-year earnings and lifted its forward guidance.
Turning to economic data, U.K. CPI fell slightly on the month in January, down 0.1%, but the annual figure remained elevated at 5.5%, suggesting pressure will remain on the Bank of England to lift interest rates in the months ahead.
Europe sees the release of industrial production data for December, but the focus is likely to be on the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s last meeting, where policy makers in all likelihood debated how quickly it should tighten monetary policy in the months after March.   
Oil prices rose Wednesday, regaining some ground after the previous session’s sharp losses on the easing of tensions on the Ukraine border. 
Elsewhere, crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, released on Tuesday, showed a draw of just over 1 million barrels for last week. Investors now await crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due later in the day.
By 3:40 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% higher at $93.04 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.1% to $94.31. Both benchmarks fell over 3% on Tuesday, the biggest one-day loss this year.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,858.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1391.

Feb 16 was when Russia was meant to invade Ukraine, according to the White House, but Moscow's signals that it was pulling back some troops massed at Ukraine's borders lifted Wall Street on Tuesday and fuelled a selloff in safe-haven Treasuries and German Bunds.
Market gains are extending into Wednesday -- Japan's Nikkei rose 2.2% and European bourses open higher, yet U.S. equity futures show renewed signs of caution. 
There are, of course, other ways of waging war; Ukraine blamed Russia for a series of cyber attacks that hit it on Tuesday. And note, Russia's parliament asked President Putin to recognise two Moscow-backed eastern Ukrainian breakaway regions as independent.
Economic data releases and central banks are also occupying markets. Those hoping for signs of inflation peaking will have been dismayed by the latest UK and U.S. readings. British consumer prices rose at the fastest annual pace in nearly 30 years last month, edging up from December 
That comes a day after Tuesday's U.S. data showed core factory gate inflation -- the cost for producers after stripping out food and energy -- posting its biggest gain in a year. 
(Graphic: Inflation, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/zdvxoabdlpx/inflation.png) 
The prospect of front-loaded, aggressive rate hikes has dramatically flattened bond curves, with the gap between two-year and 10-year UK gilt yields a whisker off turning negative -- the so-called inversion that often portends an economic slump.
The U.S. Treasury yield curve steepened back on Tuesday as receding war fears lifted 10-year yields, but a day earlier it was the narrowest since mid-2020. For some, the state of the curve is a sign that central banks have fallen behind in their inflation fight and must act faster with policy tightening to catch up. 
So all eyes now on minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's last meeting. They could show whether policymakers will lean towards a larger half-point rate rise at its March meeting, or whether they favour moving faster with selling the Fed's bond holdings to tighten financial conditions.

OSLO (Reuters) - Several investors in Telenor are seeking assurances from the Norwegian telecoms company that customer data will be protected following the sale of its operations in Myanmar.
Myanmar's military rulers have given the go-ahead for a local company, Shwe Byain Phyu, to own most of Telenor's business in the Southeast Asian country, under a deal to be finalised soon, Reuters reported on Friday.
Some human rights groups have said the handover could put the data of 18 million people within the junta's reach, with several demonstrations held in Myanmar in recent days calling on Telenor to stop the sale altogether.
DNB Asset Management, Telenor's fourth-largest investor with a 1.64% stake, said it had requested a meeting with the company to discuss the impending exit, describing the situation as ""a considerable dilemma"" for Telenor.
""We plan to discuss the management and treatment of personal data both prior to and following any sale,"" said Janicke Scheele, the investor's head of responsible investments.
Storebrand Asset Management, Telenor's eighth-largest investor with a 1.31% stake, said it was asking the company to conduct ""human rights due diligence"" as it departs the country.
In an emailed statement, Kamil Zabielski, the head of sustainable investment at Storebrand, said Telenor needed to assess the likelihood that its assets could be misused after it leaves. 
""Telenor must evaluate whether any customer data (or the existing infrastructure) that may eventually be transferred could be misused by the military through any purchasing counterparty and take appropriate measures to avoid or mitigate these risks,"" its head of sustainable investment, Zabielski told Reuters.
Pension fund KLP, which owns 0.96%, said it was also scrutinising the sale.
""We are in dialogue with Telenor and other stakeholders on this particular matter in order to get a full picture of the circumstances,"" KLP's head of responsible investments, Kiran Aziz, told Reuters.
In response to the investor statements, Telenor said it had to comply with the law in Myanmar to protect its employees.
""Some have stated that they understand our need to leave the country, but have asked us to close the operation and delete data,"" said a Telenor spokeswoman.
""Both in the event of a sale and if Telenor Myanmar returns its operating license, the data must still be stored in accordance to local legislation and license terms.""
""We cannot violate local laws without exposing our employees to danger, which is utterly unacceptable,"" she added.
Shwe Byain Phyu and the Myanmar military junta did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
The Norwegian government, which is Telenor's biggest shareholder with a stake of nearly 59%, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

https://graphics.reuters.com/MYANMAR-POLITICS/TELENOR/qzjvqbqyrpx/chart.png 
It was unclear what impact the shareholder pressure will have on Telenor's exit from Myanmar.
The company sought to leave the country after last year's military coup, telling Reuters in September it was selling its operations to avoid European Union sanctions after ""continued pressure"" from the junta to activate intercept surveillance technology.
Military leaders late last year rejected its plan to sell its local operations - which once contributed as much as 7% of its earnings -- to Lebanese investment firm M1 for $105 million.
Instead, they wanted M1 to partner with Shwe Byain Phyu, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

https://graphics.reuters.com/TELENOR-MYANMAR/dgkvlrkgwvb/chart.png 
According to communications reviewed by Reuters, Shwe Byain Phyu, whose chairman has a history of business ties to the military, will own 80% of the unit under a handover expected to be concluded shortly.
A Telenor spokeswoman previously told Reuters by email that it had had no dialogue with Shwe Byain Phyu and its sale agreement was with M1, which was ""the only party we have selected"". 
Shwe Byain Phyu has denied all ties to the Myanmar army and said it was ""selected by Telenor … because it was the most unrelated to the military"".
In an emailed statement to Reuters, M1 said it ""does not compromise on human rights issues, unlawful interception and surveillance requests"" and said it was committed to meeting all its legal and ethical obligations to its users worldwide.
""Should the regulatory decision come out in M1 Group’s favor, we will announce the identity and details of the entity that would be the legal owner of the Telenor Myanmar operation, in due course,"" M1 said.
It added it was committed to preserving the Telenor Myanmar operations.
Two employees of Telenor Myanmar, who asked not to be named, citing safety considerations, told Reuters last week that authorities had already requested the call logs of opponents of the junta and the last known location of people on the run.

They said Telenor had complied.
Telenor's spokeswoman previously told Reuters it was not possible for Telenor to comment on directives from the military, due to risks to employees.

Chris Xu, Shein's founder and CEO, has also become a permanent resident of the city-state, according to a document. 
Shein, which Xu started in 2008 in Nanjing and has since grown into a global fashion marketplace, last year de-registered its main business, Nanjing Top Plus Information Technology Co Ltd, a Chinese corporate filing shows.
The developments are in line with what other sources have previously told Reuters are revived plans by Shein to list in New York this year and Xu looking at a change in citizenship to bypass tougher Chinese rules for offshore IPOs.
Singapore-registered Roadget Business Pte, which lists Xu and three others as its representatives, was established in 2019 and since late 2021 has been the legal entity operating Shein's global website, Singapore filings show.
Roadget also now owns Guangzhou Shein International Import & Export Co Ltd as well as Shein's trademarks that were transferred from Hong Kong's Zoetop Business Co, which had been involved in intellectual property disputes with global brands. In addition, Shein's company profile page on LinkedIn shows Singapore as its headquarters.
Sources for this article were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.
Shein did not directly address Reuters queries as to whether it had moved its legal and administrative home to Singapore, saying only that it has centres of operations in major markets including in China, Singapore and the United States. 
Shein, which was valued at about $50 billion in early 2021, produces clothing in China to sell online in the United States, Europe and Asia but doesn't sell in China. 
It is unclear when Xu gained his Singapore permanent resident status and if it was granted under the country's global investor programme. A person must be a permanent resident for at least two years before applying for Singapore citizenship.
Shein did not comment on Xu's permanent resident status in Singapore or whether he'll seek Singapore citizenship. Xu is ""a Chinese citizen with long-time roots in China, it said, adding that he was not available to answer queries on the matter.
Melissa Ow, executive vice president of the Singapore Economic Development Board, declined to comment on whether the board has had discussions with either Shein or Xu. 
HIRING IN SINGAPORE
Shein aims to quadruple the number of its Singapore employees to around 200 by the year's end, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
It is currently advertising for government relations associates as well as for staff for human resources, marketing and IT. Shein said it is expanding its Singapore offices to support the firm's growth in the Southeast Asian market.
Despite fierce competition, Shein has become one of the world's largest fast fashion marketplaces by targeting the social media-savvy ""Gen Z"" generation, making heavy use of influencers and discount codes.
Items such as $10 dresses and $5 tops help draw hundreds of millions of visitors to its website each month. The company made around 100 billion yuan ($15.7 billion) in revenue last year, sources have said. It has about 7,000 employees worldwide, according to its website.
Singapore, an Asian financial hub with a large ethnic Chinese population, is viewed by some businesses as a neutral base amid trade tensions between China and the United States. Chinese tech giants such as TikTok owner ByteDance and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), have in recent years set up regional hubs in Singapore.
A New York IPO for Shein, if finalised, would likely be the first major equity deal by a Chinese company in the United States since China's regulators began tightening oversight of such listings last July.

Chinese firms, particularly those with large overseas markets, are attracted to the deep pool of potential financial investors in the United States.

1691,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 02:50AM ET</span>","Dutch foundation seeks consumer damages over Apple, Google app payments","(The August 15 story corrects job title in paragraph 9)
By Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google face a potential class action lawsuit in the Netherlands over app store charges, after a foundation headed by Dutch entrepreneur Alexander Klöpping began gathering claimants.
The action, which still faces legal hurdles before any court hearing, reflects growing criticism over how much the two firms charge developers for payments on their app stores, while the Netherlands has become increasingly popular as a jurisdiction to pursue complaints against multinational firms.
Klöpping is a co-founder of Blendle, a digital platform that enables users to buy individual news articles, which he sold in 2020. He told Reuters his determination to pursue the tech giants grew out of his experience at Blendle.
""The reason it's getting so much attention right now is that everyone feels in their gut that there's this imbalance of power when it comes to big tech companies.""
He said while developers have complained most about app store practices, costs are ultimately passed on to consumers.
Klöpping's App Store Claims Foundation is being represented by law firm Hausfeld, with funding from Fortress Investment Group.
Apple did not reply to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which owns Google, had no immediate comment but said the company had reduced fees on Google Play.
At this stage in the Dutch class action proceedings -- which were codified in a 2020 law -- formal notice has been sent to Apple and Google. 
Rob Okhuijsen, strategy director at Hausfeld, said the next step will be submitting evidence to the Amsterdam District Court in April. If a judge agrees, the court would then begin weighing the merits of the complaint.
CMS lawyer Bart-Adriaan de Ruijter, who is not involved in the case but specialises in corporate litigation, said the Netherlands is becoming a magnet for suits against multinationals. Recent instances include a $339 million action launched last month against Airbus and a ruling last year ordering Shell (LON:RDSa) to cut its carbon emissions.

Apple has already been taken to task by Dutch authorities for its app store practices. In December the Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) ordered Apple to make it possible for dating app developers to offer non-Apple payment choices in the Netherlands.
Apple, which is appealing, has been fined $5.7 million four separate times for failing to comply, most recently on Monday.

1694,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 02:20AM ET</span>",Column-Entangled fears of Fed error and Ukraine crisis: Mike Dolan,"By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - Keen to downplay anxieties about war in Europe, global investors appear to fear a monetary policy miscalculation even more.
Their problem is that two are hugely intertwined right now.
World markets gyrated over the past week as fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine ebbed and flowed - and with them the chance of a standoff between nuclear powers in NATO and Moscow.
As Brent crude oil prices raced toward $100 per barrel as a result, market tension over how the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks rein in 40-year-high inflation rates went up several gears.
Confusion abounded as talk of emergency interest rate rises and surging oil prices sent bond yields spiking higher, even as some sought ""safety"" there due to the threat of conflict.
The upshot was surging volatility in U.S. Treasury markets, where the MOVE index of implied volatility hit its highest since the COVID shock of March 2020.
But where to focus? More global fund managers surveyed by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) this month identified ""monetary risks"" - as opposed to geopolitical, credit, business cycle or trade risks - as the biggest threat to financial market stability than at any point in near 20 years of polling.
Although the survey was conducted before the latest ratchet in Ukraine tensions, a net 64% of respondents saw either hawkish central banks or inflation as the biggest ""tail risks"". Just 7% opted for the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
All this angst led to the highest net cash reading in portfolios since the pandemic first unfolded, heightened recession fears, and the biggest net share of funds betting on a flatter yield curve since 2005.
But the worry list speaks loudly to investor fears of central bank policy errors, in part due to the still wild pandemic-related and now geopolitical distortions. Misinterpret the inflation surge and tighten too much or too hastily - or even underestimate it, allow high inflation to fester and then have to squeeze harder eventually to wrest back control.
Neither is a great recipe for holding bonds or equities.

SELF-FULFILLING
And yet the sort of comments made by St Louis Fed chief and voting Fed policymaker James Bullard over the past week - which spurred frantic market talk of the first inter-meeting Fed hike in almost 30 years - merely reinforced those fears.
Bullard said he favoured a full percentage point increase in the Fed's main interest rate by midyear - mainly because the Fed's ""credibility is on the line"".
While some investors doubt the Fed will be that aggressive, it's unnerving to think central bankers might act just to be seen by markets, governments and the public to be ""doing something"" - even as their own analysis shows there's little they can do to ease an energy supply or geopolitical shock.
What's more, spooking markets in that direction can have a dynamic of its own if authorities then feel they then need to catch up.
PIMCO's Tiffany Wilding said she sees ""virtually zero"" chance of an intermeeting Fed hike and also doubts it will opt for a large 50 basis point rise in March.
But even if the ""rollercoaster"" ride for U.S. bond investors seemed extreme, there was danger ""market pricing may become a self-fulfilling prophecy,"" she added.
Unigestion multi-asset manager Salman Baig also thinks the Fed will have more patience than markets now bet.
But he added: ""Tightening into decelerating growth runs the risk of further slowdown, raising the concern of a policy mistake that would put a serious dent into 2022 earnings.""
But all the furtive movement of tanks and troops in eastern Europe does have a role in seeding such a mistake.
Although concerns have risen about broadening price pressures, the assumption in market and policymaking circles late last year was that even a flatlining oil price would see annual base effects get crushed early this year and take pressure off headline inflation rates everywhere in 2022.
To the extent the Ukraine tensions were largely behind the 35% surge in Brent crude over the past month, then they have put paid to that hope to date. Along with the Omicron wave of COVID, this was likely a significant factor in the Fed's hawkish pivot around new year.
Instead of subsiding, year-on-year oil price gains - closely correlated to inflation expectations in bond markets - have stayed about 45% since November. If they had stayed at late November prices, those gains would have been wiped out by now.
The near 5% recoil in Brent on Tuesday amid some tentative de-escalation of the Ukraine standoff gives a small glimpse of how much the latest oil spike was down to those tensions. And indeed many fund managers have upped oil exposure precisely as a portfolio hedge to those geopolitical tensions.
The picture is amplified in Europe of course due to the quadrupling of natural gas prices over the past year - and Tuesday's Ukraine relief saw a near 10% retreat in those.
And so these monetary and geopolitical risks are joined at the hip and hard to disentangle completely. War and an energy shock could simply up the risk of hawkish error. Avoiding those may be needed to confirm the still-benign year end forecasts.

1696,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 01:35AM ET</span>","Rising costs, lack of widebody flights pose risks to recovery in aircraft maintenance market","By Chen Lin and Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The global aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) sector faces fresh challenges from rising labour costs and a weak recovery in the widebody market as shop visits begin to rebound after a severe pandemic-related slump.
The MRO sector, worth an estimated $68.4 billion in 2021, according to consultancy Oliver Wyman, has been battered by retirements of older planes, which typically require more maintenance, and reduced flying hours for the rest of airlines' fleets. 
That has led to less wear and tear on parts and given airlines with grounded planes the ability to conserve cash and postpone shop visits.
Industry delegates at the Singapore Airshow said that the outlook was improving but that labour costs were rising. They said the recovery was lumpy and focused on specific areas where air travel was rebounding, such as narrowbody aircraft and dedicated freighters, with older passenger widebodies lagging well behind.
""There is a general labour shortage and the only way to get labour back to work is higher rates,"" said Kailash Krishnaswamy, senior vice president of aftermarket services at Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR). ""Inflation is definitely a challenge.""
For his company, business has been solid in the Americas, where it services narrowbodies but less so in Belfast, where it had done a lot of work on Airbus A330 widebodies, many of which have been retired.
""We are trying to pursue a lot more narrowbodies in Belfast that we used to not do in 2019,"" Krishnaswamy said. 
A recent survey by broker Jefferies on aftermarket demand in aerospace found participants expected an 11% increase in sales this year. Half believed engines would be the area with the biggest recovery this year, although many airlines deferred engine maintenance during the pandemic. But Jefferies said the expected rise may be due to the low base in 2021. 
Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) said in December that large-engine flying hours were at only 50% of 2019 levels due to the uneven nature of the aviation recovery, but its civil aerospace president, Chris Cholerton, said on Wednesday that flying hours were expected to increase significantly this year.
Shop visits are on the rise and Rolls-Royce plans to hire more workers in Singapore this year, he said. 
""The modern aircraft – the 787s, the A350s, A330neos, probably by before the middle of this year, they'll be back to where they were in 2019,"" Cholerton said. ""The reduction in flying hours is from the parking of capacity from older aircraft.""
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Global Services President Ted Colbert said the industry in Asia had been aided during the pandemic by a boom in passenger-to-freighter conversions that helped MROs fill spare hangar capacity.
The biggest beneficiary of the trend, Singapore Technologies (ST) Engineering, on Monday announced a deal to convert to freighters and lease up to five A320s to Vaayu Group. The first one is due to be placed on lease in the second quarter.
As the market recovers, Malaysia's AirAsia, which as of last week had 55% of its fleet on the ground, hopes to have all of its planes flying again by the fourth quarter, increasing maintenance demand.

""For airlines growing out of the crisis and increasing capacity and getting access to MRO slots, that is going to be a struggle,"" said Embraer Commercial Aviation President Arjan Meijer. ""The capacity is limited in terms of hangar space but also from a human capital perspective."" 
Planning for a rebound, AirAsia's parent Capital A on Tuesday said it would raise more than $95 million for its engineering arm, which plans to build a large MRO facility at Kuala Lumpur International Airport capable of heavy maintenance of up to 14 planes at a time.

1697,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 12:25AM ET</span>",Embraer aims for decision on proposed turboprop as early as this year -exec,"By Chen Lin and Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Brazilian planemaker Embraer expects to decide late this year or early next year on whether to launch a new turboprop plane that could enter service around 2027, its commercial aviation head said on Wednesday.
Embraer is also in talks with Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) and GE about providing an engine for the plane, with a decision expected in the second half of this year, Embraer Commercial Aviation President Arjan Meijer said.
""It will be improved but conventional engine technology on the aircraft,"" he told Reuters by phone from the Singapore Airshow. 
He declined to comment on how the fuel efficiency was likely to compare to that of existing turboprops in an industry dominated by ATR, a joint venture between Airbus and Leonardo. 
The other Western turboprop maker, De Havilland Canada, has completed all of its ordered Dash 8-400 planes, so production is being paused, raising broader questions over turboprop demand. ATR and De Havilland both use Pratt & Whitney engines.
Meijer said the proposed Embraer turboprop would be less noisy than existing planes and have 70- and 90- seat versions, with the larger one carrying more passengers than the ATR72. 
He said he could not reveal the company's programme cost estimate, but added that it was in talks with several financial and industrial partners for development. 
Rolls-Royce Civil Aerospace President Chris Cholerton said his company, which is weighted toward widebody aircraft engines, was working to put forward a compelling tubroprop engine proposal to Embraer.
""I think we would see significant reductions in fuel burn, and therefore we are very positive about the potential of that product,"" he told reporters at the airshow.
Rolls-Royce is also conducting an engine study for Boom Supersonic, which plans a 55-seat supersonic passenger jet.

Cholerton said Rolls-Royce remained engaged with Boom but emphasised it was a study, not a contract, and considerations such as the size of the market for the jet had to be taken into account.
Pratt & Whitney and GE did not respond immediately to a request for comment on Embraer's turboprop plans.

State-owned Shanghai Construction, which sued the Evergrande unit in the southwestern city of Chengdu in December for overdue construction fees, cited the Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court ruling that the assets to be frozen will include bank deposits and real estate. 
Separately, Shanghai Construction Group said last week a local court in Guangzhou has frozen 361.5 million yuan of assets of a different Evergrande unit in the central province of Jiangsu for overdue payments. 
Many suppliers and contractors have launched legal actions against Evergrande, the world's most indebted property developer with over $300 billion of liabilities, over missed or late payments.
A growing number of construction and decoration companies are also writing off assets or issuing profit warnings as debt woes at Evergrande and other property developers debilitate their suppliers.
To better oversee and manage the debt restructuring of Evergrande by the authorities, all lawsuits against the developer across the country have been centrally handled by the Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court since around August. 
Evergrande declined to comment on the lawsuit with Shanghai Construction Group. 
Company chairman Hui Ka Yan told an internal meeting earlier this month the firm aimed to fully restore construction work across China in Feb, compared with 93.2% at the end of last year, with a goal of delivering 600,000 apartments in 2022.

He added the firm needs to clear its debt by fully restoring construction and sales activities and not by selling off assets on the cheap.

Singapore Airlines had in December said it had signed a provisional agreement to buy the freighters.
""The order underscores the importance of the cargo market to the SIA Group,"" Goh Choon Phong, the airline's CEO, said in a statement. ""These new-generation aircraft will substantially increase our operating efficiencies and reduce our fuel burn.""
The new freighters will replace Singapore Airlines' own fleet of seven ageing Boeing (NYSE:BA) 747s. 
The companies did not provide a value for the order, which was signed at the Singapore Airshow. 

The deal allows the airline to swap part of the order for 15 A320neo jetliners and two A350-900 passenger versions that it had previously ordered from Airbus and remain to be delivered.
Those 17 planes had a list value of $2.3 billion when Airbus last published prices in 2018, roughly the same price as the estimated value of the freighters.
