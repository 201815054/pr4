Dow Jones and S&P 500 futures were up 0.6 percent and 1.3 percent respectively by mid-morning in Europe having been as much as 3 percent lower during the Asian session.
Futures turned positive as European stocks pared losses, with the pan-European STOXX 600 down 1.6 percent by 0930 GMT, having sunk more than 3 percent at the open.

U.S. stocks plunged on Monday, with both the S&P 500 and Dow indices slumping more than 4.0 percent, as the Dow notched its biggest intraday decline in history with a nearly 1,600-point drop and Wall Street erased its gains for the year.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stock markets nosedived for a fourth day running on Tuesday, having seen $4 trillion wiped off from what just eight days ago had been record high values. 
Europe's main bourses started down as much as 3 percent, leaving investors with little option but to seek the traditional refuges of gold, the Japanese yen [FRX/] and one of the initial triggers for the selloff - benchmark government bonds. 
Wall Street futures offer a chink of light as they turned higher but commodities suffered too, with oil and metals all tumbling backwards as what had been one of their best starts to a year also soured rapidly. 
""Playtime is officially over, kids,"" analysts at Rabobank said. ""Rising volatility painfully reminds some investors that one-way bets don't exist.""
The stock selloff had been viewed by some as a healthy correction following their rapid rise over the last year but, as it snowballed through Asia and then Europe, nerves were starting to fray.
Wall Street's Dow Jones and S&P 500 benchmarks had slumped 4.6 percent and 4.1 percent on Monday, their biggest drops since August 2011. It was also the Dow's biggest fall on a pure points basis of all-time.
Europe's early drop sent the region's STOXX 600 to its lowest level in six months. There was intense trading activity, with more than 40 percent of the average daily volume traded on Germany's DAX and Europe's STOXX 50 by 0845 GMT.
TIDE TURNING?
""Since last autumn, investors had been betting on the 'Goldilocks' economy - solid economic expansion, improving corporate earnings and stable inflation. But the tide seems to have changed,"" said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid 3.4 percent. Taiwan's main index lost 5.0 percent, its biggest since in 2011 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped 4.2 percent.
Japan's Nikkei dived 4.7 percent, its worst fall since November 2016, to four-month lows.
The original trigger for the sell-off was a sharp rise in U.S. bond yields late last week after data showed U.S. wages increasing at the fastest pace since 2009. That raised the alarm about higher inflation and, with it, potentially higher interest rates.
That could be painful for markets that have been propped up by central banks' stimulus for many years.
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield rose to as high as 2.885 percent on Monday, its highest in four years and up 47 basis points since the end of 2017. 
But a massive fall in share prices prompted an about-turn, and on Tuesday, it fell back to as low as 2.662 percent. German Bunds, Europe's equivalent benchmark then fell 5 basis points in early trading, their biggest drop in over two months,
ONLY TWO FED HIKES?
U.S. interest rate markets are now pricing in only two Federal Reserve rate hikes this year, a big shift from only a few days ago when they were pointing to three or even four hikes.
The CBOE Volatility index, the closely followed ""fear-index"" measure of expected near-term stock market volatility, jumped 20 points to 37 its highest level since August 2015.
That left some popular exchange-traded products that investors use to benefit from calm market conditions facing potential liquidation.
Keen to avoid further risk, investors are closing their positions in other assets, including the currency market, where a popular strategy has been to sell the dollar against the euro and other currencies seen as benefiting from higher interest rates in the future. 
The euro was sold off on Monday but popped back up to $1.2435 on Tuesday. It took it away from last week's low of $1.2335. That could usher in a further correction after its rally to a 3-year high of $1.2538 late last month.
Against the yen, which is often used as a safe-haven currency because of Japan's solid current account surplus, the dollar slipped as much 0.2 percent to 108.86 yen before clawing back to 109.3.
Oil prices also dropped, with international benchmark Brent futures hitting a one-month low before recovering to stand at $67.28 per barrel, down 0.5 percent on the day.

U.S. crude futures traded at $63.87 per barrel, down 0.6 percent, while safe-haven gold was up for a fourth day in the last five, at $1,340 per ounce.

All sectoral indexes were trading in negative territory, pushing the pan-European STOXX 600 index down for the seventh straight session.
The index was down 2.6 percent by 0814 GMT, while Britain's FTSE dropped 2.5 percent and Germany's DAX fell 2.7 percent. The euro STOXX volatility index hit its highest level since April 2017.
""Price action is clearly driven by technical factors, tied to a brutal awakening of stock volatility,"" said Alessandro Balsotti, head of asset management at JCI Capital Ltd. ""We are undoubtedly in uncharted waters.""
Investors fear a comeback of inflation would prompt central banks to tighten monetary policies faster than expected, scaling back from years of stimulus that boosted stock valuations and lifted European equities to 2 year highs in January.
Among the top fallers on Tuesday were Ocado (LON:OCDO), down 7.1 percent, after the British online supermarket missed forecasts with flat full-year core earnings, while Babcock declined 4 percent after lowering its revenue forecasts.
Among the few stocks in positive territory,  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) was up 0.4 percent after Italy's biggest retail bank pledged to halve its soured loans and grow revenue strongly while cutting costs under a new four-year plan. Traders said the market welcomed Intesa's dividend plans.
AMS jumped 7.9 percent after the chipmaker reported a surge in fourth-quarter profit as the Austria-based group benefited from rising demand for the sensors it makes for smartphone producers such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, slipped 0.17% to 89.42 by 02:57 AM ET (07:58 AM GMT).
Asian markets plunged for a second day but U.S. futures erased overnight losses as European trading got underway, dampening safe haven demand for the dollar.
The selloff in global equities followed Friday’s stronger than expected U.S. jobs report which investors took as a sign that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates this year at a faster pace than previously expected.
The jobs report supported a recovery in the dollar after it fell to three year lows in late January, pressured lower by a range of factors, including concerns about U.S. trade protectionism and perceptions of narrowing yield advantage.
Expectations of tightening monetary policy tend to boost the dollar, as rising rates make the currency more attractive to yield-seeking investors.
The euro gained ground against the dollar, with EUR/USD climbing 0.51% to 1.2433.
The dollar pushed higher against the yen, with USD/JPY last at 109.18, up from an overnight low of 108.46. The yen tends to rise in times of market turbulence thanks to its safe haven status.
Sterling was also higher against the dollar, with GBP/USD rising 0.19% to trade at 1.3983."

The Nikkei 225 Stock Average closed off its intraday lows, still weak enough to record a drop of more than 10 percent from a high on Jan. 23. Stocks across the region extended a global slump with virtually all shares on the 1,000-plus member MSCI Asia Pacific Index down. Euro Stoxx 50 futures fell more than 3 percent. The yen was flat after advancing earlier on haven demand. Treasuries declined after they also benefited from a flight to safety earlier.

“How far it goes down? You tell me,” Steven Wieting, global chief investment strategist at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., told Bloomberg TV. “But this speed of decline you cannot keep doing this day after day after day without finding some sort of bottom rather quickly,” he said -- though anticipating that markets will stay volatile for a while.
Elsewhere, oil slumped for a third day and metals joined the sell-off after gaining on Monday. Bitcoin tumbled for a sixth day to trade around $6,000.

Many finance professionals were left scratching their heads to explain the severity of the moves in a short space of time. Anxiety was building about the outlook for monetary policy prior to Monday’s rout, with equities being tested by the surge in bond yields. Global shares had just last month risen to record highs on optimism for expanding profits and economic growth.
Even as the Dow suffered its worst point loss ever, some of the biggest investors remained relatively sanguine. Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, said the big declines were “just minor corrections in the scope of things” and there was a lot of cash on the sidelines waiting to buy. Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, said he doesn’t expect the stock market to drop more than 10 percent.
“I actually think there’s buying opportunities, maybe not today, but through this week as this sell-off exacerbates,” said Sean Fenton, a portfolio manager who oversees about A$1 billion ($788 million) at Tribeca Investment Partners in Sydney.

8,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 02:50AM ET</span>","Toyota posts 54 percent jump in third quarter profit, lifts full-year forecast","TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp lifted its full-year profit forecast by 10 percent on Tuesday after posting its best quarterly operating profit in two years, boosted by a weaker yen and strong sales at home.
Japan's biggest automaker now expects operating profit to increase 10 percent on the year to 2.2 trillion yen ($20.23 billion), from 1.99 trillion yen a year earlier and marking an upgrade from its previous forecast of 2.0 trillion yen. 
It expects net profit to come in at 2.4 trillion yen, up from a previous forecast for 1.95 trillion yen and on track for a record high.
For the third quarter, Toyota posted 673.6 billion yen in operating profit for October-December, a 54 percent jump from a year earlier. The result exceeded a mean estimate of 527.22 billion yen taken from 11 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, and was its highest since October-December 2015.
Operating profit in Japan more than doubled as vehicle sales rose at home, while the automaker posted lower sales in North America, its biggest market, where it is struggling with heavy discounting as it tries to produce and sell larger vehicles.
Toyota sold 2.63 million vehicles globally in October-December, up from 2.28 million a year prior. Sales in Japan rose 3 percent, while sales North America fell to 735,000 from 745,000 units. Sales in Europe rose 1.7 percent.
Operating profit in North America tumbled 53.1 percent. Toyota has been struggling with rising marketing costs in the region amid steep discounting among automakers trying to sell more cars in the slowing U.S. market.
Toyota has had a bumpy ride in the United States, its biggest market where it trails only General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co in terms of sales, as automakers continue to angle for higher market share as overall sales retreat from a record high hit in 2016.
Profitability in the U.S. market is key for Toyota to help generate funds as it invests heavily in new technologies including self-driving functions, electric cars and new mobility services.
As U.S. drivers continue to gravitate towards larger pick-up trucks and SUVs over sedans and hatchbacks, Toyota, best known for its Camry and Corolla sedans, has been scrambling to shift more production from cars to trucks.
Meanwhile, it has been selling its sedans at hefty discounts for much of 2017 to bolster demand for models like the Camry, while also raising incentives on its SUVs and trucks to remain competitive in the U.S. market. 
This has lifted overall marketing costs per vehicle by 10 percent in 2017 from 2016, according to figures from Autodata.

10,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 02:33AM ET</span>",Fed's Wells Fargo Punishment Sets Precedent for Harsher Era,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve just devised a harsh new punishment after  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. landed in scandal after scandal -- one that may haunt every big bank.
The San Francisco-based lender was banned late Friday from growing until it convinces authorities it’s addressing shortcomings -- an action that could cost it $400 million in profit this year. Untested is how the cap on total assets will affect the firm long term by handing its largest competitors an advantage in pursuing new business.
Even as the Trump administration signals a loosening of regulations across industries including Wall Street, the Fed’s move sets a scary tone. In an industry where public scorn seems to shift every few years to another colossal U.S. firm, without necessarily hampering growth, this year it’s Wells Fargo -- next year, who knows?
“The Fed just put the fear of God into bank boardrooms across the country,” Capital Alpha Partners LLC analyst Ian Katz said in a Sunday note. “Since the financial crisis, bank boards have gradually become more serious and less rubber-stampy. But the Wells scandals indicate that some boards still aren’t vigilant enough.”
Acting ‘Swiftly’
Shares of the company tumbled more than 9 percent in early trading in New York on Monday, dropping to $58.12 at 7:07 a.m.
Wells Fargo is moving to rectify the regulators’ concerns, said spokesman Oscar Suris.
“As Friday’s consent order acknowledges, Wells Fargo has made progress in enhancing its board governance and compliance and risk management, and that work continues through the consent-order process and ongoing actions such as recent key outside hires and additions to the board,” Suris said Sunday in an emailed statement. “The company is confident that under Chair Betsy Duke and CEO Tim Sloan we will move swiftly to address the issues.”

Major U.S. banks have bounced back from past crackdowns.
In 2013, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). agreed to more than $23 billion in legal and regulatory settlements as the bank sought to resolve probes in areas including energy trading, oversight of services to Ponzi-scheme operator Bernard Madoff and mortgage-linked dealings by the bank and firms it acquired. The next year its assets grew by $157 billion.
In late 2011, mounting fines and liabilities over Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).’s role in the housing collapse pushed its stock price below $5. Still, the bank was able to add more than $80 billion in assets the following year.
Ratcheting Up
The Wells Fargo sanction -- called unprecedented by Fed officials -- arguably marks an apex for central-bank enforcement actions that have been ratcheting up in recent years.
The Fed has at times put a bank’s growth in check, such as in 2005 when it told  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). that it was expected to not undertake “significant expansion” until it addressed the issues that gave rise to numerous compliance failures. But before the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed wasn’t known for punishing lenders.
During former Chair Janet Yellen’s tenure it changed course, routinely banning bankers from the industry who had been accused of misconduct and joining other regulators in imposing billions of dollars in fines on Wall Street firms.
What’s unclear is whether Wells Fargo’s sanction reflects how the Fed will do business going forward, or if it’s the capstone of a more aggressive enforcement posture that could now start receding.
Trump’s Tone
President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly said he wants to loosen constraints on the financial industry, is increasingly putting his stamp on the central bank. His pick, Jay Powell, succeeds Yellen. Former  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) LP executive Randal Quarles is now responsible for the Fed’s oversight of large banks, and last month the Trump appointee laid out his road map for easing aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act and other rules.
Quarles said his plans include altering regulations that have forced lenders to hold bigger capital cushions, revising Volcker Rule trading restrictions and making annual stress tests that examine whether firms can endure another economic meltdown less burdensome. Quarles, who became the Fed’s vice chair of supervision in October, had no involvement with the Wells Fargo case because family ties have prompted him to recuse himself from all matters tied to the lender.
‘Willing’ Regulators
Representative Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said the Fed’s action shows that regulators must be vigilant across the industry.
“We need more regulators to be willing to use all of the regulatory tools at their disposal to deal with bad actors like Wells Fargo,” she said.
The Fed’s move presents an opportunity for other banking giants, according to Betsy Graseck, an analyst at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). Wells Fargo is coming off a year when its loans fell for the first time since 2010 as the bank grappled with fallout from the scandals and pulled back in auto lending. Any reliance on the consumer business for growth would come as the bank is shrinking its branch network.
‘Back Foot’
“I would think every competitor is looking at this saying, ‘OK, Wells is going to be on the back foot for the full year so let’s go after market share,” Graseck said Friday as analysts grilled Sloan on Wells Fargo’s conference call.
A “very small number” of Wells Fargo’s existing customers will be affected by the bank’s need to dial back some activities, Sloan said on the call. Among them will be other banks that have parked some of their money at Wells Fargo, said Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry. Ditching those high-cost deposits could end up boosting Wells Fargo’s net interest margin, Shrewsberry said.
Sloan, the bank’s chief executive since October 2016, isn’t in imminent danger, said Charles Peabody, an analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading.
“Sloan can stay as long as there is no additional scandal,” Peabody said. “You’ve got to have the shareholders on board to change management. I don’t sense you have it there yet.”
Still, in a Sunday note, Jefferies analyst Ken Usdin summed up concerns about the potential for more sanctions or nervous investors dumping shares by asking whether the Fed’s action was the “end of the beginning or beginning of the end.”

11,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 02:30AM ET</span>","Shanghai stocks post worst day in two years, more companies suspend shares","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China stocks tumbled on Tuesday as a global market rout intensified, with the Shanghai index posting its biggest loss in nearly two years on worries that inflationary pressures will prompt central banks to raise rates faster than expected.
The Shanghai Composite Index slumped 3.4 percent to 3,370.65 points, its biggest single-day drop since February 2016, while the blue-chip CSI300 index ended down 2.9 percent at 4,148.89.
The start-up board index ChiNextp plunged 5.3 percent to a three-year low, in its worst tumble since late 2016.
Chinese markets had bucked the global downdraft on Monday.
""We see little chances for a further steep correction in the A-share market, but for the moment investors shall be wary of liquor makers and home appliance makers that had rallied strongly in 2017, "" said Yan Kaiwen, an analyst with China Fortune Securities.
""The slump on the Wall Street could have limited impact on the A-share market, unless there is a stock market crash in the U.S.,"" Yan added.
A fresh wave of Chinese companies suspended trading in their shares to avoid margin calls, with investors also spooked by China's intensified crackdown on shadow banking.
Still, losses in China were not as sharp as some other Asian markets, partly due to Beijing's strict capital controls, which help shield the market from global volatility.
But small caps, which last week suffered their biggest weekly loss in a year, continued to underperform blue chips, as the threat of margin calls mounts.
On Monday, over 50 companies announced share suspensions as a growing number of companies took measures to avoid forced liquidation.

According to an estimate by Sinolink Securities, as of Jan 31, 1,066 cases of margin calls had been triggered, involving shares in 608 listed firms, and the list will grow if prices fall further.

BOSTON (Reuters) - As  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co enters the latest chapter in its long-running sales practices saga, Wall Street is trying to figure out how to make sense of new developments that do not affect profits very much but can send the bank's stock price careening.
On Friday, the U.S. Federal Reserve unveiled a consent order imposing a cap on Wells Fargo's balance sheet, as well as letters it sent to the bank's directors and two former chairmen criticizing them for weak oversight.
On Monday, Wells Fargo's share price fell 9.2 percent, more than twice as sharply as the market during a broad selloff.
The Fed's order followed two others issued by financial regulators in September 2016. Those were tied to a $190 million settlement over Wells Fargo employees creating millions of phony customer accounts to hit aggressive sales targets.
The Fed did not detail any new misdeeds at Wells Fargo, and executives said the order would reduce profits by less than 2 percent this year.
But the regulator's tough stance a full 514 days after the scandal erupted shows how hard it will be for Wells Fargo to shake it, investors and analysts said.
As the bank's asset and revenue growth has softened, it has been difficult to quantify how much is related to current regulatory actions and negative headlines about Wells Fargo's past behavior, they said.
""The thing people are really struggling with is, what does this do to revenue?"" Brian Foran, a bank analyst with Autonomous Research, said in an interview.
In a note to clients on Sunday, Chris Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co, wondered whether the Fed would go so far as to replace senior management, including Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan.
""The distraction of the sales practices scandal continues and we fear will leave choppy financial performance in its wake,"" Kotowski wrote.
Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk referred Reuters to Sloan's earlier statements in which he expressed confidence the bank would meet the Fed's requirements and serve customers.
While other regulators punished Wells Fargo for consumer abuses, the Fed's action pertained to the board of directors, which the Fed has sole jurisdiction over, a Fed official said. It was months in the making and stemmed from a report the board released in April, as well as news articles. The Fed believes the punishment is appropriate given the scale of Wells Fargo's compliance failures, the official said.
PROBLEMS LINGER
During the scandal, Wells Fargo launched a broad review of sales practices, installed new executives and board members – including a new CEO and chair – changed incentive structures, overhauled risk management and compensated many customers who said they were harmed.
But the problems have not ended.
In July, Wells Fargo said it may have forced customers into unwanted products and improperly closed accounts or frozen funds. In October, the bank fired its head of consumer lending for disparaging comments about regulators, some of whom are still mulling enforcement actions.
It is unclear whether regulators appointed by President Donald Trump will be as aggressive in scrutinizing Wells Fargo as their predecessors, since Trump has pledged to ease regulatory burdens broadly.
Investors and analysts said they were skeptical that the bank was out of the woods yet, given the ongoing consent orders and outstanding regulatory probes. On the other hand, the weakened stock could be a bargain, some said.
Greg Donaldson of Donaldson Capital Management, a mid-sized holder of Wells Fargo shares, said the Fed action seemed deserved, even though he sees the stock price decline as an opportunity to buy more shares.

""I'm a great fan of Wells Fargo, but what they did was wrong,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Southeast Asian shares suffered heavy losses on Tuesday, extending the rout to a second day, with most of the markets wiping out January's gains, as a sell-off pummeled markets across the world.
Wall Street plunged in highly volatile trading, with the S&P 500 and Dow Industrials indices slumping more than 4 percent, as the Dow notched its biggest intraday decline in history with a nearly 1,600 point drop. (N)
Investors fled from equities, spooked by a sharp rise in U.S. bond yields following Friday's data that showed U.S. wages increasing at the fastest pace since 2009 with lower unemployment, festering concerns over higher inflation and potentially higher interest rates. 
Asian shares plunged, with the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan plummeting as much as 4.1 percent in its worst fall since June 2016. 
However, Taye Shim, head of research at Mirae Asset Sekuritas, said the market reaction was slightly exaggerated.
""We are looking at situations where prices seem to have picked up little bit fast. However, I do not believe we are in a bubble situation,"" he said.
The correction is likely to continue for a while and presents a good opportunity for investors to collect attractive assets, said Shim. 
Vietnam, which as of Friday's close was the only Southeast Asian stock market with double-digit percentage gains this year, slumped as much as 6.3 percent in the session, its steepest intraday percentage decline since October 2001.
Malaysian shares plunged as much as 3.1 percent, in their biggest intraday percentage drop since April 2013.
Philippine shares fell as much as 2.7 percent, led by losses in financials.
Philippine annual inflation accelerated much faster than expected in January, data showed, increasing the chances of an interest rate hike this week.
Index heavyweights BDO Unibank Inc fell as much as 2.9 percent, while Ayala Corp slumped to a two-month low. 
Singapore shares retreated as much as 3.6 percent, in their biggest intraday drop in over a year, as financial stocks pulled down the index.

Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index plummeted 4.9 percent, on track for its biggest daily percentage drop since August, 2015. Hong Kong is particularly exposed to U.S. rate moves because its currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar.
The HSCE, an index tracking Hong Kong-listed Chinese firms, tumbled over 6 percent.
The market was little helped by a second-day of heavy bargain hunting from Chinese investors, who spent over 4 billion yuan $635.7 million) buying Hong Kong stocks during the morning session.
In China, both the Shanghai Composite Index and the blue-chip CSI300 Index fell more than 3 percent, as did start-up board ChiNext, which touched its lowest level in three years. Chinese markets had bucked the global downdraft on Tuesday.
A fresh wave of Chinese companies suspended trading in their shares to avoid margin calls, with investors also spooked by China's intensified crackdown on shadow banking. 
Albert Xu, Hong Kong-based strategist at Zhongtai International Securities Limited, said investors had been too complacent and that a correction in global equities was long over-due. 
""A sharp correction at such a high level is a normal thing,"" Xu said.
China's main indexes had climbed 5-6 percent in January, while the Hang Seng rose 10 percent and the HSCE surged over 14 percent.
Reflecting surging investor anxiety, the HSI Volatility Index which has been climbing this year, surged to the highest level since June 2016. 
Stocks fell across the board in Hong Kong, with China's biggest lenders and insurers such as ICBC, Bank of China, China Life and Ping An slumping over 6 percent. 
Still, some investors believe the slump is a good buying opportunity.
""Overall valuations in Hong Kong stock market are still relatively low, so it will attract fund inflows that hope to buy at the bottom after a short-term adjustment,"" Yang Delong, managing director at First Seafront Fund.
""The downside for Hong Kong stocks is smaller than for the U.S. market and after this round of adjustment, Hong Kong stock market is likely to regain momentum.""
CHINA MARKET 
Still, losses in China's indexes were generally more subdued than those in rest of Asia, partly due to Beijing's strict capital controls, which help shield the market from global volatility.[MKTS/GLOB] 
But small-caps, which last week suffered their biggest weekly loss in a year, continued to underperform blue chips, as the threat of margin calls mounts. 
On Monday, over 50 companies announced share suspensions as a growing number of companies took measures to avoid forced liquidation. 
According to an estimate by Sinolink Securities, as of Jan 31, 1,066 cases of margin calls had been triggered, involving shares in 608 listed firms, and the list will grow if prices fall further.

Monday's stock market rout left two of the most popular ETPs, which investors use to benefit from calm rather than volatile conditions, facing potential liquidation, market participants said.
The VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN sank 84 percent in after-hours trading, while the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF fell nearly 79 percent as investors questioned if they could survive the volatility shock.
The products seek to provide inverse exposure to VIX short-term futures and, when that measure spikes, the investment loses value, at which time ETP issuers could liquidate the shares.
It was not immediately clear if the issuers would opt to liquidate these products.
BlackRock did not mention the products by name, but reiterated its long-held view that inverse and ""leveraged"" ETPs that double or triple market returns ""are not ETFs, and they don't perform like ETFs under stress,"" adding ""that's why iShares does not offer them.""
IShares is the brand name for BlackRock's exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
BlackRock also called for a regulatory classification system to label levered and inverse ETPs differently than plain-vanilla ETFs, to show the risks associated with such products.
SVXY sponsor ProShare Capital Management LLC declined to comment. Janus Henderson Group plc, which markets the VelocityShares notes, could not be reached immediately.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, which issued the VelocityShares notes, traded down 6 percent after-hours.
""The XIV ETN activity is reflective of today's market volatility. There is no material impact to Credit Suisse,"" said spokeswoman Nicole Sharp. She declined to comment further.
Stocks plummeted in highly volatile trading on Monday, with the benchmark S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrials suffering their biggest respective percentage drops since August 2011 as a long-awaited pullback from record highs deepened.

For the Dow, the fall at one point of nearly 1,600 points was the biggest intraday point loss in Wall Street history.

However, Longi, one of China's top solar cell makers, won't give up on the U.S. market as a result of the move, global marketing director Xia Aimin said at a briefing.
China is the world's biggest solar panel producer.
Xia said Longi still needs to assess the impact of Trump's new policy, which was announced last month to help U.S. manufacturers, but which has alarmed Asian trading partners that produce lower cost goods.
The administration also put a tariff on imported washing machines.
""We realise that trade protectionism is going to have a severe effect on the solar market,"" Longi's chief strategy officer Shang Yaohua said at the same briefing.
""However, no matter how trade policy is heading, we will continue to expand capacity overseas and increase investment overseas,"" he added.

Futures fell to as low as 2,542, the weakest levels since early October, and 11.7 percent below their record peak of 2,878.5 touched on Jan. 29. S&P futures were last down 1.6 percent while Dow futures were last down 2.2 percent.
The slide added to sharp falls over the past week. The S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average had their biggest single-day percentage drops since August 2011 on Monday, while last week, they posted their biggest weekly percentage drops since January 2016.
""The amount of the selloff that we are seeing is normal,"" said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co in New York. ""The speed at which we are doing it is not normal.""
Purves said the futures slide could be magnified because of the ""short volatility"" trade unwinding, as well as being a reaction to Asian markets selling off. 
Wall Street's ""fear gauge"", the VIX, notched its biggest one-day jump on Monday in over two years, as U.S. stocks slumped and investors took to the options market in search of protection against a further slide in equities prices.
Monday's stock market rout left two of the most popular exchange-traded products that investors use to benefit from calm rather than volatile conditions facing potential liquidation, market participants said.
The question now for investors, who have ridden a nearly nine-year bull run, is whether this is the long-awaited pullback that paves the way for stocks to again keep rising after finding some value, or the start of a decline that leads to a bear market.
Bulls argue that strong U.S. corporate earnings, including a boost from the Trump administration's tax cuts, will ultimately support market valuations. Bears, including short sellers that bet on the market decline, say that the market is over-stretched in the context of rising bond yields as central banks withdraw their easy money policies of recent years.
""Where does the market rout end? I think we are pretty close to a selling climax here,"" said Purves. ""The fundamentals are pretty good. The only thing that is really different is that bond yields got up to 2.8 percent.""

Treasury yields fell from four year highs on Monday after a rapid selloff in equity markets sparked demand for the low risk debt, and benchmark 10-year note yields were last at 2.68 percent.

(Reuters) - Puerto Rico's financial oversight board told the bankrupt island's governor on Monday to revise his proposed fiscal turnaround plan to add more detail on labor and other reforms, and to create room in the budget for a $1.3 billion emergency fund.
In a letter to Governor Ricardo Rossello, the federally appointed, seven-member panel set a Feb. 12 deadline for the new draft, which will chart Puerto Rico's plan to regain economic stability. 
The U.S. territory is struggling to recover from September's Hurricane Maria - its worst storm in 90 years - while also navigating the biggest government bankruptcy in U.S. history, with $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt.
Rossello's draft turnaround plan, submitted on Jan. 24, projected a $3.4 billion budget gap that would bar the island from repaying a penny of its debt until 2022.
While the plan included subsidy cuts to cities and towns and the streamlining of public agencies, the board, which must approve the plan, demanded more details in Monday's eight-page letter. 
The board wants an emergency reserve of $650 million in the next five years and $1.3 billion within 10 years, ""based on best practices for states and territories regularly impacted by storms,"" it said. 
It also wants more details on key structural reforms, notably labor. The board suggested that Rossello make Puerto Rico an at-will employer and make severance and Christmas bonuses optional, both of which are norms among U.S. states. 
The board criticized Rossello's proposed reduction of capital expenditures to $400 million a year, saying there had ""been no project or agency-specific analysis"" to support that figure and that the plan should provide for expenditures ""necessary to maintain assets of the commonwealth.""
The board also sought more detail on Rossello's vision for Puerto Rico's energy grid, which was decimated by Maria. 
Rossello has announced plans to privatize Puerto Rico's bankrupt, quasi-public power utility, PREPA. 
But the governor's plan must ""support a transaction by providing a set of targets for a potential bidder to meet or exceed during the bidding process,"" the board said. 

It said the plan should provide a five-year outlook for financial stability at the utility, and for the creation of an independent energy regulator with commissioners appointed by the governor, from a candidate list developed by an independent expert panel.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average tumbled 5 percent to hit a near four-month low on Tuesday morning after Wall Street posted its worst decline in four years on fears about rising U.S. bond yields and potentially rising inflation.
The Nikkei was trading down 5.3 percent at 21,490.63 in midmorning trade, the lowest level since Oct. 20.
The S&P 500 and Dow Industrials indices slumped more than 4 percent overnight, as the Dow notched its biggest ever intraday drop, down nearly 1,600-points. The declines for the Dow and the benchmark S&P 500 index were the biggest single-day percentage drops since August 2011.
The rout reverberated through the Japanese market, which hit a 26-year peak last month, buoyed by last year's re-election of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, firm global growth and strong earnings expectations by local companies.
""Investors are now unwinding their risk positions,"" said Takuya Takahashi, strategist at Daiwa Securities. ""People are pulling out of risk assets now and at this point we don't know if this is temporary or not.""
Takahashi added that the Nikkei's immediate support is seen at its 200-day moving average of 20,938.
All of the Topix's 33 subsectors were in the red, with insurance and exporter stocks, such as machinery and electric component makers, among the worst hit.
Insurer T&D Holdings stumbled 7 percent and Dai-ichi Life Holdings nosedived 7.4 percent.
Furukawa Electric declined 6.2 percent, Yokogawa Electric dropped 6.3 percent and Sumitomo Electric Industries fell 6.2 percent.
Bellwether companies also lost ground. Toyota Motor Corp shed 3.7 percent, Honda Motor Co fell 4.4 percent, Sony Corp (T:6758) slipped 4.2 percent and Nintendo Co (T:7974) tumbled 5.2 percent.
Market participants expect that the Bank Of Japan will buy exchange-traded funds on Tuesday to support the market.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Emerging markets stocks are so far weathering the storm in developed markets stocks and bonds in the past few days, though action in U.S. markets in the next few days may test investor appetite for the asset class. 
Asian stock markets are expected to be pressured lower on Tuesday after the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index (SPX) fell 4.1 percent on Monday, its largest daily percentage drop in 6-1/2 years. 
By contrast the MSCI index of emerging market stocks (MSCIEF) fell only 1.75 percent, the largest drop in just over two months.
Most of the weakness in equities is expected to remain contained in U.S. markets, as investors change asset allocations due in part to a stronger than expected string of economic data.
U.S. economic growth was running at an annualized 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, and on Friday the U.S. Labor Department reported the unemployment rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, but wages saw their largest rise in more than eight years. 
Friday's data revived fears of inflation and a faster pace of Federal Reserve interest rate increases this year, pushing up U.S. benchmark bond yields to four year highs. 
""The reason for the (U.S. stocks) selloff is because things are better than people thought and they want to reevaluate allocations between equities and bonds,"" said Erin Gibbs, equity chief investment officer at S&P Global Market Intelligence in New York.
The relatively mild response in emerging markets speaks to traders confidence that the U.S. decline is a correction to stretched equity valuations rather than weakness in economic growth, corporate earnings or financial system strains, analysts said. 
""Over the last year we’ve been adding to emerging market value stocks, which is an asset class that is far more attractive than anything else we can find,"" said Catherine LeGraw, a member of the asset allocation team at Boston-based asset manger GMO.
LeGraw said that she expects that emerging market stocks will gain more than 6.0 percent this year after adjusting for inflation, a gain that “no other asset class comes close” to matching.
However, Monday data from the Institute of International Finance (IIF) show outflows from emerging market portfolios were the highest since the U.S. presidential election in November 2016, with bonds being hit less hard than equities.
And the current selloff in U.S. equities may not have run its course yet.
""Asia will follow in sympathy of what they saw in New York because the trigger of the selloff is a New York event,"" said Claudio Irigoyen, the New York-based head of Latin America economics and fixed income strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
The key, he said, lies in the U.S. Treasury debt market. U.S. Treasury yields fell on Monday, as the stocks selloff sparked demand for the low-risk debt, after yields hit four-year highs on Friday. 
Upward pressure on U.S. yields may not be over though as the Treasury is due to significantly increase its borrowing this year to make up for declining purchases from the U.S. central bank and to fund a fiscal deficit widening as a result of the Trump administration's tax cuts late last year.
""If you’re still having more of a rally in yields between now and tomorrow’s (stocks) open, that may lead people to think there’s more of a correction to come in equities,"" Irigoyen said. 
""If yields stabilize people may be more willing to buy the dip in U.S. equities tomorrow,"" this would help underpin emerging equities, he said.

After regular trading hours on Monday, S&P 500 E-mini stock futures rose 0.73 percent, suggesting some traders expect Wall Street to open with a gain on Tuesday.
Bulls argue that strong U.S. corporate earnings, including a boost from the Trump administration's tax cuts, will ultimately support market valuations. Bears, including short sellers that bet on the market decline, say that the market is over-stretched in the context of rising bond yields as central banks withdraw their easy money policies of recent years. 
The U.S. stock market has climbed to record peaks since President Donald Trump's election, on the prospect of tax cuts, corporate deregulation and infrastructure spending, and it remains up 23.8 percent since his victory. Trump has frequently taken credit for the rise of the stock market during his presidency, though the rally and economic recovery was well underway during the Obama administration. 
As the stock market fell on Monday, the White House said the fundamentals of the U.S. economy are strong. U.S. economic growth was running at a 2.6 annualized rate in the fourth quarter last year and the unemployment rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. 
On Monday, the financial, healthcare and industrial sectors fell the most, but declines were spread broadly as all major 11 S&P sectors dropped at least 1.7 percent. All 30 of the blue-chip Dow industrial components finished negative.
With Monday's declines, the S&P 500 erased its gains for 2018 and is now down 0.9 percent in 2018. The Dow is down 1.5 percent for the year.
The market's pullback comes amid concerns about rising bond yields and higher inflation which were reinforced by Friday's January U.S. jobs report that prompted worries the Federal Reserve will raise rates at a faster pace than expected this year. 
""The market has had an incredible run,"" said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist At JonesTrading In Greenwich, Connecticut.
""We have an environment where interest rates are rising. We have a stronger economy so the Fed should continue to tighten ... You're seeing real changes occur and different investments are adjusting to that,"" O'Rourke said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,175.21 points, or 4.6 percent, to 24,345.75, the S&P 500 lost 113.19 points, or 4.10 percent, to 2,648.94 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 273.42 points, or 3.78 percent, to 6,967.53.
On Monday, the S&P 500 ended 7.8 percent down from its record high on Jan. 26, with the Dow down 8.5 percent over that time. The declines come after the Dow and S&P posted their biggest weekly percentage drops since January 2016 last week, and the Nasdaq posted its biggest weekly drop since February 2016. 
At one point, the Dow fell 6.3 percent or 1,597 points, the biggest one-day points loss ever. Even with the sharp declines, stocks finished above their lows touched during the session. 
""It doesn’t look like people are working their orders – the programs are trading this,"" Dan Ryan, who works on the New York Stock Exchange floor for E&J Securities, said as he was leaving work for the day.
Investors also unloaded riskier corporate bonds during the Wall Street stock market rout. Exchange-traded funds that focus on junk bonds suffered a third day of losses. BlackRock’s iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, which has about $16 billion in assets, fell 0.6 percent to its lowest share price since December 2016. 
The CBOE Volatility index, the closely followed measure of expected near-term stock market volatility, jumped 20 points to 30.71, its highest level since August 2015.
“One thing is that going into the last week or so, investor bullishness was in the top decile of its historical range, which suggests that investors were pretty optimistic, with high expectations and largely complacent,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer with Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. ""There’s kind of an emotional reversal that’s going on.”
About 11.5 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges on Monday, well above the 7.6 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 8.64-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 6.92-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 1 new 52-week highs and 38 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 17 new highs and 164 new lows.

29,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 07:02PM ET</span>",You need to do some math on your new paycheck,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - When I received my first paycheck reflecting the new tax law, I was worried. 
I hate to owe money to the IRS at the end of the year and have always adjusted my W-4 tax withholding form to take out enough to ensure a small refund at year's end.
The amount withheld from my check for federal income tax seemed too low to cover my whole tax burden for 2018, given that usually itemize my deductions beyond the new higher standard deduction - even if I would get a bigger tax credit for my two kids.
The Tax Policy Center calculates that the new tax law will, on average, result in a cut of about $1,200 per family this year, but what I have learned covering personal finance is that there is really no average person when it comes to taxes. Everyone's situation is different. 
Many Americans might not know how to assess whether the amount of withholding from paychecks is correct, which is why I looked for expert help. I took my questions to Leon LaBrecque, a certified financial planner who is also a tax attorney, a certified public accountant and a chartered financial analyst in Troy, Michigan. To figure out if anyone's withholding is correct, LaBrecque looks deep into the paystub and also considers past tax liability. He did this with employees in his office to make sure their new withholdings were correct - most were. 
It turns out my withholding drop was due mostly to my filing status. As a divorced mom of two, I file as head of household, which falls between single and married in taxdom. There is no withholding formula for that status, which about 22 million American households use, and filing as a single person leads to too much withholding but joint filing status takes too little.
I was withholding as married, with two allowances. That filing status made things complicated, but the married numbers were closer to what LaBrecque thought my 2018 bill would be than listing as single. 
By contrast, Heather Baer, a 39-year-old teacher in Massachusetts, saw a bigger amount withheld from her check, making her take-home pay drop. This is because she files head of household as a divorced mom with two kids but was listed as single on her W-4 form. 
""I am flabbergasted,"" said Baer, who after investigating her options thinks she will now switch her withholding to married. 
Among others who might have special concerns about whether their new withholding is correct are around 5 million taxpayers who owed Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) in the past, people whose total itemizations exceed the new standard deduction of $12,000 for individuals, those with many children and, really, anyone who adjusted their W-4 previously to change the amount of money taken out of their checks. 
Bruce Steiner, a 67-year-old attorney in Manhattan, is one of them. He previously had to pay AMT, an additional tax imposed on high earners on top of regular tax. Steiner adjusted his withholding to take out extra each month - and then usually owed a big check at the end of the year any way. 
The new tax law preserves the AMT, but changes the income qualifications, so Steiner thinks he will no longer have to pay it. At the first opportunity, he changed his W-4 form to wipe out the extra amount. 
The IRS is planning to update the W-4 form by spring, and services like TurboTax plan to offer online calculators to help taxpayers estimate. 
For those who do not want to do math or worry about a hulking tax bill, the smart thing to do is save any increase in your pay, suggested Kelley Long, a Chicago-based financial planner and CPA with an expertise in personal finance. 
That is how Jessica Krakoski, a 34-year-old public relations executive in Austin, Texas, is approaching it. When she got her first paycheck with increased pay, she did limited math. 
""I just calculated how much it would be per month,"" Krakoski said. The extra $200 she will receive is now set to go automatically into her savings account. 
Krakoski tax situation will change again soon, though, as she is expecting her first baby in the summer. Any shortfall she has will probably be made up with a $2,000 child credit.

30,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 06:52PM ET</span>","Lululemon says CEO Potdevin has resigned, to pay him $5 million","By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian athleisure wear maker Lululemon Athletica's (O:LULU) Chief Executive Laurent Potdevin abruptly resigned on Monday effective immediately, with the company saying that he had fallen short of its ""standards of conduct"" without offering any details.
""Lululemon expects all employees to exemplify the highest levels of integrity and respect for one another, and Mr. Potdevin fell short of these standards of conduct,"" the Vancouver-based company said in a statement. It did not elaborate.
Reuters was unable to reach Potdevin for comment.
Lululemon said in the statement that Chairman Glenn Murphy would become executive chairman, with three senior executives taking on expanded duties and reporting to him. It also reaffirmed its updated guidance for the fourth quarter of 2017 for revenue of $905 million to $915 million.
Lululemon said separately in an exchange filing that it had agreed to pay Potdevin a total of $5 million in exchange for his agreeing to certain terms including a covenant not to sue the company.
The company's shares lost 3.5 percent to $74.71 in after hours trade. 
""Today's announcement is vague and damaging,"" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said in an emailed statement. ""As a company that prides itself on transparency and openness, we would expect it to have an honest conversation with stakeholders.""
Potdevin became CEO in January 2014, taking over from Christine Day who led the company during its transition from a niche yoga-wear maker to broader multi-sport appeal. He was previously president of the footwear brand TOM shoes.
A person familiar with the matter told Reuters that Potdevin's resignation was not related to any single action or event. The person was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter and request anonymity.
The company posted a 14 percent increase in sales in the quarter ended Oct. 29.

Potdevin had said he wanted the company to increase revenue by more than 40 percent to $4 billion by 2020. The company said in its statement on Monday that its strategies to achieve that were still on track.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber [UBER.UL] was either a cheating competitor willing to break the law to win the race to develop self-driving cars, or the victim of an unproven conspiracy theory stitched together by its main rival, Waymo, jurors heard in opening statements of a trade secrets trial on Monday.
The first salvos were delivered to a 10-person jury in San Francisco federal court in a civil lawsuit that could help determine who emerges in the forefront of the autonomous car business nearly a year after Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's self-driving car unit Waymo sued rival Uber Technologies Inc.
The case hinges on whether ride-hailing firm Uber used apparent trade secrets to advance its autonomous vehicle program. Waymo's allegation is that its former engineer Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files in December 2015 containing designs for autonomous vehicles before going to work for Uber and leading its self-driving car unit in 2016.
""Waymo wants you to believe that Anthony Levandowski got together with Uber as part of some grand conspiracy to cheat and take trade secrets,"" Uber attorney Bill Carmody said in his opening statement to the jury. ""But like most conspiracy stories it just doesn't make sense when you get the whole story.""
Waymo and Uber are part of a crowded field of automakers and technology companies competing to build fleets of self-driving cars that could transform urban transportation systems.
Waymo attorney Charles Verhoeven told the jury that the competitive pressures were so great to develop the cars that the then-Chief Executive of Uber, Travis Kalanick, decided that ""winning was more important than obeying the law.""
""We're bringing this case because Uber is cheating. They took our technology ... to win this race at all costs,"" Verhoeven said.
Waymo has estimated damages in the case at about $1.9 billion. Uber rejects the financial damages claim.
Uber attorney Carmody said the ""elephant in the courtroom"" was that, despite the downloads by Levandowski, Google’s proprietary information never made it to Uber and into its self-driving technology.
""There is no connection whatsoever between any files he downloaded ... and what’s in here,"" Carmody said, pointing to an Uber-designed Lidar sensor sitting in front of him, a light-based sensor that is crucial to autonomous driving and central to the case.
""There's not a single piece of Google proprietary information at Uber,"" he added. ""Nothing, zero, period.""
After what is expected to be two weeks of testimony, the jury will have to decide whether the eight apparent trade secrets were indeed such, and not common knowledge, and whether Uber improperly acquired them, used them and benefited from them.
Levandowski, regarded as a visionary in autonomous technology, is not a defendant in the case but is on Waymo's witness list. Levandowski was fired from Uber in May 2017 because the company said he refused to cooperate with Uber in the Waymo lawsuit and did not hand over information requested of him in the case.
WAYMO CEO TESTIFIES
Waymo sought to put a reassuring face on the company’s self-driving efforts, calling as its first witness Chief Executive Officer John Krafcik, who described for the jury the first car he bought, his two children and how he found Waymo’s mission to reduce driving fatalities ""inspiring.""
Asked why Waymo sued Uber, Krafcik responded, ""We believe in fair competition.""
""We believe in accelerating the technology that is going to save a lot of lives in this world. What we came to find is aspects of our technology were taken from us in an unfair fashion and it was important for us to correct that,"" Krafcik said.
Under cross-examination, however, Carmody tried to show that, rather than leading the pack in autonomous driving, behind the scenes Waymo was struggling to keep talent, citing emails between Waymo executives expressing concerns about the exodus of top engineers for rivals. 
Carmody showed to the jury one email sent by Levandowski to Google co-founder Larry Page on Jan. 9, 2016, a few weeks after downloading the documents. ""Chauffeur is broken. We are losing our tech advantage fast,"" Levandowski wrote, referring to a previous name of the project.
Uber has co-founder and former CEO Kalanick at the top of its witness list. There are a total of 99 potential witnesses between the two companies, according to court documents, including Google co-founders Page and Sergey Brin, Benchmark venture capitalist and Uber investor Bill Gurley and Alphabet executive David Drummond.
Waymo lawyer Verhoeven, ending the day, walked CEO Krafcik through the list of departed engineers who went to form their own companies or join others, asking him whether Waymo had sued them after their departure.

""We did not,"" replied Krafcik.

Bullish ISM services data, meanwhile, provided markets with a brief period of respite before the selloff resumed in earnest.
ISM nonmanufacturing data for January showed an uptick to 59.9, beating expectations of 56.5.
Analysts said the strong ISM reading was indicative of a strong economic activity, which could strengthen further, should tax-reform measures lead to a solid rise in consumption.
“The reading today is consistent with an economy that is growing close to 3%,” Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi said. “If consumers and companies spend the tax reform monies like they are supposed to, this could be the best year for the economy since the housing bubble years in the mid-2000s.”

The gauge retreated and is currently hovering around 30. Since 1990, the index’s average has been 19.3, but during the past three years of market calm that figure’s been below 13.
Amid the quick pace of moves, derivatives trading seemed almost quaint. The most-active VIX options on Monday were at strike prices like 15, 22, 18 and 16. VIX February calls with a 30 strike price weren’t even in the top 10 most-traded contracts on the gauge.
“Positioning-wise, VIX actually looks pretty bearish, with open interest near an all-time high and put/call ratio near a low,” MKM derivatives strategist Jim Strugger said in an interview on Monday. “If/when 30-plus strikes start flying off the shelves would be notable. Even today, most activity is 23 and lower.”
Given that much of the talk about the drop in equities has gone back to bond yields, some were looking for the effect of rates on the VIX as well.
“History suggests that rapid increases in bond yields are often short-lived catalysts for a higher VIX,” Mandy Xu, equity derivatives strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), wrote in a note Monday. “Once investors have had the chance to digest higher rates, equity volatility will quickly normalize.” She added, “over the long run, there has been zero empirical relationship between higher rates and higher VIX.”
The Merrill Option Volatility Estimate Index, which measures normalized implied volatility on one-month Treasury options, isn’t so far off its historical floor.
“Let’s assume this volatility is emanating from the Treasury market. Then it makes little sense to me that this event ends with MOVE just off of its all-time low,” Strugger said."

BNSF Railway Co, a unit of the billionaire's conglomerate  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), on Monday said it has become the first major U.S. railroad to join the Blockchain in Transport Alliance.
The alliance is a group of more than 200 companies examining how best to use the digital ledger technology behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the transport industry.
It hopes to establish blockchain standards in such areas as vehicle maintenance, quality control and fraud prevention.
Among its members are shippers FedEx Corp (N:FDX) and  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS), tire maker Bridgestone Corp (T:5108), German software company SAP SE (DE:SAPG) and some banks and brokers, according to the alliance's website.
BNSF said it will work with other alliance members to decide how data should be used in the freight transportation blockchain.
""It is important that the industry comes together to align around a set of standards,"" Muru Murugappan, BNSF's vice president of technology services, said in a statement.
He was not immediately available for additional comment.

BNSF operates in 28 U.S. states and Canada, and is among the largest of Berkshire's more than 90 business units. It generated $2.84 billion of profit in the first nine months of 2017.

(Reuters) - Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Ltd made a $121 billion ""best and final offer"" on Monday to acquire Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, ratcheting up pressure on its U.S. semiconductor peer to engage in talks on what would be the biggest ever technology acquisition. 
The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd use their market dominance to negotiate down chip prices.
Qualcomm responded that its board of directors would review the latest offer, and declined to comment further until then.
Broadcom's new $82 per share offer included $60 in cash and $22 in Broadcom stock. Its first offer, of $70 per share, in November comprised $60 in cash and $10 in stock. The increased stock component would subject the deal to a Broadcom shareholder vote.
Reuters first reported on Broadcom's new offer on Sunday.
Qualcomm shares fell 4.3 percent to $63.20 at mid-afternoon on doubts about the deal's prospects, as well a KGI Securities report that said Apple might drop the chipmaker in favor of  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) to supply modem chips for its next-generation iPhones.
Broadcom shares edged up 0.2 percent to $235.77.
""Qualcomm and its board now have a tough decision, as this is a compelling offer in our opinion,"" said analyst Daniel Ives of GBH Insights.
Singapore-based Broadcom is mainly a manufacturer whose connectivity chips are used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers. Qualcomm primarily licenses its technology for the delivery of broadband and data, a business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology.
Qualcomm is locked in a patent dispute with Apple over its licensing agreements.
""Qualcomm got where it did in the last 30 years with a business model hinging on intellectual property licensing that is, at this day and age, not sustainable. You can sell products, as Broadcom does, very successfully, and generate a very good return for your shareholders,"" Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan said in an interview.
In a presentation issued on its website, Broadcom criticized Qualcomm's management team, led by its CEO Steve Mollenkopf, for its total shareholder returns of negative 7 percent since 2005, while the wider semiconductor index has returned 106 percent.
In January, Qualcomm announced an ambitious 2019 profit target predicated on a new $1 billion cost reduction plan and resolving licensing disputes, including with Apple. Broadcom said there was no reason to believe Qualcomm's latest initiative would be successful.
Broadcom also announced concessions to address Qualcomm's concerns that their combination could take more than 18 months to secure regulatory approval, and that divestitures demanded by antitrust watchdogs could be financially burdensome.
Broadcom said it was willing pay Qualcomm a ""ticking fee"" if the transaction is not completed within its target of 12 months after any definitive agreement. It would also pay a significant ""reverse termination fee"" if regulators scuttle the deal.
Broadcom's antitrust counsel, Daniel Wall of Latham & Watkins LLP, said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that Broadcom was willing to sell two Qualcomm businesses to resolve any antitrust problems. These are its Wi-Fi networking processors and RF Front End chips for mobile phones.
""There is no antitrust issue. The overlap is very limited in this transaction. People talk about us making even more commitments on the regulatory front, like adding hell-or-high water provisions, which are not a very well defined legal standard, and we chose not to include it because it would not add much incremental certainty,"" said Tan.
QUALCOMM'S DEAL WITH NXP 
Broadcom said on Monday its improved offer was premised on either Qualcomm acquiring  NXP Semiconductors  NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) on the current disclosed terms of $110 per share in cash, or the $38 billion transaction being terminated.
NXP shareholders, led by activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, are resisting the deal, pushing for Qualcomm to raise its offer. NXP shares were trading at $119.16 on Monday afternoon, indicating investors were expecting a sweeter deal.
Qualcomm's proposed acquisition of NXP was approved by European Union antitrust regulators last month. Qualcomm expects China's blessing later this month, at which point it has to decide whether it would raise its offer.
At Qualcomm's March 6 shareholder meeting, Broadcom plans to nominate a slate of directors to replace Qualcomm's board. That remains the company's focus unless Qualcomm agrees to negotiate, Tan said. When asked, he did not exclude the option of launching a direct offer for Qualcomm shares.

""We are going all the way to Qualcomm's shareholder meeting of March 6,"" Tan said.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's concerns over how the European Union should proceed with taxing large digital businesses are shared by a growing number of countries, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe told Reuters on Monday. 
Italy, France, Germany and Spain are pushing to change tax legislation for tech corporations accused of paying too little tax in the EU but have faced resistance from smaller nations like Ireland, who fear the reform could hurt their economies.
Ireland wants any tax reforms to be coordinated on a global basis and while the European Commission has pledged to follow the work being spearheaded by OECD in this area, it has also kept open the option of acting unilaterally.
""From talking bilaterally to a number of my (EU) colleagues since the meeting we had in Estonia (in September), the concerns that we have in relation to digital taxation are broadly shared...I would say by a growing number of countries,"" Donohoe said in an interview in his Dublin office. 
""If we bring forward measures relating to digital taxation, they're going to have to apply equally to international, local and European companies and I think as that is better understood, the need for debate and care about how we look at that tax policy will only grow.""
Ireland's low 12.5 percent corporate tax rate has long made it a hub for investment from the likes of Google (O:GOOGL) and Facebook (O:FB). Dublin has found an ally in Hungary on the issue and has also been boosting alliances with Nordic and Baltic states since like-minded Britain voted in 2016 to leave the EU.
Donohoe said such alliances would help with his nomination of Irish central bank chief Philip Lane for the post of European Central Bank vice president.
Lane is so far the only declared candidate two days before nominations close but Donohoe is ""certain"" there will be at least one more, likely proposed by Spain. Its economy minister Luis de Guindos has long been considered the favorite for the job.
ECONOMY OVERHEATING?
Donohoe, who added the finance ministry to his brief as public expenditure minister in June, inherited an economy that had recovered rapidly from collapse a decade ago and is almost certain to have been the best performing in Europe for a fourth successive year in 2017.
Having warned just weeks into his new role that Ireland must be careful not to overheat the economy, Donohoe said on Monday those risks remained unchanged but that he did not believe the economy is currently overheating.
""We still believe there are people who are not working at the moment who can work again, who want to work again and economic activity has to get to the point to move them back into paid employment,"" the 43-year-old economics graduate said.
""Secondly, if I look at the wage growth that is taking place in the economy, while it does vary very strongly sector to sector, on average it is in line with the kind of growth rate in national income that we are seeing at the moment.""

Donohoe, whose department last forecast in October that the economy would grow by 3.5 percent in 2018, said he was confident that growth would come in at 3.5 to 3.75 percent this year.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Nearly 100 Belgian companies called on Monday for Germany's Lufthansa to keep Brussels Airlines based in Belgium and not to merge it with Eurowings, as the German carrier replaced the Belgian airline's top management.
Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), which took control of the Belgian national flag carrier in 2016, on Monday appointed a new chief executive officer and chief operating officer at the airline.
Christina Foerster will take over the helm of Brussels Airlines on April 1, Brussels Airlines said in a statement on its website after a board meeting.
Executives at Belgian firms including  Solvay  (BR:SOLB) and AB Inbev (BR:ABI) said in an open letter that the connectivity offered by Brussels Airlines was strategically important for Belgium and its ability to export products and services.
""We are today advocating that Brussels Airlines remains a strong airline, anchored in Brussels, that meets the needs of the various segments in the market,"" they wrote in the letter published on the website of communications firm Akkanto.
""It is crucial that Brussels Airlines, together with its many partners, can further develop the hub in Brussels and the network of flights to Europe and the rest of the world.""
In response to the letter, Lufthansa's Eurowings said the strengths of both airlines would be combined.
""There is no difference in content between the demands of the Belgian economy and Eurowings' plans to build a strong, sustainable and leading pan-European airline, together with Brussels Airlines,"" a spokesman said, adding Brussels Airlines would retain a base in the Belgian capital.
Lufthansa is using Brussels Airlines to expand long-haul operations for its Eurowings budget brand out of Duesseldorf.
The letter was welcomed by unions representing workers at Brussels Airlines, which employs 3,400 people. 
Anita Van Hoof from the BBTK union, said it was ""uplifting"" to be supported by the Belgian company executives.
""But that is not the main point. We are very worried about the number of jobs that will remain in Brussels after Lufthansa’s decision. We have not heard about their plans so far which causes a lot of uncertainty,"" Van Hoof told Reuters. 
Union representatives have said they would consider strike action depending on the outcome of Lufthansa's decision.
""It will not only be the brand that will change, it's the business model: the employment, the conditions,"" Filip Lemberechts, secretary of the CGSLB union, said.
Brussels Airlines emerged out of SN Brussels Airlines which was created in 2002 in the wake of the bankruptcy of Sabena.
This went bust after Swissair, which then owned a 49 percent stake, failed to inject the necessary funds and a Brussels court later held the Swiss airline responsible for its failure.

Swissair later also collapsed and its successor Swiss International Airlines was taken over by Lufthansa.

98,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 11:02AM ET</span>","Goldman Sees S&P 500 Risks Going Either Way, Urges Options Hedge","(Bloomberg) --  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). sees such extensive risks in its year-end S&P 500 Index target of 2,850 -- both positively and negatively -- that it’s advising clients to use options to maintain their upside exposure but limit risk.
There’s a lot to be positive about out there, strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note to clients. Stronger economic growth, higher commodity prices and a weaker U.S. dollar than their baseline assumptions could push the S&P 500 to as high as 3,000. In addition, investor positioning points to further gains, with the potential for U.S. households to allocate more to stocks and a “significant upside” for equities demand from corporations given gains in the gross domestic product and windfalls from tax reform.
The report discounts concerns of a repeat of 1987, when a 13 percent return in January preceded an unprecedented drop in equities that October, saying that such a focus overlooks “other historical episodes that suggest a much better outlook” this year.
“Of the 12 other years since 1950 that started with a January return greater than 5 percent, 1987 is the only one in which the February-December return was negative,” Kostin’s team wrote in the note dated Feb. 2.
That said, there is cause for concern. Rising interest rates will prevent valuations from expanding above the current 18 times price-to-earnings ratio on the S&P 500, the strategists said. They also see some positioning data as pointing to caution, including CFTC equity-futures data showing long and net positions at new records, and NYSE net margin debt at the highest level relative to market capitalization since at least 1980.
Amid all that, Goldman’s advice is simply to prepare for a potential move, one way or the other.
“Consider using calls to maintain exposure to S&P 500 upside while limiting downside risk,” the strategists say, adding that “investors who are already long cash equities could instead consider purchasing puts as protection.”"
99,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 11:01AM ET</span>",Fed restrictions continue to badger Wells Fargo; U.S. banks down,"By Aparajita Saxena
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's shares fell as much as 9.4 percent to $58.05 on Monday, sparking a sector-wide sell off after the Federal Reserve imposed regulatory restrictions on the bank, forcing it to improve its governance and controls in the wake of the sales scandal.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) fell nearly 2 percent,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) fell 1.5 percent, while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) dipped nearly 0.8 percent in early trading.
""Banks generally respond well to higher rates/inflation but I do think the WFC news is taking down the entire large cap bank tape this morning,"" said RJ Grant head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York.
Wells Fargo, which posted its biggest intraday percentage loss in six and a half years, led losses on the S&P 500 index, down 0.18 percent.
U.S. stock markets fell last week after a broad-based pullback dampened investor sentiment.
The U.S. Fed on Friday told Wells Fargo it is not allowed to grow beyond the $1.95 trillion in assets it had at the end of last year ""until it sufficiently improves its governance and controls"".
Wells estimates the cap will cut its annual profit by $300 million to $400 million this year, as it reduces some parts of its balance sheet, like corporate deposits and trading assets, in order to continue growing core businesses.
While the market has largely hailed the restrictions on Wells as necessary for making amends, many see the tightening as bringing the regulatory spotlight back to banks, especially at a time when the financial sector has been calling for relaxing federal regulations and scrutiny.
""...we have long said that regulator-imposed restrictions on growth (M&A, branch openings, capital return) is not a good thing,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Jason Goldberg.
""This action (against Wells Fargo) is severe and unprecedented for a large, sound bank. Though we believe this situation will be manageable, it will clearly keep WFC in the penalty box for a bit longer,"" he added.
Regional banks also fell, tracking large-cap banks' shares. The KBW Regional Banking index slipped 0.7 percent. SunTrust Banks Inc (NYSE:STI) and M&T Bank Corp (NYSE:MTB) fell around one percent each, while Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Inc and  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT) dipped 0.6 percent each.

""I think some concerns might be creeping into the group given this enforcement from the regulators. The Fed is definitely messaging that the industry shouldn't take regulators lightly and that enforcement is going to be harsh if you cross the line,"" KBW's Grant said.

Markets closed in the negative on Friday after a strong jobs report showed that wages grew at their fastest pace in more than eight and a half years, fueling inflation concerns. The Labor Department reported the U.S. economy had added 200,000 jobs in January, beating a consensus of 180,000, while wages grew by 2.9 percent on an annualized basis.
Bond yields rose after the report, as investors grow concerned that inflation will rise and the Federal Reserve will interest rates more than expected next year. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.855% while the 30-year Treasury bond surged to 3.116%.
Bond yields rise when prices fall.
Bank and technology stocks were among the worst performers after the morning bell.

While the market for RF chips is expanding with the upgrade to 5G telecom networks from 3G/4G, iPhones account for more than a third of the market demand and a swing in Apple's fortunes impacts RF chip makers more, analyst Joseph Moore said.
""A miss in iPhone units shipments and big upticks in channel inventory points to additional supply chain cuts for the June quarter,"" Moore wrote in a research note.
Shares of Apple were up 1.5 percent in early trading, while Qorvo's were little changed and Skyworks dipped 0.5 percent amid a decline in the broader market.
Apple sold 77.3 million iPhones in the key holiday quarter, missing Wall Street expectations of 80 million.
Apple plans to slash its iPhone X production target by half for the first three months of the year, to around 20 million units, the Nikkei reported late last month.
Several analysts have cut their estimates for iPhone X shipments in the past few weeks, citing a high price, among other factors, for muted demand for the 10th anniversary edition of the iPhone.
Moore estimates Apple purchases about 10 percent of all semiconductors, and said the broader chip industry would benefit with a pick up in demand for the iPhone.

""Given Apple's outsized influence, a reduction in their build rates and inventory could be the catalyst for industry conditions to loosen up.""

112,By Business Insider,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 09:51AM ET</span>",The global stock bloodbath has nervous traders doing something not seen since the presidential election," For much of the stock market's blistering bull market run, investors have stayed remarkably calm, with measures of fear locked near historical lows.
However, it appears that the rapid global selloff that's rocked markets in recent days — including a 4% drop in the benchmark S&P 500 — has made traders re-think that stance.
The Cboe Volatility Index — or VIX — has seen a sudden gain, spiking 66% in just six trading days to the highest since Election Day 2016. In addition, investors are paying the highest premium since the election to protect against a decline in an exchange-traded fund tracking the S&P 500, relative to bets on an increase, according to Bloomberg data.
In other words, traders have been snapped out of complacency, and the escalating situation appears to have their attention to a degree not seen in 14 months.
And can you blame them for finally showing some worry? Given that the market spent months breaking new record highs seemingly everyday, a decline of this magnitude feels even more drastic.
The increase in the cost of downside protection comes amid repeated hedging recommendations from Wall Street strategists. Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett has been saying for weeks that investor confidence has gotten overextended, and that traders should be guarding their gains any way they can.
Meanwhile, INTL FCStone macro strategist Vincent Deluard has taken it a step further, offering a handful of hedging suggestions for a landscape he acknowledges is much trickier to navigate than before.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) weighed in on Monday morning with a cautiously optimistic view, noting that while we're undoubtedly in the throes of a selloff, US indexes are still up in 2018. Still, the firm agrees with its Wall Street counterparts that it's better to be safe than sorry.
""Investors who are already long cash equities could instead consider purchasing puts as protection,"" Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a client note. ""Our derivatives strategists believe options are inexpensive relative to recent market moves."""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) played up the prospects for a potential new mid-market jet on the eve of the Singapore Airshow on Monday - but the war for sales has already begun in this area of the market worth hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 20 years.
Even before Boeing decides whether to launch its much-touted new jet, the U.S. planemaker and European rival Airbus are stepping up sales of existing models to seize market share and disrupt each other's profits without the temporary respite many had been expecting after a busier than expected 2017.
Their battle is focused on aircraft with around 200-270 seats, where Boeing leads at the top end with its twin-aisle 787 Dreamliner and Airbus seeks to maintain its dominance of the largest single-aisle planes like the A321neo, executives say. 
Although few immediate orders are expected, aggressive sales pitches have increased the tension going into this week's air show, where airlines will be hoping for updates on Boeing's development plans and Airbus's possible response.
After trouncing Airbus in the market for wide-body planes last year, Boeing is trying to seize the advantage by directly targeting Airbus's slow-selling A330neo with further sales to airlines of its competing 787, several industry sources said.
Airbus, by contrast, hopes to keep pumping its hot-selling single-aisle AA321neo into the market to minimize the space left for Boeing in the niche between single-aisle and long-haul jets, where Boeing's new jet is waiting on the drawing board. 
""You can expect Airbus to be pushing as many A321s as possible this year. Boeing is attacking the A330neo wherever it pops up,"" said the fleet manager of a large Western airline.
Several U.S. airlines and low-cost, long-haul carriers such as Level, part of the IAG (LON:ICAG) group, are comparing the Boeing 787 and the recently upgraded A330neo as competition intensifies, market sources said.
Even AirAsia, Airbus's top Asian customer, has said it is considering the Boeing 787 for long-haul operations, in what would be a significant upset for the European company. 
Airbus officials were not available for comment.
INTERNAL GOAL
Boeing's potential new mid-market jet would seat 225 to 275 people and enter service in the middle of next decade, senior vice president Dinesh Keskar told reporters, adding interest was coming from markets like Australia, India and the Middle East.
Asked about expectations that Boeing would launch the plane this year, he said, ""Certainly the interest is there and we continue to have our dialogue with customers"".
Airbus argues it already controls much of that space with its 185-240-seat A321neo, which boasts 80 percent of comparable sales, and the albeit less-in-demand A330neo wide-body.
But despite winning the 2017 order battle thanks to a record deal for small jets, Airbus took a severe hit in the high-margin wide-body market, where Boeing won three times as many orders.
Airbus has shrugged off the loss, claiming a 50 percent share of average sales over 10 years. But privately, it has made closing the gap its top internal goal this year, sources say.
These concerns have intensified as Airbus faces a wave of new departures following the retirement of sales chief John Leahy, who is in Singapore this week to facilitate the handover to his successor, ex-Rolls-Royce executive Eric Schulz.
""The A330neo is a big priority for Airbus this year in sales,"" BOC Aviation Chief Executive Robert Martin told Reuters.

""There are new markets opening up this year for mid-sized wide bodies. India is probably going to have more growth ... Maybe some of the U.S. majors will add to their growth. I think we are going to see a big battleground in this area.""

As 2018 brings back wilder swings to markets, developing-nation equities are beating other asset classes from U.S. stocks to gold, bonds and commodities when returns are adjusted for volatility. This despite a more-than-40 percent increase in emerging-market price turbulence this year, and a weekly loss that matched the worst since the election of Donald Trump.
After a scorching start to the year, global markets are turning cautious as concern grows that risk-seeking and the hunt for greater yields have gone too far. Technical signals point to near-term losses, and volatility gauges are surging. The Chicago Board Options Exchange SPX Volatility Index, known also as the VIX, or fear gauge, has soared 68 percent this year and similar measures for Europe and emerging markets have jumped at least 42 percent.
If bonds extend declines and a weakening dollar prompts the Federal Reserve to hasten monetary tightening, volatility could rise further and investors may start looking for assets that yield better risk-adjusted returns.
Emerging-market stocks are cheaper today than they were before the U.S. presidential election, when compared with U.S. and developed-market equities. The lower valuations and growing earnings estimates may give the comfort investors need in times of turbulence.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets were routed around the globe on Monday, with European indexes opening lower and bond yields rising as resurgent U.S. inflation raised the possibility central banks would tighten policy more aggressively than had been expected.
Europe's benchmark Stoxx 600 (STOXX) fell 1.5 percent, its sixth consecutive day of losses totaling 4.6 percent - the biggest decline since the United Kingdom voted in June 2016 to leave the European Union.
All major indexes in Europe fell: the UK's FTSE 100 (FTSE) dropped 1.4 percent, France's CAC 40 (FCHI) 1.4 percent and Germany's DAX (GDAXI) 1 percent.
Friday's U.S. payrolls report showed wages growing at their fastest pace in more than eight years, fuelling expectations that both inflation and interest rates would rise more than previously forecast.
That sparked a sell-off in U.S. equities that is set to continue on Monday. Dow Jones futures (1YMc1) pointed to the market opening 1.1 percent lower, with the S&P 500 down 0.6 percent and the NASDAQ (NQc1) down 0.9 percent.
Futures markets <0#FF:> priced in the risk of three, or even more, rate rises by the Federal Reserve this year after Friday's data release.
""This added fuel to a bond market sell-off, pushing US 10 year Treasury bond yields closer to the magic 3 percent level, which will only increase borrowing costs for corporates following years of cheap financing, thus ushering equities further from recent highs,"" said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets
Bond yields, which move inversely to bond prices, initially rose to multi-year highs across the globe before pulling back in later trades.
Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury debt (US10YT=RR) hit a four-year high of 2.885 percent, having jumped almost 7 basis points on Friday. They were last trading at 2.833 percent.
German 10-year yields, the benchmark in Europe, rose to 0.774 percent (DE10YT=RR), their highest since September 2015, before falling to last trade at 0.671 percent.
FX FALLOUT
Faster rate rises by the Fed would hurt emerging markets and commodity currencies, said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) macro strategist Alan Ruskin.
Emerging-market currency the South African rand <ZAR=> fell 0.4 percent, with the Chinese yuan and Polish zloty <PLN=> down around 0.2 percent.
Rising U.S. yields gave the dollar some support. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was up fractionally at 89.267 (DXY), after climbing 0.6 percent on Friday for its biggest single-day gain in three months.
Any rally by the dollar weakens commodities priced in the currency, with the Thomson Reuters CRB index down 0.5 percent. Gold <XAU=> was off at $1,335.78 an ounce after losing 1 percent on Friday.

In oil markets, Brent (LCOc1) fell 1.36 percent to $67.66 a barrel and U.S. crude (CLc1) dropped 1.06 percent to $64.76.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) have teamed up with insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG) SE to offer discounts on cyber insurance to businesses that primarily use equipment from both technology companies, they said on Monday.
The arrangement, which also includes insurance broker Aon Plc, will help businesses fortify their cyber security defenses and make them eligible to score more favorable terms for cyber coverage, such as lower or no deductibles, along with support services in the event of attack, the companies said.
""The key here is a holistic approach to cyber,"" Jason Hogg, chief executive officer of Aon Cyber Solutions, which helped develop the product, said in an interview. 
The offering helps to streamline cyber security for businesses, which Hogg said are often addressed in a ""siloed manner,"" with everyone from technology staff to legal departments playing separate roles.
Cyber coverage is a mounting concern for companies worldwide as hackers increasingly take aim at their technology systems. Cyber crime insurance, once a little-known product, has gained traction as hacks involving large companies such as  Equifax Inc  (NYSE:EFX) and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) have become more costly and commonplace.
U.S. cyber security premiums totaled $1.35 billion in 2016, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. That is a sliver of the $244.9 billion in total premiums for U.S. commercial line insurers, but a growing market in which insurers are trying to distinguish themselves.
Apple CEO Tim Cook said in June that his company and Cisco were collaborating to get cyber insurance discounts for businesses using their products. He said the combination of gear from the two companies was more secure than competing technology. 
Long known for its consumer devices, Apple has embraced business users in recent years, adding additional security features to its iPhones and iPads. In 2015, Cook said Apple was generating at least $25 billion a year in sales to businesses.
The new offering begins with a cyber security evaluation by Aon, the companies said. Businesses using Cisco Ransomware Defense malware-blocking software and certain Apple devices can then apply for special cyber insurance through the specialty lines unit of Allianz SE, the companies said.

Policyholders that are victims of a cyber attack will receive support services from either Cisco or Aon, the companies said.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Dalian Wanda Group is selling a $1.24 billion stake in its listed film business to a pair of investors led by  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA), as the conglomerate looks to bring in strategic partners and raise new funds.
The property-to-entertainment firm will sell the combined 12.77 percent in Wanda Film Holding Co Ltd (SZ:002739) to e-commerce giant Alibaba and state-backed Cultural Investment Holdings Ltd (SS:600715) for a total of 7.8 billion yuan ($1.24 billion).
The move, hot on the heels of a separate deal to bring in investors to its commercial property unit, highlights a major shift by Wanda towards a streamlined, ""asset light"" model, amid a broad crackdown in China on high levels of corporate debt.
""Generally speaking, Wanda needs more cash, and every business line needs cash,"" said Li Chengdong, a Beijing-based analyst, referring to a cash crunch that has hit Wanda and a number of other major Chinese conglomerates over the past year amid tightening access to credit.
In the latest deal, Alibaba will invest 4.68 billion yuan of the total. Wanda would remain as the controlling shareholder of the firm with a 48.09 percent stake, it said in a statement.
Wanda said the deal would give its film business access to Alibaba's strength in big data, while Cultural Investment, indirectly controlled by Beijing city's cultural assets arm, would help to open up tourism-related opportunities.
""The main purpose of the equity transfer of Wanda Film Holding is to bring in shareholders with strategic value,"" Wanda said.
Alibaba, which has its own film division as well as businesses from sports and ticketing to online payments, said in a statement the deal reflected the ""future development potential"" of Wanda Film.
The stake sale will add to the around $16 billion in investment deals that Wanda has announced since last year. In late January, Wanda said its commercial property arm had reached a deal to get a $5.4 billion investment from a group led by tech giant Tencent Holdings (HK:0700).
Wanda, along with other major conglomerates including HNA Group and Fosun International (HK:0565), has faced increased scrutiny of its finances and debts over the past year as Beijing clamps down on what it terms ""irrational"" overseas deals.
Last month, Wang Jianlin, Wanda's chairman, said the company had greatly reduced its debt and would use its ""limited cash"" in developing Wanda Plazas, the group's core business. He also pledged to reduce Wanda's corporate debt through all available means to ""absolute safe"" levels within two or three years. 
Wanda Film includes Wanda's film production, marketing and distribution assets, including over 500 cinemas, but does not include Wanda's U.S.-based studio Legendary Entertainment and several other film-related assets.
The film unit had operating revenues of 13.2 billion yuan last year, Wanda said in its statement.

158,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 07:31AM ET</span>",Southeast Asian airlines look to non-stop U.S. flights despite profit challenges,"By Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Vietnam Airlines JSC will struggle to be profitable on non-stop flights between Vietnam and the United States due to a lack of demand from business travelers, but it may launch them anyway as early as next year, the carrier's CEO said on Monday.
Duong Tri Thanh, and his counterparts at other state-controlled Southeast Asian carriers such as Thai Airways International PCL and Malaysia Airlines, are trying to balance government desires for growth with what is best for the airlines' financial health in a competitive market.
""The philosophy of the company is to help the economy and try to be viable and profitable,"" Thanh told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference ahead of the Singapore Airshow. 
""But growing the economy is more of a mandate. You can see on most of the intercontinental routes we are not making money. But we are helping to get people in and out.""
The market for flights between Southeast Asia and the United States is highly competitive and consists mostly of options involving a stop in North Asian or Middle Eastern countries due to the distances involved.
There are exceptions; due to geography Philippines Airlines has a slightly shorter, more economical hop to U.S. west coast cities, while Singapore Airlines Ltd launched 17.5 hour non-stop flights from its Singapore hub to San Francisco last year. 
The Singapore carrier plans to resume even longer flights to Los Angeles and New York later this year after a five-year hiatus, helping to close a gap in its U.S. capacity relative to competitors like Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and Emirates.
New technology, such as Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 787 Dreamliners and Airbus SE A350s jets that have longer ranges and are more fuel-efficient than their predecessors have improved the economics of such flights, which were abandoned by Singapore Airlines, Malaysia Airlines and Thai Airways when the fuel price rocketed earlier in the decade.
""Those are very finely balanced as to whether they are viable based on fuel prices and load factors and the mix of customers,"" Association of Asia Pacific Airlines Director-General Andrew Herdman said. 
Singapore Airlines has a reputation for quality and a substantial amount of business travel to and from the city-state, improving its ability to configure aircraft with a high number of premium seats and charge more than one-stop competitors, according to analysts.
""With Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia you simply can't get away with charging the premium needed compared to the one-stops, which are now very aggressively priced, due to the intense competition in the Southeast Asia-U.S. market to make the non-stop flights profitable,"" said Brendan Sobie, chief analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation. 
Thanh said his airline benefited from a diaspora of 2 million Vietnamese living in the United States, but most of the traffic was more likely to be driven by price rather than the convenience of saving a few hours of travel time.
""It is quite a big headache, to be honest,"" he said, of coming up with a viable business plan for the flights. 

""The plan is the end of 2019. But if it is not feasible and it is too much we have to wait to find a way to work with partners to improve the traffic mix. Like most of the airlines, like Philippines and Thai, we don't have enough business travelers. We are just dependent on visiting friends and relatives. That is no way to make money.""

While the Fed is poised to push on with rate hikes, the difference this time round is that it’s not just the U.S. that’s enjoying an economic revival.
“Synchronized global growth is always very good for emerging markets,” said Diana Amoa, who oversees a $2.9 billion emerging markets local currency bond fund at JPMorgan. “We have been expecting this and positioned our portfolios according to this.

Neither Amazon nor the French authorities would say what the settlement was worth.
Amazon first acknowledged in 2012 that the French government was seeking back taxes, interest and penalties for the fiscal years from 2006 to 2010 in relation to ""the allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions"".
""We have reached an overall settlement agreement with the French authorities on past questions,"" an Amazon France spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters. 
Amazon has in the past been criticized for minimizing its tax bill in France and other European countries by channeling sales through Luxembourg, which offers tax breaks to foreign companies which base themselves there.
It said that it had set up a branch in France in 2015 and now booked retail sales, charges and profits in the country.
The French government has opened the door to negotiating settlements in long-running tax cases after it lost a court case against Google (O:GOOGL) last July.
A French court ruled that Google was not liable to pay 1.1 billion euros in back taxes demanded by the French authorities as the company did not have sufficient taxable presence in France.
Since then the French government has also been pushing hard at the EU level for new rules to tax online companies based on their revenues, rather than only on their profits at present.
Such companies are often taxed on profits booked by subsidiaries in low-tax countries like Ireland or Luxembourg, even though the bulk of their sales comes from other EU countries.
Separately, EU competition regulators told Luxembourg in October to recover about 250 million euros in back taxes from Amazon, accusing the country of giving illegal tax benefits. Luxembourg has lodged a legal challenge against the move.

162,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Model planes and chocolate hearts: Air Berlin surprised by auction success,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Defunct airline Air Berlin's first auction of assets drew almost 13,000 bids for items ranging from plane seats to chocolate hearts and model aircraft, the administrator said, with more lots still to go under the hammer.
Lucas Floether declined to give the total amount raised by the first auction, citing legal restrictions, but said the auction website had received 1.2 million hits, with bids placed by buyers in 45 countries.
""The high level of interest positively surprised us,"" he said in a statement on Monday. 
The auction is the first of four to raise cash for creditors of Air Berlin, once Germany's second-largest airline, serving 30 million passengers a year, which filed for insolvency in August after years of losses and burdened by heavy debt.
Its operations have been carved up among rivals, including Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and easyJet (L:EZJ), but an inventory of objects owned by the airline is being sold in a process organized by the Dechow auction house.
A 4.8 meter-long model Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 plane went for 7,800 euros ($9,721), while items such as umbrellas were picked up for around 30-40 euros. The chocolate hearts that Air Berlin used to hand out at the end of each flight went for as much as 352 euros for a box of 100.
In three further auctions that run until Feb. 16, fans can pick up retro-style messenger bags, deck chairs and beach balls with the Air Berlin logo, plus more model planes in various sizes.
It is not clear whether staff uniforms, including those worn by pilots, can be sold. The auction house is currently in talks with aviation authorities as to whether they can be offered to the public because they have official markings and selling them could contravene security regulations.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Stock markets are expected to get off to a pouncing start in the Year of the Dog but investors might want to sniff around for value a bit later, Hong Kong brokerage CLSA said in its astrological predictions for the 2018 lunar year.
CLSA's Feng Shui Index, a tongue-in-cheek financial forecast for the Year of the Dog which begins on Feb. 16, forecasts ""a most auspicious day"" on Feb. 28, although it warns of a ""summer of discontent"".
The report, which cautions investors not to ""bite off more than they can chew"", draws on findings from a feng shui master, who looks at the five elements in Chinese astrology: wood, metal, earth, fire and water. 2018 is the year of the Earth Dog.
""It's not a year for metals to bark so don't expect much more than a whimper from banks and financials - we expect both to underperform from the previous two years,"" CLSA said. 
""There's just enough earth in the charts to keep property and renewables anchored,"" it added.
September is a good time to hound down smart investments, with sectors such as healthcare and consumer, seen as wood-related, among the top picks for the year. A lack of metal element this year may see auto and machinery stocks underperform.
CLSA advises against taking bets on casino or transport stocks in March, when the market is likely to take a tumble, although these sectors should get a leg up in October.
Construction and resources stocks are expected to bloom from spring to mid-summer, but investors are told to be wary of banking and financials.
The Hang Seng Index (HSI) is expected to close on a high at the end of the year, it says.
Hong Kong got off to a strong start the calendar year, scaling a series of record highs, although the past few trading sessions have been volatile, tracking moves in global equities.
The financial hub's benchmark index (HSI) has risen around 7 percent so far this year after surging 36 percent in 2017. 

The CLSA Feng Shui Index began in 1992, the Year of the Monkey, as a Lunar New Year card for clients.

169,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 04:17AM ET</span>",Energy stocks have room to build on solid start,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Energy stocks have got off to a strong start this year and look poised to run further, fueled in part by a rebound in oil prices, climbing U.S. production and investors looking to take advantage of shares that could be a bargain after a disappointing 2017.
The S&P 500 energy index fell 3.8 percent in 2017, one of only two of its 11 major sectors to close out the year in negative territory, even as the overall S&P 500 rallied nearly 20 percent. 
Those declines came despite a friendlier energy policy by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, while investors remained unconvinced a rise of more than 12 percent in WTI crude oil to the $60 a barrel by the end of the year mark would hold.
But a combination of factors, including global economic growth, continued weakness in the dollar, the ability of OPEC to keep production curbs in place and restraint on the part of U.S. shale producers has helped lift WTI over the $65 mark and convince investors the higher prices are now sustainable.
Energy stocks climbed 3.8 percent in January before stumbling nearly 6 percent this week as part of a broad market selloff. 
The higher prices have not only boosted the attractiveness of energy stocks, but have bolstered the prospects for a rebound in shale production. Output for U.S. oil is poised to climb above 10 million barrels a day, which would top a record set in 1970 and cement the status of the United States as the No. 2 producer in the world. 
To view a graphic on U.S. oil production, click here: http://tmsnrt.rs/2EtJgen 
With the energy sector in a more favorable light, investors are looking to capitalize on stocks that remain cheap despite a gain of more than 4 percent for the year. 
""We are feeling good about the overall sector, we are feeling good about the space,"" said Lisa Shalett, head of wealth management investment resources and head of investment & portfolio strategies at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Wealth Management in New York. 
""It is supported both in terms of the fundamentals, the fundamentals having more staying power and that staying power translating into better earnings growth."" 
The relative performance of the S&P energy index has generally tracked oil prices, but a gap emerged in 2017 as crude prices recovered but shares in energy companies lagged, indicating they are primed to catch up. 
While the forward price to earnings ratio (PE) of the energy index at nearly 24 is well above the 18.6 for the S&P 500, that number is set to decrease as the sector has the second highest percentage of upward estimate revisions of the major S&P groups through Thursday morning, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
In addition, the relative price-to-book ratio of the sector is near a 10-year low at 0.6, suggesting it is undervalued. 
Names such as Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), with a forward PE under 5, and Cimarex Energy, at a 15.6 forward PE, are among the cheapest in the sector. 
Also supporting oil prices has been the continued weakness in the dollar, which has helped demand. The greenback in January suffered its worst monthly performance against a basket of major currencies, down 3.25 percent, since March 2016. Demand for crude is sapped by a stronger dollar, which is priced in the currency.
""There are several things going for it, it was unloved, underowned and it already has been recovering fundamentally for a while,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. 
""Now you have a dollar break to the downside which is pushing crude to three-year highs and probably going to push crude over $70 on WTI.""
Fund flows show investors have begun to take notice, with S&P oil and gas exploration and production industry seeing a 4.3 percent increase in inflows over the prior week, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) data. 
There could be some speed bumps for the sector, however. Shale players and OPEC could lose their production discipline and a strengthening U.S. economy could cause the dollar to strengthen again and dampen oil prices. Crude has dipped 0.6 percent this week and is on track for its second weekly decline in three. 
""The stock market is bidding up some of these names beyond where they really ought to be,"" said Stewart Glickman, energy analyst at CFRA in New York.
""Is earnings power going to improve - sure. It is moving in the right direction but some of what has happened so far has been currency driven and momentum driven and it is not going to persist."" 
Another headwind could be rising bond yields denting the attractiveness of the sector for investors who look to dividend payers.
""Sometimes people buy these energy stocks as a yield play because they tend to pay nice dividends,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. 
""If the rates continue higher I wonder if crude will have to break above $70 before we see the next surge in energy stocks.""

178,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>",Australia green bond market muzzled by policy uncertainty,"By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - When National Australia Bank launched the country's first ever ""green"" mortgage bond last week, it kept its expectations for demand in check with price guidance at a similar level to a non-green bond it was also selling.
Global interest in so-called green bonds has soared as banks and companies look to tap the appetite for climate-friendly investments, which can increasingly sell at a premium - dubbed ""greenium"" - over regular deals.
But the Australian market is less confident. While it is growing quickly from a low base, bankers say that issuers and investors tend to approach deals with caution, rather than optimism.
For a country with the world's fourth-largest pool of retirement funds and a high level of awareness of green issues, the market is underperforming its potential, they say.
Just A$3.2 billion ($2.5 billion) of green securities were sold in Australia last year compared with more than $40 billion in both France and Germany by governments and private companies. Globally, $155.5 billion of green bonds were sold last year.
The Australian government has never sold a green bond and currently has no plans to do so. There are only two off-the-shelf bond funds who label themselves as sustainable.
POLICY HURDLES
The biggest hurdle to developing the Australian market is perceived flip-flopping on environmental policy by the federal government, according to bond market sources.
""[Australian] corporate issuers are not in the same position as European issuers because there are no clear guidelines of the policies and what cost-benefits will accrue to them,"" said S&P Global Ratings Senior Director Parvathy Iyer, who said Australian fund managers were otherwise keen on green projects.
""If you had a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme, and it became a cost to companies, then they would progress the green approach and issue green bonds. It would be a chain reaction,"" she said.
Australia introduced a carbon pricing scheme in 2012 only to repeal it two years later and then in 2015 reduced its renewable energy target for 2020. Policy beyond 2020 is unclear.
Other governments have been more proactive. Poland and France have sold sovereign green bonds to help finance state-backed renewable power projects and to subsidize energy-efficient buildings, tree planting and other projects. Other countries have offered tax breaks to bondholders, such as in Brazil, where income from green bonds that finance wind projects is not taxed.
Sydney-based Yen Wong, the head of credit research at Altius Asset Management, which is one of the only two local sustainable bond funds in the country, said investors needed a stable policy outlook.
""What is supporting the growth, for instance of renewables, when we have a political environment that doesn't support it and where the regulation for de-carbonising the economy is uncertain,"" she said.
""GREENIUM""
NAB's proposed A$112.5 million residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) will finance loans on properties certified as low-carbon buildings. Its three-year deal is expected to price in coming days. Depending on demand, the bank could increase the size of the sale but key will be the pricing.
If NAB can command a ""greenium"", where demand is strong enough to lower the interest rate it offers compared to non-green securities, it would be an encouraging sign for the Australian green bond market.
Green bond issuers in Europe and the United States are increasingly benefiting from greeniums as investor demand rises, according to a study by the London-based Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI), an international organization that promotes investment in green securities.
Australia's QBE Insurance Group secured such a premium when it sold the world's first green insurance bond last year. However, it was the demand from European investors, not local ones, that helped lower the interest rate, according to QBE Group Treasurer Paul Byrne.
Australian companies' lack of interest in borrowing green has not stopped its state governments from getting involved.
The CBI expects the Australian market to double or even triple in size this year with the help of state government deals.
Victoria and Queensland states sold green bonds in 2016 and 2017, respectively, worth a combined A$1.05 billion. They funded transportation and renewable energy projects, and both states are considering fresh deals.
New South Wales, which has never issued green bonds and currently has little need for funding following a series of privatizations, says it is following its neighbors' progress closely.
""What is really encouraging is the willingness for investors, issuers and representative bodies to work together to develop the standards and expectations in the sector,"" said Katherine Palmer, a senior manager at the NSW Treasury Corporation, the state’s funding body.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's surprise ban on  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co growing its balance sheet comes at a difficult juncture for the United States' third-largest lender.
The San Francisco-based bank has been dogged by higher expenses related to a long-running sales practices scandal and investors want it to reboot its revenue engine to help boost earnings.
But the U.S. central bank on Friday made it harder for Chief Executive Tim Sloan to ramp up lending with a rare, company-wide bar on Wells Fargo growing past the $1.95 trillion in assets it held at the end of last year.
The sanction, issued on Janet Yellen's last day as Fed chairwoman, will be lifted when Wells Fargo has shown it has improved its governance and controls.
Sloan said on Friday that the cap will cut the bank's annual profit by about $300 million to $400 million this year, equivalent to less than 2 percent of the profit it generated last year -- not a big financial hit.
To comply with the order while growing core loans and deposits, the bank will trim deposits from financial institutions and some commercial clients as well as some low-yielding trading assets.
The danger from clients being turned away is that it provides an opportunity for competitors such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C).
U.S. banks already expect revenues to climb and the profitability of their lending to rise this year due to lower corporate tax rates and higher interest rates.
Wells Fargo's balance sheet expanded steadily from the end of 2013 to 2016, but growth slowed dramatically last year as it battled to address the issues raised by the scandal.
""The growth limits will force Wells Fargo to slow down and that leaves room for others to pick up market share,"" said Michael Kon, portfolio manager and director of research at San Mateo-based Golub Group, which sold its stake in Wells Fargo, once around 400,000 shares, as the sales problems emerged. 
""It will take a bigger decline in the price of WFC to get us interested again. We're looking for a wider margin of safety at this point,"" Kon said in a telephone interview.
A BUYING OPPORTUNITY?
Wells Fargo stock has risen 12 percent in the last 12 months, lagging the S&P Financials Sector's 26 percent increase as litigation expenses related to the scandal helped inflate its costs.
For all of 2017, the bank had costs of $58.5 billion, which translated into an efficiency ratio of 66.2 cents in costs per dollar of revenue, higher than its own target range of 55 to 59 cents.
The bank expects to spend less this year, estimating non-interest costs at up to $54.5 billion, but growing revenue would help it meet its efficiency ratio more easily.
After the Fed dropped its bombshell on Friday, Wells shares fell 6 percent in after hours trading.
For some investors, that presents a buying opportunity.
""Wells will get it right,"" said Christopher C. Grisanti of Grisanti Capital Management LLC in New York. ""They have strategically assembled a terrific set of assets in and after the financial crisis, including the largest mortgage portfolio in the United States.""
""We would be long term buyers in weakness.""
The bank reached a $190 million settlement with U.S. authorities in 2016 over its employees opening accounts in customers' names without their permission to hit sales targets. The tally of fake accounts has since risen to potentially as many as 3.5 million. Separately, thousands of auto-loan and mortgage customers were potentially overcharged.
Since the 2016 settlement, Wells has taken steps to enhance oversight at the board level, centralize risk-management functions and install new executives to oversee key businesses and control functions. Its board chair, Betsy Duke, is a former Fed governor, and it recently hired Sarah Dahlgren, a former New York Fed official, as its head of regulatory relations.
The Fed said on Friday that the bank will replace three current board members by April and a fourth by the end of 2018. Wells had previously said it would add new directors this year, with three expected to retire before its April shareholder meeting.
The bank must submit a plan to the Fed within 60 days detailing how it has enhanced oversight from its board of directors and improved compliance and risk management functions, and how it plans to improve further.
Once the Fed approves those plans, Wells will hire third-party consultants to review them and monitor its progress until the regulator is satisfied.
Analysts do not expect the Fed to ease up under the leadership of its new chair, Jerome Powell. 
""The bank will continue to face tough oversight,"" said John Heinlein, CEO of Horan Capital Management, in Maryland, which has about 316,000 Wells Fargo shares.

""Wells Fargo has its work cut out for it over the next few years.""

181,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 01:19AM ET</span>",UPS order for Boeing freighters highlights trade growth,"By Tim Hepher
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A recovery in international trade is reviving demand for aircraft once proudly linked to long-haul passenger travel and now mainly dependent on hauling cargo to stay in production.
The upturn underscores a solid economic backdrop to this week's Singapore Airshow, as the airline industry heads into its ninth year of global profits.
On the eve of the show, the world's second-largest domestic cargo airline,  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS), handed Boeing (NYSE:BA) a lifeline order for 14 more 747-8 freighters, easing doubts over the jumbo's future.
The deal extends a turnaround since a year ago when half a dozen 747-8s were sitting unsold after being built: a sure way of allowing cash to rot on a manufacturer's balance sheet.
It comes as air freight markets respond to higher consumer confidence after years of volatility and tepid growth at best.
Last year was the best for cargo since 2010, with traffic growth more than doubling to 9 percent, three times the growth in capacity, the International Air Transport Association reported.
Although Boeing offers a 467-seat passenger version of the modernized 747-8, its future is tied firmly to cargo.
But to make money, carriers have to fill about four fifths of its vast interior: a risky bet in uncertain economic times and one that has focused their attention on smaller planes.
Dedicated freighters must also compete with increasing amounts of cargo shipped in the belly of passenger jets.
Keeping the 747 on life support helps Boeing avoid charges and layoffs for halting production, or the headache of switching its share of overheads at the mammoth wide-body plant outside Seattle to newer programs like the 787 Dreamliner.
Air freight is among several indicators, such as rising electronics shipments, contributing to a positive trade outlook, according to Flight Ascend economist Peter Morris.
In a further sign of confidence, Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard noted the new 747-8s are for growth and do not replace planes being retired at UPS. 
Boeing hopes such growth will also sustain demand for the mid-sized 767, a model that has all but served out its usefulness as a passenger jet and relies on freight and its role as a future tanker for the U.S. Air Force. 
Having started producing more 767s to fulfill a big 2015 order from FedEx (NYSE:FDX), the world's largest freight carrier, Boeing is pushing for more sales to preserve momentum and deny a home at players like UPS to the newer Airbus A330 freighter.
UPS said its $6.2 billion order includes four 767s.
Even small aircraft like the Franco-Italian ATR turboprop are benefiting from stronger trade winds, with FedEX recently ordering a new cargo version.

With last year's rush helped by re-stocking, economists say it will be hard to maintain the same growth. But IATA says the cargo trend has turned ""optimistic"" and that projected 2018 growth of 4.5 percent will still be enough to tighten capacity.

182,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>",U.S. asset managers shake up equity research as banks cut back,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As new rules spur Wall Street banks to further shrink their research budgets, U.S. asset management firms are shoring up in-house research, and reinventing the stockpicking business in the process.
Fund managers are eschewing the traditional model of teams built to cover a broad range of industries, instead picking areas of expertise and hiring analysts with very specialized knowledge and often non-Wall Street backgrounds.
The European Union's MiFID II regulations that target conflicts of interest and took effect in January require asset managers to separately report trading commissions and investment-research payments. In the past, banks bundled research with trading fees covered by investors rather than fund management firms.
While the rules apply only to those operating in the EU, the transparency is making fund managers globally re-think what research they are willing to pay for.
Interviews with more than a dozen senior executives, research analysts and other staff show fund managers are already weaning themselves off routine analysis of major sectors where it is difficult for any investor to gain a lasting advantage.
Instead, fund companies would rather go it alone and focus on narrow slices of the market they can dominate, from breakout technologies like cryptocurrencies, niche international markets and environmental, social and corporate governance.
That means fund managers are hiring, but not necessarily those who have spent their careers with brokers or banks.
For example, ARK Investment Management LLC recruited James Wang to cover artificial intelligence (AI) and ""the next wave of the internet."" Wang was previously a product manager at Nvidia Corp in California and helped the semiconductor company launch GeForce Experience, a gaming application.
""I never thought I would work in finance, much less on the East Coast,"" said Wang, who turned 34 in October.
ARK is now hiring a specialist focused on cryptocurrencies and another researching genomics.
INVESTMENT BANKS SLASH STAFF
BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) Chief Executive Larry Fink, who runs the world's largest asset manager, told Reuters he is spending more on research done at his own firm.
In recent weeks, BlackRock, which has $6 trillion in assets under management, asked several providers to stop sending research they were not paying for so the company could make sure it complied with the new rules, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Fink said in October that BlackRock would consider paying out-of-pocket for the research the asset manager consumes from banks globally.
Other managers are going further.
Richard Bernstein went ""cold turkey,"" stopping paying for external research and cutting all of his fund company's subscriptions to investment-bank research about a year ago. What he found was that he could live without most of it.
""That was the way we could decide who we need and who do we miss,"" said Bernstein, who was an analyst at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Corp's Merrill Lynch unit before he started his current company, Richard Bernstein Advisors LLC.
""A handful - a dozen, whatever - analysts we really wanted back. However, a lot of them we didn't.""
He says the company does 95 percent of its research in-house.
Across Wall Street, asset managers are also betting that some research can be automated.
Even before the new MiFID II regulations, which stands for Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, banks were scaling back equity research as algorithmic trading, regulation and the growing popularity of index-tracking funds, which tend to trade less, weighed on their income.
Major global investment banks slashed their equity research budgets from a peak of $8.2 billion in 2008 to $3.4 billion in 2017, according to Frost Consulting. McKinsey projects the top 10 banks will cut those budgets by another 30 percent in the near term, due largely to MiFID II.
Fund managers can ill afford giving up on research altogether because that is what sets them apart and allows to compete for investors' money with index funds set up to merely match market benchmarks.
Applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to stockpicking requires a new breed of tech-savvy specialists, and managers think some of the best opportunities are there.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) polled fund managers and other clients at a recent conference on the subject and found that nearly half hired ""quant"" researchers in the past year.
More traditional expertise is also in demand. Ariel Investments LLC, which manages $13.1 billion, hired research analysts who had lived in Russia, China and Greece to bolster its efforts combing through international markets for ideas, company vice-chairman Charlie Bobrinskoy said.
The company added six analysts to its global research team over the past year. Three previously worked for traditional brokerages, two came from asset managers and another moved from elsewhere in finance, Ariel said.
As banks cut research expenses and thin their ranks, fund managers might be offering fewer, but potentially more lucrative opportunities.
The average asset manager's equity research analyst with five to eight years' experience range made $419,000 in 2016, compared to $385,000 at a bank, according to a survey by financial services recruiting company Options Group.

Reuters found the gap widens for those with more experience and special expertise with asset-management firms paying millions for high-caliber researchers.

184,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 12:24AM ET</span>","Nissan to pump $9.5 billion into China business, eyes top three spot","By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co plans to invest 60 billion yuan ($9.5 billion) in China over the next five years with its joint-venture partner as it seeks to become a top three automaker in the world's biggest market.
Long stuck as a second-tier player in China, Nissan and Dongfeng Group said on Monday they plan to boost their volume to 2.6 million vehicles a year by 2022, up from 1.5 million vehicles last year.
Nissan plans to achieve the objective, dubbed its ""Triple One"" strategy, by focusing on electric cars and Venucia, a no-frills local brand Nissan operates in China - two market segments expected to see a surge in demand. It also aims to boost sales of light commercial vans and trucks.
China’s auto market has been dominated by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG for nearly two decades, with each of them selling 4 million vehicles last year. Nissan, along with Toyota Motor Corp , Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, and Honda Motor Co, lag far behind, each selling 1 million-plus vehicles a year.
“We aim to break away from this second-tier group and become a top-3 China automaker,” Nissan’s China chief Jun Seki said in an interview with Reuters.
“We need to go full-throttle aggressive,” Seki said. “If we didn’t do that, we would fall behind and fail to grab market share otherwise we could take.”
ELECTRIC STRATEGY
Part of the strategy is to keep growing the Nissan brand and the company’s premium Infiniti brand, Seki said. 
Nissan and Dongfeng plan to increase the Nissan brand’s annual sales by 500,000 vehicles to 1.6 million vehicles a year by 2022. It also plans to boost Infiniti’s annual sales by 100,000 vehicles to about 150,000 vehicles a year over the same time frame. 
Still, more critical a strategy is Nissan’s electrification plan. 
Seki said the joint venture will launch as many as 20 electrified vehicle models across all brands in an effort to sell roughly 700,000 such cars a year by 2022 excluding electric light commercial vehicles, using a combination of all-electric battery vehicles and so-called “e-Power” hybrids.
Automakers are scrambling to launch an array of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles over the coming years, in part to comply with China’s production quotas for such cars. Nissan’s joint venture with Dongfeng sold about 22,000 electric vehicles last year, but they were mostly light commercial e-vans.
In order to generate large enough EV volume, Nissan plans to come up with lower-cost electric cars by locally sourcing electric motors and other key EV components from suppliers in China.
In 2019, Nissan for example plans to launch three such lower-cost EVs under the Venucia name. “We expect EV and e-power hybrid business to become profitable,” Seki said, without elaborating.
NO-FRILLS 
Venucia, which Nissan established jointly with Dongfeng, is another key focus. The brand began selling cars in 2012, competing with China’s low-cost, no-frills indigenous brands such as those run by Geely and Great Wall Motor.
Seki said shoring up Venucia is a must because indigenous Chinese brands will likely collectively sell as many cars as global brands sell in China. Last year indigenous Chinese brands sold a total of 10.3 million vehicles, compared with global brands’ 13.9 million vehicles.
Venucia, which uses retired Nissan technologies such as platforms and transmissions, last year sold 143,000 vehicles, up 22.7 percent from 2016.
Seki said Nissan wants to boost Venucia's annual volume by more than 400,000 vehicles to be able to sell as many as 600,000 vehicles a year by 2022. 
The effort is likely to face tough competition, however, from established local players such as Baojun, which GM operates jointly with its local China partners.
“No global automakers have a brand that competes with low-cost local brands except for us and GM,” Seki said. In addition to Baojun, GM operates the Wuling brand in a joint venture with Chinese partner SAIC Motor Corp and Guangxi Automobile Group. 
“Venucia is our clear advantage and we are going to milk it to grow rapidly,” Seki said.

186,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2018 08:42PM ET</span>",Deadline looming for Boeing to decide on Canada fighter jet bid,"By David Ljunggren and Leah Schnurr
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co must decide by the end of this week whether to take part in a multi-billion-dollar race to supply Canada with fighter jets, even as the U.S. company's relationship with Ottawa has soured due to a trade dispute.
Although a U.S. trade commission on Jan. 26 dismissed Boeing's complaint that Canadian plane maker Bombardier was dumping airliners on the American market, it is far from certain the ruling will be enough to placate Canada.
That could well influence the company's decision on bidding on a contract for 88 jets worth between C$15 billion ($12.1 billion) and C$19 billion, people familiar with the matter said.
Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said in a post earnings call last week the company will wait to see the commission's reasoning, coming later this month, ""to make decisions on our path forward.""
The company declined to comment further.
Boeing has until Feb. 9 to express an interest in taking part in the Canadian jet competition, failing which it will be excluded from the bidding process.
At stake could be billions of dollars of defense procurement orders at a time when Canada is ramping up military spending over the next decade. Boeing says it supports some 17,000 jobs in Canada.
The dispute also has weighed on the crucial NAFTA modernization talks, which have dragged on for months.
Although government officials say the competition will be open, they have privately made it clear that Boeing needs to drop the Bombardier challenge and talk of an appeal to stand a better chance of winning the jet contract, say sources familiar with the matter.
""A lot of things would be better if they did that,"" said one source who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the situation.
FROSTY RELATIONSHIP
There are signs the relationship between Boeing and Ottawa remain frosty. Boeing did not send its own staff to a meeting between the Canadian government and industry held in January to discuss the jets contract, the sources said.
Boeing said its F-18 Super Hornet was represented by the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the Pentagon unit that implements foreign arms sales. U.S. foreign military sales are often negotiated between the U.S. government and each customer nation.
 Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), Dassault Aviation SA and Airbus SE also are expected to compete.
Canada is part of the consortium that helped develop Lockheed's F-35 stealth fighter, although Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said during his successful 2015 election campaign that he would not buy the plane because it was too expensive.
Canadian Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, who has said Boeing has not behaved like a trusted partner, did not answer directly last Tuesday when repeatedly pressed as to how the aerospace giant could get back into Ottawa's good books.
Ottawa says the bids will be evaluated in part on the basis of ""past and recent economic behavior of potential bidders leading up to the procurement.""
That test is months away from being finalised, meaning Boeing has no idea whether Ottawa would be satisfied if it did drop the challenge, sources said.
A company's submission will be evaluated not just on the economic test but on a number of factors including, price and military capability, one of the sources said.
While Boeing has repeatedly said it will not take reprisals against its Canadian supply chain and workforce, the dispute between Boeing and Canada worries aerospace suppliers who fear they could lose future contracts, an industry source familiar with the matter said. Canada's aerospace industry is a major employer in Quebec, a politically valuable province for Trudeau, who is facing elections in 2019.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures opened weaker on Sunday, extending the rout equity markets experienced on Friday when the benchmark S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial average notched their worst week since early January 2016.
Rising bond yields and prospects for increasing inflation undermined equities and pushed benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields to a four-year high on Friday.
S&P 500 e-minis (ESc1) traded down roughly 24 points before pulling back some ground to trade down 16 points after the first hour of trade, a loss of 0.60 percent.
Dow e-minis (1YMc1) were down 190 points, or 0.75 percent.
U.S. Treasury futures prices rose at the open but have since retreated and traded flat . 
While the early indication is for weakness in the U.S. markets when regular trading resumes on Monday, it is how the day ends rather than begins, that will be the focus for investors, one strategist said.
""The futures opening lower portends this is a market that might need more of a sell-off, but we have got Asian and European trading hours to get through and futures can change quite markedly through the night,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey. 
""Overall you still have earnings coming out and they have been solid for the most part. It was a market that was poised to pullback at some point. It was overbought. This was a widely anticipated pullback, and nothing to be surprised by. The question is how much more does it have to pull back?"" she said.
On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 665.75 points, or 2.54 percent, to 25,520.96, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 59.85 points, or 2.12 percent, to 2,762.13 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 144.92 points, or 1.96 percent, to 7,240.95.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury (US10YT=RR) reached a four-year peak at 2.852 percent on Friday after a strong U.S. jobs report raised concerns the U.S. Federal Reserve might hasten to increase interest rates to stem inflation.

188,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2018 07:25PM ET</span>",DoubleLine's Jeffrey Gundlach: 'Hard to love bonds at even 3 percent' yield,"By Jennifer Ablan
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jeffrey Gundlach, the chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, says ""it is hard to love bonds at even 3 percent"" yield, given the backdrop for accelerating economic growth in the U.S.
""It seems the tradable buy on bonds will need a flight-to-safety bid on a wave of fear washing over risk markets,"" Gundlach told Reuters late on Saturday. ""Hard to love bonds at even 3 percent when GDPNow for Q1 2018 is suggesting annualized nominal GDP growth above 7 percent.""
The 10-year Treasury yield hit a four-year high on Friday after the latest jobs report showed solid wage gains, effectively confirming the expected rate increase at the Federal Reserve’s next meeting in March. 
Friday’s selloff contributed to the broad decline in U.S. government paper within the last week as inflation fears, strong economic data and an announcement of bigger Treasury auctions drove yields higher.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed 7.9 basis points to 2.852 percent, the highest since January 2014. 
""Treasury yields have been rising at a pace above 200 basis points annualized on parts of the (yield) curve since September,"" said Gundlach, known as Wall Street's Bond King.
""This is partly caused by the manic mood and partly caused by the falling dollar and related rising commodities. Rates up significantly and dollar down significantly with exploding deficits is a dangerous cocktail reminiscent of 1987.""
Last month, Gundlach predicted the S&P 500 may go up 15 percent in the first part of the year, but ""I believe, when it falls, it will wipe out the entire gain of the first part of the year with a negative sign in front of it.""
On Saturday, Gundlach said: ""What matters to success this year is understanding that we entered a mania phase in 2017 that went completely out of control after September with the Bitcoin blowoff exhibiting exactly the same lunacy as the dot com blow off back in late 1999. 
""Similar to that period, but even more excessive this time -who’d have thought it possible - is the explosion of bullish sentiment, with some surveys registering 96 percent, 97 percent, even 100 percent bullish respondents. Long Island Blockchain. Kodakcoin. Cryptokitties. Sheer madness.""

Gundlach said overall, the U.S. stock market is an odds-on favorite to turn in a negative return for 2018. ""Whether Friday is the start of a crash or just the first chapter in the topping process is not the issue,"" he said.

Not so this time.
U.S. stock index futures fell for a third day, extending losses after signs of encroaching inflation and surging bond yields sent major benchmarks to their worst week in two years. March e-mini contracts on the Nasdaq 100 Index fell 0.6 percent as of 6:25 p.m. in New York. The Nasdaq 100 Index contract slipped 0.5 percent and Dow Jones Industrial Average contracts slid 0.7 percent.
“The slight decline in futures tonight is a departure from the frequent overnight ramps in this long bull market,” Brian Frank, portfolio manager at Key Biscayne, Florida-based Frank Capital Partners LLC. “If this were just a stock story, it would be all part of normal historical volatility returning to an abnormally quiet market. However, fixed income, cryptos, and international markets are all moving together. The broadness of the move and the aggressiveness of investors positioning explains the general unease.”
With the exception of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co., every stock in the Dow average lost at least 1 percent last week, while more than 450 companies in the S&P 500 fell. Concern that a faster expansion in U.S. hiring and wages will prompt the Federal Reserve into a tougher stance against inflation erased about two-thirds of January’s U.S. equity advance, the biggest since 1997.
Before last week, a steady rally powered partly by optimism over Donald Trump’s tax cuts pushed stock valuations to some of the highest levels since the internet bubble. Stocks have been in rally mode for the better part of nine years, propelled by stimulus enacted by the Fed to restore the economy after the financial crisis.
“When you have a bad Friday and an indication of a bad Monday, it can cause some additional selling panic, even though on a fundamental level the economic backdrop is still strong,’’ said Tim Ghriskey, managing director at Solaris Asset Management. “Selling can cause more selling, and that can cause more danger for the economy, if the stock market has a major correction simply because everyone wants to sell.”
Speaking on CBS’s “Sunday Morning” earlier, outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen said U.S. stocks and commercial real estate prices are elevated but stopped short of saying they’re in a bubble. The S&P 500 has gained 85 percent since she took office in February 2013.
“Well, I don’t want to say too high. But I do want to say high,” Yellen said on CBS’s “Sunday Morning” in an interview recorded Friday as she prepared to leave the central bank. “Price-earnings ratios are near the high end of their historical ranges.”
Signs of nervousness abounded on Friday, when the Cboe Volatility Index jumped 29 percent to cap a weekly increase that roughly matched its surged in August, when concern about tech stock valuations pushed the Nasdaq 100 down for four straight weeks. As traders rushed to hedge on Friday, options volume on the VIX exceeded the previous record by 39 percent, with 4.3 million contracts traded.
“We are not concerned about a sustained move lower in stocks near term,” Dennis Debusschere, head of portfolio strategy at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients on the weekend. “Current earnings and forward revisions have been strong, but some PE contraction should be expected” as bond volatility increases, he said.
Last week’s retreat, the first of 2018, came amid a crush of signals that would ordinarily be bullish for investors, including record inflows into mutual and exchange-traded funds and frenetic account openings at discount brokerages. Chris Harvey, the head of equity strategy at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co., said clients were mostly calm during Friday’s 666-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
“We’re not really hearing and seeing the fear on the other side of the phone,” Harvey said in an interview Friday. “There’s a behavioral issue about this. If you sold over the last 12 and 24 months, you’ve come to regret that. So what we saw in the second half of 2017 was more or less a sellers’ strike where people didn’t want to re-position and didn’t want to sell because it was basically ripping up money.

The dollar extended gains.
Equity indexes in Australia and New Zealand sank at least 1 percent, while futures on the S&P 500 Index were 0.7 percent lower and losses were expected in Japan and Hong Kong. The gauge of U.S. shares tumbled 2.1 percent Friday and the 10-year Treasury yield rose above 2.85 percent following solid jobs data showing rising wages and a hint from Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan that the Federal Reserve may need to lift interest rates more than three times this year.
Anxiety about the outlook for monetary policy is reaching fever pitch with equities being tested by the surge in bond rates -- yields on 10-year Treasuries have climbed to a four-year high from 2.40 percent at the start of the year. Last week’s decline for global stocks follows one of the best starts to a year on record amid hopes for ever-expanding corporate profits and growth in the world economy that’s broadening.

191,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2018 04:47PM ET</span>","Amid stock market selloff, U.S. profit forecasts rise","By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's main stock indexes suffered their worst week in two years as bond yields soared and renewed fears of inflation gripped investors. 
But amid the selloff, corporate earnings forecasts keep improving.
Forecasts for earnings, one of the fundamental factors that drives stock prices, are rising fast as analysts factor in benefits from the U.S. tax overhaul.
Optimism over forecasts has caught the attention of anxious investors, who hope that strong earnings can support lofty stock valuations and offset the concerns over rising bond yields and the pace of Federal Reserve rate hikes. Rising interest rates in general mean higher borrowing costs for companies. 
This week, fears of higher rates overwhelmed the upbeat profit picture as the benchmark S&P 500 stock index (SPX) fell 3.9 percent and raised some concern about a deeper pullback.
""This uptick in bond rates has everybody nervous obviously,"" said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, Texas.
""But we step back and look, and so far earnings have been awful good. Even though you have seen rates move up some here, they are still very low, inflation is still low,"" he said. 
With half of the S&P 500 index companies still to report fourth-quarter results and potentially give guidance on 2018, profit estimates are likely to increase further.
Even after the selloff this week, the S&P 500 is up 3.3 percent for this year and that is on top of a 19.4-percent gain for 2017. Whether this week's downturn in global equity markets continues will depend in part on upcoming earnings reports.
Reports from both Apple (O:AAPL) and Google parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) late Thursday disappointed investors, as did Friday's results from ExxonMobil (N:XOM) and  Chevron  (N:CVX), but fourth-quarter S&P 500 company results overall have been much stronger than expected.
Among changes to the tax law, the corporate income tax rate drops to 21 percent from 35 percent, so earnings estimates for the first quarter and all of 2018 have jumped.
First-quarter profit growth for S&P 500 companies is now estimated at 17.7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data, up from 11.7 percent on Dec. 20, when both houses of Congress approved the tax revamp. Earnings growth for 2018 is now forecast at 18.2 percent, up from 11.5 percent on Dec. 20. 
Typically, expectations decline as the earnings reporting season for the quarter approaches. On average, profit growth expectations fall by four percentage points from the start of the quarter to the start of earnings season, said David Aurelio, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters.  
This January, revisions to S&P 500 2018 earnings estimates were 4.3 times more positive than negative, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC). The one-month ratio of upward to downward revisions was the highest since at least 1986, as far back as the bank's data goes.
All of the S&P 500 companies together are expected to show earnings of about $155 per share this year in aggregate, up about $9 since Dec. 20, Thomson Reuters' estimates show. 
The tax reform benefit is estimated to add more than that, however, a full $13, which suggests there ""there is more room to run,"" BofA-ML strategists said in a note.
In addition to the tax law, U.S. companies' earnings are benefiting from improving global economic growth and the weaker U.S. dollar, which helps U.S. multinationals exports sales, said Jill Carey Hall, equity and quant strategist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
Those factors could help to underpin U.S. earnings even after the tax benefit is priced in.
""Stocks may be have been overbought, but some of that was alleviated this week, and global growth and profit growth are still intact,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. 

Among companies due to report next week are Walt  Disney  (N:DIS), General Motors (N:GM), several biotech companies including Gilead (O:GILD) and restaurants including Chipotle Mexican Grill (N:CMG).

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Signs that a long-awaited correction may have arrived on Wall Street will keep investors on edge on Monday after the S&P 500 closed off the week with its biggest percentage drop in two years.
The S&P 500 has slumped 3.89 percent since hitting a record high a week ago, trimming its gain in 2018 to 3.2 percent. 
With the S&P surging more than 20 percent over the past year, selloffs like Friday's 2.12 percent drop have become rare. No session last year suffered a loss of 2 percent or more, and 2016 had only four declines of that magnitude.
""Sentiment was getting a little frothy, and we were developing some complacency in the market. Now that complacency is coming out of the market,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Suntrust Advisory Services in Atlanta.

196,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2018 12:37PM ET</span>",Interest rate angst trips up U.S. equity bull market,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - For nearly nine years, the global hunt for yield sent you to one place: the U.S. stock market.
On Friday, stocks took their biggest pounding since September 2016, before U.S. President Donald Trump was elected, after the U.S. government's monthly payrolls report showed the biggest wage gains for workers since 2009. That convinced investors the threat of inflation, long tame since the 2007-2009 recession, is growing larger, sending bond yields soaring.
With central banks having taken extraordinary measures to combat the financial crisis, driving interest rates to record lows and making safe assets like U.S. Treasuries a scarcity, investors of all stripes were forced to turn to equities.
But when what had been a stealth increase in U.S. rates over several months suddenly broke out into the open in the last week, investors were jolted awake to a new reality: stocks are no longer the only solution for finding yield.
""One of the key mantras of the bull market has been stocks are inexpensive relative to bonds, and bonds are getting cheaper, especially at these highs,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""So people are taking profits and they probably should be.""
With the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note on pace to top 3.5 percent this year for the first time since April of 2011, risk-free bonds are becoming an increasingly attractive place for yield-focused investors.
At the current forward price-earnings ratio of 18.2, according to Thomson Reuters proprietary research, the S&P 500 (SPX) index's earnings yield is 5.5 percent, well below the historic norm of around 6.7 percent. With bond yields rising across the spectrum, the 5.5 cents of profit that underpins every $1 in share prices on average begins to look thin by comparison.
""We don't have a line in the sand but 10-year Treasuries near 3 percent are starting to look a lot more attractive,"" said Mike Dowdall, a portfolio manager with BMO Global Asset Management.
That rise in yields prompted a broad sell-off in stocks on Friday, as investors reacted to data from the U.S. Labor Department showing wages last month recorded their largest annual gain in more than 8-1/2 years.
Equities continued a five-day downward trend, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 2 percent for its largest one-day decline since September 2016. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) lost more than 2.5 percent.[nL2N1PS28O]
Meanwhile, a sell-off in bonds that has gathered pace this year intensified, with yields on 10-year Treasuries hitting a four-year peak.
That dynamic is putting pressure on areas of the market that had served as bond proxies. As a result, fund managers are rediscovering the risk of rising rates, selling out of assets ranging from high-yield ""junk"" bonds to utility stocks and pushing the broad S&P 500 lower.
Warning signs for equities have been long discussed, as the market hit almost daily fresh highs. On Friday, Merrill Lynch's bull-bear indicator, which has accurately predicted 11 out of 11 U.S. stock market corrections since 2002, hit a ""sell"" signal.
The rise in bond yields is ""certainly beginning to concern the markets,"" said Nicholas Colas, co-founder at DataTrek Research in New York. ""Rates have risen fairly quickly this year and the speed of the advance is worrying.""
The yield on the 10-year Treasury has risen to 2.84 percent from 2.46 percent at the start of the year, the swiftest rise since November 2016.
Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve left rates unchanged but said it anticipated inflation likely would rise in 2018, bolstering expectations borrowing costs will continue to climb. The Fed currently projects three rate hikes for this year.
Stocks have so far proven largely immune to rising rates, with the S&P 500 jumping nearly 20 percent in 2017. Stocks have not fallen by 10 percent or more since the start of 2016, leaving recent declines as buying opportunities.
A stock market correction could pose a political problem for President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans ahead of congressional elections later this year. Trump has trumpeted the sharp gains in U.S. equities since he took office as proof that his economic policies were working.
SECTOR DECLINES
There already are signs investors are moving into actively managed stock funds in order to sidestep the impact of rising rates. U.S.-based active stock mutual funds, which lost $7.2 billion in outflows as investors moved toward “passive” stock exchange traded funds (ETFs), attracted $2.4 billion in new assets during the week that ended Wednesday, according to data from Lipper.
At the same time, the lowest end of the credit spectrum has been facing cash withdrawals as rising rates increase the cost of refinancing debt. In the week ended Wednesday, U.S.-based high-yield ""junk"" bond funds posted outflows of $1.8 billion, their third consecutive week of cash withdrawals, according to Lipper. The four-week moving average for the sector is negative $825 million, the largest such figure since early December.
Still, some have piled in even as risks rose. U.S. fund investors cashed out of cash funds and stocked up on stocks in the latest week, Lipper data showed.
Earlier in the week, positioning data showed hedge funds and other big speculative investors to have their largest net long exposure to the S&P 500 since September. Weekly commitments of traders data released Friday by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed that as of Jan. 30, so-called noncommercial investors had modestly raised their net long positions for a third straight week.
Stocks sensitive to rates are leading the market lower for the year. Real estate stocks in the S&P 500 are down 3.7 percent over the last month, while utilities are down 4.6 percent over the same time.
Consumer discretionary stocks, which tend to outperform during periods of inflation due to rising wages, are up 8 percent over the same time.
Fund managers say they expect that other growth-oriented sectors such as technology and financials will continue to outperform, thanks in part to a pickup in inflation and the Republican-led tax overhaul that slashed corporate rates.
Overall, 78.1 percent of companies in the S&P 500 have reported fourth-quarter earnings above analyst expectations, compared with an average of 72 percent over the last year, according to Thomson Reuters data.

""You're getting a pickup in economic growth and in wages, so that makes the growth sectors still the place to be,"" said Margaret Patel, a senior portfolio manager at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Funds who runs a portfolio of both equities and fixed income. ""Even Treasury yields of 3 percent have never been an impediment to the stock market doing better.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is seeking ""substantial"" civil fines from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV after the government filed suit accusing the company of illegally using software that led to excess emissions in 104,000 U.S. diesel vehicles sold since 2014, a person briefed on the matter said on Friday.
Bloomberg News reported Friday that the Justice Department sent Fiat Chrysler lawyers a Jan. 27 settlement offer that included requiring the company to offset excess pollution and take steps to prevent future excess emissions.
A person briefed on the matter confirmed the letter included language that a settlement ""must include very substantial civil penalties.""
Fiat Chrysler shares ended down 7.2 percent at $22.30 on Friday in New York after earlier falling over 10 percent on news of the potential fines.
In a discussion in Washington this week between the Justice Department and Fiat Chrysler overseen by court-appointed settlement adviser Ken Feinberg, no specific figures were discussed, two people briefed on the talks said. Another round of settlement talks is set for late this month.
Feinberg and Fiat Chrysler declined to comment.
In July, Fiat Chrysler won approval from federal and California regulators to sell 2017 model year diesel vehicles after it came under scrutiny for alleged excess emissions in older diesel models.
To resolve the excess pollution issue, Fiat Chrysler lawyer Robert Giuffra said in December at a court hearing the company remains confident it can use updated emissions software in the 2017 vehicles as the basis of a fix to address agencies' concerns over 2014-2016 diesel vehicles.
The Justice Department said in December that company testing on the proposed fix began on Dec. 17 and would take about three months. The government will then have 30 days to review the results and expects to make a determination by the end of April.
No settlement is expected before testing is completed, people briefed on the talks said.
Separately, the company is still trying to settle lawsuits filed by owners of the diesel vehicles. A separate settlement session is set with lawyers for the owners and Fiat Chrysler in the coming weeks.
Regulators have said Fiat Chrysler diesel vehicles had undisclosed emissions controls that allowed vehicles to emit excess pollution during normal driving. The company has denied wrongdoing, saying there was never an attempt to create software to cheat emissions rules.

Fiat Chrysler's emissions case comes after Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) diesel emissions scandal prompted increased industry scrutiny.

200,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>","Volkswagen seeks delay in U.S. trial after lawyer references monkey testing, Hitler","By David Shepardson
(Reuters) - The U.S. unit of Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) on Friday asked a U.S. judge to delay several court trials it is facing over excess emissions because it fears ""inflammatory"" comments made by a lawyer representing car owners in a recent TV documentary will prejudice the jury.
Although nearly all U.S. owners agreed to take part in a 2016 settlement, the German carmaker is being sued by some consumers after it admitted in September 2015 to cheating on diesel emissions tests, sparking the biggest business crisis in its history. 
The first consumer fraud trial involves a North Carolina man who bought a 2014 diesel Jetta, and is set for Feb. 26. 
But according to a legal filing, Volkswagen of America asked a judge in Fairfax County, Virginia to delay that trial for at least six months on Friday after a lawyer for more than 300 U.S. VW diesel owners, Michael Melkersen, gave an interview in which he referred to the company testing diesel fumes on monkeys.
This week, Volkswagen in Germany suspended its chief lobbyist in response to reports the carmaker had jointly sponsored tests that exposed monkeys in 2014 to toxic diesel fumes, methods condemned by its chief executive as repulsive. 
In the interview for a documentary aired by streaming service Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Melkersen criticized the tests, adding: ""One cannot help to think back throughout history of another series of events involving individuals being gassed by a person who was actually at the opening of the very first Volkswagen factory,"" an apparent reference to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust. 
In its legal filing, VW's lawyers argued those comments would prevent a fair trial and pointed to another comment Melkersen made in the documentary: ""There is a concern, obviously, amongst Volkswagen that if a jury were to ever hear about any of this stuff that that could really impact the verdict in this case."" 
Volkswagen lawyers said that ""pretrial publicity has connected (the company) directly with Hitler and the Holocaust,"" which they said was not relevant to a trial about alleged consumer fraud claims.
Melkersen called the VW legal motion ""hogwash.""
""This is another tactic to postpone their day of reckoning,"" Melkersen told Reuters by phone.
VW has agreed to spend more than $25 billion in the United States to address claims from owners, environmental regulators, U.S. states and dealers and to make buyback offers.
As part of that, Volkswagen said in 2016 it would buy back or fix nearly 500,000 polluting 2.0-liter diesel U.S. vehicles. About 2,000 owners opted out and most are pursuing court claims seeking additional compensation. The first trials could potentially set a template for the remaining suits. 

The monkey tests were also sponsored by  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and BMW and both said this week they had suspended or moved staff linked to the testing. VW said the monkey tests were approved by an independent review board to protect animals.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Worries about the impact of a tightening job market on the prospects for inflation and a surge in bond yields sent investors fleeing equities on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrials Average swooning almost 666 points, for its biggest daily percentage loss in 20 months. 
It was the biggest daily point fall in the Dow since December 2008 during the financial crisis.
With Friday's rout, Wall Street's three major indexes logged their biggest weekly losses in two years, after closing at record highs the previous week. The S&P 500 and Dow saw their worst weeks since early January 2016 while Nasdaq had its worst week since early Feb 2016.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Worries about the impact of a tightening job market on the prospects for inflation and a surge in bond yields sent investors fleeing equities on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrials Average swooning almost 666 points, for its biggest daily percentage loss in 20 months. 
It was the biggest daily point fall in the Dow since December 2008 during the financial crisis.
With Friday's rout, Wall Street's three major indexes logged their biggest weekly losses in two years, after closing at record highs the previous week. The S&P 500 and Dow saw their worst weeks since early January 2016 while Nasdaq had its worst week since early Feb 2016.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc's hint of returning a ton of cash to shareholders was not enough to move investors who worried more about the iPhone maker's weak outlook amid reports of production cuts for its flagship iPhone X.
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) were down about 1.4 percent at $165.42 in early trade on Friday.
The iPhone X was the first phone to get a major design overhaul since the launch of the iPhone 6 in 2015, and many expected it to lead to blockbuster sales.
On Thursday, the Cupertino-based tech giant said it sold fewer iPhones over the holiday quarter than Wall Street expected, and sees revenue of $60 billion to $62 billion and gross margins of between 38 percent and 38.5 percent for its fiscal second quarter ending in March. 
Analysts were expecting $65.7 billion in sales and a gross margin of 38.9 percent for the March quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Analysts at Longbow Research said the revenue guidance implied a low 50 million iPhone shipment forecast against a consensus of 58.5 million.
""We now forecast 221 million iPhone shipments for fiscal 2018, versus the prior 235 million consensus.""
On Thursday, Apple also said it was planning, over time, to ""target a capital structure that is approximately net neutral,"" adding that it will ""take that balance down from $163 billion to zero,"" referring to Apple's level of cash net of debt.
The comments sent its shares up about 3 percent Thursday after the bell.
""iPhone sell-through appears to have declined in the December quarter, which, along with weaker-than-expected
second quarter revenue guidance, reinforces our view of a saturated market,"" KeyBanc analysts said in a note, cutting the rating on the stock to ""sector weight"" from ""overweight.""""Further, gross margin results and guidance both missed our expectations, which reduces our view of potential profit growth going forward.""
Of 39 analysts who cover the stock, 29 rate it 'buy' or higher. However, the mixed results triggered varied responses from analysts. At least three brokerages raised their target price on the company's stock largely banking on the possibility of cash returns, while three cut price targets.

""(Apple's) cash return should support the stock, but we see little to drive upside,"" KeyBanc analysts said.

Strong US Jobs Data Send Bond Yields Soaring; Dow Plummets 660 points 
The Labor Department said Friday, U.S. non-farm payrolls rose by 200,000 jobs in January. That beat economists’ forecasts for 184,000 new jobs.
Wage growth for the prior month was revised upward to 0.3%, triggering investor expectations that tighter labor markets could finally increase wage price pressures, spurring inflation growth, forcing the Fed to raise rates by more than markets currently priced in.
The United States 10-Year rose above 2.8% to four year highs as some market participants now expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates four times this year.
JPMorgan warned that if productivity does not improve then rising wages could hit corporate margins which could curb upside momentum.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 600 points on Friday.
WTI Crude Posts Weekly Loss as US Output Hit 10 Million Barrels Per Day
Crude oil prices settled lower for the week as recent data showed US output rose above 10 million dollars for the first time in nearly half a decade, while US supplies snapped 10 straight weeks of declines.
This renewed fears that rising output could dampen major oil producers’ production curbs, slowing down rebalancing in oil markets.
Goldman Sachs, however, allayed fears over rising production somewhat after the bank raised its forecasts for oil prices amid expectations for a “speedy rebalance in oil markets.”
On Friday U.S. crude futures fell 35 cents to $65.45 a barrel.
Federal Reserve Tweaked Its Monetary Policy Lyrics 
As was widely expected, the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged within a 1.25% - 1.50% range. Investor focus, however, was drawn to a subtle shift in the central banks’ language concerning inflation.
The Fed said that inflation is expected to “move up,” which differed from its usual “remain low” inflation narrative.
This subtle shift in language together with the bullish jobs report helped the dollar recover some of its losses against major rivals like the euro and sterling.
Gold Fell To Rising Dollar, Bond Yield Pressure 
Soaring bonds yields and a rising dollar pressured gold prices to its biggest weekly loss since December. The yellow metal fell to about $1,333 an ounce from its weekly high of about $1,352 an ounce. 
Yet, some market participants said that it is too early to conclude the balance of power has shifted to the bears as gold is up roughly 9% over the past year, while recent CFTC COT data showed money managers continued to raise their bets on gold, increasing net long positions to near multi-year highs.
Crypto ‘Bloodbath’ Round 2: Bigger, Uglier, Scarier 
There was no place hide for investors 'hodling' the top ranking cryptos as the global regulatory crackdown gripped markets ushering in wave of selling pressure as billions were wiped off the crypto-market. 
The total cryptocurrency market cap at $413 billion, at the time of writing, is below $478 billion – the level last seen following the so-called crypto “bloodbath” on Jan. 16. Yet that is still well above the total marketcap of roughly $170 billion seen during the first major regulatory crackdown in September last year.
Bitcoin fell roughly 20% to $8,680 over the past week, while Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, fell 14% to $898.11.
Ripple XRP, meanwhile, led the weekly decline falling nearly 30% to $0.87."

213,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 04:50PM ET</span>","Wall Street says Starbucks has too many stores, prices too high","By Lisa Baertlein
(Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) has too many stores and its prices are too high, Wall Street analysts are starting to agree, as they seek to explain the company's slowing U.S. growth.
The world's biggest coffee chain now has more U.S. locations than McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) but it has been struggling for more than a year to lure the traffic needed to deliver the growth that investors have come to expect.
Executives last week warned that Starbucks' 2018 same-store sales growth would be at the low end of its forecast. The chain reported a 2 percent U.S. quarterly same-store sales gain that fell short of expectations on flat holiday traffic. Two years ago, those sales jumped 9 percent. 
Starbucks itself has offered a laundry list of reasons for the deceleration in its domestic business, including weak retail traffic, changes to its rewards program, bottlenecks from a crush of mobile orders, and holiday merchandise and drink specials that failed to ""resonate"" with customers.
Executives concede that Starbucks' U.S. afternoon business has dragged down results in its most important market. 
Still, they say that Starbucks - which had 14,163 U.S. locations at year-end, 25 percent more than five years ago and 127 more than McDonald's - is not cannibalizing its own sales or losing share in a market crowded with coffee sellers ranging from independent cafes to fast-food chains and convenience stores.
Analysts disagree. A recent analysis of restaurant industry trends, retail traffic and other factors led Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore to solidify her view that ""excess unit growth, at a time when Starbucks is reaching a more mature stage of growth, is the root cause"" of the company's domestic woes.
""Rather than a litany of excuses, we believe this is best explained by overcapacity in the industry,"" said John Zolidis, president of Quo Vadis Capital, a Paris-based boutique research firm. ""Starbucks is contributing to the problem by opening new units.""
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Jason West said the brew of stepped-up competition combined with Starbucks' recent opening of roughly 700 U.S. stores a year, is weighing on its ""ability to re-accelerate growth.""
Starbucks said on Friday its new cafes perform well and bring more business to all nearby coffee shops, not just its own.
Proliferation of stores is not Starbucks' only problem, according to analysts. Zolidis also sees another troubling sign: ""We believe the company has raised prices too much."" 
Starbucks did not immediately comment on pricing. 
McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts, owned by Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (O:DNKN), have been holding down drink prices, said Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson, who analyzes 10 markets in the U.S. Northeast, including New York, Boston and Washington.

McDonald's - now selling $1 coffee and $2 small espresso drinks - has kept prices mostly flat for the last two years. Dunkin Donuts' has raised prices by roughly 1 percent per year, while Starbucks has raised prices by about 3.5 percent each year, said Anderson, who added that the rivals may be peeling off some of Starbucks' less-affluent customers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock markets plunged and bond yields soared on Friday after U.S. data showing the strongest annual wage growth since 2009 rattled investors who fear accelerating inflation will usher in more interest rate hikes than expected this year.
Yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note shot up to a four-year high just minutes after the release of a Labor Department unemployment report for January that underscored strong momentum in the U.S. economy. 
A gain of 200,000 jobs last month and annualized increase in average hourly earnings to 2.9 percent led the dollar to surge against the yen, the euro and a basket of six currencies.
The price of the U.S. 10-year note later fell further, pushing the yield up as high as 2.854 percent from 2.773 percent late on Thursday. 
The rapid rise in the 10-year note - the world benchmark for corporate lending - sent shockwaves through a market grown accustomed to low inflation and a steady tick higher in stocks.
""It feels as though the grand era of interest rates below 3 percent will soon be in the rear-view mirror,"" said Mike Terwilliger, portfolio manager of Resource Liquid Alternatives for the Resource Credit Income Fund in New York.
While wage growth may be good for the economy it could spell trouble for the bond market as inflation portends rate hikes, which augur a repricing of fixed income, he said.
The spike in bond rates made everybody nervous, said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas. But the stock sell-off was long overdue, he said.
""The correction looks a whole lot worse than maybe it is because of the fact that we hadn't had a correction for so long that we all got used to watching this market go up,"" he said.
Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York, said next week investors will kick themselves for selling assets for all the wrong reasons in a sell-off akin to throwing the baby out with the bath water.
""Next week we will start sorting and saying, 'Wait a minute. We sold financials because interest rates are going higher?'""
It was the biggest single-day percentage decline for the benchmark S&P 500 index since September 2016 and for the Dow since June 2016. The S&P 500 is still up 3.2 percent for the year.
A stock slide of at least 1 percent in Europe later accelerated on Wall Street as the strong labor market data boosted chances the Federal Reserve will raise rates four times this year instead of the three hikes analysts had expected.
""What is good for the average American worker ends up being negative for stocks because it increases the odds of further rate hikes,"" said Michael Antonelli, managing director of institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 665.75 points, or 2.54 percent, to 25,520.96. The S&P 500 lost 59.85 points, or 2.12 percent, to 2,762.13 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 144.92 points, or 1.96 percent, to 7,240.95.
Disappointing results from some of the largest U.S. companies also weighed on stocks. Oil majors Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) fell 5.1 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively, after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly profits.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell 5.3 percent after an earnings miss and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 4.3 percent as investors focused on its muted forecast rather than strong iPhone prices.
MSCI's all-country world index of equity performance in 47 countries fell 1.8 percent while its gauge of emerging market stocks lost 1.43 percent.
Deutsche Bank's disappointing results pulled the heavyweight banking sector down to help European shares post their biggest weekly loss in more than a year, while Britain's top share index sealed its weakest week in nine months on BT's results.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed down 1.37 percent and the blue-chip FTSE 100 index in London closed down 0.63 percent.
The dollar index, tracking the unit against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.59 percent, with the euro down 0.38 percent to $1.2460. The Japanese yen weakened 0.64 percent versus the greenback at 110.12 per dollar. 
The U.S. bond market's gauges of inflation expectations added to their rise. The gap between 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) and 10-year Treasury notes reached its widest since September 2014.
Crude prices fell on the surging dollar though adherence to output cuts by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and rising global demand kept much of this year's rally in oil in place.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled down 35 cents to $65.45 a barrel. Brent lost $1.07 to $68.58. The deep decline in Brent cut the gap between it and WTI to its narrowest since August.

U.S. gold futures for April delivery settled down $10.60, or 0.8 percent, at $1,337.30.

216,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",'VIX elephant' rides volatility wave to erase hedging losses,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - An unnamed trader dubbed the ""VIX elephant,"" who for months has prepared for a spike in equity market volatility, adjusted a massive options position as stock prices plunged on Friday, thereby erasing months' worth of hedging losses.
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), better known as the VIX, is the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term volatility for the S&P 500 Index (SPX). It rose more than four points to 17.86, its highest since November 2016.
For one trader, whose VIX options position was in the hole by as much as $35 million as of early January, the market rout provided a serendipitous opportunity to capitalize on the higher volatility to erase all of those losses.
On Friday, in one trade, more than 2 million VIX options changed hands as a position with an expiration on February 14 was closed and a fresh position was opened for contracts expiring on March 21.
VIX options are primarily used to protect against a stock market pullback.
""He had something expiring in February and would have probably rolled it around this time anyway,"" said Pravit Chintawongvanich, head of derivatives strategy at Macro Risk Advisors in New York.
""The VIX spiking gives him a little bit of a better opportunity,"" said Chintawongvanich, who calls the trader 'the VIX elephant,' in an allusion to the enormous size of the options position.
Rolling refers to the closing of an existing position to replace it with a similar position that is set to expire further out in time, a strategy the trader has used for months.
The large trade on Friday boosted overall VIX options volume to a record 4 million contracts, about four times the daily average, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.
It also accounted for about 6 percent of overall options activity in all U.S. listed options contracts on Friday, per Trade Alert.
Macro Risk Advisors' Chintawongvanich estimates that the trader was up about $40 million on the February contracts. 
""He started trading this structure back in July and if you look at his profit and loss he is now flat,"" Chintawongvanich said.
The trader's position in the March term stands to profit if volatility continues to spike. The maximum gain will be realized if the VIX settles at 25 at the March expiration.

Reuters could not determine the overall impact of the volatility spike on the anonymous trader's trade book.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Daimler's new Mercedes A-Class, unveiled on Friday, includes the German automaker's own machine-learning and voice recognition technology in one of the industry's boldest attempts so far to take on Silicon Valley's finest.
The Mercedes ""MBUX"" dashboard system to be rolled out across the lineup is about as capable at understanding what you say - and more importantly what you mean - as Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri or Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Assistant.
Its debut comes as carmakers are embroiled in a tech arms race, raising questions about the ultimate profitability of new services that often duplicate those available on smartphones. Daimler itself warned on Thursday that 2018 profit growth would be dampened by technology investment.
Carmakers, especially premium manufacturers, are resisting the encroachment of tech giants on several fronts including autonomous driving and connected services - whose commercial potential multiplies with voice recognition and assistance.
""It's fine to have Google or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) voice apps sitting alongside the main one, but no car company wants the voice activation that controls the air con to be Alexa,"" said Mike Ramsey, a Detroit-based analyst with tech research firm Gartner.
The Daimler system ""narrows the gap with tech,"" Ramsey said. ""If it works as advertised, Mercedes will have set a new standard and given hope to other automakers that they can build a voice interface that actually works like Siri or Google.""
Mercedes is updating its A-Class with a new look and engines, roomier interior and semi-autonomous driving features that can help pilot the car in highway traffic. 
But its biggest draw is the MBUX system, presented on two large horizontal touch-screens that dispense entirely with dashboard instruments.
It uses artificial intelligence to make sense of commands and even anticipate them by learning the preferences and habits of up to eight different users. Spoken instructions can command everything from navigation to infotainment.
Other auto brands have taken a more affordable approach, often using ""mirroring"", which grants access to smartphone apps via a touch-screen interface. Some also route vocal commands straight to Siri, Alexa or Google.
'NO CHOICE'
Daimler hopes customers already used to voice assistants won't miss Siri or Alexa when they climb aboard and must remember to preface requests with ""hey Mercedes"" instead.
The A-Class could be a test of whether carmakers can make bespoke voice assistants a selling point that customers are prepared to pay more for.
Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche rebuffed that idea.
""We've tested it already,"" he told reporters at the Amsterdam launch. ""We don't test on our customers.""
Unlike its cloud-based rivals, available only when online, the Mercedes assistant uses embedded software from Nuance Communications, a Massachussets-based voice recognition specialist, to continue functioning when data connections fail.
Mercedes declined to say whether the current A-Class starting price of 24,000 euros ($30,000) would rise with the new model. But its profitability will, Zetsche insisted - citing axles among mechanical components where savings had been found to offset higher tech spending.
Carmakers now have ""no choice"" but to put their best technology into their smallest cars, Evercore analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said. ""Otherwise those cars would be uncompetitive.""
""Everyone's using Waze for navigation on their mobile phones because onboard navigation systems are so outdated,"" he said. ""These things need to change.""
The technology giants are pushing harder for dashboard space. Apple's CarPlay mirroring service includes Siri and is now available on more than 200 vehicle models, while a three-year effort by Amazon has placed Alexa in Ford and Toyota cars.
Suppliers are also jostling. At the CES tech show in Las Vegas, Panasonic showcased an upgraded infotainment system based on Google software, allowing drivers to use voice commands to pull up directions or access some vehicle controls. 
The growing interest among suppliers, and Nuance's embedded software technology, may open the way for other carmakers to follow Daimler's lead, Gartner's Ramsey predicts.
""Really slick integration of voice activation systems is the big tech thing we're going to see in cars over the next couple of years,"" he said.

221,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 04:18PM ET</span>",Dell says it will explore IPO or merger with VMware,"By Liana B. Baker and Sonam Rai
(Reuters) - Computer maker Dell Technologies Inc said on Friday it was considering a public offering of common stock or a combination with business software maker VMware Inc (N:VMW), its publicly held subsidiary.
Dell, the world's largest privately held technology company, is under pressure to boost profitability after its debt-laden acquisition of data storage provider EMC Corp (NYSE:EMC) for $67 billion in 2016 failed to meet financial targets, hurt by intensifying price competition.
Combining with VMware would provide access to VMWare's $11.6 billion in cash, helping Dell trim its $52.5 billion debt pile. Last month's U.S. tax reform made servicing that debt more expensive due to caps on deducting interest expense.
The combination would also make Dell a publicly listed company, offering a path for private equity firm Silver Lake to begin selling down its 18 percent stake if it chooses to. Silver Lake helped bankroll Dell CEO Michael Dell in taking the company private in 2013 in a $24.9 billion leveraged buyout.
A lockup provision prevents Dell from buying out the stake in VMware it does not already own until September. Any merger agreed before then would have to be structured as an acquisition of Dell by VMware: a so-called reverse merger.
""We view a reverse merger of Dell by its majority-owned subsidiary, VMware, as potentially the most beneficial alternative for Dell and Silver Lake,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities LLC analysts wrote in a research note. 
A combination of Dell and VMware would place them under the same management and help them co-ordinate strategy. Dell's hardware and VMWare's software offerings could potentially be marketed in one suite of products. 
""As part of our ongoing multi-year strategic planning, Dell Technologies is evaluating a number of potential business opportunities,"" founder Michael Dell said in a blog post. ""We do this from a position of strength, with a desire to grow Dell Technologies and its businesses even faster and thrive in the very dynamic IT marketplace.""
Reuters reported on Thursday that Dell planned to announce a review of a possible reverse merger with VMware, as well as other options, including an IPO or asset sales. Sources told Reuters VMware was likely to form a special committee to consider a combination with Dell.
Dell added on Friday that nothing had been decided and the company might end up continuing to operate under its current structure.
""The board of directors follows sound corporate governance practices, and will continue to do so in connection with any potential transaction involving our controlling stockholders,"" VMware's lead director Paul Sagan said in a company statement. 
Shares in VMware, which is 82 percent-owned by Dell, fell 2.4 percent on Friday to close at $122.72. Dell's tracking stock (N:DVMT), which Dell issued to finance the EMC deal and which tracks the value of VMware's business, was up a little less than 1 percent at $70.90.
CHALLENGING PC MARKET
Dell has faced fierce competition in the storage market, with prices pressured by cloud-based rivals such as Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) AWS and Microsoft Corp's (O:MSFT) Azure. Dell's infrastructure chief, former EMC executive David Goulden, departed last fall, and the company has been working to reorganize storage operations.
Michael Dell helped shape the personal computer market when he founded Dell in 1984 as a University pre-med freshman with $1,000 in savings. But growing popularity of smart phones and tablets has squeezed the PC market, which shrank by 0.2 percent in 2017, according to International Data Corporation.
Dell's servers have been a bright spot, helping total net revenue grow to $56.7 billion in the nine months to Nov. 3, from $41.6 billion a year earlier. Yet operating expenses soared from $10 billion to $17.3 billion and Dell's operating loss widened to $3 billion from $1.6 billion a year ago.
Dell has been considering a sale or initial public offering (IPO) of one of its fast-growing divisions, Pivotal Software Inc, sources have said.

Dell, whose technology portfolio spans servers, displays, workstations and gaming PCs, also has a security unit, RSA, and a cloud platform called Boomi.

222,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 04:01PM ET</span>",Dow Jones Plunges 660 Points as Rising Bond Yields Halt Rally ,"Investing.com – Wall Street tumbled after US bonds yields soared following a strong US jobs report showing wage growth improved fuelling expectations for a faster pace of inflation, and monetary policy tightening.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed lower at 25,520. The S&P 500 closed 2.13% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite closed at 7240.95, down 1.96%.
The Labor Department said Friday, U.S. non-farm payrolls rose by 200,000 jobs in January. That beat economists’ forecasts for 184,000 new jobs. While unemployed remained at unchanged on the prior month at 4.1%.
Wage growth met expectations rising 0.3%, and was revised upward to 0.3% for December, triggering investor expectations that tighter labor markets could finally be starting to boost wage price pressures. This may spur inflation growth which could force the Fed to raise rates by more than what markets currently anticipate.
The 10-year Treasury yield rose above 2.8%, as some market participants expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates four times this year. BNP Paribas revised upward its assessment of core PCE inflation, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, to 2.2% from 2.0% previously, and said it expects the Fed to raise rates four times in 2018 compared to a prior estimate of just three hikes.
Also weighing on sentiment for riskier assets were mixed earnings by tech firms reported Thursday as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) missed iPhone sales growth estimates, while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) missed revenue estimates. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), however, closed about 3% higher after reporting earnings that beat on both the top and bottom lines.

Strong jobs data that increased the likelihood the Federal Reserve will lift rates next month sent bond bulls scurrying and rattled equity investors who haven’t seen a week this bad in two years. The selling accelerated after Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan suggested more than three hikes may be necessary this year. The 10-year Treasury yield popped above 2.85 percent for the first time since January 2014.
“Yields have risen, inflation evidence is rising rather broadly. It’s that combo of factors that’s starting to mount,” Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Weeden, said by phone. “And then you get a report, and that’s the straw that breaks the camel’s back, and that’s kind of what we got into today.” 
There was nowhere to hide on the stock market, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors lower. The index’s five-day rout topped 3.5 percent -- marking its first pullback of at least that much in a record 404 days. Energy shares sank 4 percent as earnings disappointed and crude slumped. The tech selloff worsened, sending the Nasdaq 100 Index lower by 1.7 percent. It’s on track for the worst week since February 2006. Not even a record rally at Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). could rescue the measure, as the world’s biggest company, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). hit its lowest since October.
“People are finally starting to reprice reflation, it’s about time,” Jeanne Asseraf-Bitton, head of global cross-asset research at Lyxor Asset Management, said by phone. “Global economic growth is strong and corporate earnings are very solid, so there’s no reason to question the equity bull market. The rise in bond yields is good, it’s just the speed at which it’s happening that is making investors nervous. Bottom line: this is a healthy correction.”
U.S. hiring picked up in January and wages rose at the fastest annual pace since the recession ended, as the economy’s steady move toward full employment extended into 2018. Equities are being tested by the surge in bond yields, with some fund managers saying 3 percent U.S. 10-year rates would signal a bond bear market. The level is seen by many stock-watchers as a potential trigger for a correction in equities.
In Europe, a bond selloff deepened across the continent, and equities dropped for a fifth straight day, the longest streak since November. Disappointing results from companies including  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and BT Group (LON:BT) Plc. paced losses, with Germany’s DAX giving up the year’s gains, capping the worst weekly decline since 2016. Bund yields reached a fresh two-year high, while the euro and British pound weakened. Japanese debt gained and the yen declined after the Bank of Japan intervened to stem the rise in rates.
Elsewhere, oil edged lower, though still trading near its highest level since 2015 in New York. Bitcoin continued to slide after a miserable January, falling below $8,000.

225,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 03:26PM ET</span>",Boeing proposes Embraer tie-up excluding defense unit: source,"By Ricardo Brito
BRASILIA (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) has sought the Brazilian government's approval of a partnership with planemaker Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) that would create a new company focused on commercial aviation, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The new vehicle would not include Embraer's defense unit under the proposal presented on Thursday, according to the source, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of ongoing talks.
Embraer said in a securities filing that it was in ongoing talks with Boeing and the Brazilian government about a potential partnership that could eventually create a new company, but it had not received a formal proposal from Boeing. 
A Boeing representative in Brazil said the structure of a possible deal with Embraer was ""still being studied.""
Government sources told Reuters it was too early to say if the latest suggested structure of a deal would pass muster with all ministries concerned and, importantly, with the military. Some did say that the latest structure would seem to meet the main government demands, especially regarding the protection of Brazilian defense programs.
Representatives at Brazil's Defense Ministry, which set up a committee to make recommendations to the government on a partnership, declined to comment immediately.
Brazil's Air Force repeated on Friday that they ""consider Embraer to be fundamental for the country's security and any decision has to take into account national sovereignty."" 
Embraer shares, which surged as much as 9 percent after a report by Globo media suggested that Embraer had accepted a proposal from Boeing, pared gains to around 4.5 percent in afternoon trading. Boeing shares were down about 1.5 percent.
Boeing's proposed tie-up with Embraer, the world's third-largest planemaker, would give it a leading share of the 70- to 130-seat market and create stiffer competition for the CSeries program designed by Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) and backed by European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) last year.
An unexpected U.S. trade ruling last month scrapping tariffs on CSeries jets added to pressure on Boeing and Embraer to pull off a tie-up of their own. 
Brazil's government has openly pushed for a partnership between the two companies focused more narrowly on commercial aviation, rather than an outright acquisition, due to concerns about the independence of Brazilian defense programs.
The government, which holds about 10 percent of Embraer shares through public-sector funds, still has veto power over its military programs and any takeover attempts due to a golden share in the former state enterprise.

Boeing has sought ways to preserve the government's golden share in Embraer and previously proposed safeguards for defense programs in Brazil along the lines of its subsidiaries in Britain and Australia, sources have told Reuters.

227,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 03:22PM ET</span>","Exxon, Chevron shares plunge after weak results spook Street","By Ernest Scheyder
HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) posted rare quarterly earnings misses on Friday as cost cuts and rising oil prices failed to offset weakness in international refining operations, sending shares of both companies plunging.
The results surprised Wall Street, where analysts had been steadily raising expectations due to stronger crude prices and a rebounding global economy, according to Thomson Reuters data.
But excluding U.S. tax benefits, results at both companies fell short of expectations, casting a cloud over the U.S. oil industry just days after the nation's output surpassed a milestone 10 million barrels per day.
""We got carried away with our expectations, and by we, I mean Wall Street as a whole,"" said Oliver Pursche of wealth manager Bruderman Brothers LLC, which holds Exxon shares.
Exxon, Chevron and rival Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) all reported lower cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter despite higher oil and gas prices. Reasons varied, but included weaker refining profits and spending on capital expenses.
Shell, the world's second-largest publicly traded oil company after Exxon, managed to overtake its bigger rival for the first time in a key area, producing about 6 percent more cash last year than Exxon's $33.2 billion.
""What struck us the most was the decline in cash flow from operations at Exxon,"" Pursche said. 
Exxon's stock dropped 6 percent in Friday afternoon trading, the biggest one-day drop since August 2011. The stock had been making gains after hitting a low last summer, closing Thursday at a 52-week high. But Exxon shares are flat over the past year despite a 22 percent rise in the S&P 500.
Analysts needled Exxon's director of investor relations, Jeff Woodbury, with unusually pointed questions about the cash flow drop on a Friday earnings conference call. Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods did not participate in the call.
The frustration boiled over into the Chevron call, which followed Exxon's. Mike Wirth, in his second day as Chevron's CEO, described the refining weakness a one-time issue rather than a systemic problem.
While Wirth's answers did not seem to mollify all analysts, several thanked him for talking. ""I really appreciate you coming on the call from time to time,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital analyst Paul Cheng said to Wirth. ""I hope that at least one of your other major competitors will do the same."" 
Chevron's shares were off more than 5 percent in afternoon trading. Both companies are part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which fell more than 2 percent in late trading.
""It was a pair of disappointing results from both companies,"" said Brian Youngberg, an oil industry analyst at Edward Jones. ""Is refining something to be concerned about as we move through 2018? Will that be an offset to those higher oil prices?""
Chevron said higher oil prices, up 25 percent in 2017, and currency impacts hurt refining margins by $500 million in the quarter. 
Both companies benefited from recent U.S. tax reform. Non-cash tax gains were $5.94 billion at Exxon and $2 billion at Chevron.
Excluding that tax change and other one-time items, Exxon earned 88 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of $1.04 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Exxon's quarterly production fell 3 percent to 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, with the only gain coming from the United States. But its U.S. production business was unprofitable for the third year in a row.
At Chevron, production rose 2.6 percent. Excluding the tax change and other one-time items, the company earned 72 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of $1.22 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
""I expect us to maintain capital cost and discipline,"" Wirth said. ""I intend to lead Chevron to win in any environment.""

France's  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) and the United Kingdom's  BP  (LON:BP) Plc plan to post quarterly results later this month.

Microsoft fell 2.2 percent to $92.97, trimming its market capitalization to about $711 billion.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), the world's most valuable listed company, was worth $827 billion on Friday after reporting disappointing iPhone sales on Thursday. Its stock fell 3.7 percent to $161.57. 
The major stock indexes fell as much as 2.1 percent in a broad retreat. 
At least 13 brokerages raised their price targets for Amazon after it posted record profits, pointing to growth potential from increasing global Prime subscriptions and a market-leading cloud business.
Analysts at Jefferies, Wedbush and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) were the most bullish, boosting their targets to $1,750. At that price, Amazon would be worth about $850 billion.
Microsoft's stock has jumped 150 percent to new highs since Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella took over in 2014 and made the company a major player in cloud computing while reducing its dependence on a tepid personal computer industry.
But Microsoft has failed to keep up with Amazon shares, which have surged 73 percent in the past 12 months.
Amazon revenue has been growing at a scorching pace as more shopping moves online and businesses shift their computing operations to the cloud, where Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads the market.
AWS, which competes with Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google Cloud platform, reported a 45 percent jump in revenue to $5.1 billion in the quarter.
""AWS is still adding more incremental dollars than all public cloud competitors combined,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Ross Sandler said.
The high-margin business, which accounts for a significant chunk of Amazon's operating profit, has been providing cash for investments and supporting the razor-thin margins in retail.
Amazon's earlier investments in warehouses have yielded results for the company as lower shipping costs boosted its quarterly operating margin to 3.5 percent, its highest fourth-quarter margin since 2010, analysts said.

Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Amazon, with 46 of 50 brokerages rating it ""buy"" or higher, three ""hold"" and only one ""sell."" Their median price target is $1,580.

230,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Merck's consumer health sale at risk as Nestle bows out - sources,"By Pamela Barbaglia, Patricia Weiss and Martinne Geller
LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The sale of Merck (NYSE:MRK) KGaA's (DE:MRCG) consumer health unit has been thrown off track after Nestle (S:NESN) has pulled out, leaving the race to buy the maker of Seven Seas vitamins without its main contender, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Nestle has walked away from the process, led by JPMorgan (N:JPM), after months of negotiations as the Swiss company was put off by Merck's price expectations of about 4 billion euros ($4.99 billion), the sources said.
Nestle and Merck declined to comment. A spokesman for Merck said that ""the process of evaluating options for our consumer health business is well on track.""
Four sources familiar with the sale said that interest from other bidders, including British consumer goods giant  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB), was also waning as a rival consumer health auction, led by U.S. drug giant  Pfizer  (N:PFE), was gaining momentum.
Reckitt is now concentrating on buying the Pfizer unit which makes Advil painkillers, Centrum multivitamins and Chapstick lip balm and is worth about $20 billion, the sources said.
Reckitt declined to comment.
Germany's Merck said last year it was looking to sell its consumer healthcare business, which has annual sales of about $1 billion, to help to fund more research into prescription drugs.
Nestle was initially seen as a natural buyer for the business, which also makes Bion nutritional supplements, after previous talks to set up a consumer joint venture with Merck fell through over the summer.
Consumer health is a fragmented sector ranging from over-the-counter medicines and vitamins to sports nutrition products and condoms. It has proved fertile ground for deals in recent years, as aging populations and health-conscious consumers drive demand.
Nestle's CEO Mark Schneider is a healthcare veteran and wants a deeper focus on nutrition, health and wellness.
Nestle made a non-binding bid for the Merck's business in November and was then shortlisted to carry out due diligence and submit a final offer this year.
But the Swiss food group could not reach an agreement on price as Merck was targeting a valuation as high as 20 times the unit's core earnings, according to one of the sources.
Another source said mounting pressure from Dan Loeb's activist fund Third Point, which last year made a $3.5 billion investment in Nestle, also played a role in deciding against buying the Merck's business.
Loeb has repeatedly asked Nestle to move faster to overhaul its strategy. He wants the Swiss company to boost its exposure in high-growth areas such as coffee, pet care, bottled water and nutrition while selling ""ill-fitting businesses"" more quickly.
Schneider has so far taken positive steps including selling the U.S. confectionery business to Italy's Ferrero for $2.8 billion but he wants to be disciplined on price, the sources said.
Famous for his sharply-worded letters to corporate chieftains, Loeb wrote on Jan. 22 that he was concerned about Nestle pushing more deeply into consumer healthcare with the purchase of Canadian vitamin maker Atrium Innovations  and said he wants a better explanation of that move.

PARIS (Reuters) - Botox-maker Allergan (N:AGN) has embarked on a big push in China where it plans to hire 200 additional staff this year and will also be on the lookout for potential acquisitions in the country, a senior executive told Reuters on Friday.
The drugmaker is about to complete a restructuring in which more than 1,000 staff will leave the company, more than 5 percent of its current workforce, as it faces a drop in revenues coming from new competition for its second most important drug, dry-eye treatment Restasis.
Speaking on the sidelines of aesthetic and cosmetic dermatology congress IMCAS in Paris, Allergan's Executive Vice President in charge of international operations Marc Princen said Allergan was eyeing annual sales of around $500 million in China by 2022.
The company recorded sales of around $180 million there last year, he said.
""At this point in time, 80 percent of our sales are in the U.S and 20 percent abroad. Over the next five years, we will bring the 20 percent to 30 percent,"" Princen said in an interview.
""The focus will be on high potential must-win markets, for example China. We have added 300 staff there in 2017 and we grew revenues by 60 percent. We will add another 200 this year,"" he said.
Princen said his team had identified 12 key markets outside the United States. Among them China, Brazil, Russia as well as European countries such as France, Italy, Germany and Spain.
""I am a strong believer in mainland Europe for instance. We can have double-digit growth there by doing the right things. At the moment, in Europe, we have growth of around between 7-8 percent, it will grow..."" he said.
The executive said the company, which has recently bought Zeltiq Aesthetics for $2.48 billion, had many options to grow out of its own resources but that other acquisitions would also be considered.
""What we are not going to do : mega deals. We will not go into that. But we will buy early stage-products that we will develop and market further, the closer they are to launch, the better,"" he said without giving further details.
""I will not go country by country on M&A. I would say though mainland Europe is important as well as Asia.""
Princen said 90 percent of the job cuts announced in November were completed.
""If we look at the proportion, its 800 departures in the U.S and 200 outside the U.S,"" he said.
The company is due to publish its annual results on Feb.6.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A group representing large investors voiced concern that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is undoing protections for shareholders to bring proxy resolutions opposed by management.
Ken Bertsch, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, said his group disagreed with recent SEC decisions allowing companies including electric utility AES Corp to craft their own rules on the right to call special investor meetings, in place of versions proposed by shareholders.
""AES is playing games with this,"" Bertsch said in a telephone interview late on Thursday, adding that existing guidance from the top U.S. securities regulator should have been enough to protect the resolutions.
The council, whose members include big pension funds and asset managers like BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Vanguard Group, raised its concerns to the SEC directly in a Jan. 31 letter seen by Reuters.
Under Chairman Jay Clayton the SEC has taken steps seen as favoring businesses, such as allowing companies to confidentially file paperwork for initial public offerings. Clayton said at a November conference he hoped to reconcile concerns about the cost of shareholder resolutions with the corporate governance improvements they can bring about.
Spokespeople for AES and the SEC declined to comment, and the SEC did not make Clayton available for an interview.
Shareholder resolutions have taken on a new importance as fund firms seek money from investors concerned about climate change and corporate governance. [nL1N1IX15V]
The SEC has already taken steps that could raise the bar for filers, such as allowing more resolutions to be skipped as ""ordinary business."" [nL1N1OX1EX]
The AES resolution and a similar one at CF Industries Holdings Inc (NYSE:CF) were filed by independent investor John Chevedden. Both called for shareholders with at least 10 percent of shares to be able to call special meetings, which can put pressure on management.
The companies requested SEC permission to leave the proposals off their proxies. Each company said it planned instead to offer shareholders a resolution to set the special meeting threshold at 25 percent of shares, a higher standard that could protect executives and directors.
The SEC sided with AES in December, and with CF on Jan. 30, saying Chevedden's measures conflicted with the management proposals. A CF spokesman did not respond to messages.
In an interview, Chevedden said shareholders could logically vote for both standards to see which had more support. Now, he said, shareholders would ""only get to hear management's side.""

TORONTO (Reuters) - Ontario's financial regulator said on Friday it has revoked the license of mortgage brokerage Building Development and Mortgages Canada Inc (BDMC) and Vince Petrozza, a co-founder of a related firm, Fortress Real Developments, following an investigation into risky syndicated mortgage investments.
Regulator FSCO said BDMC, the lead broker for Fortress projects, and three mortgage brokers, FDS Broker Services Inc, FFM Capital Inc and FMP Mortgage Investments Inc, which marketed Fortress products as their primary or sole line of business, were fined a total of C$1.1 million. (Special Report: Canada regulator ignored warnings on risky mortgage investments - http://reut.rs/2BwjTXz)
BDMC confirmed that it had agreed a settlement with the Financial Services Commission of Ontario (FSCO) and would stop all mortgage brokerage activities. BDMC said it had raised C$920 million for real estate projects from over 14,000 investors.
The firm has agreed that existing syndicated mortgage investments in Fortress projects will be managed by a so-called arms length administrator, FAAN Mortgage Administrators, which will conduct business in BDMC's name.
In a special report published in November, Reuters revealed that the Canadian province's regulator had been investigating brokers raising funds for projects associated with Fortress since 2011 but had failed to take action despite repeated warnings that the marketing of the risky investments broke provincial laws.
Syndicated mortgage investments, which pool the funds of private lenders to raise funds for real estate development, have grown in popularity in Canada as investors looked for ways to generate better returns from their savings with bank savings accounts offering record low interest rates. However, their growth in popularity led to thousands of pensioners and mom-and-pop type investors putting their life savings at risk.
An investor outcry about the products has focused public and government attention on FSCO's lax regulation of the market. In the past decade, more than 20,000 retail investors have put as much as C$1.5 billion (US$1.2 billion) into syndicated mortgages, mostly in Ontario, according to regulatory sources.
Roughly 90 percent of those investments, the sources said, have ended in a loss or are at risk of doing so, and Fortress projects make up more than half of the investments.
The regulator said on Friday it had revoked the broker licenses of Petrozza and three other people, requiring them to stop all mortgage brokering businesses immediately.

Ildina Galati-Ferrante, principal broker of BDMC, surrendered her broker license and was required to cease all mortgage brokering activities.

248,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",Hedge funds bet against some Italian banks on the rise,"By Simon Jessop, Maiya Keidan and Danilo Masoni
LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - A group of hedge funds have stepped up bets against a string of Italian banks, taking a contrary stance against a sector and broader market on the rise ahead of an election which could yet rattle investors.
The negative stance, shown in positioning data filed with the regulator, is at odds with business morale - at a decade high as a slow economic recovery gathers pace - as well as debt markets, where there is no sign of sovereign stress ahead of the March 4 vote.
Italian banking stocks (FTIT8300) - a proxy for the health of the wider Italian economy, have risen 11 percent so far this year to push the country's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) index up 6.5 percent, outperforming most European peers.
By contrast, European banks (SX7P) have risen just 3.8 percent over the same period.
While Italy's market gains have been helped by growing confidence over the country's economic recovery, thanks in part to the European Central Bank's loose monetary policy, banks would be firmly in the firing line if the market suddenly considers the positivity overdone, such as around the election.
At the moment, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement is the most popular single party in opinion polls, ahead of the ruling party PD. A center-right alliance of smaller parties is seen winning most seats in parliament though, but probably not enough to govern, pointing to a coalition.
""It's a paradox,"" said Carlo Franchini, head of institutional clients at Italy's Banca Ifigest, about the relatively sanguine market reaction so far.
""People simply haven't realized there are elections ahead. The problem is the immense liquidity,"" he added, referring to how easy money policies have inflated bond prices in the heavily indebted euro zone country.
So-called 'short' bets on lenders including UniCredit (MI:CRDI), BPER Banca (MI:EMII) and Credito Valtellinese (MI:PCVI) have all risen since the end of last year, data from the Italian regulator's website showed.
The hedge fund trade involves borrowing a stock from a long-term holder such as a pension scheme and selling it into the market in an expectation that the price will fall before you buy it back and return it, pocketing the difference as profit.
U.S. hedge fund Bridgewater Associates is leading the charge with the largest number of bets in the sector, including against  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP), UniCredit and Finecobank (MI:FBK), among others.
Other funds to add to their short positions recently include London-based firms Marshall Wace, Lansdowne Partners, Oceanwood Capital Management and Caius Capital, the data showed, as did computer-driven investors AQR Capital Management, Oxford Asset Management and GSA Capital, which follow market trends.
All of the funds involved in shorting Italian banks either declined to comment or were not immediately available to comment when contacted by Reuters.
BULLS
Not everyone agrees, however, particularly as the Italian banking system begins to tackle its large pile of non-performing loans, freeing up cash to lend to companies and boost economic growth.
Investors also see potential for the fragmented Italian banking system to consolidate and cut costs.
A spokesman at one London-based fund told Reuters his firm was ""rather positive"" on Italian banks. ""We think they are very cheap and they have addressed their issues.""
Jerry del Missier, who runs hedge fund and private equity firm Copper Street Capital, said he had a more nuanced view on the Italian banks.
""There are clearly capital challenges at a number of institutions but good progress was made in the last year in cleaning up the sector. Some of this has been reflected in the market already, but we believe there are still attractive valuations across the capital structure of several banks.""
Six hedge funds owned stakes in UniCredit, betting the share price would rise, according to Thomson Reuters data, while three held such positive bets in BPER Banca and three in Credito Valtellinese. 
The International Monetary Fund estimates the Italian economy grew 1.6 percent in 2017, the strongest rate since 2010. The economy is set to grow 1.5 percent in 2018, lagging average growth of 2.2 percent across the whole euro zone.
The stock market was helped in 2017 by 11 billion euros of investment from a government-backed scheme to promote public ownership of small and mid cap companies. Another 9 billion euros investment is expected in 2018, according to estimates from brokerage Equita.

249,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 01:21PM ET</span>",Wynn stock drop forces question: when to disclose misconduct?,"By Tom Hals
WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - The steep drop in the stock price of  Wynn Resorts Ltd  (O:WYNN) following a report that chairman Steve Wynn subjected female staff to unwanted sexual advances offers an illustration of how such allegations may now be ""material"" information that public companies need to disclose.
The #MeToo movement has sparked a wave of harassment and abuse allegations leveled against dozens of powerful men in recent months.
In the past, companies generally did not need to disclose such claims, which under U.S. securities law the companies would have to evaluate based on the profit impact from any settlement payments, according to legal experts.
But in the current environment, lawyers say companies must consider factors including reputational harm, litigation risk, and the potential disruption if a key executive is forced out. 
""A settlement involving a CEO would cross the threshold now if it didn't a few years ago,"" said Brian Quinn, a professor at the Boston College Law School.
The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Wynn personally paid $7.5 million to settle sexual assault allegations by a former manicurist. The newspaper also said the tycoon routinely subjected employees to unwanted sexual advances. 
The company's stock has fallen around 15 percent since the report was published. Several law firms specializing in securities class actions have said they were exploring possible lawsuits.
Wynn Resorts did not respond to a request for comment.
Reuters has not independently verified the allegations. Wynn, the billionaire founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Wynn Resorts, has called the claims ""preposterous."" The company set up a special committee to investigate.
The report prompted investigations by gaming regulators in Nevada, where the company has its flagship U.S. resort, the Wynn Las Vegas. Authorities in Massachusetts, where a new Wynn casino is planned, this week expressed concern about whether Wynn would meet a ""suitability"" requirement for a gaming license.
On Thursday, shares in retailer Guess Inc fell over 17 percent after a #MeToo tweet by model Kate Upton, who accused co-founder Paul Marciano of using his power to harass women. Marciano denies misconduct. 
'MATERIAL EVENTS' 
U.S. public companies are required to report 'material events,' such as mergers or major product recalls, that can impact the share price.
The rules are subjective and something that would be considered material to a $100 million company might not be for a $100 billion multinational. 
Even if Wynn Resorts, rather than Wynn himself, had paid out a $7.5 million settlement, the amount would likely be considered immaterial for a company with $6.3 billion in revenue in 2017, according to legal experts.
Corporate lawyer Steven Shapiro was former general counsel at a publicly traded company he declined to identify when it paid a small confidential settlement to resolve misconduct allegations. Today, Shapiro said he would give more consideration to disclosure in a similar situation, though he would still be cautious.
""Sometimes disclosure can be more misleading,"" he said. ""Shareholders might think the problem is more widespread than it is. That's not fair to investors."" 
Allegations of sexual misconduct can be particularly tricky because they involve the interests of shareholders, who may want information public, and the rights of those who want privacy, including the accuser, the accused executive and his or her family.
Disclosure can also open a company to liability if it describes an incident as isolated, and it later emerges there was problem of serial abuses, legal experts said.
Many companies that uncover credible misconduct claims will opt now to force out an accused executive quickly, lawyers said, but that may not solve the problem when the person, like Wynn, is highly identified with the brand and remains a major shareholder.
Tax return preparer Liberty Tax Inc (O:TAX) encountered such a situation when it fired CEO John Hewitt without explanation in September, although he remained a controlling shareholder and chairman.
In the following months, according to press reports and a resignation letter from a company director, Hewitt had sex in his office and lavished company funds on women with whom he was involved. The auditor soon quit, the stock has tumbled and Nasdaq has warned it could delist the company after Hewitt stacked the board with allies.
The company and a lawyer for Hewitt did not respond to requests for comment.
Allen Nelson, former general counsel of Crawford & Co (N:CRDb), which manages insurance claims, said harassment settlements, regardless of size, raise material questions about leadership and corporate culture.

""I think people in the board room should be having that discussion now,"" said Nelson.

Starbucks has outlets in countries across Europe and around the world, but its plan to launch a high-end Reserve Roastery in Milan will be its first bid to attract Italian coffee drinkers.
The U.S. firm plans to launch the outlet in the autumn, offering coffee enthusiasts the chance to watch the process from roasting beans to pouring a shot, as well as tasting a range of coffees. It will be the first of its kind in Europe.
Starbucks has till now launched two Reserve Roasteries, in its hometown of Seattle, in 2014 and in Shanghai, in December 2017. The firm reportedly spent $20 million on the Seattle outlet. It says it plans to open 'Roasteries' in New York, Tokyo and Chicago.
After the launch in Milan, its Italian commercial partner and licensee Percassi will open more typical Starbucks shops in the city later in the year, the company said. 
A total of 300 people will be hired for its Italian stores in 2018, it said. 
Other coffee makers like Lavazza have opened shops in Italy's financial capital, reflecting global competition among major brands to capture a growing market for people prepared to pay a premium for quality espresso coffees.

281,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 11:39AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank gambles German goodwill with bonus bonanza,"By John O'Donnell and Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's British chief executive may have done much to rebuild bridges between Germany's biggest bank and its politicians, business leaders and general public, but John Cryan has gambled this goodwill in an effort to keep top bankers.
Cryan's decision to push ahead with paying big bonuses, despite  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) reporting heavy losses in 2017, is testing relations with German politicians and the public, many of whom deeply disapprove of high pay and Anglo-Saxon style capitalism.
Reactions to the bonus payouts confirmed on Friday were almost universally negative in Germany, including from the government in Berlin itself, leaving the 57-year-old former UBS investment banker with another huge public relations job to do. 
For unlike his predecessor, Cryan has made a point of speaking German, staying attuned to the mood music in the local press and putting Deutsche Bank's own backyard, rather than Wall Street and London, at the center of its growth strategy. 
""This is capitalism gone out of control and it's bad for Deutsche Bank's image in Germany,"" Hans-Christian Stroebele, a prominent member of Germany's Green party and one of the country's best known liberals, said.
There is a growing debate in Germany about the gap between rich and poor. A prominent research institute published a study in January showing that a greater portion of household wealth was concentrated among the super rich than previously believed.
What really irks many Germans is that the bonus debate comes as Deutsche Bank slashes its headcount and on Friday reaffirmed plans to cut 9,000 jobs from 2015 levels, around one in 10 staff globally, with 4,000 expected to lose their jobs in Germany.
""Deutsche Bank management does the only thing it can in the circumstances,"" Christian Ehring, one of the nation's best known comedians, said on state broadcaster ARD this week: ""Sack staff and swipe fat bonuses for themselves"".
In justifying his bonus plans, Cryan said Deutsche Bank was making a ""one-off investment"" to retain staff and that bonuses next year would be closely linked to performance. 
But even the German government, which normally keeps a low profile when it comes to voicing opinions on private sector pay, aired its own scepticism after Deutsche Bank announced its third annual loss in a row, due to a drop in revenue from investment banking and a U.S. tax reform, but paid its staff more than 12 billion euros, 3 percent more than in 2016. 
In investment banking, where Deutsche Bank posted a loss of more than 700 million euros during the final three months of the year, pay and bonuses in the same period jumped 45 percent year on year to more than 1.2 billion euros.
""The leadership team of a large corporation – including that of a German bank – must always pay attention to how its decisions are perceived in public,"" Steffen Seibert told journalists in Berlin, reiterating similar remarks this week.
""They must also have a good argument for the public.""
Cryan defended the payout, while acknowledging the potential damage to Deutsche Bank's image.
""We are in a particular time in Germany where the word bonus does still have a certain sensitivity,"" he said. ""But I think our job is to do what is right for the company overall.""
He said the bank's restructuring reflected its allegiance to Germany, Europe's biggest economy. Last year, it decided not to sell Postbank, a retail bank in Germany, which Cryan said was ""a clear commitment to our home market"".
And Marcus Schenck, co-deputy CEO who oversees Deutsche Bank's investment bank, pointed out that many U.S. banks fled Germany as the financial crisis hit in 2007, leaving companies there in the lurch. ""We will never do that,"" he said.
German investors, who have seen their shares fall in value since Cryan became CEO, also expressed unease. 
""It is not clear why investment bankers should get high bonuses when their business is in the red,"" Hendrik Leber, a fund manager at Deutsche Bank shareholder Acatis, said.
And Markus Kienle of the SdK, a group that represents German investors, said he could not see why Deutsche Bank was doing so.
""If you're not going to be measured by your results in paying the bonus, what then?"" Kienle added.
As well as negative headlines in German newspapers and broadcasters taking a critical stance on the bank's bonus payout, which has been hotly discussed since rumours circulated at the beginning of the week, even comedians have weighed in. 

""Half a billion loss but a billion in bonus because top managers would otherwise go to the competition?"" Martin Sonneborn, a German comedian and European Parliament member joked on Twitter, prompting a flood of ""likes"" in response.

Shares rose 3.7 percent to $5.29 in early trading, a day after sliding 5.7 percent to their lowest in a year and a half. 
The company has sought to strengthen its balance sheet by cutting costs and mortgaging a portion of its airwaves and equipment, but industry analysts have raised concerns about how it can adequately fund network improvements after merger talks with rival T-Mobile US Inc ended last year. 
Sprint now expects $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion in operating income, up from its previous estimate of $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion. It expects adjusted free cash flow of $500 million to $700 million, compared to previous estimates of breaking even. 
""We think recent weakness in shares is reflective of lowered investor expectations, while in-line to slightly better financial results could provide some near-term relief,"" said Matthew Niknam, analyst at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), in a research note. 
On the post-earnings conference call, Sprint Chief Executive Officer Marcelo Claure said Sprint would launch a mobile 5G network in the United States by the first half of 2019. 
The company is also looking for ways to reduce the number of executives at the top, he said. Sprint cut costs by about $260 million in the quarter, excluding $100 million of hurricane-related charges. 
Claure said ""becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of (SoftBank Group Corp) could be a possibility"" but that the decision would be up to SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son. Japan's SoftBank owns a majority of Sprint and has been increasing its stake. 
For the quarter, Sprint reported net additions of 184,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, compared to additions of 368,000 a year earlier.
Net operating revenue in the third quarter ended Dec. 31 was $8.24 billion, down from $8.55 billion a year earlier. 
Sprint reported quarterly net income of $7.16 billion, or $1.79 per share, due to the impact of federal tax reforms, after a loss of $479 million, or 12 cents per share, a year earlier. 
Excluding the impact of tax cuts signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump late last year, net income was 3 cents a share.

According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, analysts had expected revenue of $8.15 billion and a net loss of 4 cents a share.

LONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's Fox is hoping the creation of an independent editorial board to protect the news channel at bid target Sky (L:SKYB) will satisfy regulators and allow it to finally take control of the European pay-TV group. 
Britain's competition regulator told Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) last month that Murdoch's near eight-year, $15.7 billion pursuit of Sky would be blocked unless a way is found to prevent the media mogul from influencing Sky News after a deal.
Fox had earlier offered to create an editorial board with a majority of independent directors. People familiar with the matter, lawyers and investors believe a stronger mechanism to guarantee independence should be enough to gain approval. 
The takeover is being closely watched in the United States where Fox has agreed to sell most of its assets including Sky to Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS), which wants to buy all of Sky in the deal and not just the 39 percent that Fox already owns.
WORKING ON A SOLUTION
Fox is likely to have taken encouragement from a comment from the regulator that given that Fox may not own Sky for long, it will be willing to accept the most cost-effective solution.
""Fox are still confident they can get the deal done,"" a person familiar with the situation said. ""They're working on new suggestions for the remedies.""
As Britain's biggest owner of national newspapers, every move by Murdoch is scrutinised by his political allies and enemies alike. Britain's competition regulator worries that a deal to own all of Sky News would give him too much sway over public opinion. 
Prime Minister Theresa May's government has the final say on the deal, but will have to stick to the regulator's advice or face possible legal action. Lawyers and consultants think Fox can land Sky by offering a fully independent board for Sky News and long-term funding, preventing it from having to make the more costly option of spinning off the channel or selling it completely. Sky, Europe's leading pay-TV provider in 23 million homes across Britain, Ireland, Austria, Germany and Italy, has kept up the pressure by warning it could close the loss-making but award-winning channel if it prevented a takeover. ROLLING NEWS
Sky News launched in 1989 when Murdoch, having shaken up the newspaper market, sought to smash the dominance of the BBC and commercial network  ITV  (LON:ITV) by launching four channels as part of a new paid-for satellite service. The 24-hour channel, the first in Britain to follow in the footsteps of global pioneer CNN, immediately gave the fledgling network visibility, and it has punched above its weight in terms of influence ever since. Watched closely in newsrooms, boardrooms and the offices of state, Sky News is a politically neutral outlet that has forced the taxpayer-funded BBC to up its game in rolling news. The challenge is to find a system that protects Sky News' independence without forcing so much separation that it puts the channel into financial jeopardy. Murdoch has funded Sky News through nearly 30 years of losses. It has an average weekly reach of 4.4 million viewers, or average share of TV viewing of 0.56 percent, according to BARB ratings for the week ended Jan. 21. It reaches millions more through its online and radio output. In its provisional findings, the competition regulator suggested a system where independent directors form an Editorial Board for Sky News, perhaps appointed by media regulator Ofcom. The Board would appoint the head of Sky News, who would in turn retain editorial control. The regulator has asked interested parties to respond. ""It is a difficult circle to square,"" said a competition lawyer who is familiar with the case. ""It has to be independent enough to still be a viable independent voice, but not so independent that it is left to wither away. ""But it can be done.""
DISNEY DIMENSION
Were the government and regulator to decide that the proposal does not go far enough, they could insist that in order to complete the deal, Fox should spin off or sell Sky News. In 2011, when Murdoch last tried and failed to buy Sky, he offered to put the news outlet into a new company with shares given to existing Sky shareholders. Reviewing the different options, the regulator has noted that Sky News has never previously constituted a standalone business, perhaps indicating its fears about how it would fare. The regulator has also acknowledged that Sky could next year be owned by Disney, a business that doesn't have any news outlets in Britain, meaning its concerns would lapse. Fox is now working on a response and is likely to address the concerns raised by the regulator about its earlier plan, including how the board members would be appointed and whether a majority of independents would be enough. 
Twenty-First Century Fox and Sky declined to comment.
""As long as Fox is willing to submit the right remedies, it will get done,"" said one hedge fund manager with investments in both companies. 
IS PRICE RIGHT?
But the lengthy process has caused agitation among some shareholders, who say Fox should now stump up more than the headline 10.75 pounds per share. 
""Basically, here is Fox being bought-out on 12 times cashflow,"" Crispin Odey, whose hedge fund is a 0.9 percent investor in Sky, said in December. ""If we (Sky shareholders) were being sold on 12 times cashflow we'd be at 12.30 pounds."" 
Activist investor Elliott Management Corp, founded by Paul Singer, has also built a stake in Sky of 1.29 percent. 
One London-based adviser said: ""An effective ring-fencing of Sky News in some form should solve all the concerns of the regulator. Once that is done, Elliott is likely to push for a better price."" 
Media Secretary Matt Hancock has said he will rule on the deal by June 14. 

If approved, it will go to a vote of Sky independent shareholders, paving the way for the 86-year-old Murdoch to finally get his hands on a company he has long coveted.

341,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 06:14AM ET</span>","Sony CEO Hirai to step down, turnaround ally Yoshida to take helm","By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Sony Corp (T:6758) said CEO Kazuo Hirai would be handing over the reins to finance chief Kenichiro Yoshida, while it also hiked its annual profit forecast further to a record that highlights the revival in fortune they have both engineered.
The change in helm, while a major surprise, is expected to go down well with investors who have been pleased with Yoshida's no-nonsense approach to restructuring after he became CFO in 2014.
Once a market leader in consumer electronics, the maker of the Walkman and Trinitron TV fell behind the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in innovation after the release of the iPod in 2001 and then the iPhone in 2007. It then also lost out to more nimble Asian rivals in price competition.
Hirai and Yoshida together streamlined Sony's unprofitable electronics businesses and then capitalised on the spread of smartphones with image sensors.
People familiar with the 58-year old Yoshida describe him as a reserved foil to the more flamboyant ""Kaz"" Hirai, but also a forceful partner who pushed through many controversial changes, including the sale of its Vaio PC division and spinning off its TV business.
Vindicating those measures, Sony quadrupled its profits to mark its best-ever third quarter, helped by robust demand for image sensors as smartphone makers increasingly adopt dual-lens rear cameras, as well as strong sales of gaming software for the PlayStation 4 console.
That prompted the 72-year old company to lift its annual operating profit to 720 billion yen ($6.6 billion) for the year through March, versus a prior forecast of 630 billion yen that would have also been a record high.
Yoshida's next challenge is to make sure Sony keeps up this momentum even after the impact of restructuring and demand for image sensors wear off, analysts said.
""The part where he's still not tested, and we really have to see, is whether or not he can inspire the creative aspect of Sony,"" said Macquarie's Damian Thong. 
""There's a need to inspire a new generation of engineers who are meant to take Sony technology and Sony know-how to create breakthrough products in new markets, and this is the crucial test that he faces,"" Thong added.
Yoshida told a news conference Sony needed to become more competitive globally as it is now dwarfed by rival tech companies in terms of market value. The Japanese firm is worth some $63 billion - less than a tenth of Apple's market capitalisation.
""Market value is not everything but if we do use this yardstick, then the world's biggest companies are all technology companies...As Sony is a tech company, I do feel a sense of urgency about this,"" he said.
Known for imposing discipline and getting the job done, Yoshida had rattled some parts of the company, including its Hollywood studio business.
Leaked emails from a hack at Sony Pictures show the then CEO of Sony Entertainment, Michael Lynton, confiding to studio co-chair Amy Pascal that he was under ""enormous pressure"" after Yoshida sought a review of executives' pay.
Yoshida will be taking on the top job at Sony on April 1, replacing Hirai who has been CEO since 2012. Hirai, 57, will stay on as chairman. 

Sony's stock rose nearly 2 percent on Friday while the broader market was down about a percent.

342,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 06:13AM ET</span>","Strong iPhone prices, cash plans buoy Apple shares after muted outlook","By Pushkala Aripaka and Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - (This Feb. 1 story has been refiled correct to show period is for fiscal second quarter, not first quarter, in paragraph nine.)
Stronger iPhone prices and hints by Apple Inc on Thursday that it could return more than half of its $285 billion in cash to shareholders eased concerns among investors, even as the world's biggest technology company gave a disappointing revenue outlook for the current quarter.
Apple also reported it sold fewer iPhones over the holiday quarter than Wall Street had expected. 
But the revenue outlook for the first three months of 2018 ""was not as bad as some feared,"" said Jun Zhang of Rosenblatt Securities Inc. Apple's comments about plans for its $163 billion in net cash helped boost shares 3.3 percent to $173.48 in after-the-bell trading.
“Over time, we are trying to target a capital structure that is approximately net neutral. We will have approximately the same level of cash and debt on the balance sheet,” Apple's chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, told Reuters in an interview.
“We’re going to take that balance down from $163 billion to zero,"" Maestri said, referring to Apple's current level of cash net of debt.
He did not say whether the reduction in net cash would come in the form of returning capital to shareholders, capital expenditures or acquisitions.
The cash plans are a ""pleasant surprise,"" Brian Colello, an analyst at Morningstar Inc, said. ""This goes a bit against Apple’s historically conservative capital structure.""
Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital Partners and an Apple investor, said the move to a level balance sheet was good news. ""Let's face it, this cash has been doing nothing for us over the last six years,"" he said.
Apple forecast revenue of $60 billion to $62 billion and gross margins of between 38 percent and 38.5 percent for its fiscal second quarter ending in March. Analysts were expecting $65.7 billion in sales and a gross margin of 38.9 percent for the March quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, though some had forecast sales as low as $60 billion.
Thrivent Financial analyst Peter Karazeris said the low revenue forecast had been expected by many analysts and investors following a string of “credible reports” that Apple had cut parts orders.
""I’m happy we’ve gotten the bad news that I was expecting guided into the stock. It was probably a little overbaked,"" he said. ""Now we're focusing on metrics that really matter like free-cash generation and shareholder returns."" Thrivent holds Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Bright spots in the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 30 included average selling prices for the iPhone that topped Wall Street predictions, at $796 versus expectations of $756. The strong prices offset unit sales of iPhones that missed Wall Street expectations, coming in at 77.3 million units versus estimates of 80 million.
“It was really driven by the success of the iPhone X and also the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus,” Maestri told Reuters of the pricing strength. “The new lineup has done incredibly well.""
The company posted revenue of $88.3 billion and profit of $3.89 per share, from $78.4 billion and $3.36 per share a year earlier. The results beat analyst expectations of revenue of $87.3 billion and profits of $3.86 per share.
Apple's services business, which includes Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud, grew 18 percent to $8.4 billion, missing analyst expectations of $8.6 billion. Maestri said the lower services revenue was because the holiday quarter was only 13 weeks rather than 14 weeks.
The services revenue was down slightly from $8.5 billion the quarter before.
""That's something to watch as we roll further into 2018,"" said Miller of Gullane Capital. ""Does that continue to stagnate, or was that a one-time bump in the road?""
Maestri also said Apple's installed base of active devices reached 1.3 billion, 30 percent higher than two years ago and representing an expansion of potential customers for the services business.
Apple said it expected its tax rate for the March quarter to be 15 percent following changes in U.S. tax law. The company said last month it plans to make a one-time tax payment of $38 billion on its overseas cash and has a five-year, $30 billion U.S. capital expenditure plan. 

The company did not say how much of its overseas cash it would bring back to the United States in the short term and gave no new information about its capital return program, which it typically updates each April.

345,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>",China's banking regulator fines 19 banks over $3-billion pledged loan fraud,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's banking regulator has imposed fines of 52.5 million yuan ($8.36-million) on 19 banks in the northwestern province of Shaanxi and the central province of Henan over a 19-billion-yuan ($3-billion) pledged loan fraud, it said on Friday.
It is the third major penalty handed down since the start of the year as the regulator steps up a crackdown on illegal practices to fend off financial risk.
Criminals illegally pledged gold of low purity to obtain loans from banks, including branches of large state lenders Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (SS:601398) (HK:1398) and Postal Savings Bank of China Co (HK:1658), the regulator said.
The findings highlight the lack of internal controls and poor management of loans and collateral at the banks involved, the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) said in an online statement.
""The banks were overly obsessed with pursuing the scale and speed of business development, without knowing their customers,"" it added.
Poor risk assessment and weak legal infrastructure leave Chinese banks suffering from rampant ""ghost collateral"" - security that appears to be on the books, but which, upon closer inspection, is not there or is worth less than it seems.
Last week, the regulator fined 12 lenders after uncovering illegal trading of 7.9 billion yuan of bank bills.
Three PSBC branches involved in the pledged loan fraud were fined 10 million yuan, while four ICBC branches were fined 6.5 million yuan in total, the regulator said.

It also punished 104 bank employees involved in the case, the regulator added.

351,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: How Tesla's first truck charging stations will be built,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, has said little about how he plans to turn his prototype electric truck into reality.
But Reuters has learned that Tesla is collaborating with Anheuser-Busch, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) to build on-site charging terminals at their facilities as part of the automaker's efforts to roll out the vehicle next year.
Details of the partnerships, which have not been disclosed previously, are still being hammered out, but include design and engineering from Tesla, the companies said. They declined to disclose what portion of the building costs, if any, Tesla would pay, or whether Tesla would be compensated for its work.
The firms are among nine major corporations that have placed pre-orders for Tesla's truck, dubbed the Semi.
With questions swirling over whether Tesla can make good on its aggressive timetable, news of the collaboration is a sign that corporate customers are taking the effort seriously, and that Tesla is working to solve one of the biggest impediments: keeping the big-rigs powered.
Companies that spoke with Reuters said the first step is to install charging equipment on their own premises. The Semis would be limited to routes that would get them back to home base before the batteries are spent, the firms said.
PepsiCo, which has reserved 100 Tesla trucks, said it may eventually explore sharing facilities and costs with other companies. The food conglomerate has held multiple meetings with Tesla to discuss the recharging effort, said PepsiCo executive Mike O'Connell.
""We have a lot of in-house capability around energy and engineering ... and certainly Tesla brings their expertise to the table on energy and charging,"" said O'Connell, senior director of supply chain for Frito-Lay North America, PepsiCo's snack-food unit.
Separately, in a high-tech twist on the traditional truck stop, Tesla is moving ahead with plans for its own stations to sell electricity to truckers who pull up for a charge, according to customers and transportation industry executives who have discussed the matter with the Silicon Valley automaker.
Tesla already operates more than 1,100 ""supercharger"" stations globally for drivers of its passenger cars. Musk has spoken publicly of doing something similar for its heavy-duty trucks by installing a network of solar-powered ""megachargers"" that could juice up a Semi battery in 30 minutes.
But just how quickly Tesla could build a robust network of electric filling stations for commercial truckers is not clear. The company is already stretched thin and burning cash. Tesla has struggled to ramp up production of its new Model 3 sedan, which has been plagued by delays. Some analysts and trucking executives doubt that Tesla can deliver the Semi in 2019, much less a vast charging infrastructure to support it.
A Tesla spokeswoman confirmed that the Fremont, California-based company is working closely with large customers to build Semi charging stations. She declined to comment further on the arrangements or Tesla's plans for its own truck-charging terminals.
Anheuser-Busch is evaluating installing its own charging equipment for its 40 Tesla Semis at large breweries and other key locations, according to James Sembrot, senior director of supply chain for the St. Louis-based beer maker.
""What was important to us was to make a big investment in this cutting-edge technology and secure our place in line,"" Sembrot said.
UPS, too, expects to work closely with Tesla on building on-site charging stations, according to Scott Phillippi, global engineering director for the parcel delivery behemoth. The Atlanta-based company pre-ordered 125 Semis in December.
Grocery chain Loblaw Companies Ltd will likely use solar power to juice charging stations for the 25 Semis that it has pre-ordered from Tesla, according to spokeswoman Catherine Thomas. She said Loblaw was considering Tesla as well as ""a few other companies"" for technology and design.
None of the companies would disclose cost estimates for building their own charging infrastructure.
U.S. transit agencies that operate electric buses provide some clues. A ""fast charger"" terminal serving six electric buses would cost $249,000, according to a 2016 report from the California Air Resources Board.
But analysts and automotive industry executives said the price tag for commercial truck facilities could easily reach into the millions of dollars, depending on factors such as the number of big-rigs to be recharged, the energy source for the electricity and existing energy infrastructure in a given area.
AUTOMAKER OR ENERGY SUPPLIER?
Tesla in November unveiled its prototype Semi with the aim of upending the trucking industry. At a splashy event in Hawthorne, California, Musk said the sleek, battery-powered cab could achieve up to 500 miles on a single charge, and be faster, cleaner and cheaper to operate than conventional diesels.
Base prices range from $150,000 to $200,000, according to Tesla's website, compared to $120,000 for a typical diesel. Companies including Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) and  Sysco Corp  (NYSE:SYY) plunked down deposits, getting plenty of public relations mileage in the process.
But Tesla's most obvious potential customers - major U.S. trucking firms - have not jumped on board.
Werner Enterprises Inc, YRC Worldwide Inc, Daseke Inc and Old Dominion Freight Line are among the transport companies holding off pre-orders of the Tesla for now, citing doubts about the Semi's promised recharge time, range, price and payload capabilities.
Derek Leathers, chief executive of Werner, said he is not among the ""naysayer crowd"" that doubts Tesla's ability to produce a viable electric truck.
""I think it'll happen, I just think their timeline is extremely aggressive,"" Leathers said.
Still, a dearth of publicly available charging infrastructure makes electrics impractical for long-haul trucking in the United States and elsewhere.
That is something Tesla's Musk has sought to address with his plans for solar-powered ""megacharger"" stations. But he has provided few specifics. At the November Semi unveiling, Musk said ""we're guaranteeing"" a 7 cents per-kilowatt-hour price for electricity at the facilities.
That is at the low end of cost figures cited by the U.S. government. Solar power for commercial use costs 9-12 cents per kilowatt hour, or 6-8 cents with a federal subsidy, according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
Customers and industry executives said Tesla intends to buy cheap excess solar power off the U.S. energy grid, store it in enormous battery banks, then profit from selling it to drivers of Semis.
But that strategy carries risks, experts said.
""It's a departure from being a vehicle manufacturer to being an energy supplier,"" said Darren Gosbee, vice president of engineering at Navistar International Corp, which is working to launch an electric medium-duty truck by late 2019.
Ian Wright, a Tesla co-founder who now runs his own company making electric powertrains for industrial trucks, is skeptical that truck charging stations can be a big money maker for Tesla.
He estimated the capital costs for batteries alone would be $15 million for a single station.

""I am not seeing any profit in the energy brokering for Tesla,"" said Wright, whose Wrightspeed powertrain venture is based in Alameda, California.

The EURO STOXX 50 slid 0.33%, France’s CAC 40 declined 0.55%, while Germany’s DAX 30 was down 0.70% by 03:40 a.m. ET (07:40 GMT).
Equity markets continued to be pressured lower by climbing bond yields. More specifically, the yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond rallied more 3% for the first time since last May on Thursday, boosted by the Federal Reserve's hawkish policy statement.
Financial stocks were broadly lower, as French lenders  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) declined 0.68% and 0.42%, while Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) tumbled 0.91% and 5.61%.
Deutsche Bank earlier reported a net loss of about €497 million euros for 2017, which was also its third consecutive annual loss.
Among peripheral lenders, Italy's  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) and Unicredit (MI:CRDI) fell 0.32% and 0.26% respectively, while Spanish banks  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) and BBVA (MC:BBVA) slid 0.25% and 0.78%.
Elsewhere, Philips Lighting NV (AS:LIGHT) eased 0.09% even after reported better-than-expected core fourth quarter results.
Infineon Technologies AG NA O.N. (DE:IFXGn) added to losses, with shares down 1.15% after the group on Thursday reported lower than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings.
In London, FTSE 100 slipped 0.16%, weighed by  Vodafone  (LON:VOD), whose shares plummeted 2.92% after the company on Thursday reported a 3.6% slump in fourth-quarter total group revenue, weighed by a stronger euro and the creation of a new joint venture in the Netherlands.
BT Group (LON:BT) wasn't very far behind, as shares lost 2.69% after the firm said costs related to pensions, business rates and its investments weighed on third-quarter profits, but left its full year guidance unchanged.
In the financial sector, stocks were also broadly lower. Lloyds Banking (LON:LLOY) eased 0.09% and  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) fell 0.23%, while  Barclays  (LON:BARC) dropped 0.59% and the Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) tumbled 1.41%.
Meanwhile, Capita PLC (LON:CPI) bounced back from recent losses to become one of the top performers of the index on Friday, with shares surging 7.43%.
Capita shares had plummeted after the company on Wednesday issued a profit warning for 2018 and its new Chief Executive Jonathan Lewis declared the group “too complex”, “driven by a short-term focus” and “lacking operational discipline and financial flexibility”.
Mining stocks were also mostly higher, as BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) rose 0.33% and  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) climbed 0.52%, while rival group  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) jumped 1.15%.
In the U.S., equity markets pointed to a mixed open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.42% drop, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.36% slide, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.22% fall."
354,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>",Police launch criminal investigation into tire maker Nokian,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finnish police plan to launch a criminal investigation into options trading at Nokian Tyres stemming from manipulated product tests, darkening the mood after the company reported rising quarterly profit on Friday.
The police action follows lengthy investigations by the country's financial watchdog after Nokian said in 2016 that it had supplied special high-quality tires for tests by motoring journalists, leading to stronger test scores that helped garner good publicity.
The watchdog had asked the police to investigate whether Nokian misused insider information or breached disclosure laws.
In 2016, shares in the company fell after it admitted the use of high quality tires in tests. Daily Helsingin Sanomat later reported that some members of the company's management team had sold options before it went public about the issue.
""The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) has opened a criminal investigation into suspected securities market offences related to tyres manufactured by Nokian Tyres plc and the tyre test results in different magazines,"" the police said in a statement on Friday.
The company's view is that no crime had occurred, a spokesman told Reuters.
""It is good that the matter will be resolved,"" he said.
Nokian shares fell 6.8 percent in early trade on Friday.
Nokian Tyres has said the use of special tyres happened in the past but they have discontinued the practice and that their tests in its main markets have been reliable for years.
It had launched an internal investigation into the matter in October 2015, and the reported option trades took place in October and November 2015, before the company went public with the past practices.
Nokian earlier on Friday said its fourth-quarter operating profit rose 13 percent from a year earlier and that it expected growing sales and profits for this year.

A 5 percent drop in shares of the German lender and losses in most sectors dragged the pan-European STOXX 600 index down 0.4 percent by 0810 GMT, set for its fifth straight session of declines. Germany's DAX fell 0.8 percent and the UK's FTSE dropped 0.4 percent.
The STOXX is down 2.2 percent so far this week, its biggest weekly loss since August, as rising bond yields on expectations of tighter monetary policy and a strengthening euro weighed.
The banking sector, which benefited at the start of the year from a rotation into cyclical stocks, fell 0.5 percent, also weighed down by a 3.5 percent drop in Spain's Caixabank after its quarterly update. 
Nokian Tyres fell 4.9 percent following weak Russian sales figures, while AstraZeneca declined 1.6 percent after the drugmaker predicted an increase in 2018 drug sales at a low single-digit percentage rate.

Capita was the biggest gainer on the STOXX, up 6.6 percent, as the British outsourcer rebounded from heavy losses that followed its profit warning on Wednesday.

357,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 03:31AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank reports third consecutive annual loss,"By Tom Sims and Arno Schuetze
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) on Friday posted its third consecutive annual loss in 2017, taking a hit from challenging markets, a drop in investment bank revenue and a U.S. tax reform, after a difficult fourth quarter. 
The worse-than-expected results are likely to increase pressure on Chief Executive John Cryan to turn Germany's biggest bank around.
""We believe we are firmly on the path to producing growth and higher returns with sustained discipline on costs and risks,"" Chief Executive John Cryan said in a statement. ""We have made progress, but we are not yet satisfied with our results.""
Investors have called on Cryan to cut costs, but the bank said it anticipated costs in 2018 of 23 billion euros, higher than a previously targeted 22 billion. 
Last March Deutsche announced an overhaul that includes the integration of its Postbank retail bank unit with its own in-house Deutsche Bank-branded consumer bank, as well as the partial sale of its asset management unit.
On Friday it said the integration with Postbank was ""on schedule"" and that it would partially float its asset management unit ""in the earliest available window"".
Still, the bank's executives have warned that a recovery would be a long, hard slog that would take years, not quarters.
Continued weak performance at the bank has prompted some investors to question whether Cryan should be given more time to turn around the bank, after less than three years as CEO.
It reported a 2017 loss of 497 million euros ($621 million), worse than the loss of 290 million forecast by nine banks and brokerages polled by Reuters. 
U.S. tax reforms prompted a non-cash tax charge of 1.4 billion euros, pushing the bank into a full-year loss.
In the fourth quarter, its net loss widened to 2.19 billion euros from 1.89 billion a year earlier and revenue slumped 19 percent to 5.7 billion euros.
Analysts had forecast a loss of 1.95 billion euros on revenue of 6.2 billion.
Its cash-cow bond-trading division saw revenue tumble 29 percent due to lower client activity in less volatile markets. Competitors saw similar declines.
The bank's shares opened down 4.8 percent on Friday.
During his tenure, Cryan has stabilized the bank, raised capital, designed an overhaul, confronted legal challenges and managed the demands of greater regulation.
But shareholders are now airing their impatience. Hendrik Leber, a fund manager with Acatis, said he liked Cryan personally. ""But I don't know which direction Deutsche Bank is heading toward,"" he said. 
""With UBS, the direction was clear with its big restructuring,"" Leber said. ""I'm not seeing a clear strategy with Deutsche Bank.""
Recently, the bank has been the focus of national debate over its intention to resume bonuses despite its full-year loss. Earlier this week, government spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters: ""Company management must of course ask what impression it leaves in public.""
Compensation at the investment bank rose 45 percent in the fourth quarter to 1.29 billion euros.
Deutsche Bank has become a major player on Wall Street over the past two decades but misguided bets and poor conduct have resulted in a litigation bill of 15 billion euros ($17.6 billion) since 2009. Legal battles have ranged from its role in the marketing of U.S. mortgage-backed securities to a so-called ""mirror trading"" scheme that could be used for money laundering.
Last year, a looming $14 billion fine from the U.S. Department of Justice had unsettled clients and investors and prompted talk of a government bailout. 
On Thursday, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said it issued an order settling charges against Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, a unit of the bank, for attempted manipulation of the ISDAFIX benchmark and requiring the firm to pay a $70 million civil penalty.

360,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>","Apple's user base grows, but analysts probe for more detail","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - In its quarterly earnings report on Thursday, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) gave the first update in two years on what it calls its active installed base, the number of major products such as iPhones, iPads and Macs in use in the world. Apple said the base expanded 30 percent from two years ago to 1.3 billion.
That increase should have been seen as positive because Apple aims to become less dependent on selling iPhones and shift to selling its existing customers services like Apple Music or add-on devices like the Apple Watch or AirPods.
But analysts voiced skepticism. Apple's best-selling product, the iPhone, has seen relatively flat unit sales over the same two-year period. On Apple's earnings conference call, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said that the combination of trends implies users are hanging on to their devices longer, and he asked Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook whether investors should be worried about that.
Cook responded that it was up to investors to decide what to focus on, but said he was comfortable with customers buying used iPhones. 
When customers sell their old iPhone for a new one, the old iPhone ""winds up with another customer somewhere else that is perfectly fine with having a previously owned iPhone. And so I view all of that to be incredibly positive. It's more people on iPhones, the better,"" Cook said.
Laura Martin of Needham & Co pressed Cook on whether the larger device base meant more devices per user, or more users - an important question, because a user with both an iPad and iPhone is likely to only purchase one Apple Music subscription, for example.
Cook said ""there are many, many, many more"" Apple users than two years ago but declined to give an actual figure.
The signals on how well Apple is monetizing users were mixed. Sales of its ""wearable"" accessories - Beats headphones, AirPods and the Apple Watch - were up 70 percent year-over-year in the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 30. But services revenue - which includes Apple Music, iCloud and the App Store - fell short of analysts' expectations for the December quarter, at $8.4 billion, and was down slightly from the previous quarter.
Apple has yet to disclose plans for how it will distribute the television shows in which it has been investing in recent months, which could become a large business.

""They've been building up the services business for several years, knowing full well that at some point the gravy train on smart phones is going to end,"" said Bob O'Donnell, head of Technalysis Research.

361,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 02:11AM ET</span>",German industrial workers stage third day of full-day strikes,"By Maria Sheahan
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Industrial workers in Germany started a third day of 24-hour strikes over pay and working hours on Friday, downing their tools at companies including carmakers Mercedes-Benz and Porsche and airplane maker Airbus (PA:AIR).
The full-day walkouts, which are due to end late on Friday, are labor union IG Metall's last warning shot before votes are cast on whether to take extended industrial action that could cost German companies hundreds of millions of euros in lost production.
Both the union and employers have said they are open to resuming talks on Monday next week, but they have each insisted that the other side show more willingness to make concessions.
Citing Germany's fastest economic growth in six years and record low unemployment, IG Metall is demanding an 8 percent pay rise over 27 months for 3.9 million metal and engineering workers across Europe's largest economy.
The union has also asked for workers to be given the right to reduce their weekly hours to 28 from 35 to care for children, elderly or sick relatives, and to be able to return to full time after two years.
This is IG Metall's first major push for a change in hours since workers staged seven weeks of strikes in 1984 to help secure a cut of the working week to 35 from 40 hours.
Employers have offered a 6.8 percent wage increase, but rejected the demand for shorter hours unless they can also increase workers' hours when necessary.
They have also dismissed the idea that they should make up some of the pay shortfall for workers who cut their hours.
Nearly 200,000 workers at more than 100 companies including truckmaker MAN and carmaker Ford (N:F) staged rolling 24-hour strikes on Wednesday and Thursday, according to IG Metall.
By the end of Friday, that number is expected to rise to around 260 companies.
The DIW economic institute has estimated the strikes could cost companies a total of 62 million euros ($77 million) a day in lost revenue, assuming around 50,000 workers, or on average 200 per company, stop working for one day each.
In a separate dispute, IG Metall has also threatened to cripple car production at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) if top executives continue to block noticeable pay increases for German staff at Europe's biggest carmaker.
After three rounds of fruitless bargaining, more than 20,000 workers at VW's core Wolfsburg factory had walked off their shifts for two hours on Thursday, staging the first warning strikes at VW since 2004. [nL8N1PR5GD]

The results of the second EU-wide stress test showed the system could cope with several users of clearing houses, such as banks, defaulting at the same time coupled with extreme market shocks, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said in a statement.
An aim of the test is to see if a collapse of one clearing house could trigger a domino effect across the system.
On an individual basis, Spain's BME Clearing showed a minor shortfall of required pre-funded resources under one aspect of the test, ESMA said.
ESMA said the shortfall at BME Clearing had no systemic impact.
ICE Clear Europe's pre-funded resources would be enough, but these would only marginally cover the simulated stress losses, ESMA added.
Clearing houses are backed by pre-funded default funds and stand between two sides of a stock, bond or derivatives trade, ensuring its completion even if one side of the transaction goes bust.
ESMA tested 16 European clearing houses with 900 members such as banks, and holding a total of 270 billion euros in default fund contributions and cash for backing trades.
ESMA Chair Steven Maijoor said that compared with the first stress test in 2016, the latest health check was broadened out.
""The expansion of the stress test to include liquidity risk in addition to counterparty credit risk has provided added reassurance on their resilience,"" Maijoor said.
This liquidity part of the test did not detect any major systemic risk concerns, ESMA said.
The watchdog said it was considering whether it should make any recommendations following the stress test results.

By John Revill and Michael Shields
ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss private bank PKB Privatbank SA Lugano committed serious breaches of money laundering regulations in business linked to Brazilian groups Petrobras and Odebrecht, the Swiss financial watchdog FINMA said on Thursday.
Switzerland's attorney general said it had launched criminal proceedings against the bank for failing to prevent possible crimes being committed.
The Financial Market Supervisory Authority said it had ""ordered the disgorgement of 1.3 million Swiss francs ($1.4 million) in unlawfully generated profits and will appoint an external auditor to supervise the measures taken."" 
FINMA has investigated more than a dozen Swiss banks in relation to the Petrobras and Odebrecht cases and launched four enforcement proceedings, one of which is pending.
PKB said in a statement the FINMA decision would have no impact on the smooth functioning of the bank. It also said it was cooperating with the authorities on the issue, which it said involved one individual who abused the bank's trust.
The OAG said in a statement it had opened a criminal investigation into PKB, following disclosures made by the bank, confirming a story that appeared in the online edition of Swiss newspaper Luzerner Zeitung.
The investigation, launched on Jan. 12, was also based on findings from the OAG's own inquiry into suspected money laundering related to Petrobras and Odebrecht.
The OAG said it suspected deficiencies in the internal organization of the bank, which meant it could not prevent possible crimes being committed.
A company can be prosecuted under Swiss law if it has not taken necessary measures to prevent crimes, like money laundering or corruption, being committed.
The OAG said it had requested a copy of FINMA's decision.
Regarding the OAG's actions, PKB spokesman Pascal Dubey said the bank had approached the authorities in the first place.
""We have fully recognized there was an issue which is why we went to the authorities,"" he said, adding that the bank was seeking to close the matter.
""There was one issue with one employee who abused our trust. FINMA has recognized that we have done everything we could after the situation came to light and that is why we have no restrictions on our activities,"" he added.
More than 100 powerful politicians and businessmen have been convicted in connection with an investigation focused on political kickbacks and money laundering at Petrobras and construction firms, such as Odebrecht, that paid billions in bribes to politically appointed former Petrobras executives.
Petrobras says it was a victim of corrupt individuals, and Brazilian prosecutors have recovered and returned more than $470 million to the oil firm's coffers so far. 
Odebrecht signed a deal with U.S., Brazilian and Swiss officials and has been fined. It admitted to carrying out bribery and a series of other corrupt acts, mostly in Latin America and Africa.

371,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 10:26PM ET</span>",Eyes on China at Singapore aviation gathering amid industry consolidation,"By Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Strong airline profits and higher defense spending have boosted the outlook for aerospace firms gathering for next week's Singapore Airshow, but after a surge of activity in 2017 the event is expected to produce few big-ticket deals.
The biennial show, the largest in Asia, will bring together buyers and sellers against the backdrop of China's attempt to play a bigger role in a realigning global aerospace industry. 
The Chinese push into the commercial jet and military drone markets comes amid regional insecurity in Southeast Asia over its rising power while the United States is retreating toward ""America First"" oriented policies. 
China was looking to get a leg up in commercial jet technology through a deal with Bombardier Inc over the advanced C Series last year, but the Canadian company instead chose to partner with Airbus SE.
The Airbus-Boeing duopoly could be further solidified if Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Brazil's Embraer SA agree to a tie-up that could involve their commercial and defense divisions.
China, with its narrow-body C919, is not the only country trying to carve out space in the tightly controlled commercial market. Russia's Irkut MC-21 and Japan's Mitsubishi Regional Jet are also seeking to become serious competitors, and will be represented at the airshow like their Chinese rival. 
But all three projects have faced delays, and significant question marks remain over whether any will gain a solid order base outside their home markets.
The C919, which has received 785 orders to date, looks the strongest because of its backing by Chinese airlines and lessors, said DVB Bank head of aviation research Bert van Leeuwen. 
""They have the market, the money and the ambitions,"" he said of China.
FASTEST GROWING AVIATION MARKET
Manufacturers are targeting the Asia-Pacific region for product sales and services because it is the world's fastest growing aviation market.
Airbus and Boeing are sending the heads of their services divisions to Singapore as they look to increase their presence in the maintenance, repair and operations industry.
But on the sales side, a final push late last year by legendary Airbus commercial sales head John Leahy before he retired has pulled orders forward and is expected to result in a weak start to the year. 
""I'm not expecting much,"" DVB Bank's van Leeuwen said of Singapore Airshow orders. ""I wouldn't be disappointed if there are few orders or if the whole year in 2018 doesn't bring many orders because this is an industry where there is an eight-year backlog of production.""
The buzz around product launches - a big sales driver at airshows - is expected to be missing at the Singapore event as Boeing's keenly watched decision on introducing a potential new mid-market airplane is not expected until later in 2018. 
BIG AIR FORCE BUDGETS
On the military side, Southeast Asian countries are bolstering their air forces amid insecurity over China's rise and its increasingly assertive stance in the South China Sea. 
The Republic of Singapore Air Force, Southeast Asia's biggest spender and a potential future  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) F-35 customer, celebrates its 50th anniversary this year and will launch the festivities at the airshow.
North Korea's ballistic missile program and potential internal instability in some Southeast Asian countries are also lifting budgets, although in other cases political events, such as an upcoming election in Malaysia, could push back buying decisions.
China's Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group will be displaying two versions of its Wing Loong reconnaissance and strike drones at the show in hopes of penetrating the Asian market. However, it may be too early for Chinese products to gain much traction at a time when the Trump administration is calling on military attaches and diplomats to boost U.S. arms sales.
The United States is, for the first time in years, sending its diplomat responsible for foreign military sales to the Singapore Airshow to promote U.S.-made weapons as part of a new ""Buy American"" initiative, a U.S. official said on Thursday.
""I think few countries are going to buy much from China,"" said Richard Bitzinger, a senior fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.

""Partly it is a reliability thing and partly it is 'if you really want to keep the United States engaged, you buy their weapons systems'. In a sense it is still the U.S.'s market to lose.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP President Tony James said on Thursday the future of the Thomson Reuters Financial and Risk business is in selling data, not in selling terminal desktop products to traders, bankers and investors.
""We're big believers in data and that's certainly a driver behind the Thomson Reuters business,"" James said in a call with analysts after Blackstone's fourth-quarter earnings, when asked how the firm was looking at opportunities in data technology and how it might expand its expertise in that area. 
""The most valuable part of that business by far is the data part. The terminals are the legacy business for which people think of them but that's not where the future of that company is,"" said James, without giving any further details.
Blackstone this week agreed to buy a majority stake in Thomson Reuters Corp's F&R division, putting the U.S. private equity firm at the heart of Wall Street's financial information industry, where Thomson Reuters competes against privately-held Bloomberg in providing bankers and investors with news, data and analytics.
In an interview after Reuters published James' comments, Martin Brand, the Blackstone executive who led the acquisition of the Thomson Reuters F&R unit, said that Blackstone wanted to improve all parts of that business, including the Eikon platform, F&R's flagship desktop product.
“The data feeds are faster growing. At the same time, we’re fully committed to investing significantly behind Eikon and view it as a business we’re excited about,” he said.

376,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 08:52PM ET</span>","Amazon posts largest profit in its history on sales, tax boost","By Jeffrey Dastin and Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday reported a profit near $2 billion, the largest in its history, as the online retailer drew millions of new customers to its Prime fast-shipping club for the holiday season and as changes to U.S. tax law added to its bottom line.
Shares rose more than 6 percent in extended trading, after previously closing down 4 percent on the Nasdaq.
Seattle-based Amazon is using fast shipping, television shows exclusive to its website and forays into new technology, such as its voice-controlled Alexa devices, to attract high-spending Prime members. Amazon said price cuts at Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM), which it acquired for $13.7 billion last year, are helping it win grocery sales, too.
The world's largest online retailer said net income more than doubled to $1.86 billion, or $3.75 per share in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. Its profit received a provisional $789 million boost from the U.S. Republican tax bill passed in December. Analysts on average were expecting just $1.85 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. (http://tmsnrt.rs/24gibla)
""This was another blow-out quarter for Amazon,"" said GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives. ""The retail strength was eye-popping as the company had a banner holiday season and looked to capture roughly 50 percent of all e-commerce holiday season sales.""
As expected, the period running from before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday through New Years was Amazon's biggest-ever by revenue. Sales rose 38 percent to $60.5 billion in the quarter, beating estimates.
The company's fast delivery, like its two-hour Prime Now service, has helped win over holiday shoppers eager to avoid the crowds of big box retailers. Prime saw more than 4 million sign-ups in one week alone last quarter, and revenue from subscription fees grew 49 percent to $3.2 billion, Amazon said.
That figure is expected to rise this quarter in part because the company recently raised the fee for month-to-month Prime plans, affecting some 30 percent of subscribers, according to analysts at Cowen & Co. Some 60 million, or close to half of all U.S. households, are estimated to have Prime subscriptions.
Advertising and other revenue rose 62 percent to $1.74 billion.
Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, said on a call with analysts that advertising was ""a key contributor"" to the company's growing profit margin. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google on Thursday reported ad revenue of $27.2 billion by comparison.
Perhaps the surprise star of the past quarter was Amazon's voice aide Alexa, embedded in the company's Echo speakers and Fire TV players, as well as some cars and house gadgets. Millions of Amazon customers ordered goods by voice with Alexa in the past year, said Olsavsky on a separate call with reporters.
""Our 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,"" added Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive, in a statement. ""We don’t see positive surprises of this magnitude very often — expect us to double down.""
HEAVY SPENDING
Amazon's stock has outperformed the S&P 500, rising almost 50 percent since the start of the fourth quarter to Thursday's close, compared with the S&P's 12 percent rise.
Its shares trade at a premium to those of many peers. The stock's price-to-earnings ratio is nearly 12 times that of cloud computing rival  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), for instance.
Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is dueling with Microsoft to handle data and computing for large enterprises, saw its profit margin expand from the third quarter.
This was a ""sign of platform strength despite increasing competition,"" said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian in a research note.
AWS posted a 45 percent rise in sales to $5.1 billion.
Amazon said it expects operating profit in the current quarter of between $300 million and $1 billion. Analysts were expecting $1.5 billion, according to analytics firm FactSet.
Olsavsky, Amazon's CFO, told reporters, ""We’re still in heavy investment mode.""
The company has become notorious for running on a low profit margin. Yet its big bets on new services and entry into new industries have reaped shareholders rewards over the past decade, including its founder Bezos, now the richest man in the world.
Amazon continues to spend on a wide array of areas. It is expanding its retail footprint outside the United States, particularly in India, and almost doubled its international operating loss to $919 million in the fourth quarter. Amazon's global headcount is up 66 percent from a year ago at 566,000 full-time and part-time employees, thanks to a hiring spree and an influx of workers from Whole Foods Market.
And earlier this week, it announced a partnership with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc to determine how to cut health costs for hundreds of thousands of their employees.
The company said it plans to spend more on video content this year as well, with a prequel television series to ""The Lord of the Rings"" in the works. Analysts estimate Amazon spent $4.5 billion or more in 2017.

""Revenue and margins vastly exceeded expectations, and cost control was impressive, so that's what people are focused on,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter, adding, ""It's clear that they will spend a lot more in 2018.""

377,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>",Western banks make push into Japanese dealmaking as fee pool hits record,"By Sumeet Chatterjee, Anshuman Daga and Thomas Wilson
HONG KONG/SINGAPORE/TOKYO (Reuters) - Western banks are bulking up in Japan, attracted by record investment banking fees and expectations of a rise in dealmaking as cashed-up companies in the world's third-largest economy step up their hunt for overseas targets.
Banks including  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) are among those looking to improve their share of a market dominated by local banks and a handful of entrenched internationals, including  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C).
While Tokyo used to be bankers' first stop in Asia, its attractions have paled over the past decade compared with its great rival China, which accounts for the biggest share of the Asia Pacific investment banking fee pool. 
But interest is picking up again in the wake of blockbuster deals including Toshiba's $18 billion sale of its chip business to Bain Capital last year, SoftBank's mooted $18 billion float of its telecoms business, and Fujifilm Holdings' planned $6.1 billion takeover of  Xerox Corp  (NYSE:XRX).
Bankers and headhunters estimate foreign investment banking headcount will rise as much as 15 percent this year in Japan. 
""People have been somewhat caught by surprise by the level of strategic activity from Japanese companies over the past couple of years,"" said Richard Gibb, Deutsche Bank's head of corporate finance in Asia Pacific. 
Last year, Japanese investment banking fees - covering M&A, equity and debt markets deals, and loans - rose 51 percent to a record $5.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.
""There will continue to be a restructuring of corporate Japan, and on the back of this there will likely be both substantial acquisitions and divestitures,"" said Gibb.
Fees from Japanese work constitute the second-largest pool of investment banking revenues in Asia. While the $2.5 billion earned from M&A and equity deals last year may look small compared with $5.3 billion paid by Chinese companies, bankers say Japan is still one of the most lucrative markets. 
""Compared to domestic deals, fee levels for outbound deals have been relatively high and will likely expand along with deal size,"" said Koichiro Doi, head of Japan M&A at JPMorgan.
Fees for Japanese IPOs can reach 4 percent of the total raised versus at best an average of about 2 percent in Hong Kong. Japanese M&A deals can also offer fees of 2 percent - much higher than in China and Southeast Asia, according to bankers.
""A shrinking domestic market stemming from a declining population has created a sense of urgency to pursue outbound acquisitions to capture new markets, new products as well as access to innovation,"" Doi said.
TEA CEREMONIES
Japan's investment banking fee ranking is dominated by local houses such as Mizuho, Nomura and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), but they have been losing market share to foreign rivals.
MUFG operates a joint venture with Morgan Stanley, allowing it to combine its sizeable domestic lending book with the Wall Street bank's global reach.
MUFG's share of investment banking fee pool dropped from 13.5 percent in 2008 to 8 percent last year, while Nomura saw a decline of five percentage points to 11 percent last year, the Thomson Reuters data showed. 
The share of top five foreign banks in the total investment banking fee league table, meanwhile, has rise from 17 percent in 2008 to 19 percent last year, led by Morgan Stanley, Goldman and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
International banks are focusing on the rising number of cross-border deals and private equity transactions, both of which tend to offer more opportunity for foreign involvement.
""PE funds, particularly large global funds, have been quite active in the Japan market in recent years,"" said Koichi Ito, Credit Suisse's head of Japan investment banking and capital markets. ""They are now increasingly focused on not only buying companies but also on exiting their investments through a sale or IPO."" 
Deutsche Bank recently hired a head of financial sponsors coverage in Japan and is looking to bring on board a new head for covering financial institutions - Japanese banks and insurers are particularly active overseas. 
Tim Eustace, a headhunter at Next Step in Tokyo, said more senior hiring was going on.
""Some European banks are very interested in rebuilding their financial sponsor coverage area, and they would be looking to hire at the senior associate to junior director level.""
Banks are also encouraged by signs that traditional Japanese companies are now more willing to break with ""keiretsu"" networks - where groups of businesses share close ties including banks and advisers.
In a rare move, Takeda Pharmaceutical's $5.2 billion acquisition of U.S.-based Ariad Pharmaceuticals did not involve any Japanese bank on the advisory side. The work instead went to Evercore Partners, JPMorgan, Goldman, and Lazard.
Foreign banks also prize the ability to build relationships with Japanese clients. 

""It's not easy to break into a Japanese company if you are a foreign entity, but once you have done that - after attending quite a few tea ceremonies - they are very loyal and they reward quality advice, which is not common in this region,"" said the head of regional investment banking at an European bank.

378,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 08:01PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. steel executives urge Trump to curb steel imports,"By David Lawder and Lesley Wroughton
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executives of top American steel companies and related groups urged President Donald Trump on Thursday to urgently impose trade measures to curb excess steel capacity and surging imports they say are undermining the U.S. industry.
A letter, sent to the White House and Congress by the American Iron and Steel Institute and the Steel Manufacturers Association, called on Trump to immediately act under the rarely used ""Section 232"" of a 1962 U.S. trade law, which allows for restrictions to protect national security.
""We urge you to implement a remedy that is comprehensive and broad based, covering all major sources of steel imports and the full range of steel products, with only limited exceptions for
products not currently available in the United States,""
according to the letter seen by Reuters.
Companies that signed the letter included Alton Steel, AK Steel Corp (N:AKS), Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (N:CLF), TimkenSteel Corp (N:TKR),  Nucor  Corp (N:NUE), and ArcelorMittal USA (AS:MT).
The letter was the second in five months from the steel industry to Trump, who promised in his presidential campaign to protect American steelworkers from imports and ordered an investigation last April of foreign steel imports under Section 232.
The results of the investigation were handed to Trump on Jan. 11, 2018. He has 90 days to respond.
A U.S. administration official said the White House was ""aware of the needs and concerns of stakeholders.""
""The president has 90 days to make his decision and we will announce that decision at the appropriate time,"" the official told Reuters.
Forcing a reduction of excess production in China, which now supplies half the world’s steel, is a key goal of any potential restrictions. 
The United States, the world's biggest steep importer, and China have long been at odds over how to combat excess capacity in the global steel sector. China has argued that it has done its bit to tackle the problem by cutting capacity.
'WAIT-AND-SEE APPROACH'
Philip Bell, president of the Steel Manufacturers Association, said there was optimism that Trump would come up with effective measures following his decision on Jan. 22 to slap tariffs on imported washers and solar panels.
""I confident he will come up with a remedy that is effective and he still has 70 days to review it and make a decision,"" Bell told Reuters. ""We will have to take a wait-and-see approach, but it is clear the steel industry continues to be challenged and that 232 action sooner rather than later is important.""
The letter underscored that despite the threat of trade actions, imports continue to swamp the U.S. market. In June 2017, steel imports hit their highest monthly total in more than two years by capturing 30 percent of the U.S. market, the letter said.
Efforts to address global excess capacity through international consultations and groups such as the G20 and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development had failed, the letter added. 
The European Union has warned it will retaliate if European steelmakers suffer collateral damage from import restrictions under the Section 232 investigation.

While the measure would mainly target China, NATO allies like Britain have expressed concern because the two countries have traded steel for military purposes.

379,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 07:04PM ET</span>",Alphabet's earnings miss profit estimates as spending grows,"By Paresh Dave and Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc missed quarterly profit forecasts as steady ad sales growth was offset by increased spending to promote its consumer gadgets, YouTube video app and cloud computing services, the U.S. technology company said on Thursday.
Shares of Alphabet dipped more than 5 percent after-hours, before steadying with a 2.7 percent loss at $1,149.93.
Though growing demand for pricey ads on mobile apps has kept Google's core ad business surging, the company has moved aggressively to maintain dominance and diversify sales. Expenses jumped 27 percent to $24.7 billion in the fourth quarter from the year-earlier period.
Google bought ads during major sports events to market its new Pixel 2 smartphone and YouTube television service. It slashed prices on other hardware in the race to get online search and media streaming devices into people's homes. Google continued to quickly add staff to its enterprise sales unit.
A growing portion of revenue has been spent on having the Google search engine set as the default option on products and services such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's iPhone and Mozilla's Firefox browser. 
Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat told analysts in a post-earnings conference call that higher marketing costs coincided with holidays and that payments to partners such as Apple and Mozilla would steady in coming quarters.
Investments are paying off, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said, noting that cloud computing is generating $1 billion in quarterly sales. He said Google's G Suite workplace software package had doubled its customers to 4 million in two years, as Reuters first reported earlier on Thursday.
Financial analysts looked past the spending.
""Overall, it was a good quarter. Advertising revenue is still up significantly,"" Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners said in an email.
Fourth-quarter sales increased 24 percent to $32.3 billion, above the average analysts' estimate of $31.9 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Adjusted quarterly profit of $6.8 billion, or $9.70 per share, missed estimates of $7 billion, or $10 per share.
The profit figure excludes a $9.9 billion tax charge as Alphabet joined much of corporate America in reporting large one-time expenses in the fourth quarter due to U.S. legislation enacted in December that lowers corporate rates. 
The tax law has given companies more affordable access to overseas profits, and Porat said Alphabet would make a ""modest increase"" in share buybacks with an additional allocation of $8.6 billion.
The growing use of smartphones worldwide has been a bonanza for social media company  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Google, which research firm EMarketer estimates together account for nearly 60 percent of mobile ad sales. 
Google sells ad space on its search engine, its fast-growing YouTube video streaming service and a network of third-party websites and apps.
The company's computer algorithms have become more effective at delivering mobile ads likely to make customers sit through commercials, install an app or visit a website.
Led by such ads, Alphabet generated $110.9 billion in full-year revenue, up 23 percent from 2016 and topping $100 billion for the first time. Profit fell 35 percent to $12.6 billion because of the tax bill and a separate charge last summer for a $2.7 billion European Union antitrust fine, which is under appeal.
""The company's continued strong top-line growth and myriad new opportunities to drive future growth remain the keys to the stock,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson said in an email.
Alphabet is attempting to maintain sales growth through new businesses, experimenting with operating a fleet of self-driving taxis through Waymo and licensing medical technology at Verily.
Non-advertising revenue from Google combined with revenue from Verily and the other Alphabet companies was $15.5 billion in 2017, accounting for about 14 percent of total revenue, compared to $10.9 billion, or 12 percent, in 2016.
Alphabet also said on Thursday that veteran board member John Hennessy took over as chairman the day before from Eric Schmidt, a long-time Google executive who will remain a board member and technical adviser. 
The potential for further regulation on privacy, monopolistic business practices or content vetting is among investors' top concerns about tech companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) that are tapping their unrivaled consumer behavior data to branch beyond their core businesses. 

MKM Partners analyst Rob Sanderson said in a note to clients last month that Google had ""the most unrecognized value"" of big publicly traded tech companies despite some concerns about regulatory issues.

""Our outlook for the fiscal second quarter net revenue growth remains a couple of points below the full year rate,"" Chief Financial Officer Vasant Prabhu added.
Net income rose to $2.52 billion in the first quarter ended Dec. 31 from $2.07 billion a year earlier, while earnings per Class A share rose to $1.07 from 86 cents. 
The payment processor recorded a gain of $1.13 billion related to the new U.S. tax law and a charge of $1.15 billion tied to the repatriation of funds held overseas.
Excluding items, Visa earned $1.08 per share. Analysts on average expected 99 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Total operating revenue rose 9 percent to $4.86 billion, reflecting growth in payments volume and processed transactions.
Operating expenses rose 12.8 percent to $1.54 billion and Visa said it expects expenses to rise in the second quarter as well.
Payment volumes rose about 10 percent to $1.93 trillion, on a constant dollar basis, with the United States accounting for about 43.3 percent of the total.
Cross-border volumes – the value of transactions made outside of the United States – increased 9 percent, on a similar measure.
Visa said it would repurchase $7.5 billion of its stock and it has $9.1 billion of funds available for share buybacks.
Earlier in the day, Mastercard (N:MA) reported a 20.2 percent jump in quarterly revenue.

381,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 06:33PM ET</span>","Mattel reports surprise loss for holiday period, shares sink","(Reuters) -  Mattel Inc  (O:MAT) reported a surprise loss for the holiday quarter on Thursday, as the toy maker faced weak demand for key brands including Fisher-Price and as the effect of the collapse of Toys ""R"" Us lingered.
Shares of the biggest U.S. toy maker fell 7.3 percent to $14.20 in after-hours trading.
Mattel reported a net loss of $281.3 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, hurt by a one-time, $457-million charge related to new U.S. tax laws.
Excluding one-time items, Mattel reported a loss of 72 cents per share, while analysts on average had expected earnings of 17 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
El Segundo, California-based Mattel has faced weak demand in recent years for its most well-known products including Hot Wheels and Barbie as children increasingly prefer videogames and electronics over traditional toys. The company's stock fell 44 percent last year.
The September bankruptcy of major toy retailer Toys ""R"" Us, while highlighting the struggles facing the industry, heaped more pressure on Mattel and other toy makers to find other outlets for sales. In response, Mattel scrapped its dividend payout to free up cash.
Sales in the company's construction, arts and crafts unit that includes Lego competitor Mega Blocks sank 25 percent in the holiday quarter, while sales from Fisher-Price toys dipped 12 percent.
Mattel's gross margin — gross profit as a percentage of revenue — fell to 32 percent from 47 percent in the year-earlier quarter, as advertising costs shot up 18 percent.
Mattel has attracted takeover bids from rival  Hasbro Inc  (O:HAS), which it has snubbed.
Hasbro has fared better after snagging the rights to sell toys modeled on  Disney  princesses, when Mattel's Disney (N:DIS) contract expired last year.
The two toy makers have also been competing for lucrative contracts with Hollywood studios in the past few years as demand for traditional toys falls.
Still, Mattel's Barbie made a comeback in the holiday period as sales from the iconic brand rose 9 percent after four quarters of declines.
Efforts to revitalize the line of dolls, including changes to skin tones and adding plus-sized and hijab-wearing models appeared to be paying off.

Mattel's net revenue fell 12.1 percent to $1.61 billion, missing analysts' average estimate of $1.69 billion.

383,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 06:00PM ET</span>","CBS, Viacom form special committees to explore merger","By Jessica Toonkel
(Reuters) - CBS Corp (N:CBS) and Viacom Inc (O:VIAB) have formed special committees to explore a merger, the companies said on Thursday, the first step in potentially reuniting the companies split by media mogul Sumner Redstone more than a decade ago. 
In separate statements, each company said that there is no assurance that the process will result in a transaction, and they would not comment further until the process is completed.
Viacom shares rose 1.5 percent to $33.70 in after-hours trading, and CBS shares climbed 0.5 percent to $59.25.
The companies had previously explored a merger in 2016 at the urging of ailing 94-year-old Sumner Redstone and his daughter Shari, who control CBS and Viacom through privately held National Amusements Inc. 
Those talks failed due to concerns by CBS' directors and Moonves over governance issues and the deal's financial sense for CBS shareholders.
But Shari Redstone has continued to discuss with executives at both companies her desire to merge the two, which intensified after Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) announced in December it would buy a majority of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's (O:FOXA) assets, sources have said.
""National Amusements supports the processes announced by CBS and Viacom to evaluate a combination of the two companies, which we believe has the potential to drive significant, long-term shareholder value,"" the company said in a statement. 
CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves and Viacom CEO Bob Bakish held discussions in January about a potential deal. The boards of both companies decided on Thursday to begin a formal process to explore the deal through special committees. 
The deal would pair CBS's broadcast network, television studios and Showtime cable network with Viacom's Paramount Pictures, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and MTV.
That could help CBS' streaming service compete with Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and boost the combined company's leverage with cable and satellite distributors. 
It also could provide an edge with advertisers, UBS analyst John Hodulik said in a research note. CBS would gain access to Viacom technology that uses data to help brands better target their messages, and the combined company could sell packages across the broadcast and pay TV networks. 
""Increased scale in ratings would allow the combined company to go into the ad market with a larger inventory across a broader demographic,"" Hodulik said, ""potentially allowing for higher overall ad rates by selling across properties."" 

""We expect a transaction to be a positive development for both sets of shareholders in the near term,"" he added.

""It's disappointing that such an iconic women's brand @GUESS is still empowering Paul Marciano as their creative director #metoo"", the model tweeted on Wednesday, using a popular hashtag designed to highlight the wide spread of sexual harassment. 
""He shouldn't be allowed to use his power in the industry to sexually and emotionally harass women #metoo"", Upton tweeted, without elaborating. 
A representative for Upton, who modeled for Guess in 2011, did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.
""Mr. Marciano denies any misconduct toward Ms. Upton,"" Guess said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. 
The fashion retailer said it will investigate Upton's concerns if it determines they have merit, adding that she had not yet made any specific allegations.
Guess also said it had investigated claims that Marciano behaved inappropriately towards two women in November 2017, after an entertainment website contacted them.
It said the investigation, aided by outside counsel, had so far been unable to corroborate the allegations and the company's board had been unable to determine if they had merit. Marciano has denied the allegations.
Marciano separately responded to Upton's allegations through celebrity news website TMZ, saying he never touched Upton, and has never been alone with her. He said he would not apologize as he had done nothing wrong, TMZ reported. 
""If she has a claim, there's one place to tell the truth and that’s in court or to the police,"" he told TMZ. 
Marciano could not be reached by Reuters for comment.

Guess shares ended down 17.7 percent at $15.11 on Thursday, wiping more than $250 million off the company's market value.

386,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 05:50PM ET</span>",More retailer forecasts will prevent UPS peak shopping season bottlenecks: CEO,"By Eric M. Johnson
(Reuters) - Getting more of its major retailer customers to share data on their holiday shipping needs will prevent a repeat of last year's parcel delivery bottleneck,  United Parcel  Service Inc's (N:UPS) Chief Executive told Reuters.
The world's largest package delivery company delivered a record 762 million packages, exceeding forecasts, during the peak U.S. holiday shopping season which runs from around the Thanksgiving Day holiday in late November through to Christmas in late December. 
But around ""Cyber Monday"", the first Monday after the annual Thursday Thanksgiving holiday in late November, those extra packages also exceeded its ability to handle them, adding about $125 million in fourth-quarter operating costs, UPS CEO David Abney said. 
""Our forecasting during peak was extremely accurate,"" Abney told Reuters after the company reported quarterly results on Thursday. ""It was that cyber weekend and cyber week that we have to do a better job of working with our customers."" 
UPS expected volume to increase 9.0 percent, but it increased 20 percent, around the time of Cyber Monday, he said. ""When you are talking about that you are delivering 25-30 million packages a day, that 20 percent had a significant impact."" 
This is not the first time UPS has experienced problems with balancing costs and resources in its network during peak season shopping, and those problems have persistently stemmed from its burgeoning, unpredictable and low-margin e-commerce business.
A late surge in e-commerce orders and bad weather in 2013 left an estimated two million packages undelivered on Christmas Eve, mostly stranded in Atlanta-based UPS's package network.
Main rival FedEx Corp (N:FDX) experienced problems on a smaller scale. 
In 2014, UPS spent $500 million, boosted seasonal hiring and worked with retailers to forecast package volumes that failed to materialize and overspending hurt fourth-quarter earnings. FedEx did not experience problems that year.
Since getting peak season right in 2015, executives have said repeatedly UPS is deepening cooperation with major customers to improve visibility on orders and better manage network bulges. 
The company has also invested heavily to handle ecommerce packages, while trying to figure out ways to cut the higher costs associated with delivering packages to residential addresses versus businesses. It has also raised shipping rates and added peak-season surcharges. [nL2N1N026T]
Abney said UPS will expand the number of customers it receives package volume forecasts from.
""The area that we've got to focus on of course for this year is cyber week, and we already announced changes in the surcharges that we think we will help that for 2018,"" he said. ""We're going to continue to discuss other ways we can send that message across."" 
Earlier Thursday, UPS reported a quarterly net profit that was boosted by growth in deliveries in the U.S. and abroad and benefits from changes to U.S. tax law, though its capital spending and the 2018 earnings outlook overshadowed its results. [nL2N1PR0IO]

It's Jobs Friday
Nonfarm payrolls data, arguably one of the most important economic events of the month, is expected to show the US economy created 184,000 jobs In January.
Economists forecast the jobless rate to remain steady at 4.1% while average hourly earnings for January is expected to rise 0.3% in line with the rise seen in December.
Investors will assess the nonfarm payrolls report for clues about the strength of the economy which could provide fresh direction for the dollar, U.S. 10-Year, and gold, as the Fed has cited that it expects a tightening labor market to spur inflation, which has been on the main headwinds for a faster pace of monetary policy tightening.
In its monetary policy statement on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said the labor market “continued to strengthen.”
Apple To Rebound?
Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 1% in after hours trade on Thursday, after the tech giant reported first quarter earnings that beat earnings and revenue expectations but iPhone sales fell short of expectations.
The tech giant posted earnings-per-share (EPS) of $3.89 on $88.3 billion in revenue against analysts’ expectations of EPS of $3.86 on $87.28 billion in revenue. That topped management guidance for the quarter expected revenue to be between $84 billion and $87 billion.
Apple sold 77 million iPhones, which was short of 80 million iPhone sales expected.
Baker Hughes rig count
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with fresh insight into U.S. oil production and demand after data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the US jumped by 12 to 759, the highest level since Sept. 1.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.

444,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>",Fed outlines yearly 'stress test' standards for Wall Street,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Thursday outlined standards for its annual 'stress test' of the largest banks to see how Wall Street would fare in a future financial crisis.
Large lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) will have to report on whether their business could survive for long if the unemployment rate jumped to 10 percent and the economy was otherwise rattled. The test looms large at those banks, as the Fed must approve before the banks can distribute their extra capital to investors. 
Thirty-eight lenders in all will have to report by April 5 on how their bottom lines will be impacted by an economic shock and the Federal Reserve will grade the banks by June 30. The 18 largest and most complex lenders will have to undergo the most rigorous version of the test, which includes a quantitative test of a firm's books, and a scrutinizing evaluation of its operations by bank regulators.
The global economy is stronger than it was last year, leading to a somewhat tougher version of the test, as Fed officials have said they want the test to be more rigorous in good economic times than bad.

In 2017, all 34 banks tested by the Fed passed. [nL1N1JP1U9]

445,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 04:01PM ET</span>","Dow Jones Ekes Out Gains; Alphabet Misses Earnings, Beats Revenue","Investing.com – Wall Street settled mixed Thursday as gains in energy were offset by weakness is tech as investors awaited a deluge of earnings from large cap technology companies.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher at 26,153.32. The S&P 500 closed 0.06% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite closed at 7385.86, down 0.35%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon, Alphabet are slated to reveal earnings after US markets closed with the latter the only stock ending the session in positive territory as some investors appeared to have taken profits off the table ahead of earnings.
Apple is widely expected to miss earnings and revenue estimates amid expectations for slower sales growth of its flagship iPhone X as its hefty price was mentioned as one of the potential headings to consumer adoption.
Sentiment on earnings overall were mostly bullish, however, as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Paypal beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines, but the latter fell more than 5% following eBay’s announcement that it would ditch its long-term partnership Paypal.
Some noted, however, that eBay represented just 13% of PayPal’s total payment volume, according to company files.
Offsetting weakness in markets somewhat was strong performance in energy and financials amid the ongoing rally in crude prices and prospect of a more hawkish Federal Reserve on monetary policy, respectively.

The December ISM manufacturing PMI was reported at 59.1, beating economists’ forecasts for a reading of 58.8, new orders in December fell to reading of a 65.4 compared with 67.4 a month ago. ISM prices paid index, meanwhile, was reported at a 72.7 beating expectations for a reading of 68.8.
Wells Fargo said that the ISM data showed backlogged orders and supplier delivery times grew during the month, suggesting recent momentum should continue in the near-term.
Amazon reported earnings that beat on both the top and bottom line, while Alphabet missed earnings per share estimates but beat revenue estimates. Alphabet reported earnings of $9.70 per share on revenue of $32.32 billion compared with analysts' estimates for earnings of $9.70 per share on $31.86 billion on revenue.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks pulled back from earlier gains on Thursday as bond yields rose and technology stocks retreated ahead of a host of high-profile earnings.
It has been a rocky week for Wall Street. Mostly robust earnings have been met by rising bond yields as world central banks back away from easy monetary policy.
On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady but indicated a more hawkish inflation outlook.
""The selloff is just letting steam out of the kettle,"" said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. ""Even after proposed policy changes, we still have an (accommodative) monetary policy.""
U.S. Treasury yields rose further after economic indicators seemed to confirm the Fed's inflation outlook.
Initial claims for unemployment benefits fell unexpectedly last week, indicating a tight labor market. 
Separately, ISM data showed prices paid by U.S. factories hitting a near 7-year high, and fourth-quarter labor costs rose by 2 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 36.32 points, or 0.14 percent, to 26,185.71, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 2.01 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,825.82 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 3.27 points, or 0.04 percent, to 7,408.21.
Banks, which benefit from higher interest rates, led the S&P 500 financials (SPSY) to a 0.8 percent gain.
Other notable stock movers included eBay (O:EBAY), up 15.1 percent after its earnings report, and its announcement that it would move away from PayPal (O:PYPL) as its main payments partner. PayPal shares slid 6.4 percent.
UPS (N:UPS) was down 6.9 percent after it reported fourth-quarter profit that was hurt by higher holiday season shipping costs. The company was the second-biggest percentage loser on the S&P 500.
Analysts see fourth-quarter S&P 500 earnings growth of 14.9 percent, up from 12 percent expected on January 1. So far, of 227 companies that have reported, 79.7 percent have come in above Street estimates.
Tech giants Amazon.com (O:AMZN), Alphabet (O:GOOGL) and Apple (O:AAPL) are due to report after the bell.
Apple is expected to show year-on-year earnings growth of 14.8 percent.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.18-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 26 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 72 new highs and 61 new lows.

458,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 03:03PM ET</span>",S&P 500's January gain suggests momentum for a strong 2018,"By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - One of the oldest Wall Street adages dictates: ""So goes January, goes the year."" After the S&P 500's gain of almost 6 percent in the first month of 2018, that should mean the rest of the year will follow suit.
Since 1950, there have been only nine major contradictions to the so-called January Barometer, according to the Stock Traders Almanac whose founder, Yale Hirsch, devised the indicator in 1972.
To be sure, investors list several risks in the market. But many still expect the full year 2018 to follow January, with help from earnings-boosting U.S. corporate tax cuts and from economic data showing solid global growth trends. 
""There's still more upside potential,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York who expects the S&P to rise another 7 percent to end 2018 at 3,040 even if there is a pullback between now and then. 
""We have the revised tax situation that's going to help. Consumers have displayed confidence. Business spending has picked up. Manufacturing has increased and the global economy has improved. Any pullback is only going to be temporary."" 
However, after over 15 consecutive months of total return gains for the S&P 500 (SPX), Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago is not predicting that ""stocks will continue their march higher."" 
""In the face of rising rates and likely a positive hit to earnings from taxes, the markets are looking for the next thing – which may be a disappointment,"" said Nolte. ""The first half of the year could be decent, the last half tougher as higher rates begin to bite and worries over the mid-terms begin hitting the markets.""
In the past, big outside events skewed the outcome, according to the Almanac, which cited issues such as the Vietnam war in 1966 and 1968, interest rate increases and the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, as well as the anticipation of military action in Iraq in 2003.
When January was negative in both 1982 and 2009, the S&P registered full-year gains. August 1982 saw the start of a bull market and the current bull market began in March 2009. 
The January barometer is not perfect, although it does have a pretty solid track record, Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial, wrote in a Jan. 31 research report. 
""Now where things really get interesting is when that first month is up more than 5 percent,"" he said. ""The return over the final 11 months actually gets stronger.”
In all the years when the S&P 500 rose more than 5 percent in January, the year's return has never been negative, according to Detrick, though he pointed out that ""they weren’t smooth rides."" 

The average peak-to-trough correction was 10.7 percent, while the smallest intra-year pullback was 4.4 percent, he said.

(Reuters) -  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX), which is in the process of being bought by AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue on Thursday, powered by the success of its premium HBO channel.
The New York-based company said it expects adjusted operating income in the high single digits for 2018 and ad revenue in the high single to low double digits in the first quarter. 
Time Warner Inc's shares were up 1.88 percent in afternoon trading Thursday.
Time Warner beat analyst estimates as it awaits the outcome of a Department of Justice lawsuit to block AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner. That suit is set to go to trial in March. 
The results demonstrate that Time Warner Inc's risk may be limited if the Department of Justice ""defies our expectation and succeeds in its antitrust suit,"" Barton Crockett, a B. Riley FBR analyst wrote in a note. 
Revenue from Home Box Office (HBO), rose 12.7 percent to $1.68 billion. Analysts were expecting revenue of $1.65 billion, according to data and analytics firm FactSet.
HBO premium channel has more than 5 million online streaming subscribers, up from 2 million a year ago, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Thursday. 
Those online subscribers come from all online streaming offerings it works with, including its own HBO Now as well as Amazon's Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Channels, AT&T's DirectTV Now and Sony Vue. 
Ad revenue was up two percent for its Turner division, which includes TBS, CNN and TNT, due to higher revenues associated with Major League Baseball post-season games and growth in Turner's international networks.
Revenue from Warner Bros, which includes the movie business and is the company's biggest unit by revenue, rose 4.8 percent to $4.05 billion. Analysts were expecting revenue of $4.03 billion, according to data and analytics firm FactSet.
""Justice League,"" featuring Israeli actress Gal Gadot and American actor Ben Affleck, had grossed more than $655.9 million globally as of Jan. 28, according to tracking firm Box Office Mojo. The company's net income attributable to shareholders surged to $1.39 billion, or 1.75 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, mainly due to a gain of $1.06 per share related to changes to U.S. tax laws. In the year-ago quarter, the company earned $293 million, or 37 cents per share. 
Revenue rose 9 percent to $8.61 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $8.42 billion. According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, Time Warner's adjusted EPS was $1.60 per share, while the average analyst estimate was $1.43.

460,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 02:50PM ET</span>","Racial bias persists at Morgan Stanley, new lawsuit claims","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) has reneged on promises to stop discriminating against black employees, according to a lawsuit by a former broker who said he was fired after complaining about racial bias, including in pay and career opportunities. In a complaint filed on Thursday in Manhattan federal court, John Lockette said he was given negative performance reviews, denied raises and bonuses, deemed too ""verbose,"" and subjected by one supervisor to the nickname ""Johnny"" because he was black.
The New Jersey resident said the discrimination culminated in his August 2016 dismissal, three years after he was hired as an assistant vice president in wealth management.
Lockette said Morgan Stanley has ""no intent to abide by the spirit"" of its 2007 agreement to pay $16 million and reform its practices, to settle class-action claims it steered business to white male brokers at the expense of black and Hispanic brokers.
Morgan Stanley denied Lockette's allegations.
""The firm is strongly committed to nondiscrimination, and looks forward to addressing this former employee's claims on the merits,"" spokeswoman Christy Jockle said in an email.
Linda Friedman, a lawyer for Lockette, disputed Morgan Stanley's commitment.
Blacks working there face ""a lack of support, undue criticism, and a lack of trust and sincere belief in their capacity to contribute or lead,"" Friedman said in an interview.
""Wall Street has a belief that money is not green, it's white,"" she added.
Morgan Stanley ended 2017 with 15,712 brokers who oversaw $2.37 trillion of client assets, and generated an average $1.12 million of annualized revenue per representative, a regulatory filing showed.
Lockette said he had begun complaining about his treatment roughly two years before his dismissal.
He said this included an insistence by one supervisor that he join a special program to prepare for the Series 7 broker examination because blacks' ""intellectual weakness"" left them ""inherently less capable"" of passing, the complaint said.
The lawsuit also said Morgan Stanley uses ""stealth"" methods to force unhappy brokers to arbitrate their claims, rather than band together to pursue class actions in court. A separate lawsuit in the Manhattan court targets this alleged practice.
Friedman said Lockette is not now employed in financial services. His lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages, back pay, and an injunction against further discrimination.

The case is Lockette v Morgan Stanley et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-00876.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Automakers posted mixed U.S. new vehicle sales data for January, with American consumers showing little sign they will stop abandoning passenger cars for the larger pickup trucks, SUVs and crossover models that manufacturers also love because they are far more profitable.
U.S. auto industry sales fell 2 percent in 2017 to 17.23 million vehicles after hitting a record high in 2016 and are expected to drop further in 2018 despite a solid economy. Interest rates are rising and around 4 million late-model used cars will return to dealer lots this year to compete with more expensive new ones. 
Automakers have used consumer discounts to boost sales, a growing concern for observers who say this undermines resale values and profits. Discounts declined in January, but remained above 10 percent of manufacturers' recommended prices.
""""I think the industry has accepted that (sales) volumes will fall somewhat in 2018,... and I don't think the industry is going to go over the cliff with insane incentives,"" Mike Jackson, chief executive officer of AutoNation Inc (N:AN), told Reuters after his company, the largest U.S. auto retail chain, posted a higher quarterly net profit.
Mark Wakefield, head of the North American automotive practice for consultancy AlixPartners, had a gloomier perspective. The industry's less-than-stellar sales performance for January showed ""we are now past the peak,"" he said.
""Automakers are now selling the deal instead of the vehicle,"" he said. ""That's a tough spot to be in because that treadmill is hard to get off once you're on it.""
General Motors Co (N:GM) said January sales rose 1.3 percent, driven by a 16 percent rise in fleet sales. Sales to consumers fell 2.4 percent. GM posted strong gains for models such as the Silverado pickup truck and Equinox crossover model, while its passenger cars continued to struggle. 
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) posted a 6.6 percent sales decline for January, with retail sales down 4.3 percent.
Sales of Ford's F-Series pickup trucks - America's best-selling vehicle brand for decades - rose 1.6 percent. Passenger cars were down more than 23 percent.
Passenger cars ""continues to be a difficult segment as we see a continued shift into SUVs,"" Ford's U.S. sales chief, Mark LaNeve, said on a conference call. ""We anticipate continued migration” from cars to SUVs over the next five years, he added. 
Ford has garnered negative headlines as it works to improve results and rejig its product lineup.
Toyota Motor Corp's (T:7203) sales rose 16.8 percent in January. It noted strong demand for its pickup trucks and SUVs, plus its revamped Camry passenger car, whose sales rose more than 21 percent. Toyota has bet on boosting its share of the shrinking passenger car market with the all-new sedan.
 Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) said new vehicle sales fell 13 percent in January, driven by a 50 percent drop in fleet sales, in line with the automaker's strategy to reduce these lower-margin sales to rental agencies, businesses and government bodies. 
Fiat Chrysler sales to consumers rose 2 percent to their second-highest level since 2001. 
Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) said its sales rose 10 percent in January, with pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers up 18 percent. Sales of the luxury Infiniti brand, however, fell 8 percent, driven by a decline in fleet sales.
Judy Wheeler, head of U.S. sales for the Nissan brand, said the recent U.S. tax overhaul should be a positive for sales in 2018.
""I think customers will have more disposable income ... and we'll see them come in to get into a new vehicle,"" she said.
Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) said its sales fell 1.7 percent in January, with both car and truck sales down. 

GM shares were virtually unchanged at $42.41, while Ford was down 5 cents at $10.92, and Fiat Chrysler was off 0.6 percent at $24.01

465,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",Dreading your taxes? Try filing as U.S. military,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - No matter how U.S. tax policies evolve in the future, it is doubtful that members of the U.S. military will ever be able to file tax returns on a postcard. Their jobs simply make it too complicated. 
Christian Schleider, an Army helicopter pilot stationed in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, filed taxes from so many different locations during 15 years in the military that he can hardly name them all. His personal situation also shifted from post to post: he is now married, with kids and a real estate LLC on the side. 
Most military members qualify for free tax help from the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program run by the Internal Revenue Service. There are also independent specialists like Marti Myers-Garver, based in Iowa, who runs a national service called Armed Forces Tax (http://armedforcestax.com). 
TurboTax has special prompts for military members, and those of certain ranks or income levels can file free.
These are main areas where military taxes differ from civilian: 
- What counts as income 
Schleider cautions his young soldiers to keep a close eye on their leave and earnings statements - the military version of a pay stub. 
While a W-2 will show gross earnings and taxes paid, the monthly military statement will break down combat pay and which states took out withholding. This is important because combat pay is not taxed as income, while regular pay is. 
Schleider said he had trouble in the past when he got back from a combat zone. The government did not resume taking taxes out of his pay, and then took it out all at once. ""It was a bit of a shock,"" he said.
While that situation is not common, Myers-Garver always asks her clients for a year-end leave and earnings statement, in addition to a W-2, to make sure she can see all the details of what has been paid and to whom. 
*Where and when to file
Establishing a state of residence is an important tax choice. If you can establish residency in a state with no income tax, like Texas, Florida or Nevada, you can save thousands of dollars a year. 
For those that enlist from high-tax states, request a change with the finance office if you switch to a post in a state that is more advantageous. The ones who choose not to might be planning to retire back in their home state or they want their children to go to college in that state's system, Myers-Garver added.
Where a military spouse files taxes for their income is even more complicated. When it comes to figuring out those permutations, it is best to seek specialized help, Myers-Garver said. 
Deadlines also vary for those in combat zones, because they can qualify for extensions automatically. But many forego that perk. ""They don't want an extension, they want their refund,"" said Myers-Garver, noting that many service members qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit. 
Finally, a spouse can sign a return for a service member in a combat zone without needing a special power of attorney. 
- What deductions count
The two items that come up the most for military members: uniforms and moving expenses. 
The deductibility of uniforms used to vex Myers-Garver, but the 2018 tax changes eliminate unreimbursed employee expenses. 
However, unreimbursed moving expenses for military members made it through as an exclusion, even though civilians can no longer claim these expenses as a deduction. 
Josh Andrews, director of military life advice for USAA, the credit union and financial services firm that specializes in customers with a military connection, said the two items most claimed are moving a pet and second car. 
A pro-tip from Andrews: If you are moving close to tax time, be sure to carry your tax documents with you.

Schleider wishes his younger self knew more about taxes, because he spent a lot of money moving a dog to Germany and back years ago, but never thought to claim the expense.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ten U.S. states and the District of Columbia said Thursday they are challenging a decision by the Trump administration to drop a requirement that Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) spend $3 million to reduce air pollution under settlement the Obama administration announced.
In 2016, the Milwaukee-based motorcycle manufacturer agreed to pay a $12 million civil fine and stop selling illegal after-market devices that caused its vehicles to emit too much pollution, and spend about $3 million to retrofit or replace wood-burning appliances with cleaner stoves.
The Justice Department in July cited a new policy by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and an ongoing review of the penalty by a government auditor in proposing to drop the $3 million penalty from the settlement. Reuters first reported the planned reduction.
U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan must still deicide whether to approve the revised agreement.
The Harley-Davidson settlement resolved allegations that Harley sold about 340,000 ""super tuners"" enabling motorcycles since 2008 to pollute the air at levels greater than what the company certified. Harley-Davidson did not admit liability, and said previously it disagreed with the government, arguing that the tuners were designed and sold to be used in ""competition only.""
Vermont Attorney General T.J. Donovan, joined by Massachusetts, New York, Washington State and others, said Sessions' new policy ""does not apply to projects like the wood stove mitigation project that directly remedies the harm caused by pollutants emitted by the non-compliant Harley-Davidson motorcycles.""
The states and the Obama administration said the $3 million wood stove mitigation project would offset additional air pollution caused by the motorcycles’ emissions of excess hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides.
The Harley-Davidson settlement came amid greater scrutiny on emissions and ""defeat devices"" by U.S. regulators after Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) admitted to using illegal software to evade U.S. emissions standards in nearly 600,000 U.S. vehicles in September 2015.
The Natural Resources Defense Council also asked the judge to reject the removal of the $3 million mitigation project, saying it ""is not reasonable because it does not adequately protect the environment and does not sufficiently compensate the public.""

The Environmental Protection Agency and Harley did not immediately comment Thursday.

470,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",Derivatives trade group ISDA may challenge new capital rules,"By Karen Brettell
NEW YORK (Reuters) - An industry group representing the privately traded derivatives markets may challenge new rules requiring that more capital be used to back the trades, arguing that the requirements place them at a disadvantage to trading futures contracts.
Capital rules adopted by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and U.S. bank regulators in 2015, which are being phased in over a five-year period, require that capital equivalent to five days the historical value-at-risk (HVaR) of a derivative such as an interest rate swap be posted to back trades that are centrally cleared, with uncleared swaps requiring 10 days' worth of HVaR.
Centrally clearing is when a clearinghouse stands in the middle of a trade and guarantees the trades.
Interest rate futures, by contrast, which are traded on the CME Group Inc's (O:CME) exchange, require capital of around two days the value-at-risk of the trades.
Regulators require higher margins for uncleared trades as they are seen as posing higher risks to the financial system.
Central clearing and higher margins are part of reforms meant to reduce the risks of privately traded derivatives after a chain of large exposures between global banks was seen as destabilizing the financial system during the financial crisis of 2007-2009.
Scott O’Malia, the chief executive officer of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), said at an industry conference on Thursday that the new margin requirements for swaps may not make sense if the risk profile of the trade is the same as in futures.
ISDA plans to evaluate the economics of the trades and may then pursue “fact-based advocacy,” on the topic, O’Malia said.

492,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 11:51AM ET</span>","Alibaba beats forecasts again, takes stake in affiliate Ant","By Pei Li and Adam Jourdan
(Reuters) -  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA), China's biggest e-commerce company, said on Thursday its third-quarter revenue jumped 56 percent, beating expectations as it shrugged off concerns about a wider market slowdown.
The group, which also raised its forecast for the year ahead, will take a 33 percent stake in payment affiliate Ant Financial, an important step ahead of an expected initial public offering (IPO) by Ant, valued at $60 billion in 2016.
""This is no secret, everybody knows that Ant Financial will IPO, and (buying the stake) is just something they had to do before that happens,"" Beijing-based analyst Li Chengdong said.
The strong growth and the move to bind itself more closely with Ant — which operates hugely popular online payment system Alipay — comes as Alibaba looks to fend off rivals in its core e-commerce business that analysts expect will start to weigh on growth.
Alibaba has, however, been defying expectations.
Revenue for the October-December period rose to 83.03 billion yuan ($13.19 billion), up from 53.2 billion yuan a year earlier. That exceeded the 79.8 billion yuan average estimate of 28 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.
The company also raised its 2018 revenue forecast to growth of 55 to 56 percent, up from 49 to 53 percent.
The deal with Ant, which will replace the current system where Alibaba receives 37.5 percent of Ant's pre-tax profit, will see the company acquire newly-issued equity in the affiliate in exchange for certain intellectual property rights it owns.
The deal will have no cash impact on Alibaba, it added.
""Importantly, an equity stake in Ant Financial enables Alibaba and our shareholders to participate in the future growth of the financial technology sector,"" Alibaba Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang said in a statement.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) was Alibaba's financial adviser, while Morrison & Foerster and King & Wood Mallesons provided legal counsel. PricewaterhouseCoopers was tax adviser.
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, Sidley Austin LLP and Fangda Partners were Ant's legal advisers.
CLOUD COMPUTING
Alibaba is looking for new areas such as cloud computing, payments and offline retail to maintain rapid growth rates that helped its shares roughly double in value last year, making it one of the world's most valuable companies with a market capitalization of $523 billion.
The company's third-quarter sales are typically strong because of its Singles' Day sales event held on Nov. 11, the world's biggest shopping spree. This Singles' Day, a record $25.4 billion was spent on Alibaba platforms.
Core commerce revenue in the third quarter rose 57 percent year-over-year to 73.24 billion yuan.
Alibaba, and other tech rivals in China such as Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) and JD.com Inc (O:JD), have also been investing heavily in brick-and-mortar retailers over the last year to expand offline.
Analyst Li said the growth of users on Alibaba's platforms was slowing down. ""Alibaba is relying more and more on acquisitions for growth,"" he added.
Net income attributable to shareholders rose to 24.07 billion yuan, up 35 percent from the year-earlier quarter. That compared with the 21.5 billion yuan estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.
Excluding one-time items, Alibaba reported a profit of 10.61 yuan per share, slightly missing analysts' estimates of 10.66 yuan, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Revenue at Alibaba's nascent but fast-growing cloud computing unit soared 104 percent, slightly faster than the previous period.
Alibaba's cloud business crossed 1 million customers globally in the quarter ended September, and has recently opened new data centers in Malaysia and India.
Cloud computing and offline retail make up a comparatively small fraction of the company's current sales, though Alibaba is betting on these units to become major revenue drivers as the Chinese e-commerce market shows signs of saturation.
Alibaba's shares fell 3.7 percent to $197.81 on Thursday morning on the New York Stock Exchange.

493,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Etihad scrambles to shore up $1.2 billion bonds before coupon crunch - sources,"By Davide Barbuscia and Stanley Carvalho
DUBAI (Reuters) - Etihad Airways is urgently examining ways to avert a technical default of some $1.2 billion in bonds indirectly linked to the Gulf airline, sources close to the situation told Reuters.
An Amsterdam-based special purpose vehicle called SPV Equity Alliance Partners (EAP) was set up in 2015 and issued two bonds for Etihad and other airlines it partially owned at the time, including Alitalia and Air Berlin, which are both now insolvent.
The bonds are quoted at a discount of more than 25 cents on the dollar after Alitalia entered special administration and Air Berlin filed for bankruptcy protection last year.
Etihad could now end up spending hundreds of millions of dollars to keep the bond structure alive, although it is not legally obliged to do so as there is no cross-default provision in the bond documentation, the sources said.
With more than $400 million of EAP debt in the hands of United Arab Emirates investors, there is political and reputational pressure on the Abu Dhabi carrier to avoid a default in March and Etihad is holding internal talks to assess whether and how to support the bonds, the sources said. 
An Etihad spokesman declined to comment on the bonds, the proceeds of which were used to enter into separate debt obligations with each entity involved, with those of Alitalia and Air Berlin each amounting to around 19 percent.
Until now a credit enhancement mechanism has covered coupon payments which were due to be paid by the defaulting airlines, but if this ""liquidity pool"" is used to pay coupons due in March and June it will drop below 75 percent of the original balance.
This would trigger a ""remarketing event"" in which defaulted debt obligations would be auctioned for cash, according to the documentation of the EAP bonds, a $700 million bond maturing in 2020 and a $500 million bond due to be repaid in 2021.
Etihad spent billions of dollars on airline acquisitions that failed to deliver expected returns. The state-owned airline once owned minority stakes in eight other carriers. 
At the time of the bond issues through EAP, they were seen as strengthening Etihad's partnerships with the other airlines. However, it has since sold two, while Alitalia and Air Berlin have declared insolvency. 
Etihad posted its first loss in six years in 2016 and began a strategic overhaul. Last month it pulled its Airbus freighter fleet from service and asked some pilots to take unpaid leave.
COMPLEX SOLUTIONS
None of the potential solutions are straightforward, the sources said, but Etihad could reach one over the next few weeks and one idea being considered, two sources said, is that Etihad could buy Alitalia's mini-bond within EAP. 
Etihad agreed at the end of 2016 to repay the principal of Alitalia's portion of debt issued by EAP, equivalent to $235 million. But this was signed before Alitalia's workers rejected a restructuring plan for the Italian carrier in early 2017, leading the company to bankruptcy.
With Alitalia now under administration, it is not clear whether the agreement would succeed in repaying Alitalia's debt in the EAP bonds, as it could be used by the administrator to repay Alitalia's more senior creditors.
Alitalia did not respond to a request for comment.
Another option might be for Etihad to pay directly into the EAP bonds' liquidity pool, to guarantee coupon payments.

""If Etihad does nothing, they'll end up paying a lot. If they don't try to save EAP, their reputation for sophisticated financial management would take a battering,"" one source said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - After  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) decided to ramp up risk in its flagship age-based retirement funds last year, one of its largest customers decided to call it quits, unhappy with the new investment strategy and how the bank handled the transition. 
Wells Fargo notified investors in April 2017 that its target-date funds would become more aggressive, outlining a plan for better returns that included buying junk bonds, stocks in emerging markets and derivatives. It was a stark difference from the conservative investment strategy for which the funds were known. 
TexaSaver, a supplemental retirement program for nearly 240,000 state employees and elected officials, was stunned by the changes, said Georgina Bouton, assistant director of benefit contracts at the Employees Retirement System of Texas. The retirement plan had fewer than 90 days to accept the revamped product or find another investment option. 
The retirement plan asked Wells Fargo for more time to find another manager, but the request was denied, she said. TexaSaver ended a decade-long relationship with Wells Fargo, pulling more than $600 million from its target-date funds. 
A Colorado-based retirement plan for more than 4,000 plumbers and pipe-fitters also pulled its money from the Wells Fargo funds, citing the “unproven nature and significance” of Wells Fargo’s changes, according to a notice sent to participants. 
""It was a big surprise,"" Bouton said in an interview. ""What Wells Fargo wanted to do contradicted why we picked them in the first place. I'm unhappy with the lack of professionalism at Wells Fargo and how this was conducted."" 
The bank says it needed to dial up risk to generate more income for investors, and recognizes that some customers are unhappy, said Fredrik Axsater, head of strategic business segments at Wells Fargo Asset Management. 
""If the client is disappointed, then we are disappointed,"" said Axsater. ""In our mind, the client is always right.""
Axsater said Wells Fargo is committed to the more aggressive strategy. He described the overall reception in the marketplace as ""really strong.""
RESTORING TRUST
Wells Fargo’s troubles with some retirement plans were happening last year while the third-largest U.S. bank was trying to right itself from a scandal in its retail operation. 
Employees at bank branches had created up to 3.5 million phony accounts in customers’ names without their permission, abuses detailed in a $190-million regulatory settlement in September 2016. Wells has since disclosed other potential issues with mortgages, auto loans and “add-on” products tacked onto accounts. 
Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan has pledged to restore trust by putting customers first. At the same time, he is trying to boost returns for shareholders by improving profits in businesses including asset management, where target date funds have been a particular sore spot. 
In 2017 alone, Wells Fargo’s target-date funds experienced $4.7 billion in net withdrawals, according to Morningstar data. Overall assets there have dropped by two-thirds over the past three years, to $5.5 billion from nearly $17 billion, even as tens of billions of dollars have been flowing into target-date funds managed by other firms. 
Reuters discovered complaints by TexaSaver and the Colorado Pipe Industry in public documents, but could not learn how many investors in total decided to leave its target-date funds after the investment strategy changed. 
DIALING UP RISK 
Until last year, Wells Fargo relied on a firm called Global Index Advisors (GIA) to manage asset allocation in target-date funds. GIA tracked performance of Dow Jones indexes, a passive strategy that was less risky than many peers'. 
Previously, investors in those funds had 28 percent exposure to the stock market at retirement, compared with at least 50 percent exposure at the largest target-date providers – Vanguard Group, Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price, U.S. regulatory filings show. 
That conservative tilt was cause for celebration during the financial crisis. Wells Fargo’s 2010 target-date fund, for example, suffered a 10.75 percent loss in 2008, compared to an average decline of 22.5 percent in a category whose investors were on the eve of retirement. 
During the stock market rally of the past nine years, that dynamic has changed, with Wells Fargo’s target date funds underperforming most competitors, according to Morningstar Inc data. The $888-million Wells Fargo Target 2020 Fund, for example, has generated average annual total return of 4.21 percent over the past 10 years, lagging 86 percent of rival funds. 
As a result, the bank decided to replace GIA with an in-house management team and boost equity exposure to 40 percent at retirement, according to the notices it sent last year. It also added new exposures to junk bonds and derivatives including credit default swaps. 
The bank also cut the funds' expense ratio to 0.19 percent from a range of 0.30–0.37 percent. Because stocks are expected to rise much less in the near-term than they have in recent years, the portfolio needs more exposure to generate adequate income for retirees, Wells Fargo's Axsater said. 
""Investor needs have changed and evolved,"" Axsater explained. ""We live longer. Life expectancy has extended. Retirement patterns have changed."" 

Ultimately, TexaSaver replaced Wells Fargo with Blackrock Inc's (N:BLK) LifePath Index Funds, while the Colorado Pipe Industry Annuity & Salary Deferral Trust Fund shifted its money to Vanguard.

Mike Branca, head of compensation for the San Francisco bank, said in a telephone interview late on Wednesday that according to recent analysis of its U.S. employees, women earn more than 99 cents for every dollar earned by male peers, and minorities earn more than 99 cents for every dollar earned by their white peers. 
The ratios have been similar in recent years, Branca said, and account for factors like job tenure and geography.
Wells Fargo has 265,000 employees overall, primarily in the United States. According to its latest disclosures, 57 percent of its workers are women, including 37 percent of its top executives.
Since mid-January  Citigroup  (N:C) and Bank of America (N:BAC) each have said that women and minorities earned 99 percent of what their male and white peers earned in the United States and in other countries.
All three banks and others have been under pressure to give the figures from activist investor Arjuna Capital. Arjuna Managing Partner Natasha Lamb said she plans to withdraw a shareholder resolution at Wells Fargo for this spring's annual meeting. But she hopes the bank and others will disclose more details such pay ratios within job levels and the median pay of women and men across the entire company.
Asked about the further details, Branca said the bank will ""continue to look at that and see how that contributes to the conversation.""

UPS is exercising options that double a previous deal for the freighter version of the 747-8, the courier said Thursday. The company is also taking four Boeing 767 freighters as it rushes to keep up with growing demand and ramps up investment after the recent cut in U.S. corporate tax rates.
The 747 order means Boeing will continue producing its largest aircraft into the 2020s, more than half a century after its debut. The UPS transaction validates Boeing’s long-held hope that a rebound in the air-cargo market would spark new interest in the jumbo freighter. The hinged nose of the jet flips open so that very large items, like oil drilling equipment, can be loaded quickly.
At the end of 2017, Boeing had just 12 unfilled orders in its dwindling 747 backlog, 11 of them destined for UPS. The latest deal will provide more than two years of output at the production rate of six jets annually.
Airbus SE is moving to a similar rate for its A380 superjumbo after landing a lifesaving order from Emirates Airline last month. Demand for such four-engine aircraft has fallen as the planemakers created twin-engine models, such as the Boeing 777 and Airbus A350, which are able to fly similar numbers of people over long-distance routes.
The 747 freighter has a list price of $403.6 million, according to Boeing’s website, before the discounts that are customary for aircraft orders."

Shares are trading up 1.65% at $189.69 after the company reported adjusted earnings of $2.39 per shares versus the Wall Street consensus of $2.25. Revenue came in at $12.78 billion, easily topping the $12.55 billion that was expected.
Investors initially sent shares of the company down more than 5% after GAAP earnings came in short, but slowly rebounded as investors realized the miss was due to a one-time tax hit of $0.77 per share.
Facebook saw a  50 million-hour-a-day reduction in the time spent in its newsfeed, which initially seemed worrisome for the company. But CEO Mark Zuckerberg said users had started to post using its ""Stories"" feature, which many claim the company stole from Snapchat, more than to their timelines.
""We expect Stories are on track to overtake posts in Feed as the most common way that people share across all social apps,"" Zuckerberg said on the call.
Zuckerberg also talked about wanting to reduce abuse on the platform and hinted that its ""Stories"" feature could be a part of doing that. The emphasis on ""Stories"" is not expected to impact revenue growth, and could even provide a new advertising format when space on the platform is starting to run thin, according to some analysts.
""All in, Q4 fundamentals were very impressive – very consistent and premium growth with record-high Operating Margins,"" Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients. Mahaney raised his price target to $250 after the report.

(Reuters) -  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) on Thursday said its fourth-quarter earnings suffered from higher costs resulting from surging shipping volumes during the peak holiday period, and its shares fell more than 6 percent. 
The world's largest package delivery company had faced system bottlenecks and delayed deliveries in the period leading up to Christmas.
Often seen as an indicator of U.S. economic activity and consumer spending, UPS has benefited from a rapid rise in ecommerce but has struggled to bring down the extra costs of making stops at individual residential addresses rather than at businesses. 
The company and main rival FedEx Corp (N:FDX) have spent billions of dollars upgrading their networks to handle rapidly rising ecommerce package volumes, leaving investors frustrated over the expense.
UPS said fourth-quarter revenue increased to $18.83 billion from $16.93 billion a year earlier on stronger-than-expected U.S. domestic and international package volumes. That was above Wall Street's estimate of $18.18 billion.
Net income came to $1.1 billion, compared with a year-earlier loss of $239 million. 
Adjusted for one-time items, earnings per share of $1.67 edged past analysts' expectations of $1.66.
The company said changes to U.S. tax laws benefited its results by 30 cents per share and helped spur new investments in facilities.
UPS said it would invest $6.5 billion to $7 billion in 2018, including 14 additional Boeing (NYSE:BA) 747-8 aircraft and four new aircraft freighters for its fleet. It also plans 18 new or retrofitted facilities this year, including three U.S. ground hubs, its first major new ones in two decades.
The hubs will be in areas where a surge in holiday online shopping orders overwhelmed its system during last year's peak period, when UPS delivered 762 million packages, surpassing its forecasts.
The company said the bottlenecks cost about $125 million, while investments in new technology and automated capacity expansion cost roughly $60 million.
UPS, which has worked for years to increase its ability to forecast customer shipping demands to handle major package volume spikes ahead of the holidays, has raised shipping rates and added 2018 peak-season surcharges.
The company forecast 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share at $7.03 to $7.37. Analysts on average are expecting $7.16.

UPS shares, up about 16 percent over the past six months, were down 6.5 percent at $119 in premarket trading.

LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia wants to complete talks with strategic investors such as China, Japan and South Korea before deciding where to list shares in state oil company Saudi Aramco, three sources familiar with the discussions said. 
The decision shows the initial public offering (IPO), which could be the biggest in history, is becoming an increasingly difficult balancing act for Riyadh.
Saudi officials have said the government plans to sell up to 5 percent of Aramco shares on one or more foreign exchanges in addition to Riyadh. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has urged Riyadh to list Aramco on the New York stock exchange, and British Prime Minister Theresa May has called for it to be in London. 
But Riyadh also has to take into account views over where the shares should be listed from the countries expected to be Aramco's biggest cornerstone investors -- those who commit in advance to invest a fixed amount of money or for a fixed number of shares. 
Sources close to the IPO said decisions must be taken by March if the IPO is to be carried out in October or November, and otherwise could be delayed until a year later.
""Everyone is talking about venues for the listing and why they haven't been chosen yet. Indeed, you have Trump encouraging Aramco to list in New York and May encouraging to list in London. But that is only the tip of the iceberg,"" said a senior Saudi source close to the IPO process.
""Aramco is also holding talks with cornerstone investors, who often express their views on where Aramco should list. And hence Aramco and the Saudi government need to think how to get the best value out of all this, how to get the best strategic arrangements out of this."" 
Asked whether a decision on where to list Aramco would be made only when talks with strategic investors are over, Aramco told Reuters: ""This is speculative and we decline to comment.""
Asia has become the biggest and most important buyer of crude oil from Aramco and the giant oil firm wants to secure Asian markets for the long-term as it faces competition from suppliers such as Russia and the United States. 
The sources said some cornerstone investors were keen to see Aramco listed on Asian and Saudi exchanges rather than in New York or London. 
""Bankers have been emphasizing to Aramco the importance of securing cornerstone investors first before moving forward with a decision on the listing. Asian cornerstone investors are most logical as that is where the oil flows to,"" a Gulf-based banker familiar with the IPO preparations said.

TIME PRESSURE
Aramco's IPO is part of a drive by the Saudi government to reduce the economy's reliance on oil and transform the kingdom.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who unveiled the Vision 2030 reform plan in April 2016, has suggested Aramco could be valued at as much as $2 trillion. 
The IPO could raise over $100 billion if Aramco goes ahead with plans to list 5 percent and cornerstone investors could buy a big part of it, sources told Reuters.
""If the IPO is going to be done in the second half of the year, then the government really does need to have a decision... They will have to get the prospectus out by the beginning of the second quarter,"" said a second senior source familiar with the IPO preparations.
""If you are going to do it, you might as well do it now,"" the source said, referring to a rise in oil prices to $70 per barrel.
Prices have doubled from their lows of 2015-2016 as Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and non-OPEC Russia reduced output to help prop up prices in 2017-2018.
Washington has been a longstanding political ally of Riyadh and New York offers the best liquidity of all exchanges but has stricter disclosure requirements than the London or Hong Kong exchanges.
Saudi Arabia is also considering listing Aramco shares on the local stock exchange, Tadawul, but there are concerns that this could damage the market.
The second source said international exchanges such as such as London, New York and Hong Kong were still being analyzed but options also included making Hong Kong the only listing abroad, or listing on Hong Kong plus private placements with cornerstone investors.
A third industry source familiar with the IPO said Riyadh wanted a decision taken by March on where to list the shares so that Aramco could be listed on at least the local bourse by October.

A fourth industry source said the official announcement may not come until October, when Saudi Arabia is due to host a major investment conference.

(Reuters) - U.S. chemicals producer DowDuPont (N:DWDP) reported a 14 percent rise in net sales for the fourth quarter and beat Wall Street profit estimates as a strong global economy led to robust demand and higher prices for its products.
The newly-combined company, formed by the merger of chemical giants  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW) and DuPont four months ago, said its net sales came in at $20.1 billion versus comparable net sales - which the company terms ""proforma"" sales - of $17.7 billion a year earlier.
It also said it planned to move ahead with plans to split the new company into three separate parts, starting with the Materials Science unit by the end of the first quarter of 2019. Agriculture and Specialty Products are expected to follow by June 1, 2019.
The chemicals giant saw prices rise by about 5 percent across markets in the fourth quarter, while volumes - a proxy for demand - rose 6 percent.
""In developed economies in particular, such as the United States, Germany, France, Canada and the U.K., we continue to see strong leading indicators of broad-based growth,"" executive chairman Andrew Liveris said in the results statement.
""Furthermore, early signs from the business community point to U.S. tax reform as a catalyst for further domestic capital investments.""
Currently trading at a market value of about $176.9 billion, Dow and DuPont completed the $130 billion mega merger in September. That created the world's largest chemical maker, until the company goes through with a plan to split into three companies.
DowDuPont's merger was welcomed by investors as a way to streamline the companies' sprawling operations by combining overlapping businesses.
The company said on Thursday it was now planning to save $3.3 billion in costs on the back of the merger - slightly more than the $3 billion it expected to save earlier.
For the reported quarter DowDuPont saw a $1.1 billion benefit from lower U.S corporate taxes, but still posted a net loss of $1.2 billion from continuing operations - substantially the result of merger-related costs.
Adjusted for those and other one time effects, the company said it earned 83 cents on a share. Ahead of the numbers Wall Street was expecting it to make 67 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S numbers.

Shares of the company dipped to $75 in premarket trading on Thursday compared to the previous close of $75.58.

562,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 07:31AM ET</span>",Shell poised to dethrone Exxon in oil titans' cash clash,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) could usurp its largest rival  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) as the energy sector's biggest cash generator after higher oil and gas prices combined with an improved performance lifted its 2017 revenue.
Chief Executive Ben van Beurden has made no secret of his desire to challenge the dominance of the world's largest listed oil company after its $54 billion purchase of BG Group in 2016 catapulted Shell into second place in terms of production.
The Anglo-Dutch company on Thursday reported a more than doubling of profit in 2017 to $16 billion, the highest since the start of the 2014 downturn as the effect of years of costs cuts and the integration of BG Group filtered through. 
""We enter 2018 with continued discipline and confidence, committed to the delivery of strong returns and cash,"" van Beurden said in a statement.
Cash flow from operations in 2017 rose to $35.65 billion from $20.62 billion a year earlier, putting Shell on course to beat Exxon, which is forecast to have generated $32.6 billion in 2017, according to estimates by Jefferies analysts. Exxon reports earnings on Friday.
Shell's shares were however 1.5 percent lower at 1200 GMT, compared with a 0.16 decline in the FTSE 100 index, as its fourth quarter cash flow was lower than anticipated by analysts.
The cash growth was driven by a sharp recovery in oil prices in the second half of 2017, as the benchmark Brent price reached a three-year high of $70 a barrel.
But it was also due to a sector-wide drive to reduce costs to adapt to a world of ""lower for longer"" oil prices, as Shell and others cut thousands of jobs, lowered spending and brought in new technology to simplify field designs and operations.
As a result Shell can now generate more cash than it did with oil prices above $100 a barrel and in November it raised its cash flow outlook from $25 billion to $30 billion by 2020, assuming an oil price of $60 a barrel.
Free cash flow -- cash available to pay for dividends and share buybacks -- rose to $27.6 billion from a negative $10.3 billion in 2016.
""We expect them to keep driving up efficiencies and reducing break evens to make it resilient and fit for the future. The BG deal seems to be paying off and the rationale for it is being proved right,"" Rohan Murphy, energy analyst at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, said.
Shell in the fourth quarter scrapped its scrip dividend, in a sign that it is confident of being able to maintain around $15 billion in annual dividend payments without resorting to scrip or borrowing after a three-year oil price downturn.
Van Beurden said the company planned to start a three-year, $25 billion share buyback program ""as soon as possible"" as the company focuses first on reducing debt. 
ASSET SALES
Shell's oil and gas production in the fourth quarter rose from the previous quarter to 3.756 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) from 3.657 million boed, but on a yearly basis, it fell 4 percent as a result of asset sales.
Production was expected to come down by 270,000 boed in 2018 as a result of divestments, including the sale of a North Sea portfolio to Chrysaor and its stake in Woodside Petroleum.
But Shell also plans to double its shale production in the United States, Canada and Argentina in the next 5-10 years from the current 275,000 barrels per day, Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl said.
Capital expenditure in 2017 was $24 billion, slightly lower than the $25-$30 billion range Shell set until 2020.
Shell's fourth-quarter profit, based on a current cost of supplies (CCS) and excluding identified items, rose by 140 percent to $4.3 billion, slightly ahead of forecasts.
Shell said its gearing dropped to 24.8 percent from a peak of 29.2 percent in the third quarter of 2016 as it cut its debt to $74.65 billion.

And while it took a $2 billion charge due to new U.S. tax rules, Shell expects a longer-term boost.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Telecom network gear maker Nokia (HE:NOKIA) posted better-than-expected quarterly profits on Thursday and forecast a recovery in profits by 2020, encouraging investors spooked last year by a weakening equipment market and acquisition integration missteps.
Nokia shares rose 6.8 percent on the results which showed fourth-quarter group operating profit increasing 7 percent to 1.0 billion euros ($1.2 billion), well ahead of a Reuters poll forecast of 888 million euros.
The profits were boosted by a one-off patent payment of 210 million euros from China's Huawei. Operating profit from the networks business fell 25 percent year-on-year. 
The network industry, dominated by Huawei, Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), is weathering the toughest part of a decade-long cycle as demand for 4G gear falls, while spending on new, mass-market 5G networks is unlikely before 2019 or 2020. 
Chief Executive Rajeev Suri said that while Nokia's network sales would remain weak during 2018, a potential rebound of spending by operators in North America could lessen the decline.
He added that the company's internal problems convincing U.S. carriers to swap out existing  Alcatel  equipment for comparable Nokia gear - the main reason for its shares losing a quarter of their value since October - had also eased. 
Nokia generated 30 percent of fourth-quarter network sales in North America, up slightly over the third quarter, while Asia-Pacific and Greater China declined. 
""For 2019 and 2020, we expect market conditions to improve markedly, driven by full-scale rollouts of 5G networks,"" Suri told a conference call.
Suri said Nokia's stepped-up capital spending to win future 5G upgrade deals will weigh on the network unit's profitability this year. He forecast an operating margin of 6-9 percent for 2018 before it starts to rebound to around 9-12 percent in 2020.
""It's a bit confusing that they give such precise guidance for long term... because there's no visibility on the market for long-term... Estimates for just one year are difficult, doing it for three years is quite bold,"" said Mikael Rautanen, analyst at Inderes Equity Research, with a ""buy"" rating on the stock.
""They had a better quarter in networks than Ericsson, but it's the same story for the outlook.""
Nokia has coped with the downturn better than Ericsson - which reported its fifth straight quarter of losses on Wednesday - thanks to its 2016 acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent (PA:ALUA) that broadened Nokia's portfolio.
Rautanen noted that Nokia's profits were boosted by a one-off patent payment of 210 million euros, and the company said its technology licensing business would prop up its profits with sales growth around 10 percent through 2020.
While about 90 percent of the company's sales come from network equipment, licensing payments on Nokia patents are highly profitable, and the company has recently struck licensing deals with all the main handset makers.
The mobile phone patent portfolio stems from the time when Nokia was the world's largest cellphone maker. It withdrew from handset production in 2014. 
Nokia bought rival Alcatel-Lucent in 2016 in a 15.6 billion euro all-share-deal and has been working to convince customers since then to switch to Nokia-brand mobile gear.

LONDON (Reuters) - Ford will launch its Chariot minibus services in a sixth U.S. city ""very shortly"", further expanding the service designed to appeal to those moving away from traditional car ownership after it began in London this week, an executive told Reuters. 
Ford is trying to diversify into other modes of transportation from vehicles sold to consumers as new competitors from Alphabet’s Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to Uber shake up the traditional automotive industry.
Major carmakers are experimenting with mobility services, partnering with existing tech apps or developing their own offerings such as car clubs as they seek to appeal to young urbanites who have increasingly shunned buying a vehicle.
Ford bought Chariot in 2016 and has been expanding the service, which allows passengers to book seats for journeys generally between transport hubs and to and from park and ride facilities.
It is available in San Francisco, Austin, Columbus, New York City, Seattle and, from this week, London, where Chariot will operate four routes in areas south of the River Thames which are generally not near underground stations.
Ford's global president of mobility Marcy Klevorn told Reuters further expansion was due soon.
""We've got a couple of other launches lined up and ... one I think fairly shortly,"" she said during an interview in London.
Asked whether that location would be in the U.S., Klevorn said: ""Exactly, coming very shortly.""
Sarah-Jayne Williams, director of smart mobility for Ford in Europe, told Reuters the investment in London had created 24 jobs so far and Ford was hoping to widen its product offering. 

""We're also looking at different enterprise routes or charter-type services which we would hope to extend during this year,"" she said.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has accelerated steps to resolve a $22-billion debt dispute that is seen by investors as a litmus test of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's commitment to reforms, three sources familiar with the matter say.
Legal battles over the debts left by Saad Group and Ahmad Hamad al-Gosaibi & Bros Co (AHAB) have dragged on for almost a decade since the two family conglomerates collapsed in 2009. From Switzerland to the Cayman Islands, the two groups have squabbled over which of them is to blame for the meltdown.
There has been gradual progress in AHAB's case since 2009, with the company making a settlement offer which has the support of around two-thirds of investors, but there has been much less movement over Saad Group's debts.
The Saudi authorities signaled their impatience in October, when Saad Group owner Maan al-Sanea was detained for unpaid debt. This spurred efforts by the al-Sanea family to try to resolve the debt dispute, the sources said. 
Saad Group took its first big step to engage with creditors last year by hiring a financial consultancy, Reemas Group, to offer a proposed settlement covering $4 billion in debt.
In a further sign of momentum, a three-judge tribunal set up in 2016 to deal with financial claims against AHAB and Saad group has approved creditor claims of about 11.5 billion riyals ($3 billion)against AHAB and appointed liquidators to deal with the unwinding of Saad Group's business empire, one of the sources said. 
Such steps could be vital for the government to win over investors and secure foreign funds for privatization projects under Vision 2030, the plan unveiled by Prince Mohammed in April 2016 to transform Saudi Arabia and reduce its reliance on oil.
""This is a $20 billion-plus problem for Saudi Arabia and unless it's handled well it will create a long-term legacy issue for some foreign investors,"" said one of the people familiar with the matter.
MOUNTAIN OF DEBT
Between them, AHAB and Saad Group owe money to more than 100 international banks including HSBC,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C). Saad Group is also in debt to contractors including Germany's  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn) and thousands of staff.
AHAB has said al-Sanea, who married into the al-Gosaibi family more than 30 years ago, defrauded it of billions of dollars after he was put in charge of its financial businesses. He strongly denies wrongdoing.
Saudi Arabia has no insolvency rules though a bankruptcy law is awaiting King Salman's signature.
AHAB declined to comment for this article, citing the tribunal that is handling its case.
Saudi Arabia's Royal Court referred a request for comment to the government's Center for International Communication, which did not respond. The Ministry of Justice also did not respond to a request for comment.
Al-Sanea's detention was not directly related to the arrests of dozens of senior officials and businessmen in a crackdown on corruption in early November, but the dispute touches on similar investor concerns about graft.
He remains in detention while the last of the people held since early November in Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton Hotel, which had been used as an interrogation center, have been released or moved elsewhere. 
Al-Sanea has been sentenced to five years in jail in absentia in Bahrain for convictions including breaching central bank rules. The sentence has been stayed pending an appeal. Al-Sanea has previously denied any wrongdoing and said the charges were politically motivated. 
In a sign that some creditors are now more optimistic there will be a positive outcome to the debt dispute, Saad Group's debt has been trading up at 3 to 5 cents on the dollar in recent weeks, compared to 1 to 3 cents previously, bankers say. 
But some investors remain skeptical. A hedge fund trader who had been considering buying Saudi debt described the attempts by Saad's advisers to resolve the issue with creditors as a ""dog and pony show"" and said ""very little"" work had been done to reach a settlement since November.
Two other sources said Reemas was hoping to push forward in the coming weeks with a proposal to creditors receptive to its plans. Reemas Group did not respond to a request for comment.
STAR ASSET
The star asset in the al-Sanea family's business empire was the Saad Specialist Hospital in the coastal city of Khobar, one of the country's top cancer treatment facilities. 
It in effect ceased operating in November, saddled with debts and unable to pay wages or contractors, sources familiar with the situation said.
What happens at the hospital is being watched closely by foreign investors as it could set the tone for a government plan to attract overseas investment to the healthcare sector. 
A committee set up on the Royal Court's orders is considering options including bringing in a private company to operate the hospital under the Ministry of Health's guidance, two of the sources said.
The Ministry of Health did not respond to a request for comment.
One problem to resolve is the wages owed to an estimated 5,000 former staff, dating back to May 2016. It is unclear how many of the former staff, if any, will have jobs when the hospital reopens, possibly in February.
""There are thousands of people affected and a lot of people have families. It is difficult for people to live their lives without this money (wages),"" said Talaat Habib, a British pediatrician who worked at the hospital. 
Siemens is owed money over a contract to maintain the hospital's high-tech medical equipment, two sources familiar with the situation said. Siemens declined to comment.

TOKYO (Reuters) - An index of Asian shares swung into negative territory on Thursday, erasing earlier gains, as a late retreat in Chinese stocks pulled the benchmark lower and as concerns about rising interest rates softened investor sentiment.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.3 percent, still wobbly after Tuesday's 1.4 percent fall, and pulling away from earlier increases.
On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve flagged interest policy tightening later this year and upgraded its inflation outlook at its policy meeting, its first in 2018 and last to be chaired by Janet Yellen, who will be replaced by governor Jerome Powell on Feb 3. It kept interest rates on hold as expected.
In China, profit-taking ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays in mid-February, led to a correction, with Shenzhen shares hit the hardest, falling more than 3 percent to 6 1/2-month lows.
""Investors are sensitive to medium and small stocks which do not have strong fundamentals as negative news in the market curbed their risk appetite and offered them an excuse to sell some shares,"" said Ben Kwong, Chief operating officer at KGI Asia in Hong Kong.
Earlier on Thursday, Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, a private business survey, came at 51.5, matching December's reading, which was the highest in four months, showing growth in China's manufacturing sector remained elevated in January.
Japan's Nikkei, a major underperformer in the past couple of weeks, rose 1.7 percent from a four-week low hit the previous day.
U.S. S&P 500 mini futures gained 0.3 percent in Asian trade on Thursday, helped by 1.4 percent gains in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in after-hours trading following the company's solid earnings.
European shares are expected to track the gains, with spread-betters seeing a high opening of 0.3 percent in Britain's FTSE, Germany's Dax and France's Cac.
Later in the day, three U.S. tech giants, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) will announce earnings.
Investors have been expecting strong profit growth in U.S. firms due to sound global growth, with U.S. President Donald Trump's tax cuts seen giving an additional boost to Corporate America's bottom line.
Economic data released overnight underscored the strength of the global economy. ADP payrolls data in the United States showed job increases of 234,000 in January, 49,000 more than economists' forecast.
""The U.S. is cutting tax and spending $1.5 trillion in infrastructure when the economy is really strong. There would be little wonder if the economy overheats,"" said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
For a growing number of investors, the biggest worry now is that the economy may accelerate too fast, lifting inflation and prompting central banks to tighten their monetary policy faster.
The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note - the benchmark for world lending - briefly shot up to 2.754 percent, a level last seen in April 2014. It last stood at 2.725 percent.
Investors' inflation expectations have also risen to 3 1/2-year high of 2.12 percent based on the so-called breakeven inflation (BEI) rate calculated by the gap between conventional bonds and inflation-protected bonds. 
U.S. interest rate futures are now pricing in almost three rate hikes this year, compared to twice at the start of year, with some now talking about the possibility of four rate hikes.
""The dollar's weakness and higher oil prices are boosting inflation expectations in the United States, which in turn is boosting U.S. bond yields,"" said Shuji Shirota, head of macro economic strategy at HSBC Securities.
On Wall Street on Wednesday, the S&P 500 erased earlier gains to end almost flat, up 0.05 percent at 2,823.81. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.28 percent, however, most of the benchmark's gains were driven by a 4.9 percent rise in index heavyweight Boeing (NYSE:BA) following its strong earnings. Stripping out Boeing's rally, the index would have been down 0.18 percent.
Although rising U.S. yields lent some support for the dollar, the U.S. currency lacked momentum as investors are focusing more on a fresher theme of exit from stimulus in other economies, such as the euro zone.
The euro traded at $1.2420, consolidating after having hit a 3-year high of $1.2538 hit on Jan. 25, as investors bet the European Central Bank will be laying the groundwork for ending its asset purchase and raising interest rates.
The dollar changed hands at 109.33 yen, bouncing off a four-month low of 108.28 hit on Friday.
The British pound fetched $1.4200, after a 5.1 percent gain in January, its biggest since May 2009, owing to broad dollar weakness and expectations of a Brexit deal more favorable to the UK.
The Chinese yuan is also strengthening, with the Thomson Reuters/HKEX Global CNY index, rising to 97.14 , its highest level since June 2016, having risen 4.7 percent from its May 2017 low of 92.76.
Oil prices rebounded after their slide earlier this week as strong demand for gasoline and distillate products and news that OPEC countries maintained heavy supply cuts in January offset the impact of rise in U.S. oil inventories.

U.S. crude futures gained 0.1 percent to $64.79 per barrel in early trade after gaining 7.7 percent in January, the best month for the contract since September.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - American consumers are snapping up plentiful low-cost pork, but U.S. farmers are worried that trade spats with key export markets in China, Mexico and Canada could hurt a lucrative part of their pork business.
The domestic demand outlook remains bright thanks to the strong U.S. economy, upcoming spring grilling season and Easter holiday ham purchases. U.S. goods in general are attractive to foreign buyers thanks to the recent drop in the dollar.
However, trade disputes with China and slow progress in North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) talks have clouded prospects for U.S. pork exports, which are crucial for the industry, as roughly one quarter of pork produced in the United States is exported.
The U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) said U.S. pork exports were on a record pace, with volumes from January through November 2017 of 2.23 million tonnes, worth $5.9 billion. That was up from 2.09 million tonnes, worth $5.4 billion, for the same period in 2016, according to the industry group.
""Without a doubt, our biggest concern is the trade situation,"" said Steve Meyer, a Kerns and Associates economist and National Pork Producers Council consultant. 
President Donald Trump's decision to slap stiff tariffs on U.S. imports of Chinese solar panels and washing machines has sparked fear among pork producers of possible retribution from China, the world's largest consumer of pig meat and the U.S. pork sector's No. 3 market.
China trade is always risky, Meyer said, and ""the last deal over washing machines and solar panels didn't help anything.""
China is a growing market for U.S. pork, but pork muscle-cut exports trended lower in 2017 as China's domestic pork production increased, said USMEF.
""We live in an interconnected world. And when you put your thumb in someone's eye, they're likely try to jab back and put their thumb in your eye,"" said Linn Group analyst John Ginzel.
Separately, contentious NAFTA modernization discussions are drawing more attention as the United States spars with Mexico and Canada, the top- and fourth-ranked destinations for U.S. pork by volume. Progress has been slow after several rounds of talks, and concerns remain that the U.S. could withdraw from the agreement.
Canceling the agreement could threaten hog farmers' profits, which have been strong thanks to low-cost feed and strong demand throughout 2017. Those factors also enhanced the bottom lines for packers such as  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN).
""The hog industry is really strong because everything is lining up right now,"" said Marshall, Minnesota hog farmer Greg Boerboom. Farmers have cut input costs by using nutrients from pig manure on crops instead of commercial fertilizer, Boerboom said. 
As of Dec. 1, there were 73.2 million hogs on U.S. farms, most since 1943, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and packers produced a record 25.6 billion pounds of pork, according to independent industry analyst Bob Brown and Livestock Marketing Information Center’s Jim Robb. 
Boerboom said potentially losing NAFTA is a bigger threat to his livelihood than disputes with China because Mexico and Canada share common borders and have been viable markets for the United States.

""You want to keep the customers you have before you start worrying about new ones. So I really think about Mexico, Canada and even Japan and South Korea more than I do China,"" said Boerboom.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's start-up board ChiNext is staring at its worst weekly loss in 21 months, with a profusion of once-acquisitive companies issuing profit warnings as they bite the bullet after overpaying for their purchases.
The over 6 percent loss in ChiNext this week brings the gauge close to a three-year-low, as a growing list of small-caps, such as outdoor products maker Toread and Hunan China Sun Pharmaceutical Machinery Co flagged losses or sharp profit falls due to goodwill impairment.
Goodwill - intangible asset that arises when one company acquires another for a premium value - has exploded following China's mergers & acquisition (M&A) boom in 2013-2015.
The painful adjustment comes as Beijing took measures to restrict reckless expansion and tighten liquidity taps, prompting companies to acknowledge they overpaid.
Pan Jiang, CEO of money manager Shanghai V-invest Co, sees the roughly $160 billion worth of goodwill sitting on the books of China's listed companies as ""the sword of Damocles"" that will haunt investors for years to come, especially among small-caps whose growth was heavily reliant on M&As.
""Organic growth of these companies don't support their lofty valuations. Only when the (M&A) tide goes out do you discover who has been swimming naked,"" Pan said.
""The intangible assets on these companies' books are landmines. Once they explode, damage can be stunning.""
Moreover, despite the ChiNext's nearly 60 percent slump from its 2015 peak, ""risk has not yet been fully exposed,"" Pan said.
In the searing selloff this week, Toread was among the firms that took a battering with its stock price dramatically sliced by over 15 percent.
In its preliminary earnings statement, the company said it had swung to a loss in 2017, after writing off over 200 million yuan worth of assets including goodwill.
Intangible asset write-downs also contributed to an expected loss of 11.6 billion yuan flagged by Leshi Internet, the struggling Chinese video-streaming firm which was once seen as a ChiNext bellwether.
Other companies which disclosed goodwill impairment this week include Sumavision Technologies, Hybio Pharmaceutical and All Winner Technology, and the list is expected to grow as China heads into the earnings season.
""Goodwill was created on the basis of many assumptions,"" said Lin Xiaofan, Shanghai-based partner at accounting firm PwC.
""As time goes by, whether those assumptions still stand, is a big question mark.""

636,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2018 12:02AM ET</span>","Exclusive: With Roman law doctrine, India moves to stub out tobacco industry rights","By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government is pushing the Supreme Court to apply a rarely used doctrine that would strip the $11 billion tobacco industry's legal right to trade, an effort aimed at deterring tobacco companies from challenging tough new regulations.
New Delhi has for the first time asked the top court to classify tobacco as ""res extra commercium"", a Latin phrase meaning ""outside commerce,"" according to a Reuters review of previously unreported court filing by the Health Ministry on Jan. 8.
If applied, the doctrine - which harkens back to Roman law - would have far reaching implications: in denying an industry's legal standing to trade, it gives authorities more leeway to impose restrictions.
For example, the Supreme Court's application of the doctrine to alcohol in the 1970s paved the way for at least two Indian states to ban it completely and allowed courts to take a stricter stance while regulating liquor - something constitutional law experts say could happen with tobacco if a similar ruling was made.
""The effects of tobacco are much more than even alcohol ... It will be a fillip to this drive against tobacco,"" said government lawyer R. Balasubramanian, who is acting on behalf of the Ministry of Health in pursuing the designation.
Balasubramanian, however, said the government is not discussing banning tobacco and the goal of invoking the Roman law doctrine was only to curtail the industry's legal rights.
CURBS AND RESTRICTIONS
With an aim to curb tobacco consumption - which kills more than 900,000 people each year in India - the government has in recent years raised tobacco taxes, started smoking cessation campaigns and introduced laws requiring covering most of the package in health warnings.
But a court in southern Karnataka state last month quashed those labeling rules after the tobacco industry successfully argued the measure was ""unreasonable"" and violated its right to trade.
The government this month appealed the ruling in the Supreme Court which put on hold the Karnataka court order. The top court will next hear the case on March 12.
In its filing, the government included ""res extra commercium"" because it wants to stop the industry from pursuing such arguments again, said Balasubramanian.
Seeking to apply the doctrine to tobacco, the government argued it should have the power ""to regulate business and to mitigate evils"" to safeguard public health, the court filing showed.
Sajan Poovayya, a senior lawyer representing top Indian cigarette maker ITC Ltd and Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) Inc's Indian partner, Godfrey Phillips, said the industry's legal rights would be severely limited if the court applies the doctrine to tobacco.
Poovayya said he would fight the government's argument ""tooth and nail"" and make a case that taking away the industry's right to trade would imperil millions of Indian farmers who depend on tobacco for their living. The industry estimates 45.7 million people in India depend on tobacco for their living.
""India is a tobacco growing country and there's a need to look at the interest of those people who are already in the sector,"" Poovayya said.
""Tobacco is not destructive to health. If tobacco is, sugar is as well.""
ITC and Godfrey Phillips, as well as India's health ministry, did not respond to requests for comment.
In a statement to Reuters, Philip Morris International said the company ""is not a party to the lawsuit challenging India's warning labels"" and that it complies with labeling rules in the country.
SET A PRECEDENT
India's tobacco labeling rules, which mandate 85 percent of a cigarette pack's surface be covered in health warnings, have been a sticking point between the government and the tobacco industry since they were enforced in 2016.
That year, the industry briefly shut factories across the country in protest and filed dozens of legal cases challenging the rules.
The federal health ministry says stringent health warnings on packages help reduce consumption of tobacco by making people aware of its ill-effects. A government survey last year found 62 percent of cigarette smokers thought of quitting because of warning labels on the packets.
Mary Assunta, a long-time tobacco control advocate and a senior policy advisor at the Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance, said she had never heard of a country applying the ""res extra commercium"" doctrine to tobacco, but hoped India would set a precedent.
""Such a classification will help protect tobacco control measures from being challenged, particularly for developing countries where the bulk of the smokers are,"" Assunta said.
The doctrine would open the door to an outright ban on tobacco sales if a state so wished, said Pratibha Jain, a partner at law firm Nishith Desai Associates and a specialist in Indian constitutional law.

""It gives the state autonomy to completely ban trade in tobacco,"" Jain said. ""It gives governments the constitutional cover that will protect future litigation. The industry will lose significant ground as your protection of right to trade is gone.""

HANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - It has no physical branches or expensive foreign software, and uses cloud technology to cut back on the hardware it needs to serve borrowers.
MYbank, a Chinese online lender that is an offshoot of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd, has built its business on doing things cheaply. 
The bank says it can deliver loans to borrowers across China at lightning speeds for up to 1,000 times less than it would cost brick-and-mortar banks to do so.
MYbank expects double-digit increases in all growth measures in 2017 due to lower costs enabled by technology, the bank's president, Huang Hao, said in an interview at his office in Hangzhou, in the eastern province of Zhejiang. 
He called the results ""very satisfying"", but declined to elaborate.
Established in 2015, the privately held MYbank employs about 300 people, half of whom are technicians. It promises to approve loans in under three minutes without any human involvement, thanks to the bank's in-house technology.
As a result, the cost of approving a small business loan can be as little as 2 yuan, compared to at least 2,000 yuan ($317.97) at a traditional bank, according to data provided by the bank. MYbank has built its technological infrastructure with Chinese-made technology, avoiding more expensive products from companies like  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Corp,  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) and Dell EMC (NYSE:EMC), which form the network backbone for much of China's finance sector, Huang said.
""My costs would have been unbearably high,"" Huang said, referring to using systems from the U.S. companies. ""In the future we will have a tremendous amount of users and high volume of demand. So I need scalable, inexpensive systems."" Dell said China was its second largest market outside the United States. ""We have many successful customer cases in China's banking sector,"" the company said in a statement.
Oracle declined to comment. IBM did not immediately comment.
MYbank is 30 percent owned by Ant Financial Services Group, an Alibaba affiliate. Alibaba and Ant Financial have provided MYbank with cloud-computing expertise and helped MYbank with developing big data, artificial intelligence and facial recognition to facilitate lending, Huang said.
BETTING ON FARMERS
MYbank is one of a handful of Chinese lenders - along with Tencent Holdings Ltd's WeBank - that are founded completely with private investment. Since mid-2015, MYbank has served more than 7 million small business owners, Huang said. The bank is seeking to expand its network to include China's 70 million to 100 million small businesses under-served by traditional financial institutions.
Funding for those borrowers has traditionally been scarce, as they have little to no collateral.
But for MYbank, such unsecured lending has been profitable. The bank's net interest margin - around 3 to 5 percent - is higher than those for China's major banks, which target large state companies, Huang said.
""Interest margins for small business lending has always been higher than loans to large corporates,"" Huang said. That's due to the higher risks associated with lending to small businesses.
MYbank's non-performing loan ratio, at around 1 percent, is also well below those of conventional lenders when it comes to lending to small businesses, thanks to risk assessment models based on big data, Huang said.
Beijing's intensifying deleveraging campaign to reduce risks in China's financial system is unlikely to hurt MYbank's lending business, Huang said, as the government is not targeting small businesses and the rural sector. MYbank had offered 441.3 billion yuan in loans by end-October, with an average loan size of 8,000 yuan, according to data provided by the bank.
'DUTY OF INNOVATION'
One challenge the company faces is that, without a physical branch to take client deposits, MYbank has relied heavily on borrowed funds from other lenders through China's interbank market. Those loans tend to be a much more expensive source of funds compared with normal deposits. Interbank funding comprises 60 percent of its total liabilities, while the remaining 40 percent consists of deposits, Huang said.
At the moment, MYbank's cost of funding is around 5-6 percent, similar to mid-tier banks, Huang said.
Commercial lenders are required by regulators to cap their interbank funding under one-third of their total liabilities.
So far, MYbank hasn't received any regulatory order to modify its liability structure, Huang said.
""Online banks and private banks are still new things in China. Compared with traditional financial institutions, they carry the duty of innovation in certain areas, so regulators apply special guidance.""

641,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 10:05PM ET</span>",Facebook forecasts rising ad sales despite dip in usage,"By David Ingram and Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) offered reassurances to investors on Wednesday that its digital ad business would remain highly profitable, despite a dip in usage on the social media network and an overhaul of its flagship News Feed.
The company said in an earnings report that quarterly revenue jumped 47 percent from a year earlier, and executives said on a conference call that they saw more chances to make money even if people spend less time on Facebook. 
Analysts had wondered about the resilience of the world's largest social media network, which is making changes to its products to deter foreign influence campaigns like ones that it says Russia has carried out and to stem the spread of sensationalism. 
Facebook added to jitters after the bell on Wednesday when, in its earnings report, it said that at the end of last year time spent by users had fallen by about 50 million hours a day. Shares fell more than 4 percent in after-hours trading. 
Shortly afterward, though, Facebook executives expressed optimism on the call with analysts, saying the changes they were making in response to criticism would be healthy for the business in the long term and might not even hurt much in the short term. 
""I want to be clear: The most important driver of our business has never been time spent by itself. It's the quality of the conversations and connections,"" Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on the call. 
The upbeat forecast led to a rebound in shares, which in late after-hours trading were up 1.4 percent at $189.50. 
Facebook management ""acknowledged things that maybe most investors weren't thinking about before - the reduction of users and usage - but at the same time they pointed to a lot of positive trends on their other platforms,"" Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said. 
Although Facebook usage is down, he said, ""One shouldn't be reflectively negative on this."" 
Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg told analysts that recent changes to reduce disinformation on Facebook could create ""more monetization opportunities."" 
Sandberg said she was optimistic about potential revenue from ads on ""stories"" on Facebook and Instagram, while Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said the average price per ad increased 43 percent in quarter. 
""They said average revenue per ad was up a lot, that quality of ads has improved, and that the engagement declines were not meaningful,"" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said. 
""In other words, better quality engagement and better ability to target ads. The street probably likes that,"" he said. 
Facebook said that time spent was falling at the end of last year by about 50 million hours a day due to changes that it said reduced viral videos, even before the company announced a series of changes to the News Feed that may further reduce user engagement. 
Facebook's 1.40 billion daily active users was up 14 percent from a year earlier, but below analysts' estimate of 1.41 billion for the fourth quarter, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. 
The number of daily users in the United States and Canada fell for the first time in Facebook's history, dipping in the company's home market by 700,000 from a quarter earlier to 184 million. Wehner said the number would ""fluctuate"" in the future. 
Total revenue, though, showed little impact, rising 47 percent to $12.97 billion and beating analysts' estimate of $12.55 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Wehner reiterated Facebook's earlier guidance on expenses, telling analysts on the call that expenses would likely grow 45 percent to 60 percent during 2018. The spending spree includes thousands of new workers to review content posted by users.
The overhaul of Facebook's New Feed was prompted in part by its disclosure last year that Russian agents used Facebook to try to sway American voters from 2015 to 2017, an allegation that Moscow denies. Facebook said 126 million Americans may have seen Russian-backed political ads and posts. 
In the fourth quarter, net income attributable to Facebook shareholders rose to $4.27 billion, or $1.44 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from $3.56 billion, or $1.21 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding a tax provision, the company earned $2.21 per share, topping analysts' estimates of $1.95, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Facebook said it increased its provision for 2017 income taxes by $2.27 billion, citing U.S. tax changes.

The university said in a statement that it will be the first time it has removed a donor name from a building or institute. It said the change is subject to board and state approval. 
The facility, part of the university's Carver College of Medicine in Iowa City, was named for Wynn in 2013 in recognition of his commitment to give $25 million toward research on a cure for hereditary blindness, the university said. 
It will now be called the Institute for Vision Research, officials said.
The naming of the institute was not a condition of the gift, the university noted. Wynn has donated $20 million so far, which has increased the institute's research scope, the university said. 
 Wynn Resorts Ltd  (O:WYNN) spokesman Michael Weaver declined comment. 
Nevada state regulators have opened an investigation into sexual misconduct accusations by former and current employees against Wynn, Karl Bennison, enforcement chief for the Nevada Gaming Control Board, said in an email to Reuters.
The allegations were reported by The Wall Street Journal last week. The newspaper reported that a $7.5 million settlement was paid in 2005 to a manicurist who said Wynn forced her to have sex with him. Reuters has not independently confirmed the allegations against Wynn.
The billionaire founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Wynn Resorts has denied the allegations as ""preposterous"" and accused his ex-wife of instigating them for her own gain in litigation against him and his company. His former spouse, Elaine Wynn, has denied through her lawyer that she did any such thing.
Wynn is building a casino in Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Gaming Commission is now reviewing the license granted to a Wynn Resorts subsidiary, commission documents said. 
During a meeting on Wednesday regarding the allegations against Wynn, Karen Wells, the commission's head of investigations and enforcement, said a $7.5 million settlement was not previously disclosed to investigators, according to her statement posted online.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Celltrion Inc shares fell on Thursday after the pharmaceutical company said it had received a warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
Investors appeared to be taking the chance to book profits following the stock's nearly 200 percent rise since the end of 2016 on the back of the bright outlook for its cut-price copies of blockbuster biotech drugs, analysts said. 
""The FDA issue was first raised last year, and it wasn't for a production issue, it was a packaging issue. This appears to be another adjustment currently happening to pharma stocks,"" Shin Hyun-joon, analyst at Hanwha Securities, said. 
The Korea SE Pharmaceutical Index, which tracks South Korean pharma stocks, became volatile in January after jumping 63 percent in 2017. It dipped as much as 11 percent last week before rebounding. 
Celltrion shares fell 5 percent on Thursday, compared to a 0.2 percent gain in the wider market.
The FDA letter to Celltrion raised issues about its pharmaceutical manufacturing process, Celltrion said in a statement on its website. 
The request was part of a routine process for the pharmaceutical industry and the response would be supplied in 15 business days as required, a Celltrion spokeswoman said. 
The European regulator had verified in early January that the quality of its copies of rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade, cancer drug Rituxan and breast cancer drug Herceptin were up to standard, the company said. 
""Celltrion remains confident in the safety and efficacy of its products"" manufactured at its site in Incheon, South Korea, the company said. 

Celltrion has received approval for its Remicade biosimilar in the United States and Europe, and for its Rituxan biosimilar in Europe.

China's smartphone market in 2017 was weaker than expected with 4G handset shipments down 11 percent, according to Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. 
""Performance of the current quarter is weighed down by Apple and China,"" Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy said.
""If there wasn't the Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) bid the stock might be down 5 percent instead ... I don't think investors are focused really on the near term operating results or even guidance at this point,"" he said.
Shares of the company were marginally lower in late trade.
The company's CDMA technologies unit, its largest business, saw a 13 percent rise in revenue to $4.65 billion in the first quarter ended Dec. 24. But licensing revenue dropped 28 percent to $1.30 billion, weighed down by a dispute with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Apple sued Qualcomm last January, accusing it of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates.
""We remain open to finding a path to resolution (with Apple),"" Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf said on a call with analysts.
The company forecast second-quarter revenue of $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share of 65 cents to 75 cents, below analysts' estimates for revenue of $5.58 billion and earnings of 85 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
In the first quarter, Qualcomm posted a net loss of $5.95 billion due to a $6 billion charge for new U.S. tax laws and a $868 million charge for a fine imposed by the Korea Fair Trade Commission.
Excluding items, Qualcomm earned 98 cents per share, topping analysts' average estimate of 91 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Revenue rose 1.2 percent to $6.07 billion and exceeded estimates of $5.93 billion.
Qualcomm is in the midst of closing its long-pending $38-billion deal to buy automotive chip maker NXP Semiconductors. In November, it rebuffed a $103-billion takeover bid by Broadcom Ltd.

However, the company expressed confidence it could drive growth and that U.S. corporate tax cuts would ""positively impact"" future earnings of its operations in the country. 
Tax reforms signed into law in December lower the income tax rate for U.S. firms to 21 percent from 35 percent.
Lenovo, a unit of Legend Holdings, reported a loss of $289 million for the three months to December, versus a $98 million profit a year ago. It had in January said it expected to incur a one-off charge for the nine months ended in December due to a reassessment of U.S. deferred tax assets. 
The company's revenue for the quarter was $12.94 billion, up slightly from $12.17 billion a year ago.
Lenovo said its core PC and smart devices business group posted an 8 percent rise in revenue to $9.25 billion as sales exceeded shipments growth, on better average selling prices driven by innovative products and a better product mix.
Its struggling mobile business reported a narrower operating loss before taxation of $92 million, versus a loss of $132 million in the second quarter.
""The group now has a stronger organization with sharper customer focus and more compelling product portfolio across all its businesses,"" Lenovo said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Thursday.
""Coupled with strong execution, the group remains confident it can build leading positions in every business the group enters and drive profitable growth.""

(Reuters) - EBay Inc posted higher revenue for the key holiday quarter on Wednesday as changes to its websites and a focus on marketing drew more shoppers to its marketplaces.
Shares of the San Jose, California-based e-commerce company climbed nearly 9 percent to a record high in after-hours trading on Wednesday.
EBay has modified its platforms, including its namesake shopping service, to include grouped listings and a simpler payment process to lure shoppers amid stiff competition from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
""The biggest surprise from the quarter was the acceleration in growth of the core U.S. Marketplace business, which sets eBay on a stronger trajectory entering 2018,"" Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said.
EBay said its gross merchandise volume — the value of all goods sold on its websites — climbed 9.7 percent to $24.43 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. Sales and marketing expenses rose 13.3 percent to $689 million.
In a blog post, eBay said on Wednesday it has signed an agreement with Adyen to become its primary payments processing partner. 
PayPal Holdings Inc would still remain a payment option as eBay expects the ""transition to full payments intermediation will be a multi-year journey.""
EBay said it would move as quickly as possible to complete the transition within the parameters of its deal with PayPal, which remains in place through mid-2020. PayPal was spun off from eBay in 2015.
The e-commerce company said in a post-earnings call that the operating agreement with PayPal ""has not been extended and it will not be extended.""
""With the announcement that eBay will begin to take over payments on the marketplace from PayPal, this opens up new revenue and profit opportunities over the long term,"" said Sebastian.
For the quarter ending March, eBay forecast revenue between $2.57 billion and $2.61 billion and adjusted earnings of 52 cents to 54 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 52 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose 9.1 percent to $2.61 billion. EBay recorded a $2.6 billion loss for the quarter because of a one-time $3.1 billion charge from the recent changes in U.S. tax laws.
Excluding one-time items, eBay earned 59 cents per share.
EBay said it would take a $1.9 billion tax charge related to the repatriation of its foreign earnings, though the charge would largely be offset thanks to accounting from years earlier.
D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte said in a recent note that repatriation could serve as a catalyst for additional mergers and acquisitions in the United States for eBay.

EBay on Wednesday also announced a $6 billion share buyback program.

(Reuters) -  PayPal Holdings Inc 's (O:PYPL) shares fell as much as 12 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday after former parent company eBay Inc (O:EBAY) said it had signed up a new primary payment processor.
EBay said it will start processing payments globally using Dutch payments company Adyen, allowing its users to remain on the eBay website when checking out.
PayPal said eBay shoppers will still be able to select PayPal as a form of payment until at least July 2023. The news from eBay came as PayPal reported quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street estimates but gave a disappointing outlook for the first quarter. PayPal shares initially fell 5 percent after the release of the quarterly results.
The chief executive officer of PayPal, Dan Schulman, said on a call with analysts that the changing relationship with eBay was very ""manageable"" and that it was in line with PayPal's new strategy.
EBay accounts for roughly 13 percent of total payments processed by PayPal.
PayPal was spun out of eBay in 2015 and has since been working to transform itself from a company that mainly processed payments for its parent company to one that processes payments for other large companies and their customers, as well as for individuals paying family and friends.
PayPal's new strategic direction has led to partnerships with numerous large financial institutions and big technology companies including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc’s (O:GOOG) Google, Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Mastercard Inc (N:MA),  Visa Inc  (N:V) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM).
San Jose, California-based PayPal forecast first-quarter adjusted earnings of 52 cents to 54 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 54 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
PayPal expects revenue for the full year of $15 billion to $15.25 billion. Analysts had been forecasting $15.16 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
PayPal's focus on partnerships and acquisitions have been paying off with growth in payment volumes and users.
The company processed $131 billion in payments in the fourth quarter, up 32 percent from a year earlier, and added 8.7 million active customers.
PayPal has been looking to freshen its brand and deepen usage with younger customers through its peer-to-peer payments app Venmo. Venmo processed around $35 billion in payments in 2017, up 97 percent.
PayPal's net income rose to $620 million, or 50 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $390 million, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 55 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 52 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Net revenue climbed to $3.74 billion from $2.98 billion.

The results included a net tax expense of $180 million connected to the recent U.S. tax reform, the company said.

David Solomon, the Wall Street bank's co-president and co-chief operating officer, said Goldman has been accelerating its recruiting efforts over the past year to attract more women. The percentage of women in its 2018 full-time analyst class was in the high-40s, he said, up from the low-40s last year. 
Still, it will take more time to see full workforce parity, Solomon added. 
""We've made a bunch of progress in the last 20 years in financial services, but not nearly enough,"" he said at an event at the New York Stock Exchange on women in leadership positions. 
Solomon is on the short list of contenders who may one day succeed Lloyd Blankfein as Goldman's chief executive, as is Harvey Schwartz, who shares the same titles as Solomon. Asked why there are three men at the top of the fifth=largest U.S. bank, Solomon replied, ""Hopefully, one day, that will be different."" 
Also at the event was Mary Callahan Erdoes, head of JPMorgan Chase & Co's (N:JPM) asset management business, who is also considered a potential successor to her boss, CEO Jamie Dimon. 
Nearly half of JPMorgan's operating committee is comprised of women, something that happened naturally , not by quota, she said. She added, though, that quotas can be a good jump start. 
""It is all about how you run the company to make it reflective of society that we're living,"" she said. ""How do you have a company that's run by one color of people, or one gender of people, or one religion of people? It just doesn't work.” 

Macy's Inc (N:M) Executive Chairman Terry Lundgren said that having women at the table helps companies make better decisions, while CIBC CEO Victor Dodig said he wished stock analysts would more often ask about diversity on quarterly earnings calls.

Positions in various business units and roles across the organization were impacted, Sears spokesman Howard Riefs told Reuters.
The move is part of the department store chain's ongoing restructuring plan to get back to profitability, Riefs said.
The news was first reported by CNBC. 
The company, led by billionaire hedge fund investor Eddie Lampert, has been shutting stores and cutting jobs aggressively to turn a profit in 2018 following six years of losses. 
Earlier this month, the company said it was closing 103 unprofitable Kmart and Sears stores.
Once the largest U.S. retailer, Sears is saddled with $3.3 billion in debt and is trying to boost liquidity after warning last March that it had doubts of continuing as a going concern.

Shares of the company fell 2.5 percent to $2.59 in afternoon trading on Wednesday. They had tumbled more than 60 percent in 2017.

(Reuters) -  Mondelez International Inc  (O:MDLZ), the world's No. 2 confectionary company, posted a quarterly profit that beat estimates on Wednesday, benefiting from strong demand for Cadbury Dairy Milk and Oreo cookies in Europe and growth in emerging markets.
Revenue from Europe, its largest market, rose 5 percent and accounted for nearly 40 percent of total revenue.
However, revenue from North America fell 0.6 percent, as its biscuits business was affected by malware-related losses.
The snack giant was hit by a cyber attack last year that hurt shipment volumes, leading to a $100 million loss in revenue for the full year.
""Since the malware incident last summer, our supply chain execution has been challenged (in North America),"" newly-appointed Chief Executive Dirk Van de Put said on a post-earnings conference call on Wednesday. 
""While we are making progress, returning to normal service levels is taking longer than anticipated,"" he said.
The East Hanover, New Jersey-based company said its net revenue rose to $6.97 billion, meeting analysts' average estimate of $6.97 billion.
Net income rose to $802 million, or 53 cents per share in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $93 million, or 6 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, Mondelez earned 57 cents per share, just brushing past estimates of 56 cents.
""Moving forward we believe that Mondelez needs to find a more permanent solution to their difficulties in North America,"" said Anthony Riva, an analyst at GlobalData Retail. 
The company said it expects double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth on a constant currency basis for 2018. 
Mondelez also expects organic net revenue to increase 1 percent to 2 percent for 2018 and adjusted operating income margin of about 17 percent.

Shares of the confectionery, food and beverage company were flat in extended trading on Wednesday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - AT&T Inc (N:T) reported quarterly profit that beat analysts' estimates on Wednesday, helped by tax cuts and new wireless subscribers, and its chief executive voiced confidence the company will complete its $85.4 billion acquisition of  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX). 
The U.S. Department of Justice sued to block the deal last year on grounds that it was anticompetitive. A trial is slated to begin on March 19.
""While we remain open to finding some reasonable solutions to address the government's concern, we do expect this case will ultimately be litigated in court,"" Chief Executive Randall Stephenson told analysts on a conference call. He added, ""We remain very confident that we'll complete this merger."" 
Shares were up 3.8 percent to $38.87 in after-hours trading. 
AT&T reported a net addition of 329,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill in the quarter, helped by lower customer attrition and a ""buy one, get one free"" promotion for the iPhone 8. The No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier lost 67,000 subscribers a year earlier.
AT&T, which owns satellite television service DirecTV, said it lost 207,000 traditional U.S. video subscribers in the quarter as more consumers drop their pay-TV packages. It added 368,000 to its cheaper DirecTV Now streaming service.
Providing video entertainment on phones has taken on greater importance as AT&T slugs it out with industry leader  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) and smaller rivals Sprint Corp (N:S) and T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS) for customers in a saturated wireless market.
AT&T's planned acquisition of Time Warner, originally announced in October 2016, reflects an effort to turn itself into a media powerhouse that can bundle mobile service with video. 
Net income attributable to AT&T in the fourth quarter was $19.0 billion, or $3.08 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, up from $2.4 billion, or 39 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
Excluding items, the company reported earnings of 78 cents per share, which included a 13-cent impact from tax cuts signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump late last year. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 65 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Revenue was $41.7 billion, compared with $41.8 billion in the year-earlier period. Analysts had expected $41.2 billion. 
For 2018, AT&T said including impacts from tax cuts and a new accounting standard, it expects earnings per share in the $3.50 range, free cash flow of about $21 billion and capital expenditures of $25 billion.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has dropped its bribery case against Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, lifting a cloud that had hovered over his expected 2018 reelection bid and removing a potential distraction for his party in a key election year.
Menendez, a longtime fixture of New Jersey politics, was accused of accepting gifts from a wealthy benefactor, ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, in exchange for official favors.
His first criminal trial ended last year in a mistrial after a jury could not come to a unanimous verdict, and federal prosecutors had said this month they would seek to retry him.
""From the very beginning, I never wavered in my innocence and my belief that justice would prevail,"" Menendez said in a statement. ""I am grateful that the Department of Justice has taken the time to reevaluate its case and come to the appropriate conclusion."" 
Abbe David Lowell, Menendez's attorney, added: ""We are pleased and grateful that the Justice Department made the right decision to end this case.""
The Justice Department's decision marks a major political victory not only for Menendez, but also for the Democratic Party, which is hoping to regain control of the U.S. Senate in the upcoming midterm elections in November.
A court order posted on Monday afternoon formally dismissed the case at the Justice Department's request.
The decision came days after U.S. District Judge William Walls threw out some of the bribery charges on the grounds that prosecutors had failed to show that about $660,000 in political contributions from Melgen to help benefit Menendez's 2012 reelection campaign were part of any fraudulent scheme.
Walls said the mere fact that some of the money arrived around the same time that Menendez took actions that could benefit Melgen was not enough to prove a ""quid pro quo"" arrangement.
""Given the impact of the court's Jan. 24 order on the charges and the evidence admissible in a retrial, the United States has determined that it will not retry the defendants on the remaining charges,"" the Justice Department said in a statement.
The department also said on Wednesday that it was dropping federal charges against Melgen.
In a statement, Melgen's attorney Kirk Ogrosky said his client ""is now and has always been innocent.""
""We take no pleasure in seeing justice done at this stage in a case that should never have been brought. All that said, justice today is better than continuing on to inevitable acquittals on the remaining counts,"" he added.

Melgen was separately convicted for Medicare fraud in Florida and is awaiting sentencing in that case.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - A recent trade decision allowing Bombardier (TO:BBDb) to sell its newest jets in the United States without hefty duties will boost airline confidence in the program, but the Canadian planemaker still faces challenges to win over lessors,  Air Lease Corp  (N:AL) Chief Executive John Plueger said on Wednesday.
Bombardier and European planemaker Airbus SE (PA:AIR), which plans to take a majority stake in the CSeries this year, still must convince leasing heavyweights that the 110-to-130-seat CSeries jets has a vast enough customer base to preserve their value and competitive pricing to win orders, Plueger.
Air Lease Corp is a major leasing firm with about $15 billion in total assets.
Last week, the U.S. International Trade Commission handed an unexpected victory to Bombardier against  Boeing Co  (N:BA). ITC commissioners voted 4-0 that Bombardier's prices did not harm Boeing and discarded a U.S. Commerce Department recommendation to slap a near 300 percent duty on sales of the company's CSeries jets for five years. The ITC did not give a reason immediately for its decision.
The decision ""removes that very, very large question mark on the CSeries (imports) into the United States,"" Plueger said by phone. ""Bottom line: It's a big positive for U.S. carriers, but I think it goes beyond U.S. carriers."" 
Having an adequate customer base is vital for lessors, which want to make sure there is sufficient demand by airlines for multiple leases. The CSeries has a backlog of 372 firm orders.
Air Lease Corp did not order the CSeries in the past because ""the price and the risk was not a good tradeoff,"" when compared to Boeing's 737 MAX line and Airbus's A320 NEO family, Plueger said. 
""Those two things have been a challenge,"" Plueger said of the CSeries. ""To the extent that Airbus's ownership can help on those two points - customer base and price - that will be a positive. It remains to be seen on both of those points.""

Earlier on Wednesday, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told analysts during a conference call that Boeing is waiting to see the reasoning behind the ITC's ruling before deciding whether to take further steps in the trade case.

676,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",Argentina companies list on U.S. exchanges ahead of expected rate hikes,"By Walter Bianchi
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine companies are rushing to list shares on U.S. exchanges beginning this week to beat an expected hike in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve, analysts said, while taking advantage of an improved investor climate under President Mauricio Macri after years of populist rule.
Airport operator Corporación América Airports (N:CAAP) and power generator Central Puerto SA (BA:CEPU) are expected to raise $1.4 billion between them in listings this week. 
Biotech firm Bioceres is expected to raise some $140 million with a listing next week, while food processor Molino Cañuelas (BA:MOLC), energy producer Genneia [EMGSD.UL] and real estate developer TGLT (BA:TGLT) also have both local share sales and international IPOs in the pipeline. 
""There is still plenty of money available in global markets. They are taking advantage of the moment ahead of the Fed's promised interest rate hike,"" said Héctor Scasserra, head of brokerage Arpenta Valores and a board member of Argentina's Bolsas y Mercados Argentinos (BA:BYMA) stock exchange.
An increase in rates by the Fed would likely dampen investor interest in equities. Companies are also seeking to take advantage of a positive outlook for growth in Argentina and investor enthusiasm for Macri's business-friendly policies. 
The Fed kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but it is expected to raise borrowing costs in March under incoming central bank chief Jerome Powell.
While many of their Latin American peers have listed on international exchanges in recent years, Argentine companies largely held back, as investors were weary of former President Cristina Fernandez's interventionist policies. 
Since taking office in December 2015, Macri has sought to attract foreign investment and develop capital markets. He ended a holding period of foreign capital, passed a reduction of corporate tax rates in an overhaul of Argentina's tax system, and is pushing reforms to labor and capital markets laws.
""The table is set and there are optimistic growth expectations for these companies,"" said Joaquin Bagües, an analyst at Balanz Capital in Buenos Aires.

Central Puerto could price its 35.5 million share offering at $1.85 per share, while Corporacion America will likely price at the upper end of its $19-$23 per share range to strong demand from funds with exposure to emerging markets, according to consultancy Delphos Investment.

716,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>",Former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan Sees Bubbles in Stocks and Bonds,"(Bloomberg) -- The man who made the term “irrational exuberance” famous says investors are at it again.
“There are two bubbles: We have a stock market bubble, and we have a bond market bubble,” Alan Greenspan, 91, said Wednesday on Bloomberg Television with Tom Keene and Scarlet Fu. Greenspan, who led the Federal Reserve from 1987 until 2006, memorably used the phrase to describe asset values during the 1990’s dot-com bubble.
Greenspan’s comments come as stock indexes remain near record highs, despite selling off in recent days, and as the yields on government notes and bonds hover not far from historic lows. Interest rates are expected to move up in coming years as the Fed continues with a campaign to gradually tighten monetary policy.
“At the end of the day, the bond market bubble will eventually be the critical issue, but for the short term it’s not too bad,” Greenspan said. “But we’re working, obviously, toward a major increase in long-term interest rates, and that has a very important impact, as you know, on the whole structure of the economy.”
The Fed on Wednesday opted to leave rates unchanged and markets are pricing in an increase at the central bank’s March meeting.
Greenspan sounded an alarm on forecasts that the U.S. government deficit will continue to climb as a share of gross domestic product. He said he was “surprised” that President Donald Trump didn’t specify how he would fund new government initiatives in Tuesday’s State of the Union speech. The president last month signed into law about $1.5 trillion in tax cuts that critics say will further balloon the budget gap.
U.S. Raises Longer-Term Debt Sales as Budget Deficit Worsens
Greenspan blamed the growing fiscal shortfall for his bond call.
“What’s behind the bubble? Well the fact, that, essentially, we’re beginning to run an ever-larger government deficit,” Greenspan said. As a share of GDP, “debt has been rising very significantly” and “we’re just not paying enough attention to that.”"

The board will need to decide if the deal is now attractive enough to CBS shareholders to overshadow concerns that scuttled a proposed tie-up pushed by Sumner and his daughter Shari Redstone in 2016. 
The CBS board meeting is regularly scheduled and no announcement may come out of it, said the sources, who wished to remain anonymous because they are not permitted to speak to the media. 
Viacom and CBS spokespeople declined to comment.
Viacom Chief Executive Bob Bakish and CBS CEO Leslie Moonves talked about the potential merger earlier this month, Reuters reported.
Viacom's Nickelodeon and MTV networks and Paramount films could help broadcast-focused CBS' All Access streaming service become more competitive, and the combined company could also better negotiate with cable and satellite distributors.
""They might be better able to develop more robust OTT offerings faster as a combined entity,"" said Michael Nathanson, analyst with Moffett Nathanson, referring to ""over the top"" streaming.
Some could argue Viacom's international presence is now more important for CBS given the rapid decline in U.S. cable subscriptions, some analysts have noted.
Walt Disney Co's recent deal to buy Twenty-First Century Fox Inc assets has stoked a fresh push from Shari Redstone to rejoin the companies her father split in 2006.
Bakish has improved distributor relations, found financing for Paramount Pictures after Chinese investors dropped out and shuffled programming since taking over Viacom in late 2016.
But Viacom shares trade around $33, below a $35 to $38.80 range when the merger was last on the table, potentially making a deal more feasible. 
CBS and Viacom last explored merging at the urging of ailing media mogul Sumner Redstone, 94, and Shari Redstone, who control both through privately held National Amusements. 
Moonves and CBS' board had concerns over corporate governance and the deal's financial rationale, and the Redstones called off the effort in December 2016.
For CBS, which owns the CBS network, local broadcasters and Showtime, taking on cable networks could mean a difficult integration and tough negotiations, said Tim Nollen, analyst with Macquarie Research.
Merging for size alone may not make sense in the long term, and CBS could be better off on its own, some analysts cautioned.

Viacom shares were down 0.4 percent in afternoon trade. CBS shares fell 1.8 percent.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Top U.S. food distributors  Sysco Corp  and US Foods Holding Corp have joined retailer Winn-Dixie Stores [BILODW.UL] and other poultry buyers suing the country's biggest chicken processors for allegedly conspiring to inflate prices.
The distributors sued companies including  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN), Pilgrim's Pride Corp, Sanderson Farms Inc and Perdue Farms in separate complaints filed in federal court in Illinois on Tuesday.
The U.S. chicken sector, which is dominated by these large meat processors, has come under increased scrutiny in recent years as customers and farmers have alleged antitrust violations relating to pricing, production and compensation.
""This is a case about how a group of America’s chicken producers reached illegal agreements and restrained trade,"" the lawsuits from Sysco and US Foods said.
Tyson, the biggest U.S. chicken company, and Pilgrim's Pride denied the allegations on Wednesday. Sanderson Farms said it will defend itself against the claims. Privately held Perdue declined to comment.
U.S. poultry buyers previously claimed in a 2016 lawsuit that Tyson and its competitors had colluded since 2008 to reduce output and manipulate prices. Winn-Dixie, which operates grocery stores throughout the southeastern United States, sued the chicken companies earlier this month. 
""We expect the industry to fight the allegations and come out successful,"" Mizuho analyst Jeremy Scott said.
Sysco and US Foods allege processors curbed the supply of chickens by colluding to limit breeder birds that produce flocks that are ultimately slaughtered for meat consumption.
Data provider Agri Stats participated in the conspiracy, according to the lawsuits, by distributing information about chicken production that gave processors insights into rivals' supplies. Agri Stats, which the complaints say is a subsidiary of Eli Lilly & Co, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""Follow-on complaints like these are common in antitrust litigation,"" Tyson spokesman Gary Mickelson said. ""Such complaints do not change our position that the claims are unfounded.""
Tyson shares were down 3.6 percent, and Sanderson Farms shares lost 3.8 percent. Shares of Pilgrim's Pride, mostly owned by Brazilian meat packer JBS SA, were down 6 percent.
Last year, such processors earned some of their highest profit margins in more than a decade as prices for grains used to feed birds slumped due to a global glut.

BENI SUEF, Egypt (Reuters) - A $1.1 billion cement plant with six production lines in the Egyptian city of Beni Suef will start up within days, officials said on Wednesday, adding to nation's bloated supplies. 
Each production line will each produce 6,000 tonnes of cement per day, so total output will be 13 million tonnes a year. Construction began 18 months ago.
The project is starting up when Egypt already has excess cement capacity. As of 2017, the country had 79 million tonnes of annual capacity with consumption only 53 million tonnes, an official at a rival firm, who asked not to be named, said.
At least three cement firms reported losses for third quarter 2017 and national inventory is now 5 million tonnes, the official said.
The new plant, 120 km (75 miles) south of Cairo, is owned by El-Areesh Cement Co for Cement, which in turn is owned by the Egyptian armed forces. 
The plant cost 900 million euros ($1.12 billion), said Wu Yong, vice president of engineering management at Sinoma (SS:600970), the Chinese firm responsible for mechanical works. 
""It is the biggest plant to be built all at one time,"" Wu told Reuters. ""We haven't had anything like it in China.""
He said other plants in the world produced more, but those had all been built in separate stages.

The Beni Suef plant produced its first clinker in December, while cement production would begin in about 10 days, another official working at the plant said.

726,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 03:33PM ET</span>",Fed Keeps Rate Unchanged as Yellen Exits; Sets Up March Hike,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve officials, meeting for the last time under Chair Janet Yellen, left borrowing costs unchanged while adding emphasis to their plan for more hikes, setting the stage for an increase in March under her successor Jerome Powell.
“The committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate,” the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement Wednesday in Washington, adding the word “further” twice to previous language.
The changes to the statement, collectively acknowledging stronger growth and more confidence that inflation will rise to their 2 percent target, may spur speculation that the Fed will pick up the pace of interest-rate increases. Officials also said inflation “is expected to move up this year and to stabilize” around the goal, in phrasing that marked an upgrade from their statement in December.
At the same time, the Fed repeated language saying that “near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.”
“It opens the door to four hikes for them, but I don’t think they have walked through it,” said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc in New York. “It closes the door to two hikes.” Fed officials penciled in three rate moves this year in quarterly forecasts they updated last month, according to their median projection.
With her term ending later this week after President Donald Trump chose to replace her, Yellen is handing the reins to Powell, who has backed her gradual approach and is widely expected to raise interest rates at the FOMC’s next meeting for the sixth time since late 2015. Fed officials are hoping to keep a tight labor market from overheating without raising borrowing costs so fast that it would stifle the economy.
“Gains in employment, household spending and business fixed investment have been solid, and the unemployment rate has stayed low,” the Fed said, removing previous references to disruptions from hurricanes. “Market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low.”
With a gradual pace of rate increases, policy makers want to nudge inflation back up to their 2 percent target, a goal they have mostly missed for more than five years. Even with a brightening outlook for global growth and Fed tightening, financial conditions continue to ease.
The vote by U.S. central bankers to keep the benchmark overnight lending rate in a 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent target range was unanimous. Fed officials also voted to continue with their program to reduce the central bank’s balance sheet, which began in October.
The FOMC said in a separate statement Wednesday that it elected Powell as its chairman, effective Feb. 3. He will be sworn in as chairman of the Board of Governors on Feb. 5.
“On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to run below 2 percent,” the FOMC said, removing a previous reference to declines in inflation in 2017.
Inflation has picked up slightly since the middle of 2017 while remaining short of the central bank’s 2 percent goal. The Fed’s preferred price gauge, a Commerce Department index linked to consumer spending, rose 1.7 percent in the 12 months through December. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, inflation was 1.5 percent.
Yellen isn’t scheduled to hold a press conference after this meeting; her final such event was in December. Fed policy makers will update their economic projections in March, when Powell is also expected to hold his first press briefing as chairman.
New Members
An annual rotation among the 12 regional Fed presidents who vote on the FOMC saw Loretta Mester of Cleveland, Thomas Barkin of Richmond, Raphael Bostic of Atlanta, and John Williams of San Francisco join as members at this meeting. Barkin and Bostic are voting for the first time since taking their posts.
The committee also reviewed its long-run policy goals statement at the January meeting and reiterated its support for the 2 percent inflation target, approving a statement that updated the long-run normal rate of unemployment to 4.6 percent -- the median in projections from December.
Several Fed officials have called for a rethink of the central bank’s policy framework, which could include aiming for a higher inflation target, or allowing prices to rise faster to make up for the time that they were too low.
During Yellen’s four years at the helm, U.S. unemployment has fallen to 4.1 percent, the lowest since 2000, as she navigated the Fed away from its crisis-era emergency policies and inched interest rates away from zero. Yellen exploited low inflation to maintain low interest rates that helped pull millions of more Americans back into jobs, and the Fed under her leadership began to pay more attention to labor-market inequality.
“She is going out on a high note,” Diane Swonk, chief economist for Grant Thornton LLP in Chicago, said before Wednesday’s decision.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher at 26,169. The S&P 500 closed 0.08% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite closed at 7411.48, up 0.12%.
US stocks staged a late rally after turning negative intraday following the Federal Reserve's unchanged rate decision and policy statement, in which the Federal Reserve signalled it would push ahead with rate hikes anticipating a “move up” in inflation this year. RBC said that Fed's policy statement signalled a “clear upgrade” on inflation as central bank ditched its usual “remain below 2%"" remark concerning inflation.
""Inflation on a 12‑month basis is expected to move up this year and to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term,"" The Federal Reserve said in its monetary policy statement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) on Wednesday forecast full-year profit well above Wall Street estimates as it looks forward to its busiest year ever for plane deliveries, sending its shares up almost 5 percent.
The world's biggest plane maker also said it would end years of job cuts in 2018, but would not now start hiring more people because of the recent reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate.
""More of an employment plateau in the near-term,"" Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said on a conference call with analysts on Tuesday. 
Boeing has shed 20 percent of its workforce, or about 34,000 jobs, since employment peaked in 2012, in a bid to reduce costs and improve profits. Several U.S. companies have promised to boost hiring after December's new tax law slashed the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.
Although Chicago-based Boeing delivered more aircraft to customers than Airbus SE (PA:AIR) last year, and is much more profitable, it is still in a dogfight to win orders after its European rival sold about 22 percent more planes last year. 
""Our focus is to make Boeing ever tougher,"" Muilenburg said.
Boeing said it aims to ship between 810 and 815 commercial aircraft in 2018, as much as 7 percent more than the industry-record 763 jets it delivered in 2017, putting it ahead of Airbus for the sixth year in a row. Airbus delivered 718 jetliners last year.
Both companies are speeding up production at their factories to chip away at the large backlog of orders for new jetliners, created over the past few years as airlines want new, fuel-efficient planes to cope with a surge in demand for air travel.
Helped by the hunger for new jets, Boeing forecast core profit would rise to $13.80 to $14.00 a share in 2018, ahead of analysts' average estimate of $11.96, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
For the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, Boeing's core earnings nearly doubled to $4.80 per share from $2.47 a year earlier, buoyed by rising plane output and a $1.74 per share gain from changes to the U.S. tax law.
Boeing shares, which have more than doubled in the past 12 months, rose 4.7 percent to $353.60 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
SETTING THE TABLE
Boeing's commercial planes unit posted an 8 percent increase in revenue in the fourth quarter to $15.47 billion, while operating profit rose 50 percent to $1.78 billion.
The company's smaller defense business grow more slowly. Revenue for the unit rose 5 percent to $5.54 billion while operating profit rose 6 percent to $553 million. 
Boeing's new services business - which maintains and overhauls planes for their owners - posted a 17 percent increase in revenue to $4 billion in the fourth quarter while operating profit rose 9 percent to $617 million. Boeing is aiming to hit $50 billion in revenue in that business by 2027. 
However, profit margins at the unit narrowed slightly to 15.4 percent, and Boeing said it expects margins near that level this year.
""Margins weren't as good as I thought,"" said Sheila Kahyaoglu, an analyst at Jefferies LLC in New York.
Boeing also forecast at least $12.8 billion in free cash flow this year, encouraging Wall Street analysts, who generally view the company's early targets as conservative.
""Actual results could ultimately be higher,"" Seth Seifman, an analyst at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), said in a note to clients. ""As a result, we expect the stock to outperform despite its recent run now that management has set the table for a solid 2018.""
By raising production while holding down costs, Boeing and Airbus generate more profit and cash. 
Despite the rising output, their order backlogs have kept growing. Boeing said its total backlog, which includes military aircraft and other products, rose to $488 billion at year-end, compared with $474 billion at the end of the third quarter.
Excluding the gain, Boeing reported earnings of $3.06 a share. On that basis, Wall Street had been expecting $2.89 a share.

Muilenburg said Boeing still expects to increase operating profit margins to the mid-teens by 2020, from 9.6 percent last year, with most of the gain coming from reducing the cost of making 787 Dreamliners, while holding costs of its workhorse single-aisle 737 steady.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Options market traders expect shares of the biggest U.S. technology companies, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), to react more strongly to quarterly results than they have on average over the past two years, data showed on Wednesday.
Expectations for increased turbulence in stock trading rises ahead of earnings, but traders have bid up volatility to multi-quarter highs, New York-based options analytics firm Trade Alert data showed.
Apple, Facebook,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), which account for nearly half of the $21.2 billion Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, are expected to post results Wednesday through Thursday.
Wall Street expects technology companies to post strong results. Analysts estimate earnings for S&P 500 technology companies rose 18.5 percent compared with a year ago and compared with a growth of 13.7 percent for the S&P 500 as a whole, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Options traders expect Facebook shares to swing in either direction by 5.7 percent by Friday, compared with a one-day average move of 4.6 percent over the last eight quarters, the data showed.
Options-implied moves for other companies including Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet, also exceed their respective average reactions to results over the past eight quarters, the data showed. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2nu9zsN)
While some of the pick-up in the volatility expectations may be linked to an overall lift in the stock swings in recent days, there does appear a growing concerns about lofty valuations in the sector.
""Despite yesterday's pullback many are probably taking a look at the valuation of these companies as being pretty rich,"" said Mary Ryan, options strategist at online broker E*Trade Financial in Chicago.
S&P 500 Information Technology sector sports a forward four quarter price-to-earnings ratio of 19.5, compared with 18.3 for the S&P 500 as a whole, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Key sector exchange traded funds, PowerShares QQQ Trust and Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, have drawn notable defensive options activity over the last two days, pointing to demand for protection against declines.
""Some institutional investors are hedging exposure to large cap tech names,"" Trade Alert analyst Fred Ruffy said.
""While defensive positioning is not surprising given the market's losses over the past two days, the timing also reflects concerns about further short-term losses across large-cap tech ahead of a flood of earnings from the sector,"" he said.

742,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>","U.S. fund investors, undeterred by bond yields, go on buying spree","By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors ignored rising bond yields and stomped into the markets in the days leading up to an equity selloff this week, Investment Company Institute (ICI) data confirmed on Wednesday.
Some $40 billion rolled into U.S.-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) during the week ended Jan. 24, the most on ICI's records dating to 2013, with billions moving into both debt and equity markets.
More than $23 billion of that money moved into equities, the most since June, and another $15 billion went to bonds, ICI said. Commodities funds took in $1.4 billion, their best showing since July 2016.
""We've had a lot of cash on the sidelines for so many years, but as we continue to march forward, especially on the equity side of things, you see great optimism not only by institutional investors but retail investors as well,"" said Wayne Wicker, chief investment officer at ICMA Retirement Corp.
""There seems to be some pressure on individuals that haven't participated to reallocate.""
The broad buying comes as investors feed a desire for greater returns using both bonds and stocks. Rising yields during the week hurt bond prices but also attracted new investors seeking a better entry point.
Stock buyers have also been conditioned to ""buy the dip,"" and they are starting to warm up to domestic equities in a serious way after three straight years of profit-taking outflows from such funds.
Domestic equity funds attracted $12.9 billion in the latest week, while world stock funds gathered $10.5 billion, ICI said.
In more recent days, as equities sold off partly in response to rising yields, investors kept buying stocks.
The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) took in a combined $8.4 billion of assets on Monday and Tuesday this week, according to a spokesman for the fund's issuer, even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average registered its biggest two-day drop since September 2016.
Negative returns in many bond funds so far this year have failed to deter investors from piling into debt markets, which have pulled in hundreds of billions of cash from investors since the 2007-2009 global financial crisis.
During the most recent week, taxable bonds pulled in $12.7 billion and municipal bonds pulled in $2.5 billion, according to ICI.
Sales of commodity funds, meanwhile, have started to perk up, after a long slumber, on speculation that inflation is on the rise.
The following table shows estimated ICI flows for mutual funds and ETFs (all figures in million of dollars):

Federal prosecutors in Boston said James Polese, 51, and Cornelius Peterson, 28, misappropriated $500,000 to invest in and support the wind farm project. Polese also used funds from a client's account to pay for personal expenses, prosecutors said.
The conduct took place from 2014 to 2017, prosecutors said. Court papers did not identify Morgan Stanley by name, but records maintained by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority show the bank terminated both men in June.
Lawyers for the two Massachusetts residents did not respond to request for comment. Morgan Stanley also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Polese and Peterson were each charged with one count conspiracy and investment adviser fraud and several counts of bank fraud, prosecutors said. Polese also was charged with aggravated identity theft.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also filed a related civil lawsuit on Wednesday against Polese and Peterson.

D.R. Horton, the biggest U.S. homebuilder, introduced Express brand - a lower-margin business which mainly caters to first-time buyers - at a time when rising land prices made homebuilders wary of building cheaper homes and strict lending standards were limiting buyers' ability to raise credit. 
Express accounted for more than one-third of homes sold and over one-fourth of home sales in the latest quarter, the Texas-based company reported on Wednesday.
D.R. Horton said the unit is expected to grow at least 10 percent to 15 percent over the next three years.
""While the new tax laws may affect the upper-end home buyers and owners, there is enough demand strength for less-expensive homes, particularly in first-time homes, to keep the industry growing in 2018,"" Moody's Investors Service Vice President Joseph Snider wrote in a note published earlier this month.
Demand for starter homes has become the ""sweet spot"" of the homebuilding industry, Snider told Reuters.
The Express brand has kept Horton's margins lower than its peers, but has also helped it turn over inventory faster as those homes are quicker to build and sell in larger volumes.
In the recent quarter, Horton generated margins of 20.8 percent, while  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) reported 22.4 percent and PulteGroup Inc (N:PHM) 23.8 percent.
According to Moody's calculations, Horton's inventory turnover was 1.2x for fiscal 2016 and 2017, while Lennar's was 0.8x and Pulte's 0.9x.
""Lennar and Pulte tend to try to generate the best margins they can, Horton is willing to sacrifice a little on margins in order to improve their turnover and returns,"" Snider said. 
When Horton launched the Express brand in 2014, majority of homebuilders were focused on buying land in city centers to respond to higher demand for owners upgrading to more expensive homes in trendier neighborhoods. Horton instead bought land in less fashionable and less developed areas to build cheaper and smaller homes.
""... more homebuilders are looking at this, at moving their mixes towards more entry-level homes,"" BTIG analyst Carl Reichardt said, adding that other homebuilders feel more confident as the cycle has continued to improve slowly and as Horton has proved out the concept.
But, it was unclear whether other homebuilders would be as successful as Horton, Reichardt said.

Lennar is focusing on expanding its first-time home buyer offering, Chief Executive Officer Stuart Miller said in June, adding that the segment was showing some optimism. Pulte Chief Executive Officer Ryan Marshall said on Tuesday that it would start to shift some of its investment in the move-up segment to the entry-level.

758,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 01:21PM ET</span>","Daimler, BMW move staff in response to diesel fume test scandal","MUNICH/BERLIN (Reuters) -  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and BMW (DE:BMWG) suspended or moved employees linked to a group that commissioned exhaust tests involving monkeys and humans on Wednesday, seeking to show a firm response in the face of public anger over the tests.
Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen have come under scrutiny since The New York Times reported last week that they funded an organization called the European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector (EUGT).
The research group commissioned tests that exposed monkeys and humans to toxic diesel fumes, methods condemned as repulsive by Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) chief executive.
The revelations drew criticism from politicians and animal rights groups, leading VW to announce on Tuesday it was suspending its chief lobbyist, who was in charge of the EUGT and knew about the planned animal tests but didn't stop them.
On Wednesday, Daimler followed suit, saying it had suspended an employee and hired an external law firm to investigate EUGT's activities.
BMW said its representative on the EUGT's management board would be removed from his current functions pending an investigation into the research group's work by the carmaker's legal experts, adding that he would remain with the Munich-based carmaker. 
Daimler and BMW did not give the names of the affected employees. 
EUGT, founded in 2007 and dissolved last year, could not be reached for comment. 
Daimler, parent of luxury brand Mercedes-Benz, reiterated that the company was ""appalled by the nature and implementation of the studies.""
""The Board of Management of Daimler AG has decided to suspend the employee, who was a member of the board of EUGT,"" Daimler said, adding it had no influence on the study's design.
The executive committee of VW's supervisory board will meet next week to discuss the internal investigations and ensure that incidents such as the exhaust tests, denounced by German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks as ""abominable"", will not be repeated.
Europe's largest carmaker cannot seem to break free of the ""dieselgate"" scandal which erupted nearly two and a half years ago.

German prosecutors earlier on Wednesday searched the homes of several current and former employees of VW's luxury division Audi (DE:NSUG) in connection with the carmaker's involvement in the diesel emissions test cheating scandal.

(Reuters) - A surge in Boeing led Wall Street out of a two-day slump on Wednesday, but U.S. stocks pared gains in early afternoon trading as investors awaited the Federal Reserve's comments to gauge the future path of monetary policy.
The Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged and signal a gradual tightening of monetary policy later this year as the economy continues to expand and job gains remain solid.
The Fed's statement, due at 2 p.m. ET (1900 GMT), will also be parsed for the central banks' gauge of inflation, which remains below its target, the risks to economic outlook, and any assessment of the impact of the U.S. tax overhaul on growth.
""There is some nervousness ahead of the Fed statement,"" said Michael Antonelli, managing director of institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird.
""In general, people are a lot more concerned about a hawkish tone from the Fed. While the market has priced in three rate hikes for 2018, if the economy continues to firm up and earnings remain solid, the possibility of a fourth rate hike definitely becomes more firm.""
In another sign of a strong labor market, an ADP report showed the U.S. private sector added more jobs than expected in January. The report comes ahead of the more comprehensive non-farm payrolls data on Friday.
At 12:36 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 155.81 points, or 0.6 percent, at 26,232.7, the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 6.83 points, or 0.24 percent, at 2,829.26 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was up 23.81 points, or 0.32 percent, at 7,426.29.
The Dow had tumbled nearly 540 points over Monday on Tuesday amid a broad market sell-off as U.S. Treasury yields surged.
But, the blue-chip index clawed back as much as 200 points earlier on Wednesday. That came as Boeing (N:BA) surged 6.9 percent to record high after the planemaker's full-year profit forecast easily topped estimates.
The jump in Boeing's shares, the biggest weight in the price-weighted Dow and the S&P, helped the industrials sector (SPLRCI) rise 0.75 percent, the most among the 11 major S&P sectors.
Electronic Arts (O:EA) jumped 10.4 pct to record high after it gave a upbeat forecast, which also sent shares of fellow videogame makers Activision Blizzard (O:ATVI) and Take-Two (O:TTWO) to all-time highs.
Anthem's (N:ANTM) strong results and forecast sent its shares up 1.5 percent and also boosted other health insurers, a day after the group and other health stocks were hit by news of Amazon.com's (O:AMZN) healthcare plans.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,567 to 1,298. On the Nasdaq, 1,510 issues fell and 1,349 advanced.

The S&P 500 index showed 32 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 73 new highs and 35 new lows.

760,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 12:55PM ET</span>","For Saudi tycoons freed from detention, cheers and a business challenge","By Stephen Kalin and Katie Paul
RIYADH (Reuters) - Cheering supporters greeted Saudi Arabian billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal when he arrived at his skyscraper offices in Riyadh after his release from detention in an anti-corruption crackdown.
But he and other tycoons freed from a luxury hotel in the Saudi capital face a challenge to get back into the swing of running their financial empires in the uncertainty hanging over the business community since their detention in early November.
Their ability to do so could impact Saudi Arabia's attempts to lure investors to big projects, an important part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's grand vision to transform the kingdom and reduce its dependence on oil.
""It will need another six to nine months without disruption or another witch hunt before anyone would be willing to move on anything major,"" a regional banker said of the business climate. ""This is not the right time to bring anything to market.""
Online footage showed Prince Alwaleed waving from a luxury car in a convoy trailed by police as he arrived this week at the Kingdom Center skyscraper one day after his release, and then walking inside with his private physician.
A source familiar with the matter said the prince received an operational update on his global portfolio, which includes stakes in Twitter, ride-hailing firm Lyft and French hotel operator  Accor  (PA:ACCP).
In the first few days after his detention, the share price of his investment firm Kingdom Holding plunged 23 percent, erasing $2.2 billion of his personal fortune on paper.
After a jump this week, the stock has regained almost all that it lost, but during the prince's detention the overall stock market rose 10 percent. Kingdom shares do not reflect that gain, indicating investors are still applying a discount to his company because of the uncertainty.
Prince Alwaleed's predicament suggests Saudi tycoons who have long been content to focus on amassing huge profits must now consider whether the government's anti-corruption drive could stop them in their tracks.
Saudi Arabia's attorney general said on Tuesday that settlement deals had secured just over $100 billion from members of the elite. He did not provide a breakdown, and Reuters could not verify that figure. 
BACK IN THE DRIVING SEAT
In another video, property mogul Mohammed Aboud al-Amoudi sits in a black office chair at his home in Jeddah receiving kisses on the hand and forehead from a procession of well-wishers who utter thanksgiving for his safe return after nearly three months in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh.
A company representative reached by phone said Amoudi was in good health.
""It is as if he was traveling and returned, nothing more,"" said the person who declined to be named, adding it was not clear if he would run the company again.
Associates of other released detainees, including media magnate Waleed al-Ibrahim and retail billionaire Fawaz al-Hokair, told Reuters they were at home catching up with family and close friends.
An email to MBC employees seen by Reuters described Ibrahim as ""fit and eager to get back"". It said he would travel to Dubai in a couple of weeks to get ""back in the driving seat"".
Hokair, meanwhile, is hosting dinners for guests, according to one attendee. The stock price of his company, fashion retailer Fawaz Abdulaziz Alhokair Co, is still 13 percent below its level just before he was detained.
""It's as if he was on a business trip or in a summer holiday or a religious trip. He is fully motivated, full of ambitions,"" the attendee said.
""He does not talk about anything, he just says he was happy and received good treatment.""
These men are among the last group released from the Ritz, which had been used since November as a prison and interrogation center for dozens of senior princes, ministers and businessmen and was cleared out on Tuesday.
Specific allegations against the men and the settlements they agreed before their release were kept secret. Some may have been moved to prison after refusing to admit wrongdoing and reach financial settlements; they may stand trial. 
Notably absent from the final batch of releases were Prince Turki bin Abdullah, the king's nephew, and dismissed Economy Minister Adel Fakieh. Their fates remain unknown.
Two bankers said assets or corporate ownership transfers had not yet been made for the last batch of released detainees and any handovers could be shielded from public view for some time through what one banker described as ""very clever lawyers and accountants.""
Critics have described the anti-corruption campaign as a shakedown and power move by the Crown Prince. The government denies this.
As workers removed security barriers at the Ritz-Carlton in anticipation of the hotel's reopening in mid-February, recently checked-out ""guests"" reconnected with loved ones.

Pictures shared on social media showed Alwaleed visiting an ill nephew in hospital. On Twitter, people urged him to continue his charitable activities.

761,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",EU car sales seen slowing in 2018 with Brexit risk: ACEA,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Car sales growth in the European Union are likely to slow to 1 percent in 2018, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) said on Wednesday, saying stricter rules on car emissions and Brexit were threats to the industry.
Last year, new passenger car registrations rose 3.4 percent in 2017, the fourth consecutive year of growth, reaching more than 15 million vehicles for the first time since 2007.
ACEA President Carlos Tavares, chairman of the managing board of PSA Group, blamed the industry slow down on new EU regulations on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and a lack of market predictability brought on by Britain's impending exit from the bloc.
""The European automobile industry is on a pathway to recovery, coming close to pre-crisis levels ... after 10 years, but in light of major regulations ahead of us, as well as the threat of Brexit this recovery is very fragile,"" he told a news conference.
He said the European Commission's proposals to promote low-emissions vehicles did ""not sufficiently consider other alternatives"" to electric cars. Further out, Europe needed to invest in infrastructure, notably charging stations, to support electric vehicles.
On Brexit, he urged negotiators to come to a swift arrangement on the new terms of Britain's trading relationship with the bloc.
""Today the automotive industry of the EU and the UK are deeply integrated. Changes for this level of integration will most likely have an adverse impact on manufacturers.""
Problems could include restricted access to EU or UK markets, which could mean parts stuck in containers at ports, and the possibility of diverging regulation.
Tavares said the auto industry believed the transition period after Britain leaves the EU should be three years, longer than the 21 months until the end of 2020 that the EU has proposed.
""It is a struggle for our industry to make investment decisions when we don't know what is just around the corner,"" he said. ""What we know today is everyone is holding on.""

ACEA forecasts that German and French car sales growth will be muted and that the British car market will decline by 4-5 percent, following a 5.7 percent fall in 2017.

779,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 11:31AM ET</span>",Goldman's Options Advice Is to Expect a Volatile Earnings Season,"(Bloomberg) -- Here’s how to navigate the rest of the U.S. earnings season, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).: buy straddles.
Earnings volatility is likely to continue, and the best way to profit from that is to use strategies like buying straddles before companies report, Goldman strategists including Katherine Fogertey and John Marshall wrote in a note Wednesday. The straddle, which involves buying a put and a call on the same underlying stock with the same strike price and expiration date, allows the trade to be less dependent on the overall market direction while still making room to profit if earnings moves exceed expectations.
“With tech, energy and health-care earnings coming into focus, we recommend isolating the potential for larger than expected earnings moves by buying straddles selectively when they cost less than the prior earnings move,” the strategists said.
The volatility this earnings season may be at least partially fueled by the U.S. tax-policy changes, which have presented an “important and idiosyncratic tax reform data point accompanying companies’ earnings reports,” JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). strategists wrote in a note on Jan. 23. In that analysis, they suggested keeping a bias toward long volatility on U.S. stocks because the tax changes justified a larger risk premium than normal, while the options market was pricing volatility to be in line with the historical average.
Buying calls has also offered unusually big returns amid “robust” earnings moves and the S&P 500’s gain of more than 5 percent this month, the report said. The average stock in Goldman’s universe from a company that has reported this season realized an earnings move of plus or minus 3.6 percent, compared with the two-year average of plus or minus 3.3 percent.
“Buying the closest out of the money one-month call five days ahead of earnings and closing the day after generated a 66 percent return on premium,” Goldman said."

781,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 11:13AM ET</span>",Director of CDC resigns over financial conflicts: officials,"By Julie Steenhuysen
(Reuters) - Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald has resigned her post as director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over financial conflicts of interest, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said on Wednesday.
Her departure from the top U.S. public health agency comes in the middle of the country's worst flu season in several years.
Newly confirmed HHS Secretary Alex Azar said he had accepted Fitzgerald's resignation because of her ""complex financial interests"" that have forced her to recuse herself from a broad range of her duties as the CDC director.
Due to the nature of these financial interests, the HHS said, Fitzgerald could not divest them in a definitive time period. The White House declined comment, referring questions to HHS.
Politico reported on Tuesday that Fitzgerald, a physician and former commissioner of the Georgia Department of Public Health, bought shares in a tobacco company a month into her leadership of CDC, an agency charged with safeguarding public health, including reducing rates of smoking. She took over leadership at CDC in July.
After advising the HHS secretary of the status of her financial interests and they way in which it limited her ability to do her job, Azar accepted her resignation, HHS said in a statement.

784,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>","Julius Baer sees net money slowdown in 2018, on lookout for acquisitions","By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss private bank Julius Baer does not expect to keep pace with last year's bumper growth in 2018 and will push ahead with hiring more client managers and looking for deals under its new chief executive.
After a hiring spree helped the bank gain new clients and bring in 22 billion Swiss francs ($23.6 billion) in fresh funds last year, Chief Executive Bernhard Hodler said on Wednesday that the bank was unlikely to overshoot its target again.
""With regard to net new money, 2017 was a bit special,"" Hodler told journalists and analysts. ""2018 will be a good year overall, also with regard to net new money, but our estimate is to be within the range of 4-6 percent (growth).""
Switzerland's third-largest listed bank earlier posted a 14 percent rise in 2017 net profit to 705 million francs under IFRS accounting standards.
Over 100 net hires in 2016 and 41 in 2017 helped Baer achieve 6.6 percent growth last year in net new money, an indicator of future earnings in private banking. That overshot the group's 4-6 percent mid-term target range. 
However, internal transfers meant the bank increased its total number of relationship managers by only 13 in 2017, dampening prospects for similar inflows this year.
It aims to hire a net 80 relationship managers this year.
Julius Baer is looking at both large and small acquisitions, bank executives said, adding Baer could consider a transformative deal like the 2013 takeover of Merrill Lynch's international wealth management business for 883 million francs.
The bank could self-finance mid-sized deals from the strength of its own balance sheet, Chief Financial Officer Dieter Enkelmann said.
Hodler, speaking at the bank's first major corporate event since taking the helm in November, said he would drive forward the bank's growth strategy. Hodler, formerly the bank's chief risk officer, took over when long-time boss Boris Collardi quit to join independent wealth manager Pictet. 
""It's a great strategy we will sharpen in a year to come and will have three strategic priorities,"" Hodler said, citing increasing business with existing clients and doubling down on existing markets as part of its focus. ""And thirdly, drive our proven growth strategy of organic development and targeted M&A.""
Shares were down 1.5 percent by mid-day after results failed to wow investors to an already highly priced stock. Shares trade at nearly 23 times earnings and have gained over a third in value over the past year.
""We believe it will be difficult for the bank to sustain the strong net new asset growth, which is likely to abate toward 5 percent,"" Baader Helvea analyst Tomasz Grzelak said in a note.
The group proposed raising its dividend to 1.40 francs per share from 1.20.

786,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 10:33AM ET</span>",Ignore the Doomsday Talk Surrounding the Bond Market: Mark Grant,"(Bloomberg View) -- To suppose that equities and debt live in different worlds is a mistake of the first order. These two markets are joined at the hip and sometimes, such as on Tuesday, one market can move the other more than it is moved.
Tuesday began with questionable headlines suggesting that a bond market rout was in progress. Where this oft repeated notion comes from, which in my opinion is far from the truth, is an open question. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down about 9/32 at one point, which hardly represents a shellacking.
Yet, the equities market seemed to take the bait. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 362 points,which was no fun for most investors. Now, there are calls that the ""Day of Reckoning"" has arrived, but I'm not a buyer of ""End of the World"" scenarios. For more than 40 years on Wall Street I have watched this type of gibberish being spouted in the media by people that are angling for stardom by making absurd projections. These people come and go; another ""Nanosecond Nellie"" at bat.
The bond market does influence the economy and, by extension, the equity market. As the cost of borrowing increases, the real estate market, corporate borrowings and the overall economy can stall. Profit margins shrink as corporate debt becomes more expensive. This results, generally, into lower equity prices as earnings get squeezed.
Treasury 10-year yields have risen from 2.06 percent in early September to as high as 2.73 percent this week. Although that seems scary, one must consider the starting point when examining this move. Yields of 2 percent or, put another way, 2 percent borrowing costs, do not eat into corporate profits like 5 percent yields. It is ""profit margin,"" remember, and the margin is affected far less when rates are this low.
The situation looks more benign when you pull back the covers. Yields as measured by the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Corporate Bond Index have risen from 3.05 percent in early September to 3.45 percent currently, which is a smaller increase than seen in Treasuries.
This is telling in two ways. First, it shows the tremendous compression of risk assets to their Treasury benchmarks as demand has kept up for any sort of yield. Second, it shows that the increased costs of corporate borrowing is nowhere near what you might expect if you looked at just the Treasury market. This is notable because it means that not only are borrowing costs less than what you might expect, but that corporate profit margins are not going to be impacted as significantly as many predict.
Even if the 10-year Treasury yield, which is currently trading in a range of 2.63 percent to 2.72 percent, rose to 3 percent it shouldn't ring any alarm bells.
There is some genuine concern about increased borrowing by the U.S. Treasury, though that has been mitigated recently. The U.S. said Monday it expects to borrow $441 billion in the first quarter, $71 billion less than previously estimated. The new forecast includes an end-of-quarter cash balance estimate of $210 billion. During the second quarter, the Treasury expects to borrow $176 billion in net marketable debt with a cash balance of $360 billion. To put that in perspective, the Treasury borrowed $282 billion in net marketable debt last quarter and ended with a cash balance of $229 billion. The government had estimated borrowing of $275 billion for the quarter.
One of the main questions now is what incoming Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell might do at the central bank. If he slows -- or even stops -- the pace of interest-rate increases, then we could see lower bond yields. Then there is the question of just what the tax cuts might do to tax receipts, as the trade-off in lower taxes may be more than off-set by higher revenues that produce more taxes. Finally, there is the question of whether risk assets will continue to tighten against their benchmarks as the ""Pixie Dust"" money created by the world's central banks hunt for yield.

787,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 10:31AM ET</span>",Activist investors' demands rejected more in 2017: data,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Corporate chiefs said ""no"" more often to activist investors in 2017 who approached them with ideas on how to run their businesses and demands to sit on their boards, new data from research group Activist Insight show.
So-called settlements where corporations and money managers hammered out their differences without having to ask all shareholders to vote on an issue in a proxy contest dropped to 116 last year from 170 in 2016, the data released on Wednesday show. Activist Insight worked with law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel to compile its annual review.
This means that 63 percent of demands were settled in 2016, down from 69 percent the year earlier.
For three consecutive years, corporations had become ever more willing to see the activists' point of view and reach a settlement. That stopped in 2017 when companies surrounded themselves with more advisers who often urged them to fight on, according to managers, lawyers and industry analysts.
In 2017, prominent corporations including consumer products company Procter & Gamble and human resources outsourcing company Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ:ADP)., rebuffed prominent activist investors Nelson Peltz and William Ackman when they came with new ideas and requests to join the board. Peltz eventually was invited onto the P&G board after a hotly contested proxy contest.
To be sure, there were also settlements in 2017. Jeweler Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF) made a deal with Jana Partners to add three board members. Railroad CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) agreed with Mantle Ridge to hire the late Hunter Harrison as its chief executive and industrial parts company Arconic made a deal to give Elliott Management board seats. But generally the mood appeared to shift to companies preferring to fight harder to keep activist investors at bay.
Activist Insight data show that 169 board seats were won by activist investors through a settlement last year, nearly five times as many as the 34 seats won through a proxy vote. But in 2016 corporations gave 244 seats to activists through settlements while 29 seats were won through a vote.

""In 2017, activists could no longer just throw the kitchen sink at a company and hope for the best,"" said Josh Black, an analyst at Activist Insight, which tracks activist fund managers and their activities.

788,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 10:31AM ET</span>",U.S. Raises Long-Term Debt Sales as Budget Deficit Worsens,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Treasury Department will lift longer-term debt issuance to $66 billion, marking the first boost since 2009 amid expectations of growing deficits and the Federal Reserve balance-sheet roll-off.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s debt management team will sell next week $26 billion of 3-year notes versus $24 billion in November, it said Wednesday in its refunding announcement. The department also lifted to $24 billion the sale of 10-year notes from $23 billion and the 30-year bonds to $16 billion from $15 billion, also to be auctioned next week. Total offering rose to $66 billion from $62 billion in November.
Treasury also said it expects to lift sales of 2- and 3-year note auctions by $2 billion per month over the quarter. It will also boost 5-, 7- and 10-year notes and 30-year bond auction by $1 billion each month starting in February. Sale of 2-year floating-rate notes will also be increased by $2 billion beginning next month. Additional borrowing needs will be addressed by increasing bill sales.
Total adjustment will amount to $42 billion of new issuance for the upcoming quarter. Auctions sizes of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities will remain unchanged over the three-month period.
‘Borrowing Need’
“Treasury anticipates these changes will stabilize the weighted-average maturity (WAM) of the debt outstanding at or around current levels, notwithstanding large, unexpected changes to borrowing need,” Treasury said in the statement.
Before Wednesday’s refunding announcement, most primary dealers indicated they expect Treasury would boost some coupon-bearing debt auction sizes in what was seen as an inflection point to rising issuance that will ultimately spread to all tenors. Dealers forecast new issuance in 2018 to at least double this year to more than $1 trillion, the most since 2010.
The department discussed its investigation on the topic of Treasury trading data -- which is now being used only by regulators -- being released to the public.
“Treasury is actively considering a policy on the public dissemination of Treasury securities transactions data,” the department said in their statement. “Treasury officials are currently seeking input from a wide range of market participants and other stakeholders.”
Bill Sales
A big chunk of the new supply over the year will also come through more bill sales, yet that maybe temporarily stymied as Treasury waits for lawmakers to hoist or suspend the debt limit again. Mnuchin said Tuesday that extraordinary measures he’s been using to stay under the suspension -- that expired on Dec. 8 -- will last through the end of February. The Treasury statement reiterated the end-February date as well.
The U.S. posted its largest budget deficit since 2013 in the fiscal year that ended in September. While President Donald Trump’s administration says the tax bill will stimulate enough economic growth to cover lost revenue, Congress’s tax scorekeeper estimates the changes will raise deficits by more than $1 trillion over the next decade.
Treasury said over the next three months it plans to issue a call for a large-position report, without disclosing any more details. The last time the department conducted such a request for details on the positioning of market participants was in June 2016.

LONDON (Reuters) - European Commission officials have rejected the City of London's proposal to strike a post-Brexit free trade deal on financial services, a major blow to Britain's hopes of keeping full access to EU markets for one of the world's top two financial centers.
The decision increases the likelihood that the City will trade with Europe under less favorable terms and could accelerate corporate contingency plans to move more operations to the continent from London.
Since Britain voted to leave the EU 19 months ago, some of the world's most powerful finance companies in London have been searching for a way to preserve the existing cross-border flow of trading after it leaves the bloc in 2019.
Officials from the European Union's executive told British financiers in meetings in recent weeks they won't agree to a deal that would allow finance companies to operate in each others' markets without barriers because Britain has said it will leave the single market, according to two people who attended the meetings.
The City's plan proposed that Britain and the EU would allow cross border trade in financial services on the condition that each side preserve regulatory standards in line with the best international standards. This model would be maintained by close co-operation between regulators and financial policymakers.
The proposals are the most detailed on how a long-term agreement on financial services with the EU may work after Brexit, with papers setting out how a pact could be structured and policed, and it has been endorsed by Britain's Brexit minister David Davis. 
But EU officials are dismissive of any trade models that would see Britain retain similar levels of market access while leaving the single market regime.
""They have made it very clear to us that this is unacceptable to them,"" said one senior British finance executive present at one of the meetings. ""This was our best and frankly only proposal. We don't have a plan B.""
Sterling slipped against the dollar and euro on Wednesday on news of the rejection.
Britain's vast financial services looks set to be one of the most divisive areas in the Brexit negotiations, with Britain demanding a generous deal while the EU refuses to shift from its insistence that Britain's red lines -- such as ending the free movement of workers from the EU -- make that impossible.
Britain is currently home to the world's largest number of banks and hosts the largest commercial insurance market. About six trillion euros ($7.47 trillion), or 37 percent, of Europe's financial assets are managed in the UK capital, almost twice the amount of its nearest rival, Paris.
In addition, London dominates Europe's 5.2 trillion euro investment banking industry.
But unless it can secure a trade deal, for all its geographic proximity, Europe's largest financial capital will end up adrift with the same access to the EU as other countries like Singapore. 
CONTINGENCY PLANS
Britain's finance minister Philip Hammond warned Europe last week that hurting London's financial center would push business to New York and Singapore to the detriment of Europe as a whole, and he called for a bespoke trade deal with the EU.
The rejection of the proposed trade deal represents a second setback for the City of London, which had initially pinned hopes on Britain maintaining ""passporting"" in financial services after Brexit.
This means finance executives may have to rely on what it known as equivalence. The legal mechanism allows countries from outside the EU to access the single market in limited circumstances but access is patchy and can be revoked at short notice.
European Union negotiators see no room for discussion with Britain on passporting, diplomats in Brussels said on Wednesday.
Mark Hoban, a former City minister who chaired the body that wrote the blueprint, acknowledged it was ambitious but said it has the interest of government and was being discussed by EU states.
""There is agreement that the existing third country regime does not provide a robust basis for maintaining high levels of trade,"" Hoban told Reuters.
The Commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The rejection of the proposals may reinforce the view among some finance executives that they must plan for a worst-case scenario by moving more of their pan-European operations to the continent.
Many are already unhappy with the government for failing to clearly spell out what it views as its preferred trading relationship with the EU. 
A lawyer who helped negotiate the last implemented trade deal with the European Union also said Britain should temper its expectation of securing a wide-ranging deal on financial services.
Christophe Bondy, the senior legal counsel during Canada's negotiations for a trade deal with the EU, said Canada worked very hard to achieve a high standard trade deal with the EU, but still ended up with modest outcomes in financial services.

On Monday, BMO Capital Markets downgraded Apple to ""market perform,"" while also lowering its price target and estimates for the company's future.
""There has been much in the press about order cuts for iPhone X, and we believe a weaker mix in Q1 will push estimates lower for March and beyond,"" Tim Long, an analyst at BMO said in a note to clients. ""Following 10 years where [iPhone] average selling prices have generally moved higher, we believe prices will plateau as with the rest of the industry.""
The iPhone X seems to have one big problem: its price. According to Long, the $1,000 starting price of the new phone is a big reason for the weaker demand for the phone. There were still lines at the phone's release, and it was hard to get for a while, but Apple recently instructed its suppliers to  cut their iPhone X production targets in half, due to lower than anticipated demand.
The high price of the phone also represents what Long thinks is the end of the rope for phone prices. Only about 12% of phones sold globally are priced above $600, which limits the market for high-priced phones like the iPhone X. Long thinks about 30% of all iPhones sold in 2018 will be priced above $900. For the current quarter, Long cut his iPhone unit estimate by 8 million to 55 million.
All this means that 2018 could be rough for Apple.
""We expect a meaningful guide lower when the company reports on Thursday night, on the order of $5-6 billion compared to consensus revenue estimates,"" Long wrote. ""We wouldn’t be surprised by some upside to the Services business, and some of the other products, but it won’t be enough to offset the iPhone miss.""
Long said that in 2016, the company's stock was facing a slide similar to the 3.24% drop it has seen so far in 2018. At the time though, the company had new OLED phones coming and the iPhone X was on the horizon, which helped get investors excited about the company. ""No such product is on the horizon now,"" Long concluded.
Long lowered his price target to $162, which is 2.4% below the company's current $166 stock price.
Apple is set to  report earnings after the bell on Thursday.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks pulled out of a two-day dive and were eyeing their second best start to a year ever on Wednesday, while the dollar came under renewed pressure ahead of the Federal Reserve's first meeting of the year.
A controversy-free State of the Union address from U.S. President Donald Trump had helped Asian bourses steady as bond markets also calmed after another round of selling had left U.S. Treasury yields at 4-year highs. 
Europe's pan-regional STOXX 600 and Wall Street futures then followed with modest 0.1 and 0.3 percent gains to bolster the 5.6 percent jump MSCI's 47-country ACWI index has made this month.
That puts it neck-and-neck with 2012's fast start, after which only 1994's 6.5 percent leap would be better. 
""We can interpret the remarkable January performance as a spill over from 2017 - growth gathering pace, low inflation and low volatility, and that has accelerated the momentum,"" said ABN Amro's Chief Investment Officer Didier Duret.
""For me this is a prelude to the year where the equity market trend is not broken... there will be phases of people coming into the market and then correction phases as volatility spikes.""
A market gauge of that volatility - the VIX - perked up to its highest levels since August 2017 and has nearly doubled this month.
One of the big boosts for stocks though, especially in emerging markets which have seen the biggest gains, has been the weakness of the dollar.
It fell by a quarter of a percent again on Wednesday against a basket of other top currencies on course for its biggest monthly drop at 3.5 percent in nearly two years.
The day's most eye-catching move was a 2-1/2 year low against China's yuan of 6.3287. It has been the greenback's heaviest monthly drop against the Chinese currency since 1994 having lost more that 3 percent.
Other Asian action saw the yen briefly slip when the Bank of Japan upped its medium-term Japanese government bond buys (JGBs) in a move seen as a warning shot against further rises in its bond yields and currency.
The dollar later pared its gains however and was last trading at 108.82 yen as it also backed off to $1.2445 to the euro and $1.4165 to the pound respectively. 
In the opening weeks of 2018, Europe recorded the highest equity inflows across all major regions, adding to a strong 2017 which saw the region cornering over one-third of all global equity fund flows.

All eyes will be on the outcome of the Federal Reserve's first meeting of the year later which will also be Janet Yellen's last in charge.
With U.S. growth humming and unemployment at a 17-year low rates markets are currently pricing in a little over 80 percent chance of another Fed rate hike in March and between two and three for the year as a whole. 
The Fed is due to release its policy statement at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT) but there won't be a news conference or new forecasts this month.
""In light of the steady stream of favorable data, it is possible that the FOMC’s (Fed's) statement upgrades language on activity somewhat, which could be viewed as a marginally hawkish shift,"" analysts at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) said in a note.
There was the earnings treadmill too. U.S. Health insurer Anthem reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profits ahead of the Wall Street opening bell though there had been some shockers in Europe.
British outsourcing group Capita lost 40 percent of its value after its new boss slashed profit forecasts and set out plans to raise cash to avoid the same fate as recently-collapsed builder Carillion.
Poor results also sent telecoms equipment maker Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) tumbling over eight percent at one point and there were more woes for fashion retailer H&M as it said it would open far fewer stores in 2018 following a profits hit. (EU)
Bond markets meanwhile were quiet but heading for their biggest monthly sell-off since late 2016, a sign that the tide for bonds has turned as a stronger world economy spells the end for ultra-easy monetary policies.
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, hovered at just above 2.7 percent, having risen almost 30 bps this month. Those on German Bunds - Europe's benchmark are up 25 basis points and at 0.68 percent on Wednesday.
""Monetary policy looks very inconsistent with the level of growth and inflation,"" said Anujeet Sareen, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global. ""Given the normalization process, the whole bond market looks like it's just not high enough in terms of yields.""
Such major swings in the dollar and bond markets have been replicated in commodity markets too.
Oil fell for a third day, but remained on track for its biggest gain in January in five years, in spite of data that showed U.S. crude stocks rose more than expected last week.

Brent crude, the global benchmark, was down 40 cents at $68.63 a barrel having started the year at just over $66 a barrel. It will be its fifth straight month of gains.

Nasdaq has been increasing its presence in non-trading related businesses, which provides market data services, whose revenue streams are less affected by market volumes.
Revenue from its largest unit - market services, which oversees transactions, clearing and settlements, rose 2.9 percent to $611 million helped by higher trading volumes.
Revenue from non-trading businesses, which includes information services and market technology, cumulatively rose 14.6 percent to $243 million.
Nasdaq reported net income attributable of $246 million, or $1.45 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $224 million, or $1.35 per share, a year ago.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.05 per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of $1 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable.
The fourth quarter included a decrease in tax expenses of about $87 million related to the remeasurement of deferred tax liability due to the new U.S. tax law.
Operating expenses rose 1.6 percent from a year earlier to $392 million.

Revenue, excluding transaction-based expenses, rose 6 percent to $635 million, beating Wall Street estimate of $630.4 million.

819,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 07:21AM ET</span>","Global funds cut stocks, fear inflation could puncture complacency: Reuters poll","By Claire Milhench
LONDON (Reuters) - Global investors trimmed equity holdings by 1.2 percentage points in January, concerned that markets have grown complacent after a thundering bull run and seeing risks of an inflation wake-up call.
Reuters' monthly asset allocation poll of 50 wealth managers and chief investment officers in Europe, the United States, Britain and Japan showed growing caution about equities even as world stock markets (MIWD00000PUS) surged to fresh highs in January after repeatedly smashing records in 2017.
The poll was conducted between Jan. 15-29, with most participants responding before a late-month wobble in stocks, but asset managers still cut their equity allocation to 50.1 percent from 51.3 percent in December.
""The main risk today is complacency, without a pullback in major equity markets for nearly two years,"" said John Husselbee, head of multi-asset at Liontrust.
""Investors are casting off prudence,"" agreed Mouhammed Choukeir, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros. ""In investing, curiosity doesn't kill the cat, complacency does.""
Stock markets have rallied hard over the last 12 months, helped by a pick-up in the global economy and corporate profits. But MSCI's world equity index suffered its biggest two-day sell-off in 16 months at the end of January.
Mark Robinson, chief investment officer at Bordier & Cie (UK), said that while markets might continue to grind upwards in 2018, there was a possibility that current economic conditions were as good as it gets.
""There is therefore a real danger that markets forget that much of this optimism has already been priced in.""
INFLATION SURPRISE
One concern is that strong growth will fuel inflation, forcing central banks to tighten more aggressively.
""A rise in inflation significantly higher than expected could trigger a sell-off in both equities and bonds, as it would be seen as a sign of the Fed being behind the curve, and thus forced to act quicker than expected,"" said Cedric Baron, head of multi-asset at Generali (MI:GASI) Investments.
The U.S. Federal Reserve's gauge of inflation remains stubbornly below its 2 percent target, but U.S. 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) spiked to near four-year highs in January as a bond sell-off gathered steam.
In the poll, investors raised overall bond allocations slightly to 37 percent of their global balanced portfolios, but cut government bond holdings by almost 2 percentage points to 56.3 percent of their fixed income portfolios.
The fear is the tide has turned for bonds as ultra-loose monetary policy in the United States and Europe is coming to an end. Billionaire bond veteran Bill Gross of Janus Henderson has already called a bear market in U.S. Treasuries.
But poll participants who answered a question on whether a bear market had begun in government bonds were evenly split.
""A bear market in bonds calls for more than a global cyclical upswing, as not all forces that dragged yields down over the past decades have suddenly vanished,"" argued Peter van der Welle, a strategist at Robeco.
But Thomas Hempell, deputy head of research at Generali Investments, said the times of ""juicy returns"" were over.
""The bearish correction however will not be as severe as in the early 1990s,"" he said. ""But due to the low coupons prevailing, even a gradual rise in yields will result in negative returns on a wide range of government bonds over the coming quarters.""
EYEING EUROPE
Within global equity portfolios, investors raised their European exposure by 1.8 percentage points to 19.6 percent and trimmed U.S. holdings to 40.1 percent.
The euro zone economy expanded at its fastest rate in a decade in 2017 and European equities (STOXX50E) are set to end January with gains of around 3 percent.
""Earnings upside is greatest in emerging markets, Europe and mid-cap Japan,"" said Larry Hatheway, group head of investment solutions at GAM. ""That, combined with better relative valuations, should drive out-performance.""
But poll participants were almost evenly split over whether risks from Italy's March 4 election had receded.
The eurosceptic 5-Star Movement is Italy's most popular single party, but it lags behind a centre-right alliance led by ex-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia.
""Our idea is that this risk will be manageable. We do not exclude some volatility that could represent some buying opportunities,"" said Nadege Dufosse, head of asset allocation at Candriam.

820,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 07:15AM ET</span>",Airbus A321LR long-range jet takes maiden flight,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - The A321LR, a long-range version of Airbus's (PA:AIR) largest and newest single-aisle jet, made its maiden flight on Wednesday as the European planemaker looks to retain part of the market where it has been aggressively outselling rival Boeing (N:BA).
The reconfigured version of the 185-230-seat A321neo is capable of carrying up to 240 people. It took off from Airbus' Hamburg factory in northern Germany shortly after 11 a.m. (1000 GMT), witnesses said.
Airbus says the jet is the world's longest-range single-aisle aircraft, capable of flying up to 4,000 nautical miles when configured with 206 seats including lie-flat beds.
That makes it a contender to replace long-serving Boeing 757s that are nearing retirement. But Boeing is studying proposals to leapfrog the plane with a compact new twin-aisle jet, designed to serve a broader market from 200 to 270 seats.
A decision on whether to launch the so-called middle-of-the-market passenger jet is expected this year.
Airbus has been outselling Boeing in the market for large single-aisle jets by a margin of four to one and says the new A321LR version - with an improved takeoff weight of 97 tonnes - will meet demand to replace elderly 757s and some 767s. 
Boeing says the opportunity stretches beyond the 757 replacement market all the way up to planes with 270 seats and would be better served by a completely new airplane. It has meanwhile introduced a larger version of its 737 MAX, and last year outsold Airbus three to one in long-haul wide-body jets.
Boeing officials concede the A321LR flies further but say it relies on three, space-absorbing auxiliary fuel tanks, instead of one for the 737 MAX 10 in its longest-range version.
In an effort to pre-empt the possible launch of a new Boeing jet, Airbus is working on further enhancements to the A321 even as it stages the first test of the A321LR, industry sources say.
A person familiar with the Airbus plans told Reuters last week that it is studying a further increase in the A321neo's take-off weight to 100 tonnes with the help of tweaks to the existing wing and stronger landing gear, requiring more engine thrust.
A second option would include a lighter and larger new wing: something that saves on engine thrust but costs more to develop. 
Both options would involve stretching the aircraft slightly to accommodate one or two extra rows of seats, the person said.

Airbus has declined to comment on the plans.

823,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 06:34AM ET</span>","Japan's Fujifilm to take over Xerox in $6.1 billion deal, create joint venture","By Naomi Tajitsu and Ritsuko Ando
(Reuters) - Japan's Fujifilm Holdings is set to take over  Xerox Corp  (NYSE:XRX) in a $6.1 billion deal, combining the U.S. company into their existing joint venture to gain scale and cut costs amid declining demand for office printing.
The acquisition announced on Wednesday comes as Xerox has been under pressure to find new sources of growth as it struggles to reinvent its legacy business amid waning demand for office printing. Fujifilm is also trying to streamline its copier business with a larger focus on document solutions services.
Consolidation of R&D, procurement and other operations would enable Fuji Xerox to deliver at least $1.7 billion in total cost savings by 2022, the two companies said.
Fujifilm now owns 75 percent of Fuji Xerox, the joint venture going back more than 50 years ago which sells photocopying products and services in the Asia-Pacific region.
The two companies said that Fuji Xerox will buy back that stake from Fujifilm for around $6.1 billion, using bank debt. Fujifilm will use those proceeds to purchase 50.1 percent of new Xerox shares. Plans were for the deal to be completed around July-August, they added.
The combined company will keep the Fuji Xerox name and become a subsidiary of Fujifilm, with dual headquarters in the United States and Japan, and listed in New York. It will be led by Xerox CEO Jeff Jacobson, while Fujifilm CEO Shigetaka Komori will serve as chairman.
The joint venture accounts for nearly half of Fujifilm's sales and operating profit.
Both companies have struggled with slow sales of photocopy products, as businesses increasingly go paperless. Fujifilm on Wednesday reported a 29.4 percent drop in operating profit at its document solutions operations, which includes Fuji Xerox, for the third quarter, underperforming its imaging and information segments. Overall, the company reported a 3.4 percent increase in operating profit for the quarter.
Xerox reported a net loss from continuing operations of $196 million in the fourth quarter, mainly due to a one-off $400 million charge as it sought to take advantage of changes to U.S. tax law but also reflecting the steady decline in office printing.
""This has been a speedy decision, but I believe it's a creative one,"" Fujifilm CEO Komori told reporters at a briefing. ""The new structure will leverage the strengths of our three companies.""
As part of its own restructuring, Fujifilm said it was cutting 10,000 jobs at Fuji Xerox, more than a fifth of its workforce at the joint venture, in the Asia Pacific region.
Sluggish performance at Xerox had prompted investors to call on the U.S. company, which had owned 25 percent of the joint venture, to explore strategic options.
Xerox has been targeted by activist investor Carl Icahn and shareholder Darwin Deason, who joined forces last week to push Xerox to explore strategic options, oust its ""old guard"", including its CEO, and negotiate better terms for its decades-long deal with Fujifilm. Icahn is Xerox's biggest shareholder, with a 9.72 percent stake.
Xerox's CEO said the combined company would gain an increased edge in new technologies, along with higher revenues and cost synergies, while Xerox shareholders would also benefit from a $2.5 billion special cash dividend resulting from the deal.
""This transaction...offers substantial upside for shareholders of the combined companies, including current shareholders of Xerox and Fujifilm Holdings, who will own shares in a more competitive company that has enhanced opportunities for long-term growth and margin expansion,"" Jacobson said in a pre-recorded video message.
The takeover deal comes less than a year after Fujifilm admitted improper accounting standards at Fuji Xerox, but Komori said that Xerox's strong governance standards could be beneficial to the new company.

Fujifilm shares fell 8.3 percent on Wednesday ahead of its announcement of job cuts but after the Journal report about a deal with Xerox. Xerox shares ended down 0.5 percent on Tuesday.

825,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 06:01AM ET</span>",UK poised to protect consumers from high-cost credit,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - New rules could soon be brought in to protect consumers in Britain from high-cost credit companies such as doorstep lenders and household appliance rental firms.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Wednesday that its review of the market since July last year has demonstrated an ""emerging picture of the case for intervention"". 
It said there are ways of intervening that don't cut off cash to people that can afford repayments.
It intends to publish its conclusions and proposals for consultation in the Spring.
""We need to address both the choice and range available and how this market can work better for consumers,"" Christopher Woolard, FCA executive director for strategy and competition, said in a statement.
As well as being prepared to propose new rules where it has evidence that consumers are being ripped off, the FCA will look at solutions involving alternatives to high-cost credit, the watchdog said.
""Our analysis indicates that rent-to-own customers are a particularly vulnerable group of consumers,"" the FCA said.
They typically pay far more for fridges, televisions and other household goods by making repayments over time, and saw their total median amount of outstanding debt more than doubled from 2,000 pounds in November 2014 to 4,300 pounds in November 2016, the watchdog said.
The FCA also remains concerned about the high fees and charges for unarranged overdrafts, especially when compared to the relatively small amounts lent.
Overdrafts will be addressed separately in its strategic review of retail banking business models, which the FCA will update on later this year. 
The watchdog has also asked for more data from firms who offer loans in people's homes.
Some 700,000 people took out a home-collected credit loan in 2016, with 1.6 million people having outstanding debt on these products at the end of 2016, with a total value of 1.1 billion pounds ($1.55 billion).
""Catalogue credit also remains a concern for the FCA, particularly the complexity of charging structures and how people are offered choices to make repayments,"" the watchdog said. This refers to people buying items on credit from catalogues and making regular repayments over time.
In 2015, a cap was introduced on interest rates charged by short-term “payday” loans, which is set to be reviewed in 2020.
The cap was introduced after criticism from MPs and the Church of England about the very high interest charged by so-called payday loan companies for often vulnerable customers.

832,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 04:15AM ET</span>",China's young shoppers breathe new life into luxury market,"By Adam Jourdan and Farah Master
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Guo Jiaxi is typical of a new generation in China that is driving a sharp revival in luxury spending: young, female and unafraid to spend. 
An accountant in eastern Suzhou, Guo, 24, likes Coach and Louis Vuitton, and has bought Acne Studios scarves, a Daniel Wellington watch and a Mont Blanc belt as gifts. Of an annual salary of 50,000 yuan ($7,898), she spends one-fifth on luxury items.
""Luxury is not a total necessity for me, I suppose, but whenever I've got enough money to spare, then I'll buy,"" she said.
Guo and her peer group are behind a dramatic spike in luxury spending in China last year, according to consultancy Bain & Co. They are the key demographic for luxury brands from LVMH to Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and France's Hermes in tapping the world's top luxury consumers.
Their willingness to spend - often more than they can afford - comes with a note of caution. These consumers are typically less loyal to traditional brands, swayed by shifting trends online and increasingly looking for deals.
""Some of these youngsters, even when they don't really have enough funds, they're still going out and buying luxury products,"" said Huang Yue, 27, who runs the fashion section at the website ""Loving Luxury."" 
Yue added that the shift to millenials, those aged roughly 20-34, had been dramatic. It spurred the rise of new areas such as luxury ""streetwear"" and sporting attire, which Bain said were behind the recent fast growth.
""In terms of the impact on the market, it's really given it a shot in the arm,"" Yue said.
Driven by general optimism, attracted by the ease of online shopping and helped along the way by parents who benefited from the country's fast growth and rising home prices, Chinese millennials are buoying the luxury market at home and abroad. 
Millennial shoppers pushed the Chinese market up to 142 billion yuan ($22.07 billion) in sales last year, about 20 percent higher than the year before. It is by far the steepest jump in over half a decade of sluggish growth, according to Bain.
Luxury goods purchased in China make up 8 percent of the global total, while Chinese shoppers - who make three-quarters of their luxury purchases overseas - drive 32 percent of sales worldwide.
LVMH's chief executive, Bernard Arnault, said China was a ""very dynamic"" market in which the Louis Vuitton brand was doing well.
""China has had a good comeback,"" he told reporters last week. The company has seen a slow recovery in China since a weak start to 2016. 
Gucci and cognac maker Remy Cointreau are among other well-known companies citing stronger growth in the market.
Analysts and industry insiders, however, said shoppers were widening the range of brands they looked at, a challenge for some more traditional players.
Tapestry Inc's Coach and British fashion house Burberry both reported weaker ends to last year. Prada – which had seen sales slump in China - has been building partnerships with influential internet personalities and launched an online shop in December. 
Online retailers like  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and JD.com have launched their own luxury platforms and lured in brands such as Yves Saint Laurent, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen. 
""Chinese consumers are going through several changes,"" Liao Jianwen, chief strategic officer at JD.com, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum at the World Economic Forum in Davos, adding that shoppers now want high-quality products at ""competitive prices."" 
BRAND NEW SECOND HAND
Even as consumers spend more, they are becoming thriftier.
Zhang Xia, 24, an investment professional in the southern metropolis of Chongqing, has bought Dior bags, Louis Vuitton, Bulgari jewelry, and once paid 150,000 yuan ($23,695) for a Piaget watch. She's now less easily won over.
""Increasingly what I'm after now is original patterns and designs,"" she said, adding that, like Guo, she sometimes gets help paying for her purchases. ""It's more about the quality and feel of the product, so if I can find that I won't necessarily choose a luxury brand.""
The shift has meant the rise of areas not previously seen as being in the same space as traditional luxury, including casual wear, ""streetwear"" and even premium sports clothing.
Shoppers are also more willing to buy used goods. That means people making new purchases can sell their goods later, defraying the cost of a big-ticket item.
""Because people know that they can sell things on second hand, they're not so strict with their luxury budgets,"" said Deng Yun, 33, the chief operating officer of used luxury goods trading platform www.luxusj.com.
He said the most popular brands on the site were handbags from Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Gucci and Fendi. Chloe, owned by luxury house Richemont, is popular with younger shoppers, while Hermes still has good cachet, he added.
The premium sportswear firm Lululemon, seeing strong demand from China’s youth, is now ""focused on exploring and developing new approaches to capture this audience,"" said Amanda Casgar, Lululemon’s Asia Pacific director of brand & community.
Winning over the parents of young shoppers like Guo could be helpful too – they are often a source of funds for a generation increasingly inclined to borrow or use credit.
""Of course my salary is pretty low, so mum and dad do help me out a little,"" Guo said.

837,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 03:01AM ET</span>",Defections weaken Dutch banks' fintech defense,"By Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A new common mobile payments system for Dutch banks has been hobbled by the decision of two big lenders to focus elsewhere, highlighting the challenges major lenders face in fending off fintech rivals.
ABN Amro announced it was pulling out of the system, Payconiq, on the day of its launch last week. This week, Payconiq's founder ING said it had paid 270 million euros ($334 million) for a controlling stake in a fintech payments company operating in an overlapping space.
Together with Rabobank, ING and ABN control around 90 percent of the Netherlands' retail banking market, prompting charges that Payconiq was an attempt to corner the mobile payments market before EU legislation opens it up in June.
Designed to be shared by the big three banks and two others - Regiobank and Volksbank - in a continuation of a tradition of cooperation among Dutch lenders, it stood a fair chance of success, a model of how banks might fend off the fintech threat.
Each lender will now have to thrive or wilt on its own merits as the big ones look to the next generation of payments technologies and fintechs and startups eye new opportunities.
""The inevitable consequence of a truly European market is ... that there are fewer incentives to stick to the old tradition when faced with international competition,"" said Simon Lelieveldt,"" a payments consultant and historian of Amsterdam's development as a financial center.
ABN's motive for leaving is the success of its own smartphone application 'Tikkie', which boasted on Monday it has gained some 2 million users in this nation of 17 million people since its launch in June.
Payconiq CEO Duke Prins put a brave face on the situation in a telephone interview after his company launched in the Netherlands last week with its remaining members, six months behind schedule.
""We are a complete replacement for card-based systems like Visa"" he said, adding that ABN ""are being realistic, given the state of competition"".
FRAGMENTATION
Paul Alfing, a consultant at the Payments Advisory Group, said ABN's walk-out damages Payconiq's prospects and could bring further fragmentation to the Dutch payment landscape.
""If ABN is going to put all its money behind their solution, Tikkie, then some retailers will choose Payconiq, others Tikkie, others something else or nothing at all,"" he said.
This would confuse consumers and slow overall acceptance of mobile payments, as merchants wait for a winner to emerge.
Payconiq, founded by ING has its headquarters in Luxembourg, a significant presence in Belgium, and a pilot in Germany, where ING is the third-largest retail bank.
Announcing ING's acquisition of a 75 percent stake in Payvision on Monday, ING's head of transaction services Mark Buitenhek said Payvision and Payconiq -- which Rabobank still intends to use -- would both woo merchants.
Payconiq is a smartphone application, inter-operable with all its participating banks, in hopes of creating a single standard to tempt or force both brick-and-mortar stores and websites into accepting it.
A customer could use a small QR code on the same phone app to book a flight online or pay for groceries in a shop, regardless of their home bank.
Payvision, which competes with larger rivals such as WorldPay and fintech ""unicorn"" Adyen, has a much broader range. It can, for instance, allow merchants to accept Visa and Mastercard payments.
Payvision has a small but growing presence in North America, Europe and Asia, while ABN Amro's Tikkie is limited to the Netherlands and is now mostly used for person-to-person payments, though it has begun expanding the system for merchant use.
When big banks do cooperate, they are a force to be reckoned with.
In Sweden, a payments system for mobile phones backed by local banks, known as ""Swish"", has become the dominant form of mobile payments in recent years, and is now used by more than 50 percent of the population.
Back in 2005, Dutch banks formed a single platform known as ""iDeal"" to handle online payments. As of last year its market share was above 50 percent. By contrast, in the more fragmented market in neighboring Belgium, credit cards became the most popular way to pay online, followed by individual bank debit cards and Paypal.
Payconiq will have to compete from the start with both Tikkie and iDeal on banks' mobile phones apps. In the longer term, mobile phones with near-field communication chips may be the bigger threat, especially in combination with payment apps built by U.S. or Asian tech giants.
Dagmar van Ravenswaay Claasen, the director of regulatory affairs at Adyen, the Dutch start-up that handles back-end of payments for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Spotify, said customers will ultimately determine who wins in the Netherlands and beyond.
""Adyen's position is to figure out what payment methods are gaining demand in each market,"" she said. ""We go where our merchants' customers are.""
The rollout in the Netherlands of PSD2, the European legislation forcing banks to open their payments networks, has been delayed until June. But she said it will lead to more innovation by big and small players.
Ali Niknam, founder of ""Bunq"", a startup Dutch bank that prides itself on tech savvy, said his bank rejected Payconiq and saw the feud between the big banks as an opportunity.
""We expect the outcome to be largely defined by the technical proficiency of the companies providing the solutions,"" he said. ""No clear winner is defined yet.""

The billionaire founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Wynn Resorts Ltd has denied the allegations as ""preposterous"" and accused his ex-wife of instigating them for her own gain in litigation against him and his company.
The regulatory inquiry was revealed on Tuesday in a statement that CNBC and several other news outlets attributed to Nevada Gaming Control Board Chair Becky Harris, whose agency oversees enforcement of casino and gambling operations and licensing in the state.
""After completing our review, the Nevada Gaming Control Board is conducting an investigation with regard to the allegations of sexual misconduct involving Steve Wynn. The Nevada Gaming Control Board will conduct its investigation in a thorough and judicious manner,"" Harris was quoted as saying.

His former spouse, Elaine Wynn, whom he accused of fomenting false allegations against him, has denied through her lawyer that she did any such thing.
The company's stock dropped more than 10 percent on Friday after publication of the Journal's article, closing the day at $180.29 per share on the Nasdaq exchange.
Hours later, the Wynn Resorts board said it had formed a special committee to conduct its own inquiry into the accusations. That panel is chaired by Patricia Mulroy, who sits on the board's corporate governance and compliance committees and is a former member of the Nevada Gaming Commission.
The Journal report marked the latest in a wave of sexual abuse and harassment allegations against powerful men in the United State during the past year, especially in the media and entertainment industries and politics.

The Journal said its report was based on interviews with dozens of people who had worked for Wynn and that none of the 150 individuals contacted for its story had reached out to the newspaper.

843,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 12:25AM ET</span>",Blackstone bets big on Wall St. information business with Thomson Reuters deal,"By Pamela Barbaglia and Jessica Toonkel
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP catapulted itself into the major leagues of Wall Street's financial information industry on Tuesday with the acquisition of a majority stake in the Financial and Risk business of Thomson Reuters Corp.
The $20 billion deal is Blackstone's biggest bet since the financial crisis and pits co-founder Stephen Schwarzman against fellow billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg's eponymous terminals are the market leader in providing traders, bankers and investors with news, data and analytics.
Blackstone will acquire a 55 percent stake in a newly hived off F&R business, a statement from both companies said. Thomson Reuters will retain a 45 percent holding and will receive approximately $17 billion, including about $3 billion in cash and $14 billion of debt and preferred equity issued by the new business, the companies said.
The  deal will give Thomson Reuters, controlled by Canada's Thomson family, a formidable ally as it seeks to reinvigorate a business facing challenges from a shrinking and budget-conscious customer base. 
Blackstone has a track record of cutting costs and, as one of the world's biggest investors, it has business relationships with most of the major banks on Wall Street that are clients for Thomson Reuters' flagship desktop product Eikon.
The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Singapore's GIC will invest alongside Blackstone. The amount they will provide was not revealed. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board declined to comment. A spokeswoman for GIC declined to comment.
Talks on a possible deal began in earnest last summer, two sources familiar with the negotiations said.
The partnership will be managed by a 10-person board composed of five representatives from Blackstone and four from Thomson Reuters. The President and CEO of the new partnership will serve as a non-voting member of the board following the closing of the transaction. The companies did not say who that person would be. 
Thomson Reuters has relied heavily on cost cutting in recent years as its core customers, including banks, brokerages and investment houses, retrench in the face of weak trading conditions, tougher regulations and the rise of passive investing.
U.S.-listed shares of Thomson Reuters were up 2.2 percent at $47.52 in extended trading, after rising 7.1 percent in the regular session, while shares of Blackstone were down 0.2 percent after the bell.
TRUST PRINCIPLES
As talks between the two sides intensified, the biggest sticking point had been what the partnership would mean for Reuters News, the international news agency, which supplies the Eikon terminal with headlines, stories and analysis, said the two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
One issue centered around the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles, which commits Reuters to preserving its ""independence, integrity, and freedom from bias"" in supplying news. 
In an interview, Kim Williams, chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company, said ""we are satisfied that the nature of the contract ensures that appropriate quality of editorial is sustained.""
In its statement, Thomson Reuters and the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Co, which has overseen Reuters' editorial independence since the company was first publicly listed in the 1980s, cited ""consequential modifications"" to what it described as the Trust Principles ""arrangements."" The changes were not spelled out.
Until now, the principles have applied not just to Reuters News but to all Thomson Reuters business units.
Thomson Reuters Chief Executive Jim Smith said in an interview that the partnership with Blackstone required clarifying where the Trust Principles apply.
Under the deal with Blackstone, ""The Trust Principles apply any place where we use the Reuters brand or a third party uses the Reuters brand in a product,"" Smith said.
Reuters News will remain part of Thomson Reuters, along with its Legal and Tax and Accounting divisions. The new F&R company will make minimum annual payments of $325 million to Reuters over 30 years to secure access to its news service, equating to almost $10 billion. The payments will be adjusted for inflation, company executives said.
Thomson Reuters Chief Financial Officer Stephane Bello told an investor call that the payment represented what F&R used to allocate to Reuters News, plus ""a tiny bit more"".
After the deal, Reuters News will have about $625 million in revenues, including the annual payment from F&R and about $300 million in revenues from its media business, slightly higher than its cost base, Bello said. 
Williams said that an advantage of the deal was that Reuters will move ""from being a cost center inside Thomson Reuters to being a full operating business unit with its own profit and loss accounts.""
Thomson Reuters expects the transaction to close in the second half of 2018. The company said on Tuesday it expected 2017 results, which it will release next month, to meet or exceed guidance, with revenues expected to rise by 1 percent.
THOMSON FAMILY
The proceeds of $17 billion that Thomson Reuters will glean from the deal match the amount that Thomson Corp, controlled by the Thomson family, paid for London-based Reuters in 2008. That deal created the Thomson Reuters Group.
The company plans to use $9 billion to $10 billion to buy back shares, and use the rest to pay down debt, invest in its Legal and Tax & Accounting units and make selective acquisitions.
Woodbridge, the Thomson family's investment company, will take part in the share repurchase, maintaining its ownership in Thomson Reuters in the 50 to 60 percent range. Woodbridge, which currently owns 64 pct of Thomson Reuters, could not immediately be reached to comment on the deal.
Over the past six years, the family has been making divestments, reducing the number of products within the F&R segment by about 70 percent since 2012, while shrinking the division's workforce by 25 percent, according to Morningstar Equity Research. Thomson Reuters Chief Executive Smith told an investor call that there was room for more cost cuts in the new F&R business. 

Thomson Reuters has also sought to sell non-core assets, such as its intellectual property and science business, which it sold to private equity firms Onex Corp and Baring Private Equity Asia for $3.55 billion in 2016.

846,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 09:19PM ET</span>",#MeToo movement puts pressure on U.S. banks to disclose diversity data,"By Ross Kerber
(Reuters) - The #MeToo movement has put new momentum behind efforts to have companies, especially in finance, disclose details about their workforce diversity – data that could throw into sharper relief the slow pace of progress for women and minorities in the field.
Shareholder activists and corporate governance experts say they expect more support for disclosures such as the share of women and minorities in the senior ranks, or how equally they are paid.
Activists including Trillium Asset Management, Arjuna Capital and Calvert Research and Management are focused especially on banks and financial firms where women often make up a large share of the workforce, but not in leadership.
The subject is also gaining attention as investors poured $4.7 billion last year into funds that evaluate companies on social criteria.
Jonas Kron, senior vice president of Trillium Asset Management, said the emergence of the #MeToo movement likely helped boost support to 51 percent of votes cast in December for a shareholder proposal his firm sponsored calling for a diversity report at Palo Alto Networks Inc.
Counting abstentions, the measure was not approved, according to Palo Alto filings. Palo Alto Networks declined to comment. 
Interest in the resolutions, Kron said, ""Crested at the end of the year with the MeToo tidal wave, and I think it's carrying through"" into the 2018 spring proxy season. 
Last spring similar resolutions got around 30 percent support of votes cast, like one at First Republic Bank that got 33 percent support and which Trillium has refiled for this year.
A bank spokesman declined to comment on Trillium's resolution. He said of the bank's top 58 executives, more than half are women.
Executives across all industries are taking stock of an ongoing national debate on sexual harassment driven by what is known as the ""#MeToo movement"" on social media. Dozens of powerful men in politics, entertainment and business have been fired or resigned in the face of allegations they abused their power. 
The U.S. Government Accountability Office said in November that while the representation of women and minorities in most parts of finance rose from 2007 to 2015, the gains were not even. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2CbycjX) Most American companies with more than 100 employees file a federal form tallying their employees by race and gender across all job categories. Though not required to make the data public, technology leaders and a number of top banks have done so or released detailed summaries including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co.
The figures do not always show progress. JPMorgan said women accounted for 24.7 percent of its top ranks in 2016, versus 25.8 percent in 2015. 
Asked about the figures, JPMorgan spokesman Andrew Gray said women make up nearly half the bank's 11-member operating committee and half of the direct reports of CEO Jamie Dimon. Gray said that ""we strive every day to foster diversity and a workplace environment of respect and trust.""
Even if change is slow, investors and recruiters say the details can be useful as a measure of a company's concerns.
""You are going to see more and more investors wanting to screen out those companies"" that can't show a diverse workforce, said Victoria Fernandez, managing director at Crossmark Global Investments.
Although they have released diversity data, the major banks so far have not released detailed breakdowns of how women and minorities are paid within job categories.
Under pressure from Arjuna shareholder proposals, Citigroup and Bank of America each said this month that on average they pay women 99 percent of what they pay men in the United States and in other countries.
Arjuna Managing Partner Natasha Lamb said she would still like to see the banks release pay measures broken down by job level. Arjuna is still seeking pay ratio details from other banks this spring including Wells Fargo. 
One goal is to show investors and job seekers whether women are being paid equally as they are promoted, she said. ""Compensation has been in a black box for decades,"" she said.
Representatives of Citigroup and Bank of America declined to discuss Arjuna's further request.
A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment on Arjuna's current effort but noted language in its proxy filing last year when it opposed a similar resolution from Arjuna as being unnecessary because among other things the bank reviews pay equity annually.

""We are committed to ensuring that we do not discriminate on the basis of gender in our compensation programs,"" the filing states.

847,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 07:30PM ET</span>",China's small banks face uncertainties under new debt rules,"By Andrew Galbraith and Samuel Shen
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Three years ago, China's Bank of Jilin transformed its business strategy and began to gorge on debt. With a presence in just two provinces in northeast China, its favored borrowing was short-term loans from other banks.
Bank of Jilin is now beating a hasty retreat following a regulatory campaign to crack down on a business model, common among thousands of small banks in China, that relied on short-term loans to fund risky investments, or to ensure payouts to investors in its wealth management products.
Government officials have grown increasingly alarmed in recent years at rising debt levels, and analysts and investors said the clampdown on short-term interbank borrowing raises questions about the future of small banks like Bank of Jilin.
Lacking the national networks of larger rivals, these small banks face the prospect of slower growth and smaller balance sheets. Those that struggle may be forced into partnerships with other banks to survive.
""There's no choice but to shrink our interbank business,"" said a Bank of Jilin official, who declined to be identified because he is not authorized to discuss bank strategy. ""We need to transform our business model.""
Since the global financial crisis, China's debt has soared. In late 2016, the Bank for International Settlements warned China it could face a banking crisis in three years, and last year the International Monetary Fund said the country's credit expansion was ""dangerous"".
Chinese officials have taken action.
The government has issued 46 ""major"" regulations, statements and other documents aimed at reducing financial leverage since March 2016, Zhou Guannan, a senior analyst at Huachuang Securities in Beijing, noted in a report. No fewer than 14 of those have been issued since December.
The latest slew of rules from Beijing was aimed at tightening the screws on banks like Bank of Jilin, analysts said.
In 2015, the bank opened an office in Shanghai, China's financial hub, that it said was designed to expand interbank co-operation and explore ""innovative"" new business. A year later, the bank's total liabilities had grown 22 percent, almost double the pace of its deposit growth; its wealth management business had jumped 25 percent, compared with loan growth of 10 percent - and its bond trading volume had surged 140 percent.
Its issuance of negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) shot up to 108 billion yuan ($16.89 billion) in 2017 from 21.3 billion yuan in 2015.
It was not alone. Total issuance of NCDs in the interbank market rose to more than 20 trillion yuan in 2017, almost twice the size of the economy, just four years after they were introduced.
Initial regulations did not classify NCDs as interbank liabilities, which are capped under Chinese regulations at a third of total liabilities, so the market rapidly became a money fountain for smaller banks.
The latest regulations require banks to seek pre-approval from authorities for issuing NCDs and also limit how much of this debt they can issue.
At Baoshang Bank, another small lender, interbank borrowings, including NCD issuance, accounted for 48 percent of total liabilities at the end of the third quarter of 2017 - far exceeding a 33-percent cap stipulated by authorities in the latest regulations.
""Less leverage means less money for investment,"" said a manager at Baoshang Bank, whose job is to find high-yielding investment opportunities. ""The policies are getting tougher than necessary.""
Huachuang Securities estimated 19 banks, including Baoshang Bank and Bank of Jilin, had interbank borrowings that accounted for more than one-third of total liabilities as of the end of the third quarter of 2017.
Neither Baoshang Bank nor Bank of Jilin responded to requests seeking comment.
DISADVANTAGE
""The smaller (banks) will have a difficult time,"" said Gary Ng, an economist at Natixis in Hong Kong. ""Even if they can manage to increase their loan book, the proportion is still much smaller than large ones.""
One aim of the measures seems to be to push banks to shift their focus back to attracting deposits and lending to the real economy - rather than making speculative bets on securities - as the foundation of growth, analysts said.
But small lenders are at a disadvantage without the national networks of larger competitors, they said.
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China's biggest lender by assets, said in its 2016 annual report that it had 16,788 locations in China. As of March 2017, Baoshang Bank had 18 branches and 291 sub-branches.
Faced with dwindling options for funding, some banks are turning to new forms of debt issuance. A jump in convertible and subordinated debt issued by banks in 2017 is an early sign of what Ng expects to be a steady increase, particularly for banks that lack capital.
This could pour new supply into an already-struggling bond market. 
""If banks increase their issuance, that may crowd out some of the space from other companies who need liquidity (in) the bond market,"" said Ng.
Some small banks may succumb to the pressure. While it is difficult to forecast whether regulators will allow banks to fail, market observers say consolidation cannot be ruled out.
""There will be a growing tolerance of the PBOC to allow these smaller (banks) to face financial challenges,"" said Arthur Lau, co-head of emerging markets fixed income and head of Asia ex-Japan fixed income at PineBridge Investments.
""Whether they will allow them to default, that (is) another issue that we can debate. I think they are likely to ask the strong banks to take over, especially to avoid any systematic crisis,"" he said.

The government has requested information from the company, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. (https://bloom.bg/2DQhxaU)
The chairman of a U.S. Senate committee overseeing business issues asked Apple to answer questions about its disclosures, Reuters reported this month.
Apple did not respond to a request for comment. Representatives for the SEC and Justice Department declined to comment.
Apple admitted in December that iPhone software could slow down some phones with battery problems. Aging lithium batteries deliver power unevenly, which can cause iPhones to shut down unexpectedly to protect the delicate circuits inside, it said.
Apple posted a public apology over its handling of the issue and lowered the price of iPhone battery replacements from $79 to $29.
Consumers so far have filed some 50 proposed class action lawsuits over Apple's latest iPhone software update, which they allege caused unexpected shutdowns and hampered the performance of iPhone models of the SE, 6 and 7 lines. They claim the company tricked consumers into believing their phones were close to the end of their life cycle, forcing them to buy new phones or pay up to $80 for a replacement battery.
Most of the lawsuits have been filed in federal court in San Jose, California, but litigation over the software updates is also pending in other federal courts across the country. Lawyers for the consumers, who began filing their complaints in early January, have asked a federal judicial panel to consolidate the litigation in California.

Consumers are asking judges to issue orders that would prevent future modifications to the iPhone's operating system which intentionally degrade performance and battery life. They also demand an undisclosed amount in compensation and damages.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit by some of Puerto Rico's bondholders, who had argued that the U.S. territory broke the law by defaulting on constitutionally-guaranteed debt despite having the money to make payments. 
Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is overseeing Puerto Rico's bankruptcy, did not address the merits of the bondholders' claims, concluding that she lacked jurisdiction over some of them, and that others were not fit to be ruled on.
The dismissal is a setback to owners of roughly $18 billion in general obligation (GO) bonds guaranteed by Puerto Rico's constitution and taxing power.
A win would have helped establish the top priority of GO debt relative to other credits in Puerto Rico, a central question as warring creditor classes litigate competing claims to the island's limited funding streams.
Puerto Rico has $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt, and its finances are under the oversight of a federally-appointed board.
Last May, the island filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. government history.
With creditors already expecting drastic cuts to repayments, Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September, killing dozens, decimating local infrastructure, and sending bond prices plummeting as low as 20 cents on the dollar.
GO bondholders have accused the oversight board and the Puerto Rican government of unlawfully steering revenues away from them.
In the lawsuit, which was filed in June, a group of these bondholders, led by Aurelius Capital Management, alleged the island's government had violated Puerto Rican law and the U.S. constitution by paying for government services with revenues it diverted from other reserves.
They argued that, under Puerto Rican law, these so-called revenue ""clawbacks"" could only be used to pay GO debt. Puerto Rico used some $940 million in clawbacks and other restricted cash to fund government services in fiscal year 2017, they alleged.
Judge Swain, in a 19-page ruling on Tuesday, said she lacked jurisdiction over some claims. Others, she said, failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, amounting ""to abstract declarations of the parties' respective relationships"" without application to a ""current concrete dispute.""

850,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 06:11PM ET</span>",Soaring agave prices give Mexican tequila makers a headache,"By Lizbeth Diaz and Sharay Angulo
AMATITAN, Mexico (Reuters) - In the heartland of the tequila industry, in Mexico's western state of Jalisco, a worsening shortage of agave caused by mounting demand for the liquor from New York to Tokyo has many producers worried.
The price of Agave tequilana, the blue-tinged, spikey-leaved succulent used to make the alcoholic drink, has risen six-fold in the past two years, squeezing smaller distillers' margins and leading to concerns that shortages could hit even the larger players.
In front of a huge metal oven that cooks agave for tequila, one farmer near the town of Amatitan said he had been forced to use young plants to compensate for the shortage of fully grown agave, which take seven to eight years to reach maturity.
He asked not to be identified because he did not want his clients to know he was using immature plants.
The younger plants produce less tequila, meaning more plants have to be pulled up early from a limited supply - creating a downward spiral. 
""They are using four-year-old plants because there aren't any others. I can guarantee it because I have sold them,"" said Marco Polo Magdaleno, a worried grower in Guanajuato, one of the states allowed to produce tequila according to strict denomination of origin rules.
More than a dozen tequila industry experts interviewed by Reuters said that the early harvesting will mean the shortage is even worse in 2018.
Already, the 17.7 million blue agaves planted in 2011 in Mexico for use this year fall far short of the 42 million the industry needs to supply 140 registered companies, according to figures from the Tequila Regulatory Council (CRT) and the National Tequila Industry Chamber (CNIT).
The shortages are likely to continue until 2021, as improved planting strategies take years to bear fruit, according to producers. 
The result is agave prices at 22 pesos ($1.18) per kilo - up from 3.85 pesos in 2016.
Those higher prices mean that low-cost tequila producers, which make a cheaper, less pure drink that once dominated the market, find it harder to compete with premium players.
""It doesn't make sense for tequila to be a cheap drink because agave requires a big investment,"" said Luis Velasco, CNIT's president.
Small-scale distillers of quality tequilas are also feeling the pinch and some warn that drinkers are seeking alternative tipples.
""At more than 20 pesos per kilo, it's impossible to compete with other spirits like vodka and whisky,"" said Salvador Rosales, manager of smaller producer Tequila Cascahuin, in El Arenal, a rural town in Jalisco.
""If we continue like this a lot of companies will disappear,"" he said. 
Exports to the United States of pure tequila jumped by 198 percent over the past decade, while cheaper blended tequila exports rose by just 11 percent, CNIT data shows.
Over the same time, Mexican production declined 4 percent, with blended tequila leading the fall.
GLOBAL DEMAND
As it sheds its image as a fiery booze drunk by desperados and fratboys, while moving into the ranks of top-shelf liquors, the tequila industry has seen a flurry of deals in recent years.
In January, Bacardi Ltd [BACLTD.UL] said it would buy fine tequila maker Patron Spirits International for $5.1 billion. [nL4N1PI3N9] 
In 2017, after years of speculation, Mexico's Beckmann family launched an initial public offering of Jose Cuervo (MX:CUERVO), raising more than $900 million. [nL4N1PI3N9]
And Britain's  Diageo  Plc (L:DGE) swapped its Bushmills Irish whiskey label for full ownership of the high-end Don Julio tequila in 2014. 
The question posed by many distillers is how to keep pace with tequila's success. 
""The growth has overtaken us. It's a crisis of success of the industry,"" said Francisco Soltero, director of strategic planning at Patron, which buys agave under various contracts.
""We thought that we were going to grow a certain amount, and we're growing double,"" he said. 
Large sellers such as Patron and Tequila Sauza say they have not experienced problems paying for agave, and forecast that their inventories will keep growing.
""If you sell value, the costs don't worry you,"" Soltero said.
Tequila Sauza, which mostly grows its own agave, does not foresee supply problems, chief executive Servando Calderon said.
But some think it is simply a matter of time before the higher production costs and scarcity pressures bigger players.
""We are sure this will have a strong impact on the big firms such as Cuervo or Sauza,"" said Raul Garcia, President of the National Committee for Agave Production in Tequila, a group that includes most agave producers in the country.
""We don't see that the problem will be resolved soon, and that's what worries us.""
Demand is also being driven by other, fashionable agave-derived products, including agave syrup and health supplement inulin, which use the equivalent of 20 percent of the plants needed in 2018, the CRT said. 
And rising prices are leading to growing theft, driving out smaller producers, said Jose de Jesus, a producer of blue agave in Tepatitlan. Criminals come to the area with large trucks in the middle of the night to steal agave, he said.
According to the CRT last year 15,000 plants were reported stolen, more than triple the number in 2016.

The analysis by aviation consultant CAPA India and online travel agent  Expedia  Inc (O:EXPE) comes as large budget airlines IndiGo and SpiceJet Ltd (BO:SPJT) draw up plans to fly as far as Europe and the United States. 
The carriers have so far focused on shorter-range destinations such as Sri Lanka and Thailand.
Only 0.3 percent of Indians currently travel abroad for a holiday every year, a fraction of the estimated 100 million who could potentially afford to do so, CAPA's analysis of household income shows. Most Indians travel for education, business or to visit friends and relatives.
Tourism spending by Indians could rise to as much as $40 billion by 2027 from about $16.4 billion in 2016, CAPA said, ranking it sixth in the world ahead of Canada, South Korea and Australia.
""If there is any market where low-cost, long-haul can work it is India,"" CAPA India CEO Kapil Kaul said at an aviation conference in Mumbai on Tuesday, citing its geographic location and a large order pipeline for new long-range narrowbody jets. 
SpiceJet Chairman Ajay Singh said on Tuesday low-cost long haul flights will be introduced as early as this winter.
IndiGo is exploring long-haul operations and seeking rights to routes, parent InterGlobe Aviation Ltd (NS:INGL) told analysts last week.
The low-cost flights would compete against full-service Indian carriers Air India and Jet Airways (NS:JET) as well as global rivals such as Emirates [EMIRA.UL] and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG).
BUDGET GROWTH
Low-cost carriers, launched in the early 2000s, already dominate domestic air travel with a two-thirds market share. 
The share of budget airlines in the international market rose to about 23 percent in the fiscal year 2016/17 from 14.5 percent five years earlier, CAPA estimates.
That is expected to rise as Indian airlines have placed orders for nearly 800 re-engined aircraft, such as Airbus (PA:AIR) A320neos and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 MAX narrowbodies. 
The jets, with longer ranges than predecessors, will enable low-cost carriers to launch non-stop routes to Asian destinations such as Phuket, Manila, Hong Kong, and Hanoi that are otherwise unviable today.
By 2025, Indian budget carriers will operate close to 40 wide-bodied aircraft, which could deliver an additional 2 million annual outbound leisure travelers to places such as New York and Sydney, CAPA said.
Low-cost carriers AirAsia India and Vistara, a full-service joint venture between Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL) and India's Tata Group, are expected to launch their first international flights later this year.

Eurozone Inflation
Economists forecast the provisional reading of Eurozone inflation for January to cool to 1.3% from 1.4% in the previous month.
Inflation has trailed the European Central Bank’s target, of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The inflation report may add to growing investor expectations that the European Central Bank will announce plans to rein in accomodative monetary stimulus at its March meeting.
EUR/USD fell 0.10% to $1.2402
Fed Rate Decision, Fed Era of Yellen Ends
The Federal Reserve is expected to stand pat on interest rates when it concludes its policy meeting Wednesday.
There will not be a press conference as the Federal Reserve is amid a transitional phase with Ms Yellen slated to leave her role as Fed chair on Feb. 3.
Investors are expected, however, to parse the accompanying policy statement carefully for any insight into a possible shift in the central’s bank commentary concerning inflation and monetary policy.
Goldman Sachs said it expects the Federal Reserve bank to adopt a slightly hawkish slant in its commentary related to economic conditions and inflation.
The dollar traded higher against its rivals on Tuesday but remained close to three-year lows.
Energy Information Administration Weekly Inventory Report
A fresh batch of inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday is expected to show that U.S. crude stockpiles rose for the first time in eleven weeks.
Analysts forecast crude inventories rose by about 126,000 barrels in the week ended Jan 26.

The U.S. Treasury Department named major Russian businessmen in a so-called ""oligarchs' list"" released earlier on Tuesday.
The list, drawn up as part of a sanctions package signed into law in August last year, does not mean those included will be subject to sanctions, but it casts a potential shadow of sanctions risk over a wide circle of wealthy Russians.
""The Association of European Businesses (AEB) expresses its deepest concerns over the release of so called US Treasury’s ‘Kremlin Report’,"" the association said in a statement.
""The Association reiterates its calls on the Heads of States and Governments of the EU, the USA and Russia to refrain from actions, which can undermine the prospects of future economic cooperation"", it said.
The AEB brings together more than 500 foreign companies.

867,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 04:05PM ET</span>","Dow Jones Suffers Biggest Fall Since August, Sheds 360 Points","Investing.com – Wall Street suffered heavy losses, slumping to a second straight day of losses as rising bond yields spooked investors from increasing their bullish bets on equities.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed lower at 26,077.96. The S&P 500 closed 1.09% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite closed at 7402.48.50, down 0.86%.
Treasury yields continued to rise, indicating optimism on the outlook of the US economic growth, raising the prospect for a faster pace of rate hikes which some say could curb the recent rally seen in US stocks.
Yet some have argued that while the tightening of rates would reduce the supply of ‘easy’ money available to corporates there were a number of offsetting factors that could support equities including bullish economic growth, tax reform, and ongoing earnings growth.
On the economic front, meanwhile, better-than-expected consumer confidence data adding to narrative of a strong US economy but did little to inspire a reversal in equities.
The Conference Board’s consumer confidence gauge rose to 125.4 in January from 122.1 in December, beating economists’ forecast for a reading of 123.1.
The selloff comes as Donald Trump is expected to deliver the State of Union Address later Tuesday amid expectations that the president could pledge to ramp up infrastructure spending which is widely expected to boost fiscal growth.
On the corporate news front, Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) turned negative for the year so far amid growing expectations its iPhone X could undershoot Wall Street sales growth forecasts with the hefty price tag highlighted by many as one of the possible factors.
Healthcare, meanwhile, came under heavy selling pressure following an announcement that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ,  Berkshire Hathaway  B (NYSE:BRKb) (BRK.A, BRK.B), and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) formed an independent healthcare company.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tuesday's stock selloff on Wall Street set traders in the options market fretting about a near-term shock to equities in a way they have rarely done since U.S. President Donald Trump took office a year ago.
U.S. stocks fell for a second straight day on Tuesday, with the benchmark S&P 500 stock index on pace for its worst two-day decline since September 2016, hammered by a rise in bond yields and a decline in healthcare companies.
The Cboe Volatility Index, better known as the VIX and the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term stock market gyrations, spiked up to 15.42, its highest since August.
More tellingly, volatility futures point to equity investors beginning to focus on the downside potential for stocks in the months ahead. For most of the day, the VIX itself traded above the 3-month VIX futures, a rare occurrence.
""Equity investors are beginning to become so concerned about the potential downside for stocks that they are starting to irrationally pay up for short-term protection when longer-term protection is cheaper,"" Brian Reynolds, asset class strategist at New York-based Canaccord Genuity, said in a note.
Over the last year, this inversion of the VIX curve has happened only on eight trading sessions.
(Graphic: Inverted Volatility Curve - http://reut.rs/2EoUP6J)
In the recent past, these instances of inversion have been fleeting and proved to be a limited roadblock to continued gains for stocks.
""We expect this one will have a similar outcome,"" said Reynolds.
As of 2:55 p.m. EST (1955 GMT), the VIX was trading at 14.79, while the three-month futures were at 14.66.
But much will depend on how the trading session ends, Reynolds said.
""If it were to close in this fashion, it may lead to a further multi-week pullback in stocks,"" said Reynolds.
The VIX futures curve is particularly important for market participants who have used VIX-based exchange traded products to bet on continued calm in the stock market. 
Inverse volatility products such as the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN, make money as long as front month volatility futures cost less than deferred month futures - a state called ""contango."" On Tuesday, XIV shares were down 4.6 percent at $122.4.
""At this level the front-month futures are still below second month futures,"" said Joe Tigay, chief trading officer at Equity Armor Investments in Chicago. 
February VIX futures were trading at 14.2, while March VIX futures were at 14.25. 
""If that were to invert, the people short volatility via ETFs would likely have to exit. That could cause an additional increase in the futures later in the day.""

874,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 03:32PM ET</span>","Och-Ziff taps outsider as CEO, replacing founder","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Och-Ziff Capital Management on Tuesday appointed an outsider as chief executive to replace the investment firm's founder, roughly four weeks after plans to name one of its top money managers as CEO were put on hold.
Robert Shafir, a veteran wealth management industry executive, will succeed Daniel Och on Feb. 5, the company said in a statement. Och, who founded the $32 billion firm in 1994 and had been chairman and CEO from the start, will remain chairman through March 2019.
The company's share price climbed 5.22 percent to $2.42 late Tuesday afternoon.
The appointment is the most prominent fallout yet from a brewing battle between Och, other executives and board members over future leadership at the New York-based firm, known as Oz Management. On Monday, board member William Barr said he would leave the company because of succession issues. 
Last year Och, 57, tapped James ""Jimmy"" Levin, 34, the firm's co-chief investment officer, to eventually succeed him. But late last month, the firm told investors it was ""not the right time"" to promote Levin to CEO.
Shafir had been CEO of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Americas and co-head of its private banking and wealth management business. Before that he spent 17 years at Lehman Brothers. In a statement, Och called him a ""world-class executive"" who would be a great asset to the firm.
Levin, the co-chief investment officer who thought he would be moving into a bigger job, said he was excited about the future and looked forward to welcoming Shafir.
To some this suggested Levin would stay for now, which reassured some investors. ""I have no plans to make sudden moves at this point,"" said Michael Rosen, chief investment officer at Angeles Investment Advisors LLC, which invests in a fund managed by Levin.
The succession crisis broke into the public view just as Och-Ziff, which built itself into one of the hedge fund industry's biggest firms by delivering steady returns and staying out of the limelight, was hitting its stride again.
Last year it rode bets on Asian stocks and U.S. corporate mergers to strong returns with its flagship OZ Master Fund Ltd, gaining an estimated 10.4 percent.
In 2016, the firm paid $412 million to settle criminal and civil charges with the U.S. government over allegations that a unit bribed African officials. This prompted clients to pull out billions, shrinking assets from $50 billion at its peak before the financial crisis in 2005.

879,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 02:24PM ET</span>","Amazon, Berkshire, JPMorgan partner to cut healthcare costs","By Caroline Humer and Ankur Banerjee
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) will form a healthcare company aimed at cutting costs for their U.S. employees, they said on Tuesday, sending shares in the broad healthcare sector sharply lower.
The company will not aim to make a profit and initially focus on technology to provide what they called ""simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare"" for their more than 500,000 U.S. employees.
""The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,"" said Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Warren Buffett. ""Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.""
The announcement comes as investors in the healthcare sector worry that technology and retailing behemoth Amazon could become a healthcare competitor and eat away at sector profits, just as it has done in retailing.
Amazon has been looking at the pharmacy business and pharmacy distribution, according to numerous media reports and Wall Street analysts. It is unclear if the company has plans beyond this initiative.
U.S. healthcare spending increases each year faster than inflation, and in 2017 accounted for 18 percent of the U.S. economy. Corporations, which sponsor healthcare plans for more than 160 million Americans, and the U.S. government are trying to cut those costs.
Prices have risen under former Democratic President Barack Obama's 2010 Affordable Care Act, which overhauled health insurance and expanded the Medicaid government program for the poor.
Republican President Donald Trump has rolled back the mandate that required all Americans to have health insurance or pay a fine, cut subsidies for low-income people and promised new, cheaper insurance.
By teaming up with JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, and Berkshire, the third largest public company in the world, Amazon appears to be taking a big step in shaking up the health industry. 
""Investors have continually asked what unexpected development might spoil the strong investor sentiment towards managed care. Unfortunately, this seems tailor-made to fit the bill,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Borsch said in a research note.
INSURERS FALL
Health insurers that provide benefit management or health plans to the three companies could be among the hardest hit.
JPMorgan uses UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) and  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) for health benefits for its global workforce, according to ISI Evercore analyst Ross Muken. Neither company was immediately available for comment.
Amazon uses Premera Blue Cross, part of the Blue Cross Blue Shield network, according to Muken. Express Scripts, the pharmacy benefits manager, has disclosed it manages pharmacy benefits for Amazon.
Shares in UnitedHealth, Cigna Corp and health insurer Anthem Inc fell 4 percent to 7 percent. 
Drugstore operators CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) and Walgreen Boots Alliance as well Express Scripts all dropped between 4 percent to 8 percent. 
Drug distributors  Cardinal Health  (NYSE:CAH), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) and McKesson (NYSE:MCK) were off 2 percent to 4 percent. 
The plan, currently in the early stages, will be spearheaded by Berkshire investment officer Todd Combs, JPMorgan managing director Marvelle Berchtold and Amazon senior vice president Beth Galetti.
Wall Street saw the move as a positive for Amazon though its shares fell 0.5 percent. Much of Amazon's value is from its owning and interpreting massive amounts of data, according to ISI Evercore.

""Though it is unclear how the data of this venture will be shared/utilized, it is not inconceivable that Amazon could potentially leverage it longer term to better navigate the complexities of the healthcare market,"" the note said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Hackers who stole around $530 million worth of cryptocurrency from the Coincheck exchange last week -- one of the biggest such heists ever -- are trying to move the stolen ""XEM"" coins, the foundation behind the digital currency said on Tuesday.
NEM Foundation, creators of the XEM cryptocurrency, have traced the stolen coins to an unidentified account, and the account owner had begun trying to move the coins onto six exchanges where they could then be sold, Jeff McDonald said. 
Hackers made off with roughly 58 billion Japanese yen ($533 million) worth of the cryptocurrency from Tokyo-based exchange Coincheck Inc late last week, raising fresh questions about security and regulatory protection in the booming market.
The location of the hackers' account was not known.
""[The hackers are] trying to spend them on multiple exchanges. We are contacting those exchanges,"" Singapore-based McDonald told Reuters.
NEM Foundation spokeswoman Alexandra Tinsman said the hacker had started sending out ""XEM"" coins to random accounts in 100 XEM batches, worth about $83 each.
""When people look to launder these types of funds, they sometimes spread it into smaller transactions because it's less likely to trigger (exchanges') anti-money laundering (mechanisms),"" said Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic, a cryptocurrency security firm in London.
Robinson said such hopping among different cryptocurrencies was becoming more prevalent among cybercriminals trying to cover their tracks. 
The coins that the hackers had taken made up around 5 percent of the total supply of XEM, the world's 10th biggest cryptocurrency, according to trade website Coinmarketcap. 
McDonald said the hackers were unlikely to try to spend anything close to all of the stolen cryptocurrency at once, because the ""market simply couldn't absorb that much"". 
If the hackers successfully moved the coins to an exchange, they were likely to try to swap them into another cryptocurrency before transferring the coins back into a conventional currency, he said. That would make the funds difficult or near impossible to trace. 
""I would assume that they are going to get away with some of the money,"" McDonald said. 
CRYPTO-HOPPING
At least three dozen heists on cryptocurrency exchanges since 2011 are known; many of the hacked exchanges later shut down. More than 980,000 bitcoins have been stolen, and few have ever been recovered. 
In 2014, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, which once handled 80 percent of the world's bitcoin trades, filed for bankruptcy after losing bitcoins worth around half a billion dollars -- then the biggest ever such heist, which triggered a huge sell-off in bitcoin. 
""It shows how far the industry has come that a hack of this scale isn’t really an issue,"" said Robinson at Elliptic. ""This is just kind of a blip."" 
As of 1744 GMT, XEM was trading at around $0.83 per coin, with a total market value of around $7.5 billion. That was around 20 percent lower than trading levels on Friday, when the hack was announced, but XEM is still up almost 300 percent over the past two months. 

Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) on Monday ordered improvements to operations at Coincheck, which on Friday suspended trading in all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin.

(Reuters) - State-owned Qatar Airways has agreed to release detailed financial statements, the U.S. government said on Tuesday, as part of a response to accusations by U.S. airlines that the carrier had been illegally subsidized by its government.
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that Qatar and the United States had opened a ""strategic dialogue"" to address domestic airlines' concerns that the three major Gulf carriers had been unfairly propped up by their governments, putting U.S. carriers at a competitive disadvantage. 
""The outcome we achieve will ensure a level playing field in the global aviation market,"" Tillerson said at a briefing in Washington, alongside Qatari officials. 
Qatar is expected to begin publishing its annual financial statements, audited by an outside party, with the first one due over the next year. Within two years, the U.S. State Department said Qatar is expected to also disclose significant new transactions with other state-owned enterprises.
Qatar Airways was not immediately available for comment.
The largest U.S. carriers -  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) and United Continental Holdings Inc (N:UAL) - hailed the move as a victory for the domestic industry, following years of lobbying the federal government to take a tougher stance against the three Gulf carriers for what they say have been illegal state subsidies. 
The three Middle Eastern carriers - Qatar Airways, plus United Arab Emirates-based Etihad Airways and Emirates - have denied those accusations.
""Today's agreement by the State of Qatar is a strong first step in a process for commercial transparency and accountability, and we remain committed to working with the administration to address the harmful trade violations by the United Arab Emirates as well,"" Delta Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said in a statement.
The U.S. carriers have been pushing the administration of President Donald Trump to take the significant step of challenging the three Gulf carriers' conduct under its bilateral ""Open Skies"" agreements, but the administration has said its goal is to maintain the framework of the flight pacts. 
The U.S. Airlines for Open Skies Coalition, which includes smaller airlines that campaign against protectionist policies in the industry and has sided with the Gulf carriers in the dispute, also claimed Tuesday's announcement as a success.

""We appreciate the administration's strong support for maintaining the global framework of U.S. Open Skies Agreements, which will continue American aviation leadership and economic growth,"" said the coalition, which includes FedEx (N:FDX) , Atlas Air , JetBlue Airways (O:JBLU), and Hawaiian Airlines, in a statement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The jump in U.S. Treasury yields to more than three-year highs is pushing fund managers to sell interest-rate sensitive utility and real estate stocks, but does not yet threaten to derail the nine year-long bull market in U.S. equities or slow down the broader economy.
Instead, the 10-year Treasury yields would need to rise above 3 percent - or about 30 basis points from their current 2.71 percent - for the effects of higher borrowing costs to start to seep into the economy in the form of a slowdown in the housing market or consumer spending, fund managers say.
""Rates can go quite a bit higher before we see any lasting negative affects in the stock market,"" said Margaret Patel, a senior portfolio manager at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management. ""With a pickup in global economic growth and the recent U.S. tax cuts, the backdrop for equities looks a lot better than it did one or two years ago.""
As a result, Patel is selling some of her high-yield ""junk"" bond holdings and buying growth-focused equity sectors like technology and healthcare, leaving her overall bond allocation near multi-year lows, she said.
The broad S&P 500 fell nearly 1 percent in early trading Tuesday in part due to concerns about rising interest rates. The yield of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note - which helps set consumer interest rates ranging from automobile loans to mortgages - touched 2.71 percent on Tuesday, up from a low of 2.06 percent in early September.
Yet fund managers say that the recent rise in yields helps bring interest rates back to more natural levels after years of massive intervention by central banks in response to the 2008 financial crisis.
""Yields are moving back to what we consider their intrinsic valuation, yet are still low on a historical basis and aren't quite at a level where we consider them an attractive alternative"" to equities at a time when the economic expansion in the U.S. economy is accelerating, said Mike Dowdall, a portfolio manager with BMO Global Asset Management.
NO SIGNS OF BROAD ROTATION
The current bull market has weathered other quick jumps in Treasury yields without faltering. The yield of the 10-year Treasury rose from 1.7 percent in early November 2016 to 2.5 percent in March of 2017, due in part to expectations that the election of President Donald Trump would lead to higher inflation. Global economic growth and a Republican-led effort to slash corporate taxes helped push the S&P 500 up nearly 20 percent in 2017.
Overall, rising yields have not yet pushed fund managers to broadly rotate out of stocks and into bonds. So-called balanced mutual funds - those that invest in a mixture of both stocks and bonds - had 55.4 percent of their portfolios in equities at the end of 2017, down approximately 2 percentage points from 2014, according to Lipper data.
Sectors most exposed to interest rates have fallen. The SPDR Utilities Select fund (P:XLU), an exchange traded fund that tracks the performance of utilities companies, is down 4.2 percent year-to-date, while the Real Estate Select SPDR (P:XLRE) fund is down 4.1 percent. The broad S&P 500 is up 5.8 percent over the same time.
Martin Jarzebowski, a portfolio manager of the $631 million Federated Clover Small Value fund (O:VSFAX), said that he expects the stock market rally to continue even if the 10-year Treasury yield tops 3 percent by the end of the year. As a result, he is increasing his overweight in financial companies such as Iberiabank Corp (O:IBKC) and  Radian Group Inc  (N:RDN), both up 8 percent or more for the year to date.
""The rationale is there aren't just rising rates, but you also have deregulation"" as a result of the Trump administration, he said. ""It's been almost a decade since the financial sector has been in vogue.""

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Switzerland and the United States are the most secretive major financial centers in the world, according to a global ranking compiled by a group campaigning for more transparency.
The Tax Justice Network's study found Switzerland to be the ""global capital of bank secrecy"" while it placed the United States in second place because its share of global offshore financial services has increased steadily.
The study, which is published every two years, checks countries using several criteria including how much information they provide about the ownership of trusts or foundations and the degree to which they respect money-laundering rules. 
The analysis looked at 110 countries.
John Christensen, director of the network, said the study showed that while some financial centers said they were becoming more transparent, the amount of information they released depended on who requested it.
""Rich, Western countries get information but poorer countries in Africa do not,"" he said, adding that secrecy enabled money laundering and theft. 
""You have tax evasion going on every level. We are seeing the systematic looting of countries,"" said Christensen. ""The sums involved are enormous.""
Other countries that were ranked among the most significant secretive centers included the Cayman Islands, Luxembourg and Germany. Hong Kong and Singapore were also among the top 10.
The study adds to a wider debate about the use of such centers after the publication of the Panama Papers, which showed that some companies set up in tax havens may have been used for money laundering, arms and drug deals as well as tax evasion.
That embarrassed leaders worldwide who had interests tied to secretive business concerns.
Switzerland, the world's largest center for overseas wealth, will gradually dismantle bank secrecy this year when it begins sending information about its customers' accounts to foreign tax agencies.
The Alpine country's multi-trillion-dollar financial industry has, however, sought safeguards to protect against misuse of this information, a step critics said was a back-door attempt to continue with secrecy. 
The Swiss government is now considering how wide such protection should be as it further rolls back bank secrecy.
Pressure on Switzerland built after a U.S.-led crackdown starting in 2008 publicized practices used by its bankers to keep money hidden from tax authorities, from smuggling diamonds in toothpaste tubes to hiding documents in the pages of Sports Illustrated.
The United States Treasury did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

912,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",U.S. names Kremlin outliers in 'telephone directory' sanctions report,"By Jack Stubbs and Polina Devitt
MOSCOW (Reuters) - A list of wealthy Russians close to the Kremlin published by the United States on Tuesday included some businessmen who have distanced themselves from the Kremlin or even fallen foul of Russia's ruling elite.
The U.S. Treasury Department named 210 people, including 96 ""oligarchs"" with wealth of $1 billion or more, on a list of people deemed to be close to the Kremlin as part of a sanctions package signed into law in August last year.
Those included will not immediately be subject to sanctions but face potential sanctions risk. President Vladimir Putin called the list an ""unfriendly act"" that would further complicate relations between Moscow and Washington.
Some of those named, however, have publicly clashed with the Kremlin and moved their assets abroad, or been subject to prosecution and had their businesses come under attack from people close to Putin.
Senior Russian officials and business leaders, many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, also noted that the U.S. report bore similarities to the Forbes Russian billionaires rankings and publicly available lists of government employees.
""The list compilers demonstrated a good knowledge of internet resources,"" joked a person close to the Kremlin and influential business people. ""They also found the Forbes lists ... Serious and thoughtful work.""
One person whose inclusion on the list has surprised people in Moscow is Vladimir Yevtushenkov, a billionaire who was placed under house arrest in 2014 over alleged money laundering and has since clashed with powerful oil boss Igor Sechin, head of Rosneft and a long-time Putin confidant.
Russian conglomerate Sistema, which holds Yevtushenkov's assets, spent much of last year embroiled in a costly legal dispute with Rosneft over the privatization of a smaller oil firm. Sistema did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Sistema agreed to pay Rosneft 100 billion roubles ($1.79 billion) in a settlement deal in late December and has lost 40 percent of its market value since the legal battle erupted in early May. 
A senior person close to the Kremlin said the inclusion of Sergei Galitsky, CEO and majority owner of Russian food retailer Magnit, and Dmitry Kamenshchik, the owner of Russia's second-biggest airport, was also ""illogical"". 
A spokesman for Kamenshchik declined immediate comment. Magnit did not respond to a request for comment. 
Galitsky is not viewed as being close to Putin and a 20 billion rouble ($350 million) football stadium he built in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar was passed over for the 2018 World Cup. 
A Western banker in Moscow said he was surprised to see Galitsky on the list. ""Why the hell is he there?"" he said. 
Kamenshchik spent more than four months under house arrest in 2016 on charges relating to security measures at the Moscow airport he owns at the time of a terrorist attack in 2011. 
Asked for comment on Tuesday, one source at a company whose chief executive was named on the list compared the U.S. report to a ""telephone directory"".

""What even is this?,"" the source said. ""An obtusely complete list of the political leadership, plus the Forbes list. A Titanic work has been done.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A coordinated group of hackers likely tied to international criminal syndicates has pilfered more than $1 million by hijacking ATM machines across the United States and forcing them to spit out bills like slot machines dispensing a jackpot, a senior U.S. Secret Service official said on Monday.
Within the past few days there have been about a half-dozen successful ""jackpotting"" attacks, the official said.
The heists, which involve hacking ATMs to rapidly shoot out torrents of cash, have been observed across the United States spanning from the Gulf Coast in the southern part of the country to the New England region in the northeast, Matthew O'Neill, a special agent in the criminal investigations division, told Reuters in an interview.
The spate of attacks represented the first widespread jackpotting activity in the United States, O'Neill said. Previous campaigns have been spotted in parts of Europe and Latin America in recent years.
""It was just a matter of time until it hit our shores,"" O'Neill said.
Diebold Nixdorf Inc (N:DBD)and NCR Corp (N:NCR), two of the world’s largest ATM makers, warned last week that cyber criminals are targeting ATMs with tools needed to carry out jackpotting schemes.
The Diebold Nixdorf alert described steps that criminals had used to compromise ATMs. They include gaining physical access, replacing the hard drive and using an industrial endoscope to depress an internal button required to reset the device.
A confidential U.S. Secret Service alert seen by Reuters and sent to banks on Friday said machines running XP were more vulnerable and encouraged ATM operators to update to Windows 7 to protect against the attack, which appeared to be targeting ATMs typically located in pharmacies, big box retailers and drive-thrus.
While initial intelligence suggested only ATMs running on outdated Windows XP software were being targeted, the Secret Service has seen successful attacks within the past 48 hours on machines running updated Windows 7, O'Neil said.
""There isn't one magic solution to solve the problem,"" he said.
A local electronic crimes task force in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area first reported an unsuccessful jackpotting attempt last week, O'Neill said. 
A few days later another local partner witnessed similar activity and ""developed intelligence"" that indicated a sustained, coordinated attack was likely to occur over the next two weeks, O'Neill said. He declined to say where that partner was located.

Jackpotting has been rising worldwide in recent years, though it is unclear how much cash has been stolen because victims and police often do not disclose details.

(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) forecast 2018 profit and revenue well ahead of analysts' estimates on Tuesday as it expects to benefit from reduced tax rate following the recent changes to the U.S. tax code, and recorded an $11 billion gain from the overhaul.
The company's shares, which rose nearly 5 percent on Friday and hit their highest level since 2002 on Monday, fell 3 percent to $37.82 in morning trading.
The drugmaker also beat fourth-quarter profit and revenue estimates on strong demand for its pneumonia vaccine Prevnar and rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz.
Pfizer said it would invest about $5 billion in the United States over the next five years and pay about $15 billion in taxes over eight years to bring funds kept overseas back to the United States under the new tax laws.
The above consensus fourth-quarter results are ""largely irrelevent"" in the context of Pfizer's strong full-year forecast, driven by the ""dramatically improved"" 17 percent tax rate in 2018 and a strong currency tailwind, Leerink analysts said.
""Most investors were already assuming strong guidance in the wake of AbbVie Inc's (N:ABBV) recent guidance,"" the analysts said. 
Pfizer said its 2018 forecast reflected a full-year contribution from the consumer healthcare business, which the company plans to divest or spin-off this year.
The drugmaker has been under immense pressure from investors and Wall Street to pull off a large deal that could help reignite its growth, which has been reliant on drugs that are close to generic pressure following patent expirations. 
""We believe that Pfizer has the financial flexibility to add to its product portfolio through potentially sizable acquisitions, particularly now that there is clarity on U.S. tax reform,"" Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans said. 
Pfizer booked a gain of $11.34 billion from the new tax law, leading to a surge in fourth-quarter profit to $12.27 billion, or $2.02 per share. 
Excluding the tax gain and other items, the company earned 62 cents per share. Revenue rose marginally to $13.70 billion.
Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 56 cents per share and revenue of $13.68 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Prevnar raked in sales of $1.53 billion, up 8.3 percent from the year-ago quarter, while Xeljanz jumped 47.5 percent to $410 million. Both the drugs significantly beat consensus estimates, compiled by  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
However, sales of the company's breast cancer treatment, Ibrance, rose 11.4 percent to $716 million, but missed estimates of $978 million. 
Pfizer forecast full-year adjusted earnings per share of between $2.90 and $3 and revenue of $53.5 billion to $55.5 billion.

Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $2.78 per share and revenue of $53.88 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks are lining up a jumbo leveraged financing of around $13 billion to back U.S. private-equity firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group's potential acquisition of a 55 percent stake in the Financial and Risk business of Thomson Reuters Corp, banking sources said.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and JP Morgan are expected to lead the debt financing, if the deal goes ahead, with several other banks due to the large size of the underwriting, the banking sources told Loan Pricing Corp.
Thomson Reuters said in a statement late on Monday that ""it is in advanced discussions with Blackstone regarding a potential partnership in its F&R business."" The deal values the unit at about $20 billion, consisting of about $7 billion in equity and $13 billion in debt.
The financing is expected to be led from New York and comprise leveraged loans and high yield bonds, denominated mainly in dollars, sources said. It is also expected to include euro tranches, they added.
A $13 billion financing would give leverage of around 7.5 times, based on the last 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of approximately $1.7 billion for the F&R unit. Senior leverage of roughly 4.5-5.0 times could give a loan of $8 billion to $9 billion, and junior debt of $4 billion to $5 billion, sources said.
Another source familiar with the matter said that leverage was expected to be below 6.0 times.
Although the size of the financing is challenging, liquid banks and investors are eager to lend to new buyouts as the strong level of global demand continues to exceed supply.
""The market capacity for Europe is about 5 billion euros between loans and bonds and in the U.S. is $10 billion-$15 billion, so if there is a big deal that pushes capacity and the business has revenue globally it would make sense to have euro and dollars in loans and bonds to create a competitive dynamic in order to get best execution,"" a senior banker said.
It is the largest LBO loan financing since 2013 when ketchup maker HJ Heinz raised a $14.1 billion financing to back its buyout by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) and 3G Capital.
Thomson Reuters and Blackstone declined to comment.
Thomson Reuters' board is expected to meet on Tuesday to discuss Blackstone's offer for the F&R business, which supplies news, data and analytics to banks and investment houses around the world. The unit contributes more than half of Thomson Reuters' annual revenues.
Under the terms of the Blackstone offer, Thomson Reuters would retain a 45 percent stake in the F&R business in partnership with the U.S. buyout firm.

Loan Pricing Corp is a unit of Thomson Reuters.

The negative impact the announced collaboration is having on healthcare stocks is just the latest example of the outsized influence both Amazon and Berkshire can have on industries they explore. Armed with mountains of cash and an abundance of resources, their forays into new sectors can erase billions of dollars of market value in a short time.
""The healthcare system is complex, and we enter into this challenge open-eyed about the degree of difficulty,” Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a press release.
""Hard as it might be, reducing healthcare’s burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort. Success is going to require talented experts, a beginner’s mind, and a long-term orientation.""
Here’s the scoreboard:
Americans on average spent $714, or 1.6% of their take-home pay on  out-of-pocket healthcare costs in 2016, according to a report from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). That was up 3.6% from the year before and up 13.5% from 2013. The bank also found that the US spent 18% of gross domestic product on healthcare, up from 13% in 2000.

952,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 09:39AM ET</span>",VW suspends company lobbyist over 'repulsive' diesel fume tests,"By Andreas Cremer and Edward Taylor
BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) suspended its chief lobbyist on Tuesday in response to reports the carmaker had sponsored tests that exposed monkeys and humans to toxic diesel fumes, methods condemned by its chief executive as repulsive.
Europe's largest automaker has come under fresh scrutiny after the New York Times said last week that it and German peers BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) funded an organisation called European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector (EUGT) to commission the tests.
The report came more than two years after Volkswagen (VW) admitted to cheating U.S. diesel emissions tests, sparking the biggest business crisis in its history, and pledged sweeping changes to ensure such misconduct never happened again. 
""Over the weekend we had to learn once more that there is still a long way ahead of us to regain lost trust,"" VW CEO Matthias Mueller said late on Monday at a reception in Brussels in his first public remarks on the tests.
""The methods used by EUGT in the United States were wrong, they were unethical and repulsive,"" he said. ""I am sorry that Volkswagen was involved in the matter as one of the sponsors of EUGT.""
On Tuesday, VW management board accepted an offer by Thomas Steg, its chief lobbyist since 2012 and a former German government spokesman, to step aside. It appointed politics expert Jens Hanefeld as his interim replacement.
A spokesman for VW Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch said the supervisory board's executive committee will meet next week to discuss the internal investigations and ensure that such incidents will not be repeated. 
""The boundaries of decent and moral conduct were clearly crossed,"" said Bernd Osterloh, VW's labour boss, adding he will leave no doubt about workers' opposition to such tests at next week's meeting. ""It appears as if some at VW have lost their ethical and moral bearings."" 
DIESEL IN THE DOCK
The study, conducted in 2014, was designed to defend diesel following revelations that the fuel's exhaust fumes were carcinogenic, the New York Times reported.
Reuters could not confirm the details and purpose of the study and EUGT, which was dissolved last year, could not be reached for comment.
BMW and Daimler have also denounced the tests.
Mueller, a company veteran who became CEO after the emissions test cheating scandal broke in September 2015, has complained on several occasions that tackling VW's closed-off corporate culture was proving tougher than expected.
He said the New York Times report showed VW had to raise its game in improving ethical standards, and pledged to take the necessary action once it had finished investigating EUGT's work.
""We must live and deal with setbacks,"" he said.
VW said on Monday the EUGT study was never discussed in any management board meetings, after the Bild newspaper reported an internal e-mail showed at least some senior managers were informed about the design of the research. 
The study risks dealing another blow to diesel technology, in which the German auto industry has invested heavily.
Mueller and CEOs from German manufacturers and suppliers including Daimler and Continental (DE:CONG) will on Tuesday discuss ways of trying to regain the initiative after the fume test revelations, two auto industry sources told Reuters. 
Executives are expected to meet in Berlin on Tuesday to elect the new head of Germany's VDA car industry lobby.
COMING CLEAN
To regain trust, carmakers should increase support for efforts by local authorities to tackle diesel pollution, for instance by promoting electric car use in cities, said Stefan Bratzel, head of the Center of Automotive Management think-tank near Cologne.
""This scandalous affair will raise even more pressure on carmakers to help with the transition and come clean on their past sins once and for all,"" Bratzel said.
Earlier on Tuesday, the VDA said carmakers were in talks with cities including Berlin and Hamburg about ways to speed up and expand steps to tackle pollution from diesel vehicles in a bid to avoid possible bans, without giving details.
German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks, meeting in Brussels on Tuesday to discuss government measures designed to improve air quality in badly polluted cities, called the tests irresponsible.
German autos supplier Robert Bosch said on Tuesday the revelations were damaging for the entire industry and that a decline in demand for diesel could pose a threat to jobs.

""Bosch had nothing to do with the animal experiments. I am as appalled as you all are,"" CEO Volkmar Denner said.

The deal would be structured to pay more than $17 billion to Thomson Reuters, for a unit with an enterprise value of about $20 billion, two of the sources said. That $17 billion would include about $4 billion in cash from Blackstone and about $13 billion financed by new debt taken on by the new F&R partnership, the sources said.
Thomson Reuters said in a statement late on Monday that ""it is in advanced discussions with Blackstone regarding a potential partnership in its F&R business."" The company gave no more details. A spokeswoman for Blackstone declined to comment.
Thomson Reuters' New York-listed shares surged more than 10 percent in pre-market trading to around $48 on Tuesday, ranking it among the top five percentage gainers before the bell. Blackstone shares were down just over 1 percent in light volume.
If the board agrees to a deal with Blackstone, it would represent the biggest shake-up of Thomson Reuters since it was formed a decade ago by Thomson Corp's acquisition of Reuters Group Plc. Canada's Thomson bought London-based Reuters for 8.7 billion pounds in 2008, worth $17 billion at the exchange rate at the time.
Reuters was unable to determine who would lead the new division.
Thomson Reuters would hold on to its international news service, Reuters, along with its Legal and Tax and Accounting divisions. Reuters is expected to continue to supply news to F&R's flagship desktop product, Eikon, as well as to other products, though the details of the arrangement could not be determined.
The sources cautioned that a deal had not been finalised and could still fall apart. They declined to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.
It is unclear how the proposed deal would be viewed by trustees of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Co, which was set up to oversee Reuters' editorial independence when the company was first publicly listed in the 1980s.
The trustees approved Thomson's deal for Reuters a decade ago. Thomson Reuters Founders Share Co Chairman Kim Williams did not respond to requests for comment.
Blackstone's investment, if finalized, will put the buyout firm in direct competition with Bloomberg LP as well as News Corp's (O:NWSA) Dow Jones division in selling data services, analytical and trading tools to Wall Street.
Blackstone has some experience in the information business. It bought Ipreo, which sells specialist software for tracking capital markets' activities in 2014 for just under $1 billion. 
STREAMLINING
Canada's Thomson family controls more than 63 percent of Thomson Reuters shares through Woodbridge Co Ltd. The news and data provider has a market value of about $31 billion and its shares trade on the New York and Toronto stock exchanges.
Since its creation in 2008, Thomson Reuters has carried out more than 200 acquisitions, but has struggled to integrate some of the assets it took on, especially in its F&R division, which was hit hard by the financial crisis. Growth in the business has slowed as banks and brokerages shrank in the face of weak trading. But amid tougher regulations around risk-taking, the regulation and compliance business has been a bright spot. To streamline its business, Thomson Reuters has reduced the number of products within its F&R segment while shrinking its workforce.
""The progress we have made turning around the F&R business and its future potential are reflected by Blackstone’s interest,"" Thomson Reuters Chief Executive Jim Smith said in a staff memo. ""We believe F&R is well positioned within Thomson Reuters, but it could be even stronger with a partner like Blackstone.""
The company has also sought to sell non-core assets, including its intellectual property and science business, which it sold to private equity firms Onex Corp (TO:ONEX) and Baring Private Equity Asia for $3.55 billion in 2016.

Shares of Thomson Reuters have fallen 9 percent over the past 12 months compared to a 3 percent rise in the Toronto Stock Exchange's main index (GSPTSE) in the same period.

The company, which does business as Walmart, said its On Shelf Customer Availability (OSCA) data, which was only accessible internally, will be shared at the Supplier Growth Forum, a two-day event at Walmart headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
""We have reduced inventory in stores in order to have the right amount of stock and have made significant progress in the past few years,"" said Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer at Walmart U.S., told Reuters. ""We want to focus on improving that even more.""
The retailer will also tighten deadlines for delivery. In 2017 the company told suppliers it ultimately wanted orders delivered on time 95 percent of the time or they would pay a fine. The company hoped to add $1 billion to revenue by improving product availability at stores. 
Wal-Mart has been implementing that goal in phases.
It will now require large suppliers to deliver full orders within a specified delivery window 85 percent of the time or face a fine of 3 percent of the cost of goods.
Previously, large suppliers had to hit a 75 percent threshold to avoid fines.

For smaller suppliers the delivery threshold will move to 50 percent, up from 33 percent. The change will take effect in April, Bratspies told Reuters.

The S&P 500 Index’s biggest slump since September halted a rally that came in tandem with an advance in the Cboe Volatility Index, a rare occurrence that happened as investors favored VIX options to protect equity gains. The selloff that started in the U.S. triggered declines in Asian and European stock markets on Tuesday as volatility climbed across regions and asset classes.
A surge in trading of VIX options in January has helped push up the index, now at its highest level since August. A record number of contracts betting on a rebound in volatility changed hands daily this month, with volume three times greater than for puts, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The VIX and S&P 500 have been rising in unison more frequently lately. They climbed together in five months in 2017, something that had happened only in 1996 and 1995 previously, years when the equity index posted gains of more than 20 percent. Despite Monday’s slump, the S&P 500 remains on track for its best monthly advance since 2015, and the VIX is heading for its biggest surge since October 2016.
So what’s next? While that’s anybody’s guess, in the past, months of concurrent gains in the S&P 500 and VIX led to rallies in the equity measure in the following month two-thirds of the time -- and the gains were greater in that next month 72 percent of the time, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - When Apple Inc (O:AAPL) announces its first-quarter earnings on Thursday, investors will seek signs of whether the company's $999 iPhone X launched last autumn was a Steve Jobs-style hit or, as more analysts suspect, a letdown.
In recent weeks, Wall Street analysts have come to a consensus that iPhone X sales were slower than previously expected for the first quarter that ended in December and may drop off sharply for the March quarter.
Analysts have lowered their expectations for Apple's second- quarter revenue guidance to as low as $60 billion from a previous average of $67 billion.
Combined with concerns about the impact of an imbroglio in which Apple acknowledged slowing down phones with worn-out batteries, the weak iPhone X performance has again raised the question of whether the company can keep up its rapid revenue growth without a new hit product.
With eight different iPhone models priced from $350 to $999 on sale over the holidays, Apple showed that it has moved decisively away from co-founder Jobs' tight lineup of premium-priced products and embraced an iPhone-for-everybody strategy.
Analysts are questioning whether Apple can boost its revenue even as iPhone sales essentially plateau.
""Apple will have to answer the question of what's next,"" UBS analyst Steven Milunovich wrote in a note to investors. ""More services to monetize the base of one billion customers and eventually enhanced [augmented reality] capabilities may be part of the answer.""
Analysts still expect Apple to post record revenue, hitting the top of its $87 billion guidance for the holiday quarter. But they have slashed revenue estimates for the March quarter and expect the company to sell fewer iPhones in fiscal 2018 than initially thought. 
Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi predicted as few as 220 million iPhones will sell in fiscal 2018, just above the 216.7 million sold in 2017 and well below the 2015 peak of 231.2 million.
BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk spotlighted a steadily lengthening replacement cycle as new iPhones offer only small improvements over prior models. Now that it has become clear that a new battery can give life to an old phone, more customers may choose to delay an upgrade, especially with Apple cutting the price of a battery replacement to $29 from $79.
Analysts still believe Apple will report sales of $272.2 billion for its fiscal 2018, 18.7 percent above its $229.2 billion in fiscal 2017. That will be driven largely by higher average prices paid for iPhones, they said. 
'WILD CARD' 
But Apple does not give data on specific models, and with the wider lineup, analysts must do more guesswork based on surveys and other tools. They also find it harder to predict how much money Apple makes off each phone. 
""We believe that gross margins are a key wild card for investors, given limited transparency into relative margins across iPhone [models],"" Sacconaghi said in a note to investors.
All in all, it's a far cry from the days of Jobs, who shrank the company's product lineup when he returned to the helm in 1997 and kept it limited to a few models of each product at one time until his death in 2011.
But the Apple of today has something Jobs never had: An imposing user base into which it can sell a host of other products and services.

Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital and an Apple investor, believes Apple's services segment is the firm's next hit product. Analyst expect it to hit sales of $34.7 billion this year, up 16 percent.

990,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 05:50AM ET</span>",UK watchdog presses banks on 'ticking time bomb' of interest-only home loans,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Regulators told Britain's banks on Tuesday to step up checks on 1.7 million customers with interest-only home loans who in many cases have no clear plan for repaying capital.
The Financial Conduct Authority said banks and building societies are contacting customers, but a review of the market showed that some clients were reluctant to take action.
Regulators called the interest-only mortgage market a ""ticking time bomb"" in 2012 after it helped to fuel a housing boom ahead of the 2007-09 financial crisis.
A customer pays only interest until the loan's term ends, when the capital must be repaid.
Such loans helped people buy a home that they otherwise could not have afforded with a traditional loan that starts to repay capital from the beginning. 
Now far less common in new mortgages, one in five home loans outstanding are interest-only, many with shortfalls in repayment plans.
In 2013 an FCA review set out recommendations to deal with ""peaks"" in maturing loans in 2027/2028 and 2032, when customers will have to pay back the capital.
""Since 2013 good progress has been made in reducing the number of people with interest-only mortgages,"" Jonathan Davies, FCA executive director of supervision, said in a statement.
""However, we are very concerned that a significant number of interest-only customers may not be able to repay the capital at the end of the mortgage and be at risk of losing their homes."" 
Paul Smee, head of mortgages at UK Finance, the industry body that represents home loan lenders, said the FCA's review showed good progress by the sector, with some areas for improvement.
""Lenders have already improved communication with their customers and will continue to do so, to ensure that customers looking for the right option at the end of their interest-only mortgages get the right advice and support,"" Smee said.
The FCA has reviewed the sector for a second time, looking at 10 lenders who represent about 60 percent of the market.
It said there are currently 1.67 million full interest-only and part capital repayment mortgage accounts outstanding in Britain, or 17.6 percent of all home loans.

The latest review show that almost 26 percent of customers with interest-only and part capital repayment loans in the first half of 2017 are from parts of the population with lower levels of disposable income.

Toll Collect, the world's first satellite-based truck toll system, is 45 percent-owned by German carmaker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), 45 percent by Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) and 10 percent by  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) unit Cofiroute.
Confirming a report by business daily Handelsblatt, the transport ministry spokesman said that the federal government intends to take over the Toll Collect in September before starting the bidding process to renew the operating contract, which expires this year.
""It is not intended that the government will hold the shares in the operating company permanently,"" the spokesman said.
Handelsblatt's report said the reason for the planned nationalization was unresolved legal disputes between the federal government, Toll Collect and its shareholders.
There are currently two arbitration proceedings involving Toll Collect. In the first case, the government is claiming damages from Toll Collect and its consortium for the late introduction of the truck toll and for contractual penalties.
In the second case, Toll Collect is seeking compensation from the government for operation of the toll system.
The Handelsblatt report said that Berlin is still in negotiations with the shareholders in an effort to resolve the disputes and ensure that potential liabilities arising from the cases do not hinder a sale.
The ministry spokesman declined to comment further on the matter.
Daimler and Deutsche Telekom on Tuesday both declined to comment on the report.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell back on Tuesday as global markets took a risk-averse turn, with cyclical sectors including mining and financials suffering the sharpest losses.
Europe's STOXX 600 (STOXX) dropped 0.6 percent at the open before easing slightly to trade down 0.3 percent, in line with euro zone blue-chips.
The falls followed weaker trading sessions in Asia and Wall Street.
""Today is more of a temporary blip rather than a fundamental change in direction for equities. There were a number of technical indicators pointing towards market complacency and today’s move should provide some relief,"" said Prabhav Bhadani, equity strategist at JP Morgan.
The cyclical sectors leading the charge year-to-date were the worst hit as investors took profits after a strong run.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said a correction was becoming increasingly likely as the new year 'melt-up' in stocks had helped the S&P 500 and MSCI World enter their longest period without a correction of more than 5 percent. 
Mining and financial stocks were the biggest weight, while defensive sectors outperformed.
""You are seeing some sector rotation with again the winners hit the hardest. People are still looking to stay invested but looking at things that have not performed, looking at value,"" said Bhadani. 
Basic resources stocks (SXPP) sank 1.4 percent, the biggest sectoral fallers as metals prices tumbled, dented by the strengthening dollar.  Anglo American  (L:AAL) was among the worst-performing.
Europe's banking stocks also fell 0.9 percent while financial services stocks dropped 0.8 percent.
Tech stocks (SX8P) meanwhile outperformed the market, gaining 0.3 percent as they recovered from a pullback on Monday when a report Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would halve iPhone X production weighed on chipmakers.
Results drove the bulk of trading, with investors rewarding Swatch and  Alfa Laval  while Loomis and Philips disappointed.
Loomis (ST:LOOMb) was bottom of the STOXX, down 7.9 percent after the Swedish support services firm reported fourth-quarter profit missed forecasts.
Swatch (S:UHR) gained 2.8 percent after impressive results. The Swiss watchmaker's profit rose 28 percent in 2017, and it said it expected 'very positive' growth in 2018.
""The only fly in the ointment is the 20bps margin miss for the full year and approximately 50bps in the second half vs our and the market's expectation, but this should be easy to digest given the overall good (top line) performance,"" said Baader Helvea analysts.
Outside of results-driven moves,  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) rose 3.4 percent after sources said it had proposed to separate its network assets.
Swedish engineering group Alfa Laval (ST:ALFA) rose 3 percent after its fourth quarter order intake far exceeded market forecasts.
Wind turbine maker Siemens  Gamesa  (MC:SGREN) gained 5 percent after its first-quarter results, bringing peer  Vestas Wind  (CO:VWS) up with it to the top of the STOXX.
Siemens Gamesa reported orders significantly above brokers' estimates, and a trader said the market was short the stock, making any good news an even bigger boost.

Medical technology firm Philips (AS:PHG) fell back 2.5 percent, with traders pointing to the firm missing fourth-quarter earnings and revenue expectations.

The companies did not disclose financial terms.
""We bought every car in the portfolio that is subject to an active lease agreement,"" a Fair spokesperson said.
Fair said it formed a partnership in which it will be the exclusive long-term vehicle leasing partner to Uber in the United States for drivers wanting vehicles for 30 days or longer.
Fair, based in Southern California, said it was buying the lease portfolio through equity and debt secured during its recent funding round.
We have raised capital from a number of investment banks and from strategic investors such as Germany's BMW and Daimler, Fair Chief Executive Officer Scott Painter told Reuters.
According to a Wall Street Journal report in December, the net book value of Xchange Leasing's more than 30,000 vehicles was roughly $400 million.
Uber said in September it was closing the auto-leasing business, which had heavy losses. Xchange Leasing started to unwind over the last few months of 2017.
Fair, founded in 2016, matches customers with cars based on what they are able to pay each month. Customers get approved and pay for their car through Fair, which owns the vehicle, and pick up the car at a dealership.

1006,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 01:53AM ET</span>","U.S. washer tariffs put Samsung, LG supply chains through the wringer","By Ju-min Park
SEOUL (Reuters) - When South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and LG Electronics last year announced plans to build home appliance factories in the United States, they hoped to sidestep any fallout from President Donald Trump's ""America First"" manufacturing and jobs mantra.
Last week's decision by the U.S. government to impose tariffs of up to 50 percent on imports of washing machines and key components showed that wasn't to be. 
The inclusion of hefty tariffs on components in particular had moved the goal posts in a long-running trade dispute, upending supply chains and threatening investment across other industries, officials from the companies and the South Korean government said. 
""It's unprecedented and excessive, and will set alarm bells ringing for other companies doing businesses in the United States,"" said one Samsung official, declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media. 
After committing hundreds of millions of dollars to build the plants and bring jobs to South Carolina and Tennessee, the ruling caught the companies by surprise and was a ""worst case"" scenario, according to one executive.
Samsung says it will use imported parts until its factory runs at full capacity and becomes ready to produce key parts, expected to be by the end of the year.
Samsung, which relies on a sprawling manufacturing base in low-cost countries such as Vietnam has argued that a tight quota on overseas-made parts could deny it the supply chain flexibility it may need as its new U.S. production lines set up. 
The ruling on a quota for foreign components is also making other manufacturers and suppliers jittery.
""Even if you bring your tier-1 supplier with you to ... the U.S. manufacturing facilities, your tier-1 suppliers will have tier 2 and 3 suppliers which would source components from abroad. It makes it very complicated to calculate,"" a senior executive at Korean automaker Hyundai Motor told Reuters.
""You've got to find a way to adapt or circumvent somehow.""
An executive at South Korean battery-to-chemicals conglomerate SK Group said the news was also bad news for producers of intermediary goods such as SK, which supplies big manufacturers with thousands of components that will now be caught up in the spat.
Privately owned Dongjin Techwin, which supplies LG Electronics Inc, is already bracing for contract losses, as LG moves to produce components in-house.
""There'd be little point on trying to figure out how to export components from Korea to the United States, and then build a washing machine there,"" Jung Hyun-mo, a senior executive at Dongjin, told Reuters. ""There just isn’t the export-import supply chain in place for that."" 
CUT OFF AT THE KNEES
The decision by Trump in the ""Section 201"" safeguard case came after the U.S. International Trade Commission found last year imports were ""a substantial cause of serious injury to domestic manufacturers"" including Whirlpool Corp (NYSE:WHR).
The tariffs exceeded the harshest recommendations from ITC members, with a 20 percent tariff set on the first 1.2 million imported large residential washers in the first year, and a 50 percent tariff on additional imports.
Washington also imposed a 50 percent tariff on imported key parts in excess of 50,000 units in the first year, a move Samsung's South Carolina plant manager fears could ""cut us off at the knees"".
""Although we are installing production equipment and we are committed to producing the major parts in-house, there will be a transition period during which importing parts will be necessary to successfully launch this facility,"" Tony Fraley, Samsung's plant manager, told the commission in October.
When asked if there were any plan for price hikes to counter the tariffs, Samsung said it would discuss any changes with its business partners.
Consultancy firm Euromonitor estimates South Korean washing machine makers would need to raise prices by $50 to $400 to cushion the impact of tariffs. 
LG was set to start production at its new plant in the third quarter at the earliest and is now working to accelerate its launch with officials in Clarksville, Tennessee who are eager for the jobs the new factory will bring.
""We had several scenarios... this safeguard measure turned out to be the worst case one,"" Kim Gun-tai, head of LG’s home appliance division told a conference call last week.
LG, which announced a plan to raise prices on its washing machines sold in the United States last week, said in a separate statement to Reuters it was absorbing a significant portion of the tariff on parts. Once its U.S. plant's operation began it would produce key parts on site, it added.
The safeguard issue is set to top the agenda when government officials from the two countries meet later this week to discuss trade issues.

South Korea has already filed challenges and demands for compensation at the World Trade Organisation under the Safeguard Agreement.

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 01:41AM ET</span>",Renault-Nissan group pips VW to become top-selling carmaker in 2017,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The Renault-Nissan automaking alliance emerged as the world's biggest seller of light vehicles in 2017, bumping Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG off the top spot, after the inclusion of Mitsubishi Motors' numbers boosted its final tally. 
Nissan Motor Co's sales hit a record high of 5.82 million, while French automaker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) has reported sales of 3.76 million. Mitsubishi's sales came in at 1.03 million, bringing total 2017 sales for the group to around 10.61 million light vehicles. 
Together, the three automakers beat record sales of around 10.53 million light vehicles at Volkswagen, 2016's top seller which also includes the Audi, Skoda, Seat and Porsche brands.
Toyota Motor Corp, which held the No.2 spot in 2016, posted group sales of 10.2 million units last year, excluding its Hino Motors heavy trucks. 
Many automakers are trying to boost sales volumes to achieve economies of scale and cut costs amid soaring investments needed to develop next-generation automotive technologies - including self-driving cars, electric vehicles and new mobility services.
This has been a focus of the Renault-Nissan group, and was a key motivation for Nissan when it acquired a controlling stake in smaller rival Mitsubishi Motors in 2016. 
Renault-Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn has pledged to make scale an advantage and use it to double savings to 10 billion euros ($12 billion) by 2022, based on a rise in annual sales volumes to 14 million units. 
Renault, Nissan and some other automakers are looking to share more vehicle parts and consolidate production platforms to trim R&D and manufacturing costs and raise profitability. 
Toyota is taking a similar approach, while it is also partnering with Mazda Motor Corp and Suzuki Motor Corp to reign in the costs of developing and marketing electric cars and other new technologies.
But not all automakers consider scale as a way to increased efficiency and profitability. 
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) has concluded that size does not matter as much, selling its struggling European operation Opel to PSA last year to focus capital on more profitable ventures.
The strategy seems to have worked for the U.S. automaker, which posted a profit margin of 6.8 percent in January-September. That was higher than a 5.0 percent margin at Nissan and 4.3 percent at Mitsubishi Motors in the six months through October, and a 4.8 percent margin at Renault over January-June.
Earlier this month, GM pointed to new trucks and SUVs, a new, low-cost car for international markets, and the Cadillac luxury brand as possible future earnings drivers.

1009,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 01:30AM ET</span>","Asia stocks off record highs as Wall St. flags, dollar firms on higher yields","By Shinichi Saoshiro
TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks retreated from record highs on Tuesday after a selloff in Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) and spike in bond yields knocked Wall Street lower, while the dollar found support as U.S. bond yields climbed to near four-year highs.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 1.1 percent after rising to an all-time high the previous day. It was still on track for a 6.5 percent monthly gain.
Australian stocks shed 0.9 percent, South Korea's KOSPI lost 1 percent and Japan's Nikkei dropped 1.4 percent.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.9 percent and Shanghai was down 0.8 percent.
Spreadbetters expect the negative pressure to spill over to Europe, forecasting Britain's FTSE to drop 0.7 percent at the open, Germany's DAX to open 0.8 percent lower and France's CAC to lose 0.6 percent at the open.
The bearish sentiment in Asia followed a softer lead from Wall Street, which has led a global equities rally over the past year thanks to strong world growth fuelling higher corporate earnings and stock valuations.
On Monday, U.S. stocks pulled back from record highs, with the Dow and the S&P 500 indexes marking their biggest one-day percentage declines in about five months, weighed down by a slide in Apple shares. 
The dollar, however, enjoyed a reprieve from some persistent selling in the past few weeks.
Buoyed by higher U.S. bond yields, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was 0.15 percent higher at 89.457, having bounced overnight from a three-year low of 88.438 plumbed on Friday when peers like the euro outshone the greenback.
The 10-year Treasury note yield stretched its overnight surge above 2.70 percent and reached its highest since April 2014 after comments from a European Central Bank official added to expectations that central banks globally will reduce stimulus as the economic outlook improves. 
""This is a rise in real interest rates, also reflecting a rise in inflation expectations,"" said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo.
""The yield rise may have bumped off U.S. stocks from highs, but a correction was due after their recent gains,"" Ichikawa said.
The U.S. Treasury Department said on Monday that it expects to borrow $441 billion through the credit markets in the January-March quarter, less than announced previously. 
Treasury yields remained elevated, however, as U.S. borrowing is expected to continue increasing steadily in the coming years as the federal government looks for ways to fund budget deficits.
Moreover, the bond market braced for potentially hawkish language from the Federal Reserve, which will begin its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asia is at the heart of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Wealth Management's plan to rebuild after a shaky few years with further staff hires expected to complement a recovery in assets that is outpacing the global trend, its regional head said on Tuesday.
Deutsche Bank dropped out of the world's top 15 private banks in 2016, after it withdrew from a number of countries, saw some high profile departures and German's biggest lender was lumped with a hefty fine for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities before the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
Lok Yim, its head of Asia Pacific wealth management, said that period was now firmly in the past and he planned to add 20-25 mostly client-focused executives per annum in his unit going forward on top of 50 hired over the last year.
""Having taken away the uncertainties and done the recovery, you now go to the growth mode,"" Yim said.
""The growth is going to be driven by Asia, and we are going to take a larger proportion of the investments and the growth aspiration.""
Yim was appointed Asia head in late 2016 to replace Ravi Raju who left for UBS after nearly 10 years at the bank.
The private bank's global assets under management fell from 374 billion euros ($462.5 billion) in 2015 to 300 billion euros in 2016, while Asia Pacific saw a drop from 51 billion euros to 45 billion euros.
But since then, Asia has staged a recovery while global assets have held steady. As of the third quarter of 2017, Asian assets were up at 48 billion euros while global assets were unchanged at 300 billion euros. Full-year data will be unveiled this week.
""The expectation of a mass exodus actually never happened. Client confidence came back very quickly,"" Yim said.
Asia's private banking sector has seen consolidation in recent years, with local players such as Singapore's DBS Group emerging to challenge global firms in the race to service a region that boasts more billionaires than anywhere else.
Lim said Deutsche's focus will be on ultra high net worth clients in the region, those with more than $25 million, and the top end of the $5-$25 million high net worth bracket, he said.
Yim said Deutsche differentiates itself with its global reach and its investment bank capabilities in structured finance.
He said growth in the region was centered on the major economies of India, China and Indonesia, but he also picked out Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Thailand.

1014,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 11:30PM ET</span>",Indonesia's fintech lending boom exploits shortfall in bank loans,"By Fransiska Nangoy and Tabita Diela
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Fintech firms, offering loans of as little as a few hundred dollars, are seeing a spike in lending in Indonesia where tens of millions of people have little or no access to bank credit - helping alleviate a financing shortfall estimated at more than $73 billion.
The emergence of these peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms has so far been welcomed by Indonesia's financial regulators which see them as offering a much needed service to cash-strapped businesses and consumers at a time when Southeast Asia's biggest economy has been hobbled by sluggish bank lending. 
Wimboh Santoso, head of Indonesia's financial regulator (OJK), said while the trend was still a drop in the ocean of overall lending, more than 250,000 people had taken out loans through fintech. Around 30 P2P firms had extended 2.6 trillion rupiah ($193.8 million) in lending as of January 2018, compared with just 247 billion rupiah of lending in December 2016. Another 36 more firms were waiting to be approved, he added.
P2P lending has helped small businesses access capital. 
""It is so flexible. I don't need collateral and I can submit my documents anytime of the day. There's no bank like that,"" said Siyono, a 51-year-old business owner in Jakarta, who stumbled on a P2P platform while browsing on his smartphone and took out a loan at around 16 percent annual interest.
Bank loan penetration in Indonesia, where only one in three adults have bank accounts, was around 34 percent of GDP in 2015, among the lowest of Asia Pacific countries. Loan growth has also fallen below 10 percent since the start of 2016, compared with more than 20 percent during the commodity boom years before that.
While P2P platforms will help Indonesia progress toward a digital economy, some analysts warn that a more accurate credit assessment process must be developed.
"" Prudential  (LON:PRU) principles that have been implemented by banks, have to be implemented by these firms too. They may have to be even more prudent, since the credit histories of their borrowers are unknown,"" said Damhuri Nasution, an analyst with Danareksa Research Institute in Jakarta.
SMARTPHONES BOOST 
Soaring smartphone ownership, with more than 100 million smartphones sold in the country of around 250 million people, has fueled the growth of P2P.
Financing demand had been ""beyond expectation"", said Reynold Wijaya, co-founder and chief executive of Sequoia Capital-backed ModalKu, which has distributed more than 540 billion rupiah in financing to SMEs in Indonesia within two years of operation.
ModalKu accepts less than a fifth of loan applicants to curb the risk of fraud or default.
""The biggest reason for default in Indonesia is actually not credit risks, but mostly fraud,"" said Wijaya. 
OJK also wants P2P operators to expand financing to Indonesia's 40 million farmers. 
""Agriculture is still also a segment that is underserved and a lot of them have to rely on 'tengkulak', and we'd like to change that,"" said Benedicto Haryono, chief executive of KoinWorks, referring to middlemen who buy farmers' produce and give out short-term loans, often at high interest rates.
Koinworks, which aims to lift financing six- to seven-fold this year, is launching pilot agriculture loans this year, and Haryono said this could give farmers a credit history and make them more bankable.
Such platforms can also tap overseas funding. KoinWorks, where the minimum amount users can lend is 100,000 rupiah ($7.50), obtains funding from countries such as Germany, Singapore and Australia.
Nurhaida, deputy chairman of OJK, told reporters the regulator is working on a roadmap to ""regulate and facilitate fintech development"". 
Operators, however, hope that any new rules will not be too onerous.
""We are still start-ups, we can't be too strictly regulated just yet,"" said ModalKu's Wijaya.

The first payment is part of 60 installments that Qualcomm will have to fork out for the fine totaling T$23.4 billion the commission slapped on the chipmaker for the violations, the regulator told a news conference.
As part of the agreement, the chipmaker will make monthly payments over the next five years to pay off the fine, the commission said.
Earlier, the commission said Qualcomm had a monopoly over the chip market for several so-called modem technologies, which provide wireless data connectivity for mobile phones, and refused to license its technology to other industry players.
Qualcomm's fine is the latest in a years-long streak of regulatory setbacks to its business model that comes as it also fights U.S. regulators and iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in court over many of the same legal issues. 
In December 2016, South Korean regulators fined Qualcomm $854 million for violating its competition laws, a ruling that followed a $975 million fine from Chinese regulators in 2015.

The hedge fund firm said in a regulatory filing on Monday that Barr's decision to step down from the seven-member board ""relates to a disagreement over CEO succession, as well as business and governance plans for the Company."" Barr notified the firm of his plans last week and Och-Ziff made the news public on Monday.
The firm, which invests $32 billion and is one of only a few publicly traded hedge funds, made headlines last week with news that its succession plans had been ripped up.
The firm told investors late last month that it was ""not the right time"" to promote co-Chief Investment Officer James ""Jimmy"" Levin to CEO. The firm also said that founder, chairman and chief executive officer Daniel Och and the firm's board of directors hoped that the 34-year-old Levin, Och's longtime protégé and heir apparent, would remain as co-CIO. David Windreich is the other co-CIO and is also a board member.
The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the board had wanted to move ahead with the succession plan to let Levin take over this year but that Och soured on Levin and refused to accept the plan. Och, through a spokesman, and Levin did not respond to requests last week for comment.
Barr, a lawyer who had served as a U.S. Attorney General, joined Och-Ziff's board in 2016. He sent a one paragraph note informing Och and others of his plans on January 23.
""This is to advise you that I am resigning from the board of directors, effective at the end of this month (January). If that timing causes any difficulties for the company, please let me know."" The email was attached as an exhibit to the filing.
He serves as Chairman of Och-Ziff's Corporate Responsibility and Compliance Committee and as a member of the Audit Committee and the Nominating Committee.
Och-Ziff built itself into one of the hedge fund industry's biggest firms by staying out of the limelight and delivering steady returns that delighted pension funds.
But it made headlines when a subsidiary admitted to bribing African officials and after paying $412 million to settle criminal and civil charges with the U.S. government. This prompted clients to pull out billions, shrinking assets from $50 billion at its peak before the financial crisis in 2005.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May promised to hold ""frank discussions"" with China during a crucial trade visit later this week, with several awkward diplomatic issues like North Korea and Brexit expected to be discussed.
May will use meetings with President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang to try to regain momentum in the international race to secure British participation in China's services sector boom as she seeks a new role for Britain outside the European Union.
Traveling with her husband Philip and a delegation of 50 business leaders, May has to reheat diplomatic ties that have suffered from a perceived coldness since she took power shortly after Britain's Brexit vote in July 2016.
“My visit will intensify the 'Golden Era' in UK-China relations. The depth of our relationship means we can have frank discussions on all issues,"" May said in a statement. She is due to depart on Tuesday afternoon.
May has echoed calls by U.S. President Donald Trump for China to press neighboring North Korea into reining in its nuclear and missile development.
Britain has also previously expressed concern about steel overproduction, human rights abuses and the health of democratic development in former British colony Hong Kong.
Britain's last governor in Hong Kong before it was handed back to the Chinese, Chris Patten, had written to May on Monday urging her to raise concerns over the ""increasing threats to the basic freedoms, human rights and autonomy"" in the territory.
In the past sensitive diplomatic issues have spilled over into trade talks, with May's predecessor David Cameron prompting a freeze in relations in 2012 by meeting the Dalai Lama in London. 
With Britain about to undergo its most significant economic upheaval since World War Two, relations with China are set to become increasingly important as May's government looks to develop markets outside the EU.
But Chinese officials have expressed unease about what Brexit could mean for Chinese firms who have invested in Britain.
May is also under pressure to deliver a positive story in China from those closer to home. Her position as leader has been weakened by ministers openly lobbying for different types of exit and hardline eurosceptics unhappy at her Brexit strategy. 
Trade secretary Liam Fox will head a diverse delegation ranging from executives of large multinationals like HSBC and AstraZeneca to smaller firms like Northern Irish seafood wholesaler Rooney Fish.

""Our relationship is now more important than ever, as we look to form new trading bonds with the biggest growing markets around the world,"" Fox said, citing data showing China's middle class is expected to grow to 600 million people by 2020.

1020,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 07:40PM ET</span>",Asset managers rush to launch MSCI index funds ahead of China A-share inclusion,"By Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese asset managers, seeking to get ahead of an expected wave of foreign money inflows, are racing to launch index funds that place bets on a select group of mainland stocks, which will be included in MSCI's emerging market benchmark this year.
The first such product to follow MSCI's inclusion announcement in June is Truvalue Asset Management Co's MSCI China stock index fund, which launched after receiving the regulatory green light earlier this month. Launches from other fund managers are also in the pipeline. 
While some foreign investors are still haunted by painful memories of China's 2015 stock market crash and concerns about current elevated valuations, a deeper ""fear of missing out"" is expected to support a surge in mainland stocks.
MSCI's decision last June to include yuan-denominated Chinese stocks, known as ""A-shares"", into its emerging market (EM) index has already boosted interest in China's banking and consumer heavyweights. But an explosion in funds allowing more focused bets will likely add fuel to China's blue-chip euphoria. 
Truvalue fund manager Chen Long forecasts that the partial inclusion would initially trigger 80 billion yuan ($12.52 billion) of passive investments into China, while an eventual full inclusion will usher in 2.5 trillion yuan of inflows.
The fund, which tracks the MSCI China A International Index, would enable investors to get ahead of overseas investors ""with just one press of a button,"" Chen said.
Such a strategy has a good chance of success, he said, citing post-inclusion stock performances in markets including South Korea, South Africa and Taiwan. 
In June and September, MSCI will add around 230 large-cap Chinese stocks into its EM index in a two-stage process. They will represent a 0.73 percent index weighting, with MSCI's 5 percent partial inclusion factor taking China's foreign ownership caps and market accessibility into account.
Truvalue's rivals Invesco Great Wall, PingAn-UOB and Huaan have also applied to launch MSCI index funds, which are among about two dozen such products awaiting the regulatory nod.
Already, foreign funds with existing exposure to A-shares have witnessed a surge in demand.
Four years ago, U.S. asset managers Krane Funds Advisors launched its New York-listed KraneShares Bosera MSCI China A Share ETF (P:KBA). In 2017, this fund saw a 12-fold surge in assets under management to about $300 million following MSCI's inclusion announcement.
MSCI estimates that a full inclusion could potentially give A-shares an approximately 18 percent weighting in the MSCI EM Index, enabling China to dwarf many large emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia and India.
Investor concerns center on some lofty valuations in Chinese stocks, as well as recollections of the 2015 market rout, during which over 1,000 stocks were suspended from trading to avert a deeper meltdown.
A bigger worry, however, seems to be the possibility of having no exposure to China at all.
""Prejudice and information disparity resulted in foreign under-investment in China stocks in the past. The MSCI inclusion is an ice-breaking event that will stimulate foreign demand for A-share allocation,"" said Wan Qiong, fund manager at Bosera Asset Management. 
""As foreigners' understanding of China deepens, global investors will gradually move from underweight China, to equal-weight and eventually overweight.""
UBS strategist Gao Ting expects foreign ownership in Chinese A-share market to be raised to 10-12 percent in the coming years, from less than 2 percent currently. 
Anthony Cragg, senior portfolio manager at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management, and a veteran China investor, said while many global investors have finally ""woken up"" to China, funds worldwide remain ""massively"" underweight. 
Victoria Mio, Asia Pacific equities co-head at Dutch asset manager Robeco put it more bluntly:
""If you are underweight China, there's a price to pay.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) on Monday promoted Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith to be co-presidents and co-chief operating officers, a move seen as heightening competition for the job of CEO held by Jamie Dimon.
However, Dimon said in a statement he plans to continue in his current role ""for approximately five more years"". 
Pinto and Smith run JPMorgan's most prominent businesses, with Pinto, 55, overseeing the corporate and investment banking unit while Smith, 59, runs consumer and community banking.
While their names have been mentioned before as potential successors to Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, their elevation is the clearest signal that planning is actively under way for when he steps aside.
Dimon, 61, has been running JPMorgan since 2005, making him one of just two big bank CEOs who have been in the role since before the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The other is  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein, who also has two deputies acting as co-presidents and co-COOs.
The question of who will be succeed Dimon is one of Wall Street's favorite parlor games, and his eventual departure is something that worries investors who credit him with steering JPMorgan through the financial crisis and turning it into the largest U.S. bank.
""The longer he can stay, the better,"" said Walter Todd, president and chief investment officer of Greenwood Capital Associates. ""We've been a long-time holder of JPMorgan and you could argue he's probably the best bank CEO in the country.""
Dimon's plan to stay as CEO for about five more years may provide some relief for shareholders who were worried he might leave to run for political office in 2020, said Brian Kleinhanzl, a bank analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
""A small overhang is lifted from shares of JPMorgan,"" Kleinhanzl wrote in a note to clients. JPMorgan shares were little changed in after-hours trading.
Shareholders have worried about Dimon's departure for some time. 
When JPMorgan suffered more than $6 billion losses from outsized positions of a trader known as the ""London whale"" in 2012, there was speculation that Dimon might be forced to leave.
Two years later, Dimon was diagnosed with cancer, for which he was successfully treated. 
Just last autumn, there were conflicting reports about whether he would leave to become U.S. Treasury Secretary under President Donald Trump.
More recently, people in political and business circles have wondered whether Dimon will run for U.S. president himself in 2020. It is something he has mused about publicly, though people close to Dimon say he has no intention of hitting the campaign trail.
While Pinto and Smith are now considered front-runners to succeed Dimon, Monday's promotions do not guarantee that either of them will become CEO.
In the past, top JPMorgan executives who were said to be favorites in the CEO race ended up leaving the bank instead.
They include Matt Zames, who had been sole COO until June, as well as Michael Cavanagh, who left to join private equity firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) LP in 2014, and Jes Staley who instead became CEO of  Barclays  (LON:BARC) PLC.
Other names cited by sources as potential successors include Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake, as well as Mary Erdoes, who runs asset management and Doug Petno, who runs commercial banking. In the statement, Dimon thanked them for taking on added responsibilities last year and for supporting company-wide initiatives.

Schumer is the Senate Minority Leader and Slaughter is his chief counsel who has worked for him since 2009, according to her Linkedin page. She graduated from Yale Law School in 2008.
President Donald Trump last week sent the names of four FTC nominees to the Senate for confirmation. 
They are Republicans Joe Simons, Noah Phillips and Christine Wilson along with Democrat Rohit Chopra, a former official at the Consumer Financial Protection Board, to the FTC. 
Simons was tapped to chair the commission.
A spokesman for Schumer declined comment when asked if he had recommended Slaughter for the FTC position.
The FTC works with the U.S. Justice Department to enforce antitrust law. The agency has five commissioners but only three can be from one political party.
The agency is currently headed by acting Chairwoman Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican, with Democrat Terrell McSweeny the only other commissioner.
Ohlhausen has been nominated to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. McSweeny's term ended last fall, but she has stayed on pending confirmation of a replacement.
The agency is reviewing a number of big mergers in industries where there are already few players.

One is a deal to merge industrial gases companies  Praxair Inc  (NYSE:PX) and  Linde  AG (DE:LING). It will also decide whether lens maker Essilor International (PA:ESSI) SA will be allowed to merge with dominant frame-maker Luxottica Group SpA.

Nomura said in a statement late on Monday it had hired 15 senior bankers in the United States over the past 12 months in areas including mergers and acquisitions, leveraged finance, and equity capital markets.
The brokerage has made a U.S. expansion of its investment banking arm one of its priorities as it strives to earn more stable income from advisory services. Its hires include bankers covering the healthcare, technology, and financial services sectors, it said.
The expansion comes after a major restructuring in 2016 - including a big shrinking of its operations in Europe - following its acquisition of Lehman Brothers' Asian and European businesses in 2008. That led to six consecutive years of losses for its international operations.
Reuters reported last year that Nomura planned to add a dozen senior- and mid-level investment bankers over the next 12 to 18 months in the United States as it anticipated more deals by Japanese firms in the area or by U.S. companies overseas. 
Japanese companies, flush with cash and facing limited growth at home, have sought to acquire firms in the United States. Nomura's peers are also looking to expand to take advantage of the trend.
Last year, No.2 brokerage Daiwa Securities Group Inc (T:8601) bought two U.S. boutique merger-and-acquisitions advisory firms to strengthen its M&A operations.

(Reuters) - MetLife Inc (N:MET) said on Monday the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the insurer's failure to pay some workers' pensions.
MetLife, in a statement, said the SEC's enforcement staff has inquired about payments that the insurer failed to make for people who receive a type of annuity benefit from the company via its retirement business. Less than 5 percent of 600,000 people are affected, the company has said.
The New York insurer estimated increasing total reserves by between $525 million and $575 million on a pre-tax basis, resulting in a hit to fourth-quarter earnings of $135 million to $165 million.
Last month, MetLife said it failed to pay pensions to possibly tens of thousands of people and would have to strengthen its reserves because of the costs of finding and repaying them.
""To date, MetLife is not aware of any intentional wrongdoing in connection with this matter,"" the company said on Monday, adding that it was responding to the SEC's questions.
MetLife shares closed at $54.40, down 0.7 percent.
The insurer is reviewing its processes and procedures for identifying people who receive the type of group annuity benefit at issue as well as pension beneficiaries, it said.
Regulators in Massachusetts and New York state said in December they were probing the pension payment issue. [L1N1OI197]

MetLife has postponed its fourth-quarter earnings report and conference call, which had been scheduled for this week, to Feb. 13 and 14, respectively, the company said.

1025,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>","Exclusive: With Roman law doctrine, India moves to stub out tobacco industry rights","By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government is pushing the Supreme Court to apply a rarely used doctrine that would strip the $11 billion tobacco industry's legal right to trade, an effort aimed at deterring tobacco companies from challenging tough new regulations.
New Delhi has for the first time asked the top court to classify tobacco as ""res extra commercium"", a Latin phrase meaning ""outside commerce,"" according to a Reuters review of previously unreported court filing by the Health Ministry on Jan. 8.
If applied, the doctrine - which harkens back to Roman law - would have far reaching implications: in denying an industry's legal standing to trade, it gives authorities more leeway to impose restrictions. 
For example, the Supreme Court's application of the doctrine to alcohol in the 1970s paved the way for at least two Indian states to ban it completely and allowed courts to take a stricter stance while regulating liquor - something constitutional law experts say could happen with tobacco if a similar ruling was made.
""The effects of tobacco are much more than even alcohol ... It will be a fillip to this drive against tobacco,"" said government lawyer R. Balasubramanian, who is acting on behalf of the Ministry of Health in pursuing the designation. 
Balasubramanian, however, said the government is not discussing banning tobacco and the goal of invoking the Roman law doctrine was only to curtail the industry's legal rights.
CURBS AND RESTRICTIONS
With an aim to curb tobacco consumption - which kills more than 900,000 people each year in India - the government has in recent years raised tobacco taxes, started smoking cessation campaigns and introduced laws requiring covering most of the package in health warnings.
But a court in southern Karnataka state last month quashed those labeling rules after the tobacco industry successfully argued the measure was ""unreasonable"" and violated its right to trade.
The government this month appealed the ruling in the Supreme Court which put on hold the Karnataka court order. The top court will next hear the case on March 12.
In its filing, the government included ""res extra commercium"" because it wants to stop the industry from pursuing such arguments again, said Balasubramanian. 
Seeking to apply the doctrine to tobacco, the government argued it should have the power ""to regulate business and to mitigate evils"" to safeguard public health, the court filing showed.
Sajan Poovayya, a senior lawyer representing top Indian cigarette maker  ITC  Ltd (NS:ITC) and Philip Morris International Inc's (N:PM) Indian partner, Godfrey Phillips (NS:GDFR), said the industry's legal rights would be severely limited if the court applies the doctrine to tobacco.
Poovayya said he would fight the government's argument ""tooth and nail"" and make a case that taking away the industry's right to trade would imperil millions of Indian farmers who depend on tobacco for their living. The industry estimates 45.7 million people in India depend on tobacco for their living.
""India is a tobacco growing country and there's a need to look at the interest of those people who are already in the sector,"" Poovayya said. 
""Tobacco is not destructive to health. If tobacco is, sugar is as well."" 
ITC and Godfrey Phillips, as well as India's health ministry, did not respond to requests for comment.
SET A PRECEDENT
India's tobacco labeling rules, which mandate 85 percent of a cigarette pack's surface be covered in health warnings, have been a sticking point between the government and the tobacco industry since they were enforced in 2016.
That year, the industry briefly shut factories across the country in protest and filed dozens of legal cases challenging the rules. 
The federal health ministry says stringent health warnings on packages help reduce consumption of tobacco by making people aware of its ill-effects. A government survey last year found 62 percent of cigarette smokers thought of quitting because of warning labels on the packets.
Mary Assunta, a long-time tobacco control advocate and a senior policy advisor at the Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance, said she had never heard of a country applying the ""res extra commercium"" doctrine to tobacco, but hoped India would set a precedent.
""Such a classification will help protect tobacco control measures from being challenged, particularly for developing countries where the bulk of the smokers are,"" Assunta said.
The doctrine would open the door to an outright ban on tobacco sales if a state so wished, said Pratibha Jain, a partner at law firm Nishith Desai Associates and a specialist in Indian constitutional law.

""It gives the state autonomy to completely ban trade in tobacco,"" Jain said. ""It gives governments the constitutional cover that will protect future litigation. The industry will lose significant ground as your protection of right to trade is gone.""

SEOUL (Reuters) -  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) will unveil on Tuesday a re-designed Santa Fe, hoping the first makeover of the sport utility vehicle (SUV) in six years will help rectify a sales slowdown at the South Korean automaker, especially in the key U.S. market. 
The revamped version of its top-selling SUV in the United States and South Korea is larger and more fuel-efficient than its predecessor, and boasts advanced driver-assist features used in its Genesis premium sedans, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
""The new Santa Fe will be a bread and butter model for us this year,"" the Hyundai insider told Reuters on condition of anonymity since he is not authorized to speak to the media. 
""We have high hopes for the model,"" he said.
Hyundai Motor reported last week its worst annual earnings in seven years, battered by its delayed response to the burgeoning SUV market and a diplomatic row with China.
A firmer local currency also adds to the woes of the automaker, as it is eating into its profits repatriated from overseas and hurts the price competitiveness of its exports in the United States and other markets. 
Hyundai is expected to take preorders for the new Santa Fe from next week and the vehicle is likely to be launched in South Korea as early as late February, the source said. Pricing details could not be obtained immediately.
""The mission of the Santa Fe is to recover Hyundai's U.S. market share. It carries a big burden on its shoulder,"" said Ko Tae-bong, a senior auto analyst at Hi Investment & Securities. The U.S. sales of the aging Santa Fe slumped 25 percent last year even as U.S. industry SUV and truck sales rose 4 percent. 
The model, expected in the U.S. market in the third quarter of this year, will be also ""key to recovering the utilization rate of Hyundai's factory in Alabama"", Ko said.
Hyundai's U.S. sales fell 12 percent last year, making it the worst performer among automakers in that market, hit by the conservative design of the Sonata and the Elantra sedans and an absence of a broadbased SUV line-up. 
The new Santa Fe is expected to share some design cues with Hyundai's most-recent SUV model, Kona, with the image of the new Santa Fe released last month showing slimmer headlights which are similar to the ones featured on the smaller Kona. 

Hyundai, which has three SUV models - Kona, Tucson and Santa Fe - has said it would diversify its SUV line-up by launching a mini-SUV and a Genesis large SUV.

Eurozone top-tier macro data on tap
The EUR/USD could be one to watch in tomorrow’s session ahead of a provisional reading on Eurozone fourth quarter economic growth.
Eurozone fourth-quarter economic growth, measured by gross domestic product (GDP), is expected to show an improvement to annualized rate of 2.7% from 3.6% growth in the previous quarter.
The data comes amid a drop in the euro against the dollar despite comments from European Central Bank Governing Council member Klaas Knot, who suggested ECB quantitative easing should end as soon as possible.
EUR/USD traded flat at $1.2382.
U.S. crude oil stockpiles to show large decline?
Traders look ahead to a fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute due Tuesday.
The American Petroleum Institute reported crude oil stockpiles unexpectedly rose by 4.755 million barrels for the week ended Jan. 26.
Crude oil futures have a made poor start to the week amid ongoing concerns over rising US output.
Australian Consumer Price Index 
Australia releases its quarterly consumer prices index  update, expected to show consumer prices grew 0.7% in the fourth quarter, a touch lower than 0.6% consumer price growth seen in the previous quarter.
The AUD/USD has notched seven straight weekly gains but market participants expect the trend to reverse as the US Federal Reserve is set to raise rates while the Reverse Bank of Australia (RBA) is expected keep rates at record lows amid slowing growth and a weaker than expected labor market.
“While CPI slowly moves back within the RBA’s target band in 2018, depressed wage growth remains a key concern for the central bank, in particular in an environment of high household debt and declining savings rates,” Morgan Stanley said."

1035,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>",Dell VMware Tracking Stock Takes Worst Beating Since It Was Born,"(Bloomberg) -- Machinations around Dell’s effort to return to the public markets are creating unprecedented pain for one of the computer maker’s own constituencies: holders of tracking stock linked to its stake in VMware.
Shares of the tracker, which goes by ticker DVMT, fell almost 10 percent Monday, extending the plunge that began Friday to 15 percent. That’s the biggest retreat since Dell minted the security in August 2016 as part of its buyout of EMC Corp (NYSE:EMC)., as a way for EMC’s old holders to keep an interest in the firm’s 80 percent stake in VMware.
In theory, shares of Palo Alto-based VMware should trade in tandem with DVMT, but that hasn’t been happening lately. Speculation on Friday that Dell would gobble up the shares of VMWare it didn’t already own sent that stock up 9 percent, a rally that was erased today. The tracker fell then, and is falling now, amid reports that said Dell is considering combining with VMware Inc.
The tracking stock pared part of today’s decline after people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that Michael Dell would use a VMware transaction to get rid of the security. The company hasn’t decided if it would swap them for shares of the new company or acquire them with cash, the people said.
A strategy of arbitragers has been to short VMW shares and go long DVMT shares as the gap between them widened, betting on a convergence. VMW short interest is 32% of float, according to S3 Partners.
“People that had the trade on (long DVMT/short VMW) did not ever think there was any real possibility that Dell would buy VMW (and leaving DVMT outstanding) when Dell was doing the exact opposite (buying DVMT and then selling those VMW shares to VMW),” Mizuho event driven analyst Greg Lantz said in interview. Lantz said a scenario in which Dell leaves the tracking stock “outstanding by itself” remains unlikely.
The spread between the two securities went from just under $50 on Jan. 25 to high of $85 intraday Jan. 26, now sits at $56."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed lower at 26,439.48. The S&P 500 closed 0.67% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite closed at 7466.50, down 0.52%.
Risk markets fell as treasury yields jumped amid growing investor expectations that the Federal Reserve may adopt a more hawkish tone in its policy statement, when it concludes its two-day meeting Wednesday.
Goldman Sachs said it expects the Federal Reserve to adopt a slightly hawkish slant in its commentary related to economic conditions and inflation.
Mostly bullish economic data, however, did little to lift risk sentiment as it added to narrative of an improving economy able to cope with a faster pace of rate hikes.
The Commerce Department said on Monday consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.4% in December after an upwardly revised 0.8% rise in the previous month.
Personal income rose 0.4% in December after rising 0.3% in the previous month, while the savings rates hit a 10-year low, prompting some analysts to warn that a rebound in savings would weigh on consumer spending in the first quarter of 2018.
The rise personal income comes in the wake of recently enacted tax laws – which has triggered a host of companies to issue employee wage hikes and bonuses – boosting personal income, spurring a rise in spending.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street pulled back from record highs on Monday, with the Dow and the S&P 500 indexes marking their biggest one-day percentage declines in about five months, weighed down by a slide in Apple shares.
Shares of Apple (O:AAPL) fell 2.1 percent on news that the company will halve production of its $999 iPhone X smartphone. The company is due to report earnings on Thursday.
""The market's responding to the question of what Apple's earnings are going to look like, specifically what kind of guidance are they going to give on iPhone X sales,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.

AT&T (N:T) was down 1.5 percent, Verizon (N:VZ) slipped 1.1 percent and Sprint (N:S) pulled back by 1.9 percent.
 Dr Pepper Snapple  Group (N:DPS) jumped to an all-time high after K-cup maker Keurig Green Mountain said it will buy the company in a deal worth more than $21 billion. The stock ended up 22.4 percent at $117.07.

1038,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 04:51PM ET</span>",U.S. budget deficit to top $1-trillion in 2019: budget experts,"By Susan Cornwell
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As the U.S. Congress limps toward the likely passage next week of another stopgap spending bill to avert a government shutdown, a Washington think tank has estimated the federal budget deficit is on track to blow through $1 trillion in 2019.
If it does, it would be the first time since 2012 the U.S. economy will have to support a deficit so large, highlighting a basic shift for the Republican Party, which has traditionally prided itself on fiscal conservatism.
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington fiscal watchdog, said the red ink may rise in fiscal 2019 to $1.12 trillion. If current policies continue, it said, the deficit could top a record-setting $2 trillion by 2027.
The committee had previously projected the deficit - the difference between the government spending and its annual tax revenue - would reach $983 billion in fiscal 2019. That estimate came after Congress in December passed a tax overhaul that will add about $1.5 trillion to the national debt over a decade.
But that estimate was made obsolete by a shutdown-averting stopgap funding bill Congress approved earlier this month. It delayed the implementation of some healthcare taxes, further reducing the government's projected tax revenues.
Congress in coming days is expected to weigh another stopgap funding bill, needed by Feb. 8. Lawmakers also want to pass disaster relief funding, and they are pursuing an agreement to lift budget caps on spending.
Stan Collender, a longtime budget expert, predicted in October that trillion-dollar deficits would become ""the new normal"" under President Donald Trump. Trump and fellow Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress.
There were four consecutive $1-trillion deficits under former President Barack Obama. But they resulted from a historic financial crisis, a recession and stimulative spending.
""During the Trump years, the deficits are occurring mostly because of legislative changes, like the tax cut,"" Collender said.
In June 2017, before the tax overhaul was enacted, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, Congress' official scorekeeper, predicted the U.S. government would hit a trillion-dollar deficit in fiscal 2022.

An updated CBO report would typically be released around now, but the office said last week that the update would be delayed, partly because of the need to produce projections that reflect the recently enacted tax legislation.

1039,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 04:41PM ET</span>","U.S. pensions seen adding bonds, paring stocks: Wells Fargo","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. pensions are expected to shift more money into bonds and out of equities to rebalance their holdings at month-end in the wake of strong gains in the stock market in January,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) strategists said on Monday.
The possible increased allocation into bonds comes as global bond yields have been rising on strengthening business activities across the world and expectations of reduced stimulus from major central banks.
On Monday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield touched 2.727 percent, the highest since April 2014, Reuters data showed.
Higher yields would help provide pensions with a stable source of income to meet payouts to retirees. 
""Rising long-term yields can bring a considerable relief to private pensions,"" the Wells Fargo strategists wrote based their estimates on month-end allocation changes. 
Corporate pensions have struggled from historic low yields which have made their existing pension obligations expensive. Their average pension funding gap, future obligations versus current investments, has remained wide despite the run-up in stock prices. 
Retirement plans may need to add $16 billion in fixed income and to reduce up to $20 billion in equities for their month-end asset-allocation rebalancing, they wrote in a research note.
Corporate pensions could pocket some gains from Wall Street's blistering start to 2018 with the S&P 500 gaining 7 percent in January. They could put the money in less risky Treasuries.

""The $15-20 billion asset allocation shift is quite sizable in the context of recent experience,"" the Wells Fargo strategists wrote. ""The size of the January shift is a testament to the large gap in performance between equities and Treasuries at the start of 2018.""

That’s starting to change, and quickly.
A recent surge in the Hong Kong-traded shares of China’s Big Four state banks has lifted their average price-to-book value ratio to 0.99, the highest since an equity boom ended in 2015. China Construction Bank Corp. and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. are now back above the value of their net assets.
The turnaround reflects optimism that President Xi Jinping’s deleveraging drive will reduce financial risks at a time when rising interest rates are boosting profits. Monthly new yuan loans reached a record last year and the non-performing loan ratio has stabilized.
""The fact the policy makers seem to be much more convinced about deleveraging and committed toward deleveraging is making the sector more investable again,” said Michael Chang, an analyst at CIMB Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. “You want to be able to sleep at night. You want to be confident that the sector has a long-term sustainable path.”
There’s no shortage of confidence among investors right now. Banks account for five of the 10 top performers on the H-share benchmark this year, with Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. set for its biggest monthly gain since 2011. Adding to positive sentiment are swelling inflows of capital from mainland investors eager to chase laggards. Even after the rally, the Big Four trade at an average 17 percent discount to their Shanghai-traded shares.
Read more: a QuickTake Q&A on how China is curbing financial risks
The bull case for Chinese banks centers on recovery. Their net interest margin has been shrinking in recent years owing to gradual interest-rate liberalization, but that’s starting to change. Under the deleveraging campaign, interbank rates have risen, boosting larger banks that tend to be net lenders in that market. Loan-to-deposit ratios have climbed, and so have bond yields.
While deleveraging hasn’t contained overall credit expansion, it’s curtailed key areas of risk: loans to non-bank financial institutions and wealth-management products. Steadier economic growth has also helped reduce credit risks.
“There is a lack of confidence in the book value of the banks given global investor concern on the asset quality issue in China in the past and also the bigger concern on leverage of the market as a whole,” said Felix Lam, a fund manager at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA’s asset-management arm, which oversees the equivalent of about $708 billion and had positioned for a recovery in these banking shares. “The market is starting to believe that even though there may be issues, the issues are getting addressed.”
Bear Case
Not all bearish concerns have dissipated. Regulators recently penalized Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co. for hiding non-performing assets. The official non-performing loan ratio across the banking sector was 1.74 percent on Sept. 30, but 80 percent of bank respondents in a 2016 survey said these figures are artificially low.
And based on current trends, China’s debt is still on track to be more than three times the size of the economy by 2022, Bloomberg Economics estimates.
Deleveraging hasn’t floated all boats. Smaller banks have seen weaker rallies, and some such as Bank of Qingdao Co. and Bank of Tianjin Co. have even sold off in the new year, on concern their asset expansion will be curbed by tighter regulations as well as their longstanding disadvantage in attracting deposits.
Raising their price-to-book value ratio above one is especially significant for Chinese banks because they’re only allowed to raise capital at that valuation or higher. Still, major capital-raising plans are unlikely, according to CIMB’s Chang and BNP Paribas’s Lam.
Upcoming Earnings
Whether investors’ optimism is fully justified will be revealed when banks release their full-year earnings starting in late March.
“We are entering into a phase where because of increasing interest rates in the interbank market, there could be a higher likelihood that the net interest margin will go up,” said BNP Paribas’s Lam. “The trend of earnings growth would have a positive kicker if that happens and that would be one of the keys to turning around investor preference for Chinese banks.”

1044,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 04:23PM ET</span>",Exxon plans major U.S. investments due to tax reform: CEO,"HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) plans to invest billions of dollars in the United States due in part to recently approved corporate tax rate cuts, the company's chief executive said on Monday.
Darren Woods, head of the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, said in a blog post on the company's website that Exxon expects to spend $50 billion in U.S. projects over the next five years. The company also is ""actively evaluating"" projects now in planning stages as a result of new tax and regulatory changes, he wrote. (http://exxonmobil.co/2DZKArF)
More than $35 billion of that amount is for projects not previously announced, according to company spokesman Scott Silvestri. 
Exxon previously pledged tens of billions of dollars for U.S. refining, petrochemical and shale exploration efforts. Last spring, it laid out a $20 billion investment in its U.S. Gulf Coast chemical and oil refining operations through 2022. 
The company also is increasing investment in its West Texas and New Mexico shale operations, and moving ahead on a $10 billion petrochemical complex with Saudi Basic Industries Corp in Texas. 
U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law a tax reform package last month that cut top corporate income rates to 21 percent from 35 percent and allowed for immediate expensing for capital costs of projects.
""The recent changes to the U.S. corporate tax rate coupled with smarter regulation create an environment for future capital investments,"" Woods said, adding Exxon is reviewing ""the impact of the lower tax rate on the economics of several other projects currently in the planning stages."" 
Woods took over the top job in January 2017 after former chief Rex Tillerson resigned to become U.S. secretary of state.
Exxon is slated to report its quarterly results on Friday.

Shares of Exxon fell 1 percent to close Monday at $88.09 as oil prices (CLc1) also fell.

1045,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 04:01PM ET</span>","Deutsche Bank, UBS Settle Spoofing Claims in U.S. Crackdown","(Bloomberg) --  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn),  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and UBS Group AG agreed to pay about $50 million to settle civil claims of manipulating futures markets. Eight individuals were also charged for their alleged roles.
The banks settled claims from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that the firms’ traders engaged in spoofing techniques to manipulate prices of precious-metals futures. Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $30 million; UBS, $15 million; and HSBC, $1.6 million. The banks didn’t admit or denying wrongdoing.
The bank penalties made public Monday are part of a broad U.S. crackdown on spoofing, a tactic in which traders place orders without intending to execute them to try to move prices in their favor. In parallel actions, the Justice Department announced criminal charges against eight individuals, seven of whom worked at financial institutions and commodities-trading firms.
""The defendants in these cases engaged in sophisticated schemes or trading practices aimed at defrauding individuals and entities trading on U.S. futures exchanges,” said John Cronan, the acting head of the department’s criminal division, referring to the eight individuals. “Conduct like this poses significant risk of eroding confidence in U.S. markets and creates an uneven playing field for legitimate traders and investors.""
Spoofing Is a Silly Name for Serious Market Rigging: QuickTake
Among the cases announced was a CFTC lawsuit against Andre Flotron, a former precious-metals trader at UBS, who was accused of engaging in spoofing from August 2008 through November 2013. The suit against Flotron, 53, follows his arrest in September. He was charged with conspiracy and fraud over his suspected role in manipulating the price of precious metals and released on bail. The Justice Department included Flotron in its announcement of charges Monday.
“The cases against Mr. Flotron are misguided and have no merit,” his lawyer, Marc Mukasey, said in an emailed statement. He called the CFTC’s suit “an enormous waste of taxpayers’ money” because of the pending criminal case, adding that Flotron has retired and lives in Switzerland.
Spokesmen for UBS, Deutsche Bank and HSBC declined to comment. Reuters reported the arrests and penalties earlier.
The enforcement actions extend the Justice Department’s investigations into whether bank traders conspired to rig interest-rate benchmarks and manipulate currency exchanges during the past decade. The probes, which led to guilty pleas and billions of dollars in payouts by some of the world’s biggest banks, also led prosecutors to begin investigating whether metals traders placed orders without intending to execute them. In June, former Deutsche Bank trader David Liew pleaded guilty to conspiring to manipulate futures contracts in precious metals.
n addition to the case against Flotron, the CFTC sued Jiongsheng Zhao, 30, Krishna Mohan, 33, James Vorley, 37, and Cedric Chanu, 39, without saying where they worked. The agency also filed a complaint against Jitesh Thakkar, a 41-year-old computer programmer, accusing him of designing trading software for an unnamed trader who engaged in spoofing of E-mini S&P 500 futures from January 2013 to October 2013.
The Justice Department announced charges against those six individuals as well as Edward Bases, 55, and John Pacilio, 53.
Those charged couldn’t be immediately reached for comment.

(Reuters) - Keurig Green Mountain has struck a deal worth more than $21 billion to combine with soda maker  Dr Pepper Snapple  Group Inc (N:DPS) to form a North American drinks company with brands like Green Mountain Coffee, 7UP, Snapple and Sunkist.
The latest in a five-year string of acquisitions by Keurig's owner, Luxembourg-based JAB Holding Co, it creates an enlarged group with a wide range of hot and cold beverages, different ways to access customers and a bigger platform for further deals.
""We have a really wide portfolio of brands, we're able to address almost every consumer need in every format and ... to reach every point of sale,"" Keurig Chief Executive Bob Gamgort told Reuters. 
""If you want to win in the beverage industry you need a portion of your portfolio that gives you significant scale and then you need to be able to layer in higher growth segments,"" he said. 
Keurig will pay a special dividend of $103.75 per share to Dr Pepper Snapple shareholders, resulting in a cash payment of $18.7 billion. Those shareholders will also retain a 13 percent stake in the combined company to be called 'Keurig Dr Pepper'.
A 13 percent stake in Dr Pepper Snapple was worth more than $2.2 billion before the deal was announced. The company's shares jumped 25 percent on Monday to $119.70 in New York. 
Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj estimates the deal's value at $26 billion to $27 billion.
""From DPS' perspective at this time it makes a lot of sense,"" said Josh Blechman, director of capital markets at Exponential ETFs, which owns shares of Dr Pepper Snapple. ""They needed to diversify their business line from sugary drinks, so I think that this is a really good deal.""
The companies expect $600 million in cost-savings, and see opportunities to expand the business such as by selling coffee in bottles and in vending machines. Dr Pepper's direct-to-store delivery model will be complemented by Keurig's online presence and relationships with major supermarket chains.
MORE DEALS 
Bulking up is a way to boost efficiency in the business at a time when soft drink sales are falling as consumers cut down on sugar.
""If your truck is becoming less full because volumes are declining, you should have other beverages to fill that spot,"" said Bernstein's Dibadj, who has predicted beer and soft drink tie-ups for the same reason.
""The likelihood that Coke (N:KO) and Pepsi (O:PEP) will get bought has just gone up,"" Dibadj said. That would mean a mega-deal, given those soft-drink giants have market values of more than $200 billion and $170 billion respectively.
Keurig Green Mountain is the leading single-serve coffee company in the United States. It was taken over by JAB, the holding company of the German billionaire Reimann family, in 2016 for $13.9 billion. 
JAB has been on an acquisition spree in recent years, with a string of restaurant deals including Au Bon Pain, Krispy Kreme and Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA) as well as several coffee businesses from niche brand Intelligentsia to controlling the international coffee operations of Mondelez International (O:MDLZ). 
JAB and its partners will make an equity investment of $9 billion in the deal. Mondelez, now a major Keurig shareholder, will own about 13 percent to 14 percent of the combined company.
Jefferies analysts said further deals by Keurig Dr Pepper are very likely, as the company pays down a debt load expected to be about $16.6 billion when the deal closes, scheduled for the second quarter. 
The company expects to get its leverage to below three times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization within two to three years, while paying an annual dividend of 60 cents per share.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was the lead financial adviser to Keurig and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) advised Dr Pepper Snapple on the deal.

1052,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 02:57PM ET</span>",A lawsuit a day: U.S. securities class actions soar,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - The number of class action lawsuits in the United States accusing companies of fraud and other securities law violations soared in 2017, topping one a day even as the value of settlements plunged, a study released on Monday shows.
There were 432 shareholder lawsuits accusing companies of making false or misleading statements or concealing bad news about their businesses or mergers, up 44 percent from 300 in 2016, NERA Economic Consulting said in the study.
That number was the highest since a federal law to curb frivolous lawsuits, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, took effect in 1995, without taking into account ""laddering"" cases related to initial public offerings.
NERA, based in New York, said much of the jump came from lawsuits objecting to mergers, which more than doubled for a second straight year, to 197.
The number of settlements excluding merger cases also rose, to 148 from 113 a year earlier, but averaged less than $25 million each. Meanwhile, the number of dismissals rose to a record 205 from 146.
""We're seeing generally an increase in what I would call 'smaller cases,' which are 'poor quality' lawsuits often being dismissed or settled for pennies on the dollar,"" said Brian Lutz, who defends companies as co-chair of the securities litigation practice at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. ""Securities litigation for companies large and small has become common.""
The pickup in merger-related lawsuits came after Delaware state court judges soured on settlements requiring companies merely to reveal often immaterial details about their mergers.
Judges found these ""disclosure-only"" settlements a common way for lawyers to win easy paydays without doing much for shareholder clients. About half of the Fortune 500 companies are incorporated in Delaware.
NERA said the number of traditional securities class actions, often following revelations of weak financial results or regulatory probes, rose to 216 last year from 195 in 2016. Fifty-five targeted non-U.S. companies, up from 44.
The biggest settlement, $210 million, resolved claims that Salix Pharmaceuticals, now part of Canada's Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (NYSE:VRX), misrepresented inventory levels.
Last year was the first since 1998 that no settlement reached $250 million, NERA said.
A $7.2 billion settlement in 2006 over energy company Enron Corp's collapse remains the largest ever.
IPO laddering is where investors implicitly agree with underwriters to buy more shares in the market as a condition of investing in an IPO. This can lead to gains for both parties, and let insiders sell stock at prices inflated by laddering.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Children illegally brought to the United States with their parents have no constitutional right to a court-appointed lawyer to represent them in U.S. immigration proceedings, according to a federal appellate ruling issued on Monday.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in San Francisco, upheld a deportation order against a Honduran boy who fled gang violence with his mother and who appeared in immigration court without a lawyer. 
The ruling comes as President Donald Trump's administration is seeking changes to immigration court proceedings in order to speed up deportations.
Criminal defendants in U.S. courts are entitled to a court-appointed lawyer at the government's expense. However, immigrants fighting deportation generally do not have a similar constitutional right. 
Immigrant rights advocates have criticized the U.S. government for conducting deportation proceedings against very young children, without lawyers for the immigrant present.
A three-judge 9th Circuit panel ruled on Monday, however, that Congress had not extended the right of free counsel to minors such as the Honduran boy, who arrived in the United States aged 13 in 2014. 
Ahilan Arulanantham, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California who represents the boy, said they would seek a review of the decision. The court ruling would allow the government ""to pit trained prosecutors against children fleeing persecution,"" he said.
""If permitted to stand, it will result in the deportation of thousands of vulnerable children to some of the most violent places on earth,"" Arulanantham said.
In a separate concurrence, Judge John Owens called the court's ruling ""narrow"" because it did not say whether minors who arrive in the U.S. unaccompanied by their parents have the right to a court-appointed lawyer.
""That is a different question that could lead to a different answer,"" he wrote.
Representatives for the U.S. Department of Justice could not be reached for comment.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) has told employees it is taking its Frappuccino Happy Hour special off the menu in the United States this summer, as it shakes up its promotions in a bid to strengthen sales after a disappointing holiday season. 
The world's biggest coffee chain has been struggling with decelerating same-store sales in its dominant U.S. market and weakness in the afternoon and evening hours - and has put some of the blame on its Frappuccino promotions. 
""As part of our updated approach to products, events and offers, a different approach to summer offers will be planned that does not include Happy Hour,"" the coffee chain said in its recently released Spring Partner Planning Kit for U.S. employees. 
Company spokeswoman Haley Drage confirmed the language in the communication to employees but said Starbucks is not canning Frappuccino Happy Hour. She declined to elaborate. Starbucks for several years has offered some form of Frappuccino Happy Hour, which is popular with customers but not baristas.
Frappuccinos are sweet, icy, blended drinks that are more labor-intensive than many of the company's other beverages. Last year's U.S. promotion offered half-priced Frappuccinos from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., from May 5 to May 14.
That special resulted in ""a lower-than-expected lift in nondiscounted Frappuccino beverages following Happy Hour,"" Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw said on a conference call with analysts in July 2017.
Executives told analysts last week that Starbucks' cafe sales in Japan are being weighed down by softness in limited-time offers, particularly on Frappuccino drinks.
On Thursday, Starbucks warned that 2018 global same-store sales growth would be at the low end of its forecast, after holiday merchandise and limited-time seasonal drinks fell flat with U.S. customers during what is traditionally a blockbuster year-end quarter. [nL2N1PK21T]
Chief Executive Kevin Johnson said Starbucks' strategy for boosting sales includes focusing on drinks such as iced coffee, tea, cold brew and draft beverages such as Nitro Cold Brew, which are more popular in the afternoon. To that end, Starbucks is speeding up the roll-out of its hipster Nitro Cold Brew to 2,300 stores in the United States by the year from 1,300 stores currently. Nitro coffee, which looks like dark beer, is infused with nitrogen gas, stored in a keg and served from a tap.

Starbucks has nearly 14,200 cafes in the United States. Analysts worry it is also being pressured by stepped-up competition and some are concerned it is opening too many new cafes in the United States.

1065,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 02:01PM ET</span>",Risk Assets in Danger Zone as Bull Feeding Time Is a Frenzy,"(Bloomberg) -- Record bullish positions are building up across currency, equity and commodity markets as hedge funds and real-money investors dump the dollar and U.S. Treasuries to crowd into risk assets around the world.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) warns that “extreme” sentiment is propelling global shares to their best start to a year ever, while U.S. government bonds head for their worst on record. Investors are throwing caution to wind to wager more gains are nigh. Those piling into same-way bets are causing some to warn that markets are dangerously close to overextended.
""There are some notable net long and short positions that are moving into stretched territory,"" said Ben Emons, chief economist at Intellectus Partners LLC and a contributor to Bloomberg View. ""This positioning speaks very much to the global synchronization theme out there whereby the dollar plays a pivotal role."" 
Options traders are now the most bullish on the sterling in almost a decade, while speculative investors have amassed the heaviest long positions on the euro ever.
Strong corporate-earnings growth, the easiest U.S. financial conditions in 19 years and the fastest global expansion since the start of the decade are turbo-charging risk assets and overseas growth, a headwind for the greenback.
In a sign investors are betting the global industrial upswing will endure, hedge funds reported record wagers on continued price increases for U.S. and global oil benchmarks, the latest open-interest data show. The weak dollar, sliding U.S. stockpiles and OPEC’s bid to crimp supply have propelled oil prices to three-year highs.
It’s no surprise then that the S&P 500 has gained 7.5 percent this month, on track for its best start to the year on record. Investors are laughing in the face of indicators that show the benchmark gauge is in its longest overbought stretch in more than two decades.
Asset managers raised net S&P 500 index future longs to 363,000 contracts, the biggest bullish position in five years, the latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.
Appetite has picked up for contracts that pay off when the S&P 500 rises, sending option open interest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY), the largest of its kind, earlier this month to the highest since 2011. Though it’s since moderated, open interest remains 30 percent above the 10-year average.
And while the S&P 500 Index and Cboe Volatility Index are both heading for monthly advances, asset managers are doubling down on wagers that subdued market conditions are here to stay.
With bulls firmly in control of global markets, it’s no surprise investors are dumping safe assets like U.S. government bonds, with yields on the 10-year benchmark touching the highest since April 2014 at 2.7 percent.
Speculators were bearish across the U.S. Treasury curve apart from the five-year note, with noncommercial shorts close to an eight-year high, according to the latest CFTC report. Speculators extended short positions on ultra-long debt to fresh all-time highs, while in the eurodollars market, asset managers placed record short wagers.
With unabashed enthusiasm for all things global, risky and with cash flows linked to global growth, credit markets are on a tear. Spreads on U.S. corporate bonds continue to grind lower to the tightest in over a decade, with high-grade premiums not far off 2005 lows.
It’s not just the U.S.: investors have poured more than $2 billion into the iShares J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Bond ETF in January. After the fund already lured more than half the allocations it notched for the whole of last year, inflows are on track to record the biggest monthly sum since the fund’s inception in 2007 -- and short interest is nowhere to be seen.
“If everyone is on the same side of the trade, it could become extremely overextended and therefore it can be a possible reversal signal,” Craig Erlam, market analyst at Oanda Corp. in London, said. “The general conditions are bullish. But when there’s a turn for the worse, you don’t want to be the person to say it’s going to continue on for another year and then it falls off a cliff.”

1066,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 01:32PM ET</span>",Apple shares skid on report of iPhone X production cut,"By Muvija M and Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) will halve its iPhone X production target for the first three months of the year to around 20 million units, Nikkei reported on Monday, sending its shares down 1.6 percent.
The report added to growing concerns about weak sales of the $999 phone, making investors jittery about the company's financial outlook when it reports first-quarter results on Thursday. 
Apple's shares fell to their lowest level in 2018, knocking off $14 billion from the company's market value. The company declined to comment. 
Analyst Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein cut both his second-quarter and full-year forecasts for iPhones but said he did not expect Apple's 2018 profit to fall steeply because of changes to U.S. tax law that will bring the company's rate down to 18 percent.
""Apple earnings should handily beat December quarter expectations, but March guidance could moderately disappoint,"" UBS analysts said.
The production cut was prompted by slower-than-expected sales in the holiday shopping season in Europe, the United States and China, the Japanese newspaper reported, without citing a source. (http://s.nikkei.com/2BASQZU)
The iPhone X was the first phone to sport a new design since the launch of the iPhone 6 in 2015 and many expected it to lead to blockbuster sales, dubbed by Wall Street analysts as a ""supercycle.""
""This was supposed to be the supercycle year and if Apple hasn't been able to drive substantial unit growth this year, then that makes you a little cautious on future iPhone cycles,"" Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said.
Several analysts have lowered their estimates for iPhone X shipments in the past few weeks, citing the high price of the device and other factors, with at least three downgrading their rating on the stock.
Sacconaghi of Bernstein had originally predicted that Apple would outpace Wall Street expectations of 62 million iPhones by selling 66 million units, but on Monday he cut that figure to 53 million units, a nearly 20-percent cut. He also cut his full year iPhone unit forecast 11 percent to 220 million units.
But he only slightly revised his full-year earnings per share estimate for 2018 to $11.80 from $11.87, citing the positive effects of U.S. tax law changes.
Adding to the concerns,  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) said last week its postpaid device activations were lower than last year as people were keeping phones longer.
A survey of people planning to buy the iPhone showed that the percentage of them looking to buy the iPhone X has dropped to 37 percent from 43 percent in an earlier survey, UBS analysts wrote in a note on Monday.
The iPhone X, which features an edge-to-edge display and facial recognition technology to unlock the phone, went on sale in November in the United States.
Asian supply chain checks suggest that iPhone X orders have been weakening recently, with first-quarter production likely to be about 20 million units, JP Morgan analysts wrote in a note dated Jan. 24.
A few of Apple's iPhone parts suppliers are based in Asia. Shares of Foxconn, one of Apple's main suppliers and formally known as  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW:2317), fell 0.7 percent on Monday.

Shares of U.S.-listed Apple suppliers such as Micron Technology Inc (O:MU) edged lower following Nikkei's report.

(Reuters) - Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA) Co, a pioneer in serving ""clean"" restaurant food, has started a consulting service to help other chains remove artificial preservatives, sweeteners, flavors and colors from menus.
The bakery/cafe chain's ""clean consultant"" services include helping clients find ways to source healthier and more natural ingredients and to improve and differentiate menus, Panera said on Monday.
""We want to help industry peers devise strategies that prioritize clean across their whole menu, rather than focusing on a single ingredient or product,"" said Sara Burnett, Panera's director of wellness and food policy. 
She said Panera, which competes with  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG) and other limited-service chains, has removed more than 150 ingredients from its food. On Monday it also announced its latest retooled product: ""clean"" chicken wing sauce. 
Panera founder and Chairman Ron Shaich said industry peers had approached the company for help in cleaning up their menus. ""We thought it was time to formalize that advice,"" he said. 
Shaich said the service would help end ""clean washing,"" where companies reformulate a product like chicken nuggets to be more natural and then serve it with dipping sauces made from unnatural or unhealthy ingredients. 
Panera did not say how many consultants it would hire or how many clients had signed up for the service. 
Privately held JAB Holding bought Panera in July in an all-cash deal valued at around $7.5 billion, including debt. JAB also owns Caribou Coffee, Peet's Coffee & Tea and Keurig Green Mountain, which on Monday said it planned to buy soda maker  Dr Pepper Snapple  Group Inc (N:DPS) in a deal worth more than $21 billion. 

Panera has led other public health efforts ranging from disclosing calorie counts on menus to curbing purchases of meats raised with medically important antibiotics.

1080,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 12:15PM ET</span>",Sanofi beats Novo to buy Ablynx for $4.8 billion in biotech M&A boom,"By Matthias Blamont and Ben Hirschler
PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) has agreed to buy Belgian biotech company Ablynx for 3.9 billion euros ($4.8 billion), beating  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) and marking its second big deal this month after buying Bioverativ.
The transaction is a further sign of accelerating merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in the global biotech sector and comes after Ablynx rejected a 2.6 billion euro offer from Denmark's Novo Nordisk.
Sanofi said on Monday it would pay 45 euros per share in cash for Ablynx, a premium of 21 percent over its closing price on Friday, and more than double the price before Novo went public with its initial bid.
Novo Nordisk conceded defeat, saying it could not justify the knock-out price being paid by Sanofi for Ablynx, which is developing a prized experimental drug for a rare blood disorder.
This month has seen a spike in multibillion-dollar deals in biotech, with U.S.-based Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) paying $9 billion for cancer specialist Juno Therapeutics, and several experts predicting a bumper year for M&A.
Total biotech M&A so far this month now stands at $26.3 billion, or more than 80 percent of the value of all deals in 2016 and far ahead of any comparable January tally in over a decade, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Such deals are being driven by the need for large drugmakers to tap the promising new medicines being developed by smaller rivals to help revive flagging growth.
Last week, Sanofi agreed to buy U.S. haemophilia specialist Bioverativ for $11.6 billion, its biggest deal for seven years and a major play to strengthen its presence in treatments for rare diseases.
Sanofi Chief Executive Officer Olivier Brandicourt said the deals expanded the French company's late-stage pipeline and strengthened its line-up of treatments for rare blood disorders - but did not necessarily mark the end of its M&A ambitions.
""We have a strong balance sheet. We generate significant cash flow. We are going to look at opportunities on a case-by-case basis,"" he told reporters.
""We also identified CHC (consumer healthcare) previously as an area where we want to sustain a leadership position and therefore you can expect us to evaluate opportunities.""
Both  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Merck (NYSE:MRK) KGaA are currently looking to divest consumer health businesses.
Sanofi, which expects the cost of debt to finance the deal to be around 1 percent, said Ablynx would boost long-term shareholder value, while being neutral for business earnings per share in 2018 and 2019. 
The Belgian group specializes in the research of novel drugs based on so-called nanobodies found in the immune systems of llamas and alpacas, for which it partners with several of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies.
EXPERIMENTAL DRUG 
Sanofi is already one of Ablynx's big pharma partners, after striking a deal in July 2017 to find new treatments for inflammatory diseases.
By buying the company outright it will now get access to Ablynx's most promising asset, the experimental drug caplacizumab for treating the blood disease acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
Brandicourt said caplacizumab would complement Sanofi's line-up of blood products, following the acquisition of Bioverativ and an earlier deal to obtain global rights for fitusiran from Alnylam.
Sanofi will be able to use its existing infrastructure and the recently acquired platform from Bioverativ to help to commercialize caplacizumab. It will also benefit from some of the other drugs Ablynx is working on, such as an infant anti-viral treatment, that would not have fitted within Novo Nordisk.
Berenberg analysts said Ablynx was a good fit but they estimated the deal would generate no more than a 4 percent return on invested capital, assuming caplacizumab sales of around 400 million euros by 2023.
Ablynx itself has forecast peak caplacizumab sales of 1.2 billion euros, but Sanofi said it was too early to comment.
The rare blood drug was also the main attraction for Novo Nordisk.
The Danish group has sat out previous rounds of M&A in the drugs sector to focus on its core diabetes business but it now needs to find new products for its struggling smaller biopharmaceutical unit, where Ablynx would have been a good fit.
That remains a challenge for CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, who took over a year ago, and has previously stated that Novo Nordisk needs external innovation to broaden its product line-up.
Chief Financial Officer Jesper Brandgaard told Reuters Novo Nordisk would continue to hunt for promising assets to boost its blood products business.
Shares in Sanofi were little changed, with pricing considerations offset by relief that Sanofi was finally taking action to improve its drugs portfolio, following its past failure to land big deals.
Sanofi lost out on buying California-based cancer specialist Medivation to Pfizer in 2016, and also missed acquiring Swiss biotech company Actelion, which was bought by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) last year.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Lazard advised Sanofi on the deal while JP Morgan advised Ablynx.

1088,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>","Guilt, fines remain hazy as Saudi corruption purge draws to close","By Stephen Kalin and Reem Shamseddine
RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian media magnate Waleed al-Ibrahim was found innocent in an anti-corruption purge, a source at his company said on Monday, part of a wider campaign against graft whose secrecy could hurt the country's effort to win foreign investment. 
Ibrahim, who controls influential regional broadcaster MBC, was one of at least half a dozen top businessmen freed from more than two months of detention at the weekend after being interrogated by officials who said they aimed to recover $100 billion of illicit funds.
The officials said all of the men, who included billionaire global investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, had agreed to financial settlements after admitting to unspecified ""violations"".
But the allegations against the men and their settlements have been kept secret, leaving the global investment community to wonder what the penalties are for large-scale corruption in Saudi Arabia - and whether detainees were actually guilty.
The mystery is unsettling investors who have closely watched Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's every move since he promised to reform oil superpower Saudi Arabia, surprising citizens who regarded top businessmen and powerful royals as untouchable.
Aside from the crackdown on corruption, those changes are meant to include less dependence on oil, megaprojects to create jobs, and greater transparency and social freedoms.
The decision to release some of the most powerful people in the kingdom comes ahead of a planned trip by Prince Mohammed to the United States and European capitals in February and March, according to diplomats.
He could face awkward questions there about how the purge was conducted. The releases, and what kind of deals may have been struck, could have huge implications for Saudi Arabia's image in the international investment community.
MBC's Ibrahim ""was fully exonerated and declared innocent of any wrongdoing, no corruption charges, no charges actually whatsoever,"" a senior executive at MBC group told Reuters.
In an email to its staff, MBC management said Ibrahim was ""fit and well and eager to get back. He has also been totally exonerated and faces no issues going forward.""
MURKINESS
Saudi officials did not respond to requests for information on the cases of Ibrahim and dozens of other officials and businessmen caught by the purge.
Prince Alwaleed, owner of global investor  Kingdom  Holding (SE:4280), continued to maintain his innocence in an interview with Reuters hours before his release, although an official said he had agreed to an unspecified financial settlement.
On Monday, shares in Kingdom rose back to the level where they were trading when Prince Alwaleed was arrested - a vote of confidence by the market in his future. In the days after his detention, the shares had plunged more than 20 percent, erasing as much as $2.2 billion of his fortune.
Authorities have not disclosed how many people are still detained but Riyadh's grand Ritz-Carlton hotel, where many detainees were held, is to reopen to the public by mid-February.
Last week, before the latest releases, the attorney general said most detainees had agreed to settlements, 90 were released after charges were dropped, and 95 remained in custody. Some cases will go to trial.
Jason Tuvey, Middle East economist at Capital Economics in London, said the purge had increased uncertainty among potential foreign investors in Saudi Arabia, because it was not clear how they would be treated if they were caught up in corruption allegations.
“The release of Prince Alwaleed bin Talal and a number of other high-profile individuals may ease some concerns, but we still don’t have any details on what sort of agreement they have reached with the authorities. It just adds to the murkiness surrounding the whole process.”
He added that one potential worry for investors was that the purge could one day lead to a backlash against Prince Mohammed, who launched the purge and is leading ambitious reforms.
""Investors will probably need some reassurance on the exact procedures going forward to deal with corruption allegations,"" Tuvey said. ""But I think political uncertainty will remain a key risk surrounding the Saudi economy for many years to come.”
Prince Mohammed initially said he wanted to conclude the purge quickly. Foreign bankers dealing with Saudi Arabia said he may have been encouraged to do so by concern that the purge could start to affect foreign investment in the country.
Constructing complex, watertight legal cases against detainees may have been more challenging than expected - suggesting the government might find it hard to reach its target of recovering $100 billion of illicit funds, analysts said.
Saudi officials said Ibrahim's 40 percent stake in MBC would remain unchanged and Prince Alwaleed would stay in control of Kingdom. 

But construction giant Saudi Binladin Group said earlier this month that family shareholders might transfer part of their holdings to the state in a settlement with authorities.

1089,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 11:31AM ET</span>",McDonald's Traffic Rises This Year After New Dollar Menu Debut,"(Bloomberg) -- McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE:MCD) is seeing a jump in customers, a sign its new Dollar Menu is attracting penny pinchers.
McDonald’s share of U.S. traffic among fast-food and fast-casual restaurants rose to almost 18 percent in the week ended Jan. 21, an increase of about 0.4 percentage point from a year earlier, a report by researchers Datassential and Sense360 showed. The burger chain also improved in the prior two weeks.
The positive results show that McDonald’s $1, $2 and $3 menu is resonating with diners. The company recently began advertising items on the revamped Dollar Menu, which includes chicken tenders, cheeseburgers and a new classic chicken sandwich. Recovering lost customers is key to McDonald’s turnaround, which Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook has been leading with discounts, faster service, fresh beef and by franchising stores globally.
“It’s the power of a value offering,” said Dave Jenkins, managing director of customer solutions at Datassential in Chicago, referring to McDonald’s share gains over the past three weeks.
The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday and analysts are expecting another quarter of positive same-store sales. That metric rose 6 percent globally in the third quarter.
A popular Dollar Menu may not be good news for McDonald’s restaurant owners, however. Customers may be buying the cheaper fare instead of more expensive premium burgers like the Quarter Pounder. There is some owner concern about profit and cash flow because of the new menu, according to a recent survey of 26 of the chain’s domestic franchisees from Mark Kalinowski, an analyst at Nomura’s Instinet.
Sense360 tracks data from 2 million customers in cities across the U.S. and partners with Datassential to create a restaurant traffic report for more than 250 chains.
McDonald’s shares fell less than a percent to $177.43 in New York Monday. The stock had gained 3.6 percent this year through Friday.

1091,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 11:11AM ET</span>","Hung out to dry twice, Tennessee city stumped by Trump's washer tariffs","By David Lawder
CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. (Reuters) - When President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs on imported washing machines last week it was a ""Not Again"" moment for officials in this north Tennessee city that has lost jobs to an international trade dispute before.
The move threatens to stunt the launch of a new LG Electronics (KS:066570) washing machine factory under construction in Clarksville, just four years after the U.S.-China trade fight over solar panels scuttled a nearby $1.2 billion Hemlock Semiconductor polysilicon plant.
""It's like déjà vu for Clarksville, to say 'how can this be happening twice to us,'"" the city's mayor, Kim McMillan, told Reuters.
She said that the city government was scrambling to help the South Korean manufacturer accelerate its production launch by ensuring that utilities and infrastructure are quickly put in place at the factory site and expediting approvals.
""We've got to do whatever we can to make sure that LG is able to still open their facility and hire people,"" McMillan added. ""We don't want to see a repeat of what happened with Hemlock where they can't open the plant.""
At stake is an appliance manufacturing complex that could eventually employ thousands of workers and which the state of Tennessee and the local community supported with some $23 million in grants. The 310-acre (1.25 square kilometer) site an hour north of Nashville has room for three additional buildings identical to the plant's $250 million, 600-job first phase.
Trump's decision to impose 20 percent to 50 percent tariffs on washer imports and parts has local officials asking what his ""America First"" stands for: supporting all U.S. manufacturing jobs or just favoring traditional American brands over foreign rivals. Labor statistics show that foreign companies have been the source of the majority of new manufacturing jobs since the 2009 recession.
LG told U.S. retailers on Wednesday it would raise prices in response to the tariffs. That could dent its market share, reducing initial output and employment, said company spokesman John Taylor.
""If you lose floor space at retail, it can take years to get it back,"" Taylor said. 
Construction crews were working 24 hours a day on the site last week, still only a partial steel skeleton, after LG said earlier this month it would bring forward its production launch a second time again to the fourth quarter of 2018.
LG's rival Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), whose imported washers also will be hit by the tariffs, has more breathing room. It has already started production at a $380-million washer plant in Newberry, South Carolina, in a former  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) generator set factory.
The washer tariffs are the culmination of a decade-long campaign by Whirlpool Inc (N:WHR) against what it saw as unfair pricing and ""country hopping"" by LG and Samsung to avoid anti-dumping duties.
HEMLOCK FLASHBACKS
The tariffs on washers and solar panels triggered memories of a 2014 U.S.-China trade spat over solar panels, which made Hemlock abandon its just-completed Clarksville plant at a loss of 500 initial jobs and dashing hopes for more to come.
Hemlock's main market for polysilicon, a core ingredient in solar cells, dried up after Beijing responded to U.S. anti-dumping duties on Chinese solar panels with duties on U.S. polysilicon.
While beyond its control, the Hemlock pullout has affected the region's efforts to attract other firms, said Jim Durrett, mayor of Montgomery County, which has its seat in Clarksville. 
The closure ""kind of gave our community a black eye from a recruitment standpoint,"" Durrett said.
With the help of competitive state and local grants and tax incentives, low living costs and a steady supply of well-trained workers retiring from a nearby U.S. Army base, this city of about 150,000 managed to regain some traction.
A year after Hemlock left and razed its plant to protect its technology, Google (O:GOOGL) acquired it for a data center, though the tech giant has only committed to 70 jobs and has yet to detail its plans.
 Hankook Tire  (KS:161390), whose decision to build its first U.S. factory in Clarksville pre-dated the Hemlock closure, opened the 1,000-worker plant last year.
Landing the LG washer plant was seen as marking a full jobs recovery from the Hemlock debacle, said Michael Evans, the county's economic development director.
FOREIGN COMPANIES, LOCAL JOBS
With local industrial parks filled with foreign names that have arrived with the rise of the mid-South's manufacturing base, local officials and residents interviewed by Reuters saw no distinction between foreign-owned and American-owned firms. 
""Once they're here and once they've embarked on the investment, those are local jobs. LG's a continuation of that,"" said Jeff Robinson, owner of the Blackhorse Pub and Brewery in Clarksville.
And in a region where support for Trump runs deep, they are wondering why he would use tariffs to favor Whirlpool and GE Appliances, now owned by China's Haier Electronics Group (HK:1165), over a competitor moving production to Tennessee.

""I think it goes against what (Trump) has talked about doing and that’s bringing jobs back to America,"" said Durrett, the county mayor and a Republican.

1100,By Business Insider,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 09:45AM ET</span>",Stocks are facing a barrage of sell signals as the market's 'non-stop euphoric cabaret' rages on," Every week the stock market hits new highs. And every week the number of sell signals grows as conditions get more stretched.
It's an inevitable result for a scorching-hot equity market that's enjoying overpoweringly strong sentiment. And it's something that appears to be largely ignored by investors hungry for even more returns.
For starters, a gauge maintained by Bank of America Merrill Lynch — known as the Bull & Bear indicator — is on the brink of reaching sell territory. It hit 7.9 last week, dangerously close to the 8 threshold that's portended a selloff on 11 out of 11 occasions since 2002, according to BAML data.
To further drive home the market's maniacal quest for more returns, equity funds received a record $33.2 billion this week, including an all-time high of $12.2 billion to active funds, BAML data show. The fact that these massive flows occurred with major indexes at record levels reinforces just how confident — and perhaps overconfident — trader behavior has become.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett, who has been repeatedly warning about overexuberence for months, colorfully describes this confluence of factors as a ""non-stop euphoric cabaret.""
He's so concerned, in fact, that he's calling for a tactical S&P 500 pullback to 2,686 — a roughly 6% decline from current levels — at some point in February or March.
But the sell signals that have Hartnett so worried don't end there. Not even close.
Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the other indicators suggesting that stocks are overheating:
The S&P 500's relative strength index has been above the 70 level that indicates an overbought condition for 16 straight days, the longest such streak in 21 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) also made a similar observation last week.
It took the benchmark equity index just 13 trading days to travel from 2,700 to 2,800, by far the shortest gap between 100-point milestones since the financial crisis, according to data compiled by CLSA. ""Market participants are flying closer and closer to the sun, trusting that their wings aren't made of wax,"" the CLSA investment strategist Damian Kestel wrote in a client note.
The  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) US Economic Surprise Index — which measures the degree to which economic data exceeds forecasts — has started to fall after hitting a five-year high in December, according to Bloomberg data.
While it's common sense that equity exposure would be at high levels amid such a historic bull market run, the real takeaway here is the rapidly accelerating pace.
Had enough? We'll leave it at that for now, but just know that there are statistics like this littered around the stock market like minefields, spring-loaded to unleash fury.
But when? That's the key question. At this point, no one knows for sure, and forecasts are scattered all over the place. Equity strategists across Wall Street are, on the whole, still bullish, but hedge fund managers and other investment specialists have been sounding the alarm on a market event for a while now.
In the meantime, faced with the mountain of bearish data above, you're probably best off buying some downside protection, just in case. Unless you like living on the edge. In which case, good luck."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) supervisory board called for an immediate inquiry into who commissioned tests in which monkeys were exposed to toxic diesel fumes, while the German government said such studies were unjustifiable.
""I will do everything possible to ensure that this matter is investigated in detail,"" Volkswagen supervisory board Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch said in a statement on Monday.
""Whoever is responsible for this must of course be held accountable,"" Poetsch said in response to a New York Times report on Friday that German carmakers had used an organization called European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector (EUGT) to commission the tests.
The study, conducted in 2014, was designed to defend diesel following revelations that the fuel's exhaust fumes were carcinogenic, the newspaper reported.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the details and purpose of the study and EUGT, which was dissolved last year, could not be reached for comment.
EUGT received all of its funding from VW and fellow German carmakers Daimler and BMW, the New York Times said.
UNJUSTIFIABLE TESTS
Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW on Saturday denounced the study, whose revelation is the latest aftershock from the VW emissions-rigging scandal, which continues to rock the auto industry.
On Monday Volkswagen said that some staff members, whom it did not identify, including some in its legal department, at the VW brand's technical development division and at Volkswagen of America, had been aware of the tests at the time.
But Volkswagen said the study was never discussed in any management board meetings, after German daily Bild earlier reported that an internal e-mail showed that at least some senior managers were informed about the design of the research.
In another related development, German daily Stuttgarter Zeitung reported on Sunday that EUGT also sponsored scientific studies testing nitrogen dioxide, a gas found in exhaust fumes, on people.
Aachen University's research hospital confirmed on Monday that EUGT had sponsored a study in 2013 and 2014 but said it was related to workplace safety, not diesel emissions.
As part of the study, 25 people were exposed to varying levels of nitrogen dioxide for three hours to investigate the possible health effects of the chemical compound in concentrations below the limit for workplaces, Uniklinik RWTH Aachen said in a statement.
The German government said on Monday that any auto emissions testing on monkeys or people were unjustifiable.
""These tests on monkeys or even people are in no ethical way justifiable and raise many critical questions about those who are behind the tests,"" government spokesman Steffen Seibert told a regular government news conference in Berlin.
Stephan Weil, who represents the German state of Lower Saxony, a VW shareholder, on the carmaker's supervisory board, said the board was pressing the carmaker to urgently provide information about what the aim of the studies was. 

""After the matter has been cleared up there will also be the question of who was personally responsible,"" he told journalists at a news conference on Monday.

Avon's shares were up nearly 6 percent at $2.57 in premarket trading on Monday.
The shareholder group, which also includes Barington Capital Group and NuOrion Partners, said it was ""extremely disappointed"" with falling price performance and leadership of the company. 
Avon's inability to improve long-term performance and hire a new chief executive gives the shareholders no reason to wait for a turnaround from a board that has overseen a tremendous destruction of shareholder value.

Avon's CEO Sheri McCoy said last August she would step down in March 2018.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. authorities were set to arrest several people on Monday in connection with a federal investigation into so-called spoofing and manipulation in the U.S. futures market by three European banks, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The individuals, some of whom had formerly been employed as traders by UBS,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and HSBC, will be charged as part of a multi-agency probe by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into the manipulative trading behavior, two of the sources said.
Reuters reported on Friday that the CFTC was set to announce it had fined UBS, Deutsche Bank and HSBC millions of dollars each to settle the regulator's civil case against the banks for their role in the ""spoofing"" and manipulation, which was conducted across a range of futures products.
Spokesmen for all three banks declined to comment on Friday.
Spoofing, which is a criminal offense under the 2010 Dodd- Frank financial reform law, involves placing bids to buy or offers to sell futures contracts with the intent to cancel them before execution. By creating an illusion of demand, spoofers can influence prices to benefit their market positions.
In August, a U.S. appeals court upheld the conviction of former New Jersey-based high-speed trader Michael Coscia who was the first individual to be criminally prosecuted for spoofing.
This is the first time the CFTC, DOJ and FBI have worked together to bring both criminal and civil charges against multiple companies and individuals, sources said.
The bank investigations have been going on for more than a year, but the CFTC has pursued the charges against the traders as part of a more recent effort led by the agency's head of enforcement, James McDonald, to hold individual employees accountable for corporate wrongdoing, two of the sources said.
McDonald, a former prosecutor in the Southern District of New York who was appointed to the CFTC role in March, has said he aims to achieve that by encouraging companies and staff to report their own wrongdoing and cooperate with investigators in return for more lenient penalties.

A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the FBI did not respond to a request for comment.

Deutsche, Germany's biggest bank, intends to raise annual bonus payments despite posting its third consecutive annual loss in 2017, German weekly newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported at the weekend.
While Deutsche, which declined to comment on Monday, is a private sector bank, ""the company management must of course ask what impression it leaves in public,"" government spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters in response to the report.
Last October a source told Reuters that Deutsche, which is struggling to keep pace with Wall Street firms, would pay higher bonuses in 2017 but that the exact level would depend on how its investment bank fared and what competitors paid.
A return to bigger bonuses would be a relief for Deutsche's bankers as its total bonus payments dropped from 2.4 billion euros in 2015 to around 500 million euros in 2016 after a multi-billion dollar legal fine for the sale of toxic debt.
But Deutsche Bank has to tread carefully on payout levels because credit rating agencies are keeping close tabs on them and shareholders are frustrated by its slow turnaround.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's freedom has sent shares of his flagship company soaring, but banks will remain cautious about dealing with his company until they have more clarity about the circumstances of his release from a corruption probe.
Shares in Saudi Arabian investment firm  Kingdom  Holding (SE:4280) rose sharply in early trade on Monday to above their level when owner Alwaleed was detained in the country's corruption probe in early November.
The stock climbed 5.6 percent to 10.60 riyals, after jumping 10 percent on Sunday. They were at 10.28 riyals before Prince Alwaleed was detained.
The prince was released from detention at the weekend and Saudi officials said he would keep ownership of the company.
Prince Alwaleed - whose net worth has been estimated by Forbes magazine at $17 billion - is the face of Saudi business for foreign investors. Before his detention, he appeared frequently on international news channels and was featured in newspaper articles about his investments and lifestyle.
Bankers said it was inevitable that banks would be extremely cautious about dealing with Kingdom. They need to clearly understand about the future of the company's ownership after Alwaleed’s release.
""Some banks will try to limit the relationship, to avoid reputational damage,"" said a banker in Saudi Arabia, who asked not to be named.
But he said banks need to know whether any official settlement took place or not before taking any decision.
Officials at Kingdom were not available to comment.
A corruption settlement or tax amnesty by clients could trigger anti-money laundering checks at banks, which can potentially affect client relationships. 
Alwaleed's detention had begun to affect his company's relationship with some banks, which became cautious in lending to the group because of worries about potential repercussions.
Kingdom had approached banks to borrow money to fund new investments, but the financing plan was held up, Reuters had reported in November citing sources.
Kingdom has two outstanding term loans totaling $975 million and maturing over the next two years, according to Thomson Reuters data. At the end of the third quarter last year, the company had a debt to equity ratio of only 0.45. 
A senior Saudi official said on Saturday billionaire Alwaleed was released after a settlement he had concluded with authorities was approved by the attorney general. 
""The release of Prince Alwaleed bin Talal and a number of other high-profile individuals may ease some concerns, but we still don’t have any details on what sort of agreement they have reached with the authorities,"" Jason Tuvey, Middle East economist at Capital Economics in London.
""It just adds to the murkiness surrounding the whole process.""

In a development unrelated to Alwaleed's detention, Kingdom's chief financial officer Mohamed Fahmy is leaving the firm, Reuters reported earlier this month, citing sources familiar with the matter. He was believed to be a close aide of the Saudi billionaire.

1143,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 06:49AM ET</span>","Stocks - U.S. Futures Pull Back From Record Highs in Key Week for Earnings, Data","Investing.com - U.S. futures pointed to a lower open on Wall Street, suggesting major stock benchmarks were set to pull back from record eyes as investors braced for a big week in data and earnings.
The blue-chip Dow futures fell 32 points, or 0.12%, by 6:42AM ET (11:42GMT), the S&P 500 futures lost 7 points, or 0.23%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 19 points, or 0.27%
At 8:30AM ET (13:30GMT), investors will digest economic data on personal income & spending for December, as well as other key inflation data.
In the last case, the personal consumption expenditures inflation data is expected to show annual inflation sticking to a reading of 1.5%. The data will form part of the key last ingredients for the Federal Reserve to decide on its next policy move at its two-day meeting this week.
The U.S. central bank is forecast to hold steady on interest rates when it announces its decision on Wednesday, keeping it in a range between 1.25%-1.50%. This week's meeting will be the last under the leadership of Janet Yellen, before she is replaced by current Fed governor Jerome Powell.
Powell is widely anticipated to represent a continuation of policy with the majority of economists forecasting that the Fed will hike rates in March, followed by another increase in June, with a third move higher arriving in December.
Also a key protagonist on this week’s economic calendar, the U.S. Labor Department will release its January nonfarm payrolls report at 8:30AM ET (1330GMT) on Friday.
The consensus forecast is that the data will show jobs growth of 184,000, after rising by 148,000 in December. The unemployment rate is forecast to hold steady at 4.1%. Most of the focus will likely be on average hourly earnings figures, which are expected to rise 0.3% after gaining 0.3% a month earlier.
Ahead of the releases, the U.S. dollar edged higher against a basket of currencies on Monday, recovering somewhat from six straight weeks of losses. At 6:43AM ET (11:43GMT), the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.25% to 89.09, extending its rebound from a three-year nadir of 88.25 set on Thursday, when Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin talked up the benefits of a weaker currency.
Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year note hit its highest level in almost four years on Monday. Specifically, the 10-year yield rose to an intraday high of 2.724%, a level not seen since April 2014 and was last at 2.718%, up 5.6 basis points, or roughly 2.1% by 6:44AM ET (11:44GMT).
The benchmark yield has not been above 3% since late 2013 and some investors believe that level will be tested in the months ahead amid expectations that an economy boosted by tax reform will compel further policy tightening from the Federal Reserve this year.
On the earnings front, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) will be the major focus on Monday in what will be another big week for the fourth quarter reporting season. Heavy-weights such as McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), AMD, Boeing (NYSE:BA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) will all release earnings this week.
The fourth quarter earnings period has been strong thus far. With 133 of the S&P 500 firms having already reported 81% beat consensus on profit thanks to 18% growth in earnings, while 85% topped sales estimates on 8.5% growth, according to calculations from The Earnings Scout who proclaim these to be the best numbers in five years.
Meanwhile, crude oil prices headed lower on Monday, but remained near their strongest levels since 2014. Prices have been supported by optimism that OPEC-led output cuts would continue to drain the market of excess supplies.
However, concerns remain that high prices will only push U.S. shale producers to jump into production. In fact, the number of oil drilling rigs climbed by 12 to 759 last week, Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report late Friday. That marked the biggest weekly increase in the rig count since March.
U.S. crude futures 0.54% to $65.78 by 6:46AM ET (11:46GMT), while Brent oil traded down 0.83% to $69.57.
Elsewhere, European stocks struggled in midday trade, showing mixed signs across the major benchmarks as investors digested earnings and kept an eye on merger news.
Tech stocks were on the rise, getting a boost from the fact that Swiss chipmaker Ams (SIX:AMS), a key supplier for U.S. giant Apple, reported a doubling of its 2017 revenues and raised its earnings guidance far in excess of expectations.
Also grabbing headlines on the Old Continent, French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) has agreed to buy Belgian biotech company Ablynx (BR:ABLX) for €3.9 billion ($4.8 billion), beating  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) and marking its second big deal this month after buying Bioverativ.
At 6:56AM ET (10:56GMT), the European benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 fell 0.74%, Germany’s DAX lost 0.75%, while London's FTSE 100 broke the trend, trading up 0.24%.
Earlier, Asian shares closed with mixed signs with benchmarks in Seoul and Australia ending higher, while Shanghai dropped nearly 1% and Tokyo ended flat, supported by a weaker yen."

European shares were mixed in early trading, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 (STOXX) index broadly flat.
Tech was in focus after Swiss chipmaker AMS (S:AMS), a key supplier for U.S. giant Apple (O:AAPL), reported a doubling of its 2017 revenues and raised its earnings guidance far in excess of expectations.
""Technology stocks have been at the forefront of equity market gains, and this week is pivotal for keeping the momentum going,"" said Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor.
MSCI's global information technology sector index <.dMIWO0IT00PUS> was 1.4 percent higher at an all-time high. 
Industry heavyweights Apple, Alphabet (O:GOOGL), Facebook (O:FB), Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Amazon (O:AMZN) are all set to report earnings this week. 
TIGHTENING TALK
U.S. and European bond yields both reached milestones as investors prepare for central banks to tighten monetary policy, and after a European Central Bank policymaker said the ECB should spell out it would end its bond purchases this year.
Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot said on Sunday the ECB should make clear that it will end its asset purchases after the current bond buying program ends in September, adding: ""There is no reason whatsoever to continue the program.""
Borrowing costs for Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy, rose, with the five-year bond yield briefly turning positive for the first time in more than three years to reach a high of 0.004 percent (DE5YT=RR). It was last trading at minus 0.01 percent.
U.S. Treasury yields also rose, continuing a move to multi-year highs after strong growth figures posted on Friday.
""The Knot comments are a factor behind the sell-off in bonds today,"" said DZ Bank rates strategist Andy Cossor. ""There's also the sell-off in U.S. Treasuries.""
Helped by rising bond yields, the dollar (DXY) edged higher against a basket of currencies, rising a quarter of a percent to 89.30 after scoring six consecutive weeks of losses.
Conflicting signals from top U.S. officials last week did little to discourage bearish positions, with net short dollar bets increasing to their highest level since October, according to latest positioning data. 
Despite Monday's rise the dollar is set to post its biggest monthly decline since March 2016.
The currency's decline has been a boon for many commodities, with gold making a 17-month top last week and last trading at $1,346 an ounce .
Oil prices dipped on Monday but remained just off their highest level in three years.

Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were holding atop $70 at $70.28 a barrel. U.S. crude futures (CLc1) were up 23 cents at $66.23.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has opened an investigation into KPMG's auditing of the now-collapsed Carillion covering the years 2014 to 2017, the watchdog said on Monday. 
Construction and outsourcing firm Carillion collapsed this month after banks pulled the plug, raising concerns about hospitals, road and other infrastructure projects and the fate of hundreds of suppliers.
The FRC said it would look at issues such as how the auditors recognized revenue on significant contracts and accounted for pensions.
The trustee of Carillion's pension scheme said on Monday it may have a deficit of about 990 million pounds.
""The FRC is progressing with urgent enquiries into the conduct of professional accountants within Carillion,"" the FRC said in a statement. 
The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy had asked the FRC to examine the preparation of Carillion's accounts past and present, as well as the company's auditors. 
The fall of Carillion has forced the government to guarantee public services ranging from school meals to road works provided by the company.
The investigation will be conducted as quickly and thoroughly as possible, the FRC said. It said it would be done in coordination with the Financial Conduct Authority, Insolvency Service and The Pensions Regulator, all of which are investigating Britain's biggest corporate failure in a decade. 
A KPMG spokesman said the firm believed it conducted Carillion’s audit appropriately and responsibly, and would cooperate fully with the FRC's investigation. 
“Transparency and accountability are vital in building public trust in audit,"" the spokesman said. ""We believe it is important that regulators acting in the public interest review the audit work related to high profile cases such as Carillion.""

Carillion's collapse followed three profit warnings in 2017.

GUIYANG, China (Reuters) - The largest U.S. maker of equipment for pig farms opened a new factory in China on Saturday, investing in its third plant in the world's top hog market in a bet the country's ambitious push into large-scale pig farming will bring a surge in demand. 
The move sees privately owned Hog Slat Inc put $2 million into building the plant, near Guiyang, capital of southwestern Guizhou province. Newton Grove, North Carolina-based Hog Slat is seeking to extend its foothold as one of a handful of foreign firms operating in a sector dominated by small domestic players.
Chinese companies are building hundreds of new facilities to replace backyard pig farms that have shut in recent years. Many are using foreign equipment and expertise to boost efficiency and output in the world's top pork producer.
""It (China) is not a large part of our business today,"" president Tommy Herring told Reuters at the Guiyang plant's opening. ""But the industry needs to modernize so it has the potential to be a very, very big part of our business.""
Family-owned Hog Slat's aim is to have 10 plants in China within four years, Herring said, without disclosing overall financial commitments or business targets.
The new plant will make 65,000 concrete slats per year for pig barn floors - Hog Slat produces more than 1 million slats a year overall - enough to supply roughly 18 large farms hosting around 8,000 sows each.
Hog Slat has another concrete slat plant in Shandong as well as a steel flooring factory in Henan. The new plant will help Hog Slat keep costs down while competing for business in southern China, according to the company.

The Guiyang plant will supply rapidly growing customers in the region, including Sichuan Giantstar Enterprise Group, Chongqing Riquan Agriculture and Livestock Co Ltd, Yunnan Shennong Agricultural Industry Group and Guangdong Wen's Foodstuff Co, according to Hog Slat country manager for China Hans Zou.

Andy Parkinson, who headed Provident's doorstep lending unit, has a hearing scheduled for mid-April, The Times reported, without citing sources.
Three other executives who worked at Provident's troubled home credit unit have also brought claims, with hearings set for the spring, the report added.
Provident has been trying to reorganize the door-to-door lending business that has traditionally relied on self-employed agents and collecting repayments through weekly visits. But it has been unable to recruit enough people for its plan to replace external agents with direct employees.
The company is also seeking an executive chairman after the sudden death in November of former investment banker Manjit Wolstenholme, who took the helm in 2017 and was charged with turning around the business.
Wolstenholme announced changes to the consumer credit division's management structure in August, with Chris Gillespie, who had been managing director of Provident's consumer credit division, rejoining to replace Andy Parkinson.
Subprime lenders have seen a rapid growth in Britain over the decade since the financial crisis, as banks cut back on risky lending and years of austerity have forced poorer people to borrow more.
But the high interest rates charged for loans have fueled a public and political backlash, leading to a regulatory crackdown.
Provident, which was founded in 1880 and provided loans through the Wall Street crash of 1929 and both world wars, has also contended a Financial Conduct Authority probe into its Vanquis Bank and Moneybarn units.

1162,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>",How Sanofi's setback could lead to better dengue vaccines,"By Julie Steenhuysen
CHICAGO (Reuters) - New dengue vaccines being developed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals Co Ltd and U.S. government scientists are poised to provide a safer alternative to Sanofi's Dengvaxia, according to vaccine experts, because they already take into account some of the issues that sidelined the product last year.
Sanofi (PA:SASY) revealed in November that Dengvaxia - the world's first dengue vaccine - might increase the risk of severe disease in people who had never been exposed to the virus. The news prompted an uproar in the Philippines, where more than 800,000 school-age children had been vaccinated.
Next-generation vaccines by Japan's Takeda and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, in conjunction with Brazil's Butantan Institute, are now in late-stage testing. 
They both differ significantly from Dengvaxia, which may increase the chances for a stronger, more durable immune response, according to more than a dozen dengue experts interviewed by Reuters. 
They expressed especially high hopes for the NIH vaccine, which protected 100 percent of volunteers who received it in a small study. 
Merck (NYSE:MRK) & Co Inc holds an exclusive license for the NIH vaccine in the United States, Canada, China, Japan and the European Union, and plans to begin its own trials in the first half of 2018.
It's too early to say whether either candidate will ultimately succeed, and experts await data from large, late-stage clinical trials.
And while Sanofi's early safety troubles may delay licensing of new vaccines for a few years as global regulators seek assurances from longer-term data, the increased scrutiny should result in a better, safer product, they said.
""We've learned a tremendous amount about dengue from the Sanofi vaccine,"" said Dr. Anna Durbin, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who helped develop the NIH vaccine. ""There is hope the two candidates coming down the pike can provide the benefit of a good dengue vaccine without the risk.""
LESSONS LEARNED
Dengue is the world's fastest-growing infectious disease, afflicting up to 100 million people worldwide, causing half a million life-threatening infections and killing up to 25,000 people, mostly children, each year. An effective vaccine could be worth more than $1 billion globally, according to industry analysts. 
There are four distinct types of dengue. A first infection with any one of them can increase the chances of severe disease when exposed to a second. 
Experts say an effective vaccine must protect against all four types at once. A weak response to one of them could act like a first infection and leave a person vulnerable to severe disease when exposed a second time.
That is what appears to have happened with Sanofi's Dengvaxia, according to vaccine experts.
""It wasn't a uniformly high level of response to all four subtypes (of dengue) simultaneously,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH's National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview.
Sanofi's late-stage clinical trials, which were designed in 2009, only collected blood samples from 10 to 15 percent of study participants before they were vaccinated. 
As a result, it was impossible to know when the studies were published in 2015 whether risks were greater in children who had never been exposed to dengue, said Dr. Su-Peing Ng, Sanofi's global medical head, in an interview.
To answer this question, Sanofi developed a special test to re-analyze its results, leading to the November 2017 disclosure. 
""We've been extremely transparent with our data,"" Ng said, adding that the company consulted with the field's leading experts as it was developing its vaccine.
Clinical trials testing the two new vaccines both require blood samples for all participants before they are vaccinated so they can quickly identify any similar risks.
Dr. Stephen Whitehead, who developed the NIH vaccine, said in a 2016 review that the long-term follow up from Sanofi's studies ""was instrumental in identifying safety concerns that are currently being investigated.""
    
IMMUNE RESPONSE
Dengvaxia uses a widely effective yellow fever virus vaccine as its genetic backbone. To induce an immune response to dengue, certain yellow fever genes were swapped out for dengue genes.
""It seemed like a bright idea 20 years ago,"" said dengue expert Dr. Scott Halstead, an adjunct professor at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland.
In hindsight, Halstead said, simply splicing select dengue genes into a yellow fever vaccine may not present enough of the virus to the immune system to induce full protection.
Instead of yellow fever, Takeda's vaccine, TAK-003, is based on a weakened version of a live dengue 2 virus. 
""We've taken a dengue 2 virus backbone and inserted elements of dengue 1, 3 and 4,"" said Dr. Rajeev Venkayya, president of Takeda's global vaccine business unit.
That's important, Venkayya said, ""because it exposes an individual that is immunized to a broad range of proteins on the outside and the inside of the virus, which allows individuals to generate a broad immune response.""
Data published in November in Lancet Infectious Diseases showed Takeda's vaccine produced responses against all four virus types, regardless of previous dengue exposure. There were no safety concerns. 
Takeda's vaccine is being tested in 20,000 children aged 4 to 16 in Asia and Latin America. Initial data are expected in late 2018.
Venkayya said the company's research has shown the vaccine, given in two doses, can produce both antibodies to dengue as well as a second type of response in which immune cells - known as CD8-positive T cells - recognize and kill virus-infected cells.
Several researchers suspect exposure to the full spectrum of dengue proteins is key to developing a fully protective vaccine. 
Johns Hopkins' Durbin said the presence of T-cells triggered by non-structural proteins in dengue 2 could help clear the virus before people become sick. But, like Sanofi's Dengvaxia, the Takeda vaccine appears to produce an unbalanced antibody response, with the highest protection offered against dengue 2. 
In a July 2017 paper published in Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology, Halstead said that it is also not clear whether Takeda's vaccine will provoke T-cell immunity to the other three dengue viruses, clouding its potential to succeed.
The NIH vaccine, called TV003/TV005, also features weakened versions of live dengue, but three of the four components - dengue 1, 3 and 4 - are based on whole dengue viruses. The fourth component is based on a dengue 4 backbone with dengue 2 genes spliced in. 
It has been shown to provoke a strong antibody response to all four types of dengue in a single shot, as well as producing T-cell immunity.
""It appears to be a true, protective, one-dose vaccine,"" Halstead said.
Brazil's non-profit Butantan Institute is testing the vaccine in some 17,000 participants in 14 areas with widespread dengue. 

""Though you never, ever, definitively predict until after everything is completely over, everything we've seen on the preliminary work on that looks pretty good,"" Fauci said.

1164,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 12:20AM ET</span>","Ford China chief in abrupt departure, a blow to recovery hopes","BEIJING (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said its China chief, Jason Luo, has stepped down after only five months at the helm for personal reasons, a sudden resignation that raises questions over how the automaker will best tackle a sales slump in the world's biggest car market.
Luo had been poached from Key Safety Systems, and it had been hoped that he would reprise his work at the auto parts maker where he engineered a significant surge in China revenue.
He also oversaw its $920 million sale to China's Ningbo Joyson Electronic and the $1.6 billion purchase of assets from bankrupt Japanese airbag maker Takata Corp.
""Jason offered his resignation for personal reasons that predate his time at Ford,"" Peter Fleet, head of Ford's Asia Pacific operations, said in the statement.
""Ford accepted Jason's resignation as the right way for him and the company to proceed. Jason's decision was not related to the business strategy or performance of Ford China,"" Fleet said, adding that Luo's replacement would be the subject of a future announcement.
The departure, effective immediately, is a blow to Ford, which has been falling behind rivals in the market. Its China sales slid 6 percent in 2017 compared with a 3 percent rise for the industry overall.
Luo was meant to help the firm improve ties with local joint-venture partners like Chongqing Changan Automobile Co and be nimbler in responding to local consumer demands.
At Ford, Luo was in charge of the carmaker's operations in Greater China including its import business, Lincoln, its passenger car joint venture Changan Ford, its commercial vehicle investment in Jiangling Motors Corporation, and its Taiwan operations.

Foreign automakers in China are also battling fierce competition from local rivals, who are aggressively launching new models to grab market share. The market is also skewed by heavy government support for electric vehicles, prompting Ford and others to seek partners and expand local production.

1166,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2018 07:30PM ET</span>",Qatar to agree to new financial disclosures for state owned-airline: U.S. officials,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Qatar is expected to agree on Tuesday to release detailed financial information about its state-owned Qatar Airways, U.S. State Department officials said late on Sunday, a move that follows pressure from U.S. airlines for it to disclose any potential subsidies it has received.
Under an understanding to be announced Tuesday, Qatar Airways will issue audited financial reports within a year and within two years must disclose significant new transactions with state-owned enterprises, U.S. officials said.
Qatar Airways and the Qatari government could not immediately be reached late Sunday.
The largest U.S. carriers -  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), United Continental Holdings Inc (N:UAL) and Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) - since 2015 have urged the U.S. government to challenge the conduct of three major Middle Eastern carriers under ""Open Skies"" agreements. The U.S. airlines contend the Gulf carriers are being unfairly subsidized by their governments with more than $50 billion in subsidies over the last decade.
Qatar, Etihad Airways and Emirates, have denied those accusations. The Gulf airlines operate around 200 flights per week to 12 U.S. cities.
Qatar and the United States are expected to disclose details of the understanding on aviation issues at a U.S.-Qatar strategic dialogue in Washington on Tuesday that will include U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis, along with senior Qatari officials, U.S. State Department officials said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the agreement has not been made public.
The voluntary agreement follows extensive negotiations with senior U.S. and Qatari officials in recent weeks. Qatar's Civil Aviation authority told the U.S. government that Qatar Airways has no current plans to offer so-called ""fifth freedom flights"" that allow an airline to fly between foreign countries as a part of services to and from its home country.
Qatar must take steps to ensure that the transactions are conducted on commercial terms. The disclosures could help U.S. carriers make the case that the airline is getting unfair government subsidies.
The voluntary agreement does not to apply to Etihad or Emirates, both based in the United Arab Emirates. The State Department plans new talks with UAE as early as next week, U.S. officials said.
In a Sept. 14 White House memo disclosed by Reuters and other outlets in December, Trump administration officials agreed the U.S. government “should take action to address the unfair behavior of Gulf carriers.""
U.S. smaller airlines grouped under the U.S. Airlines for Open Skies Coalition said in December it was ""confident further investigation by the Trump administration will show the claims for what they are: a political ploy to protect themselves from competition and limit choice for U.S. travelers.""

The coalition represents  Atlas Air Worldwide  Holdings Inc (O:AAWW), FedEx Corp (N:FDX), Hawaiian Airlines, and JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU).

First Solar stock has risen 54 percent since the end of September, when Barron's published a story predicting U.S. tariffs on solar modules and cells, the publication said in a report in its Jan. 29 issue.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed into law a 30 percent tariff on fully assembled imported solar panels as well as the cells of which they are made.
U.S.-based First Solar is exempt from the tariff but has benefited from a surge in demand in recent months from utility customers who have wanted to fulfill their solar needs ahead of the tariff, Barron's said.
First Solar shares closed at $70.56 on Friday.

1168,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2018 12:53PM ET</span>",Wall Street Weekahead: State of the Union more likely to raise eyebrows than stocks,"By Sinead Carew
(Reuters) - Anybody hoping for a replay of the stock market advance that followed U.S. President Donald Trump's first address to Congress may be disappointed. This time around, shares could suffer if Trump does not tread carefully on hot-button issues. 
The S&P 500 jumped 1.4 percent the day after Trump's speech last February, as an unexpectedly measured tone from the notoriously abrasive president boosted investor optimism that he would be able to deliver on pro-business campaign promises. 
But with a new tax law under his belt, Trump is expected to use his late-night State of the Union speech on Tuesday to applaud that victory and broach topics including trade agreements, immigration reform and infrastructure spending.
That may not be enough to inspire investors further, after enthusiasm about corporate tax cuts helped push the S&P 500 up more than 19 percent in 2017 and close to 7 percent so far this year. 
""Nothing is going to trump tax reform,"" said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""Since I expect the president to do a victory lap, the typical market reaction would be a sell-the-news reaction in contrast to last year.""
The S&P 500 has had only 4 daily declines so far this year, and the chances of a Jan. 31 selloff are higher if the market does not take a breather before then, O'Rourke said. 
Investors could be rattled by tough talk from Trump on issues including U.S. immigration policy, which has already divided lawmakers in a Republican-controlled Congress and led to a three-day government shutdown. 
""He's got to tread carefully on the hot-button items,"" said Phil Blancato, chief executive of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York, citing immigration and trade talks. 
He noted that a ""pro-immigration agenda"" could be the easiest way to expand the U.S. workforce to boost an economy with a tight labor market. 
Congress agreed to extend funding to Feb. 8 and the White House is expected to unveil an immigration legislation framework a day before the speech. 
Strategists also are wary about how Trump will approach international trade, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, due to his tendency for ""America First"" rhetoric. 
""We know historically protectionism is bad for the economy. It's bad for markets. You open a great deal of uncertainty if you hone in on that,"" said JonesTrading's O'Rourke.
Officials from the United States, Canada and Mexico will wrap up the sixth of seven planned rounds of NAFTA talks in Montreal on Monday, with little sign of agreement on U.S. proposals to overhaul the $1.2 trillion pact. 
Any trade comments would also come on the heels of Trump approving a steep tariff on solar panels and washing machines, moves those industries have warned could raise prices and endanger jobs. 
To be sure, Trump could boost sentiment with details on a plan to rebuild U.S. infrastructure. On Wednesday he promised $1.7 trillion in investments over the next 10 years. But any related gains may be limited to sectors like industrials and materials. 
And in general, big moves like the one seen last year are relatively rare. 
The market moved more than 1 percent in either direction just 15 times the day after the annual U.S. presidential address since 1965, when it was first televised at night. By comparison, it had a 1 percent or more move 13 times in the session before the speech. 
Retail investors may be more likely than professional fund managers to let policy comments influence their trading, said Blancato, who is not planning to make any asset allocation changes based on the speech. 
Investors may also be less sensitive to the speech's message this time around. Many now say they largely ignore politics after a tumultuous year with a divided Republican party, heated exchanges with nuclear-armed North Korea, a probe of possible collusion between Trump's election campaign and Russia and the government shutdown. 
Traders have instead focused on economic data and earnings, which continue to look strong. Analysts expect the S&P 500's fourth-quarter earnings per share to rise by 12.7 percent from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters data. 

""Short of something truly stupid like a trade war with China or a withdrawal from NAFTA, or something horrific like a nuclear conflict with North Korea, we don't see a scenario where investors are likely to elevate politics to the same level of importance as the global recovery and improving earnings,"" said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas.

1174,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2018 06:35PM ET</span>",Wynn resigns as RNC finance chair after sexual misconduct allegations,"By Steve Holland and Ginger Gibson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Las Vegas casino mogul Steve Wynn resigned as finance chairman of the Republican Party's fundraising arm on Saturday, a day after a newspaper reported that he routinely subjected women who worked for him to unwanted sexual advances.
""Today I accepted Steve Wynn's resignation as Republican National Committee finance chair,"" RNC chair Ronna Romney McDaniel said in a statement.
The billionaire has denied the accusations published by the Wall Street Journal as ""preposterous"" and said they were instigated by his ex-wife to seek advantage in their divorce lawsuit.
But he said in a statement released on Saturday evening that he was resigning to avoid unnecessary distraction. He also thanked U.S. President Donald Trump for the job.
""The unbelievable success we have achieved must continue,"" the statement said. ""The work we are doing to make America a better place is too important to be impaired by this distraction.""
As recently as Friday night, Wynn associates were insisting he would fight the charges and remain at the RNC.
Instead, he becomes the latest powerful man to pay a price for accusations of sexual misconduct in the United States.
The 76-year-old founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Wynn Resorts Ltd, has been a prominent figure in the casino resort business and onetime rival of Trump.
After previously seeking to appear nonpartisan, he threw his support behind Trump during the 2016 campaign and donated money to several Republican causes including the RNC.
Trump called Wynn a ""great friend"" after he won the Nevada caucus in February 2016, and Wynn was named finance chairman of the committee after Trump became president.
U.S. Representative Francis Rooney of Florida is being considered as a replacement, one Republican fundraiser said. 
The board of directors of Wynn Resorts said on Friday it had met to form a special committee consisting solely of independent directors to investigate the allegations reported by the Journal.
The special investigation panel will be chaired by Patricia Mulroy, a member of the board's corporate governance and compliance committees and a former member of the Nevada Gaming Commission, the board said in a statement.
The Wall Street Journal said former and current company staff members it interviewed had accused Wynn of creating a hostile work environment for women and of regularly pressuring employees to perform sex acts.
""The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous,"" Wynn said in a statement on Friday. ""The instigation of these accusations is the continued work of my ex-wife, Elaine Wynn, with whom I am involved in a terrible and nasty lawsuit in which she is seeking a revised divorce settlement.""
A spokeswoman for Elaine Wynn, 75, declined comment on Friday, but her Washington-based attorney, James Cole, told Reuters the notion that his client fomented the allegations in the Journal article ""is just not true.""
After The New York Times revealed in October that Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein had paid off multiple sexual harassment accusers over decades, it unleashed a wave of accusations against the rich and powerful, leading to the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements demanding an end to impunity.
Weinstein was long a major donor to Democratic candidates and causes. The scandal prompted McDaniel to urge the Democrats to give back his ""dirty money.""

After the Journal published the accusations against Wynn, Democrats in turn called on Republicans to return his donations.

Matthias Machnig, state secretary in Germany's economics ministry, said it was urgent that proposed Europe-wide measures to police surging Chinese investment be adopted by the end of this year.
""It is essential that we get a tougher law in the European Union this year to resist takeover fantasies or outflows of technology or know-how,"" he said in an interview, excerpts of which were made available on Saturday.
The paper cited a study by the Cologne Institute for Economic Research that showed the volume of known Chinese investments in Germany had risen to 12.1 billion euros ($15.03 billion) in 2017 from around 11 billion the year before and just 100 million euros seven years ago.
Concern has been growing across Europe at China's buying spree on the continent, with investors snapping up often iconic businesses in a way many fear could threaten Europe's position as a high-value economy.
""With its innovative companies, the EU is attractive for many around the world,"" Machnig said. ""Takeovers are becoming more frequent, often under market-distorting conditions.""

1176,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2018 03:06PM ET</span>",Michigan special prosecutor to probe university in Nassar case,"By Daniel Trotta
(Reuters) - Michigan's attorney general on Saturday named a special prosecutor to lead an ""open and ongoing"" investigation of Michigan State University after campus sports doctor Larry Nassar sexually assaulted athletes over nearly 20 years.
Retired Kent County Prosecutor William Forsyth was named independent special prosecutor and will produce a public report on his findings. He will work closely with Michigan State Police Director Kriste Kibbey Etue, Attorney General Bill Schuette said.
""My department and this investigation will find out who knew what, and when,"" said Schuette, who promised the probe would speak with each of the 156 known victims.
The case of Nassar, 54, has rocked Michigan State University, where he was a faculty member and physician at an on-campus clinic. He also worked for USA Gymnastics as a doctor to Olympic athletes, leading to the resignation of the entire board of the sport's governing body.
Michigan State University President Lou Anna Simon stepped down under pressure on Wednesday, and Athletic Director Mark Hollis announced his retirement on Friday. Both said they were unaware of Nassar's abuse until it was reported publicly. 
Congress and the U.S. Olympic Committee are also investigating the Nassar case, with the U.S. House of Representatives examining allegations of sexual harassment by officials in other sports, including swimming and taekwondo.
Ingham County Judge Rosemarie Aquilina sentenced Nassar to 40 to 175 years in prison on Wednesday after he had pleaded guilty to sexual assault charges and some 150 victims told their stories in raw and unflinching terms.
Many described how he penetrated their bodies with his fingers without permission, gloves or lubrication, claiming it was treatment for sports injuries.Nassar's sentencing came amid a wave of sexual abuse and harassment allegations leveled against powerful men during the past year. Changing attitudes have led more women to denounce their abusers and be believed.
At Michigan State, athletes had been complaining about Nassar since the 1990s, but the university did not open an investigation until 2014.
""Let's be very clear. No individual and no department at Michigan State University is off limits,"" Schuette said on Saturday, without commenting on whether he expected the probe to produce more criminal charges.
He did not take questions from reporters at the televised address, during which he was flanked by Forsyth and Etue.Forsyth served as Kent County prosecutor for 40 years and chose not to seek re-election in 2016.
He had overseen more than 40 murder trials and occasionally handled high-profile prosecutions himself, such as the 2008 murder conviction of a man who shot and killed a Grand Rapids police officer, according to the Grand Rapids Press.
Forsyth said he was ""outraged"" by the Nassar case and wanted to know why nobody stopped his ""predatory conduct"" for almost 20 years.

""Who at Michigan State knew and was aware of what he was doing because they had been told by some of these victims? And once told what did employees of Michigan State University do with that information?"" Forsyth said.

1178,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2018 10:59AM ET</span>",Relief for UK workers after Bombardier trade dispute victory,"LONDON (Reuters) - British politicians and union leaders welcomed Bombardier's surprise trade victory against U.S. planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, saying it safeguarded thousands of jobs in Northern Ireland and across British supply chains.
Friday's ruling by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) was also a boost for British Prime Minister Theresa May, as the Bombardier operation in Northern Ireland is central to the concerns of the province's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party, which is propping up her government after her poor showing in last June's election.
The dispute between the two companies had put thousands of jobs at risk at the Belfast plant where Bombardier makes the carbon wings for the CSeries CS100 and CS300.
“It's a huge relief, we always knew that (the case) was unjustified,"" Britain's business minister Greg Clark told BBC radio on Saturday.
""Not only does it mean this worry is out of the way, it means (Bombardier) can now go on with strength to expand because the CSeries has just tied up with Airbus,"" he said.
On Friday, the U.S. ITC voted 4-0 to reject Boeing's claims that it suffered injury by Bombardier underpricing the CSeries in the U.S. market and discarded a Commerce Department recommendation to slap a near 300-percent duty on sales of the 110-to-130-seat jets for five years.
""Boeing has investments in the UK and it was clear that it would have been very difficult to have a good relationship with them if they were threatening these hugely important jobs in Belfast,"" said Clark.
On Friday, May welcomed the ruling as ""good news for British industry.""
The European Commission said the ruling was in line with what the EU had been arguing throughout the case and said it was a massive relief for Bombardier's 4,000 workers in Northern Ireland and for the European aerospace industry as a whole.
""The EU will always stand up and defend the interests of its industry when confronted by inappropriate use of trade defence instruments,"" a Commission spokesman said.
Democratic Unionist Party member of parliament Gavin Robinson said the ruling was ""fantastic news"". His East Belfast constituency includes a Bombardier plant that produces wings for the CSeries.
Trade unions were similarly jubilant.
""Bombardier workers in Northern Ireland and throughout the supply chain in the UK will be breathing a huge sigh of relief that the ITC has seen through Boeing’s baseless complaint,"" said Steve Turner, assistant general secretary of the Unite union.
""There can be no backsliding from the U.S. government on this decision.""

(Reuters) - The release of Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, known for his big bets on  Citigroup  (N:C) and other top Western companies, is likely to reassure investors in his sprawling international business empire. 
For many foreigners, Prince Alwaleed - whose net worth has been estimated by Forbes magazine at $17 billion - is the face of Saudi business, appearing frequently on international television and in articles about his investments and lifestyle.
A 2013 Forbes magazine profile described his marble-filled, 420-room Riyadh palace, a private Boeing (NYSE:BA) 747 equipped with a throne, and his 120-acre resort on the edge of the Saudi capital with five homes, five artificial lakes and a mini-Grand Canyon.
Directly and indirectly through his investment firm  Kingdom  Holding (SE:4280), he holds a portfolio of stakes in companies such as Twitter (N:TWTR), where he is believed to own nearly 5 percent, ride-hailing firm Lyft and French hotel operator  Accor  (PA:ACCP), where latest disclosures show him with 5.7 percent.
His web of hospitality and real estate investments includes the George V hotel in Paris, New York's Plaza hotel and the Savoy hotel in London. Investments within Saudi Arabia include a 16.2 percent stake in lender Banque Saudi Fransi (SE:1050).
The assets of Prince Alwaleed, who is in his early 60s, appeared at risk of seizure or liquidation when he was detained in November in a crackdown on corruption. A Saudi official said he was accused of money laundering, bribery and extortion.
Kingdom Holding's share price plunged as much as 23 percent in following days, wiping about $2.2 billion off his fortune.
But the stock has since recovered about half its losses. The prince's release on Saturday could help it rebound further.
Terms of the release have not so far been disclosed. A senior Saudi official told Reuters the prince was freed after a financial settlement over ""violations"" to which he had admitted. But the official gave no details, beyond saying Prince Alwaleed would continue to head Kingdom Holding.
Prince Alwaleed told Reuters in the final hours of his captivity that he maintained his innocence of any wrongdoing, and did not expect to have to hand over assets to the state.
The prince also said he was able to communicate with executives at his business during his detention, and that Kingdom Holding would remain under his ownership.
FINANCE MINISTER'S SON
Prince Alwaleed, whose father was the Saudi finance minister in the 1960s, formed Kingdom Holding in 1979, initially pouring money into real estate in Riyadh. In the 1990s, he ventured into Wall Street, investing heavily in Citigroup.
He had a close relationship with former Citigroup Chief Executive Sanford ""Sandy"" Weill, and has nurtured close ties with other Wall Street leaders including Goldman Sachs (N:GS) chief executive Lloyd Blankfein.
""He's always been a colorful and unofficial public face of Saudi Arabia, though he has never been a key decision-maker in the kingdom,"" a Gulf-based businessman said.
Well before he was detained, Prince Alwaleed publicly endorsed economic and social reforms pushed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who launched the crackdown on corruption.
Prince Alwaleed was an early advocate of women's employment in Saudi Arabia and ending a ban on women driving. In September, King Salman ordered the driving ban to be lifted this year.
The prince has also been outspoken in the international arena. During the U.S. election campaign, he called Donald Trump a ""disgrace"" and said he should withdraw from the campaign after Trump pledged to ban Muslims' entry into the United States.
Trump responded by tweeting that the Saudi prince wanted to control ""our politicians with daddy's money. Can't do it after I get elected.""
Following the vote, Prince Alwaleed congratulated Trump on his victory and said that, whatever past differences, America had spoken.

1180,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2018 10:22AM ET</span>",German industrial workers to stage 24-hour strikes,"By Ilona Wissenbach
STUTTGART (Reuters) - Powerful German union IG Metall has called for all-day walkouts by industrial workers across the country next week, hampering the production of cars, car parts and machinery, after last-ditch regional labor talks failed to reach a deal.
""We have to step up the pressure on employers in the coming days so that they show some willingness to compromise,"" IG Metall chief Joerg Hofmann told journalists in a news conference on Saturday.
IG Metall said it saw no point in further talks during the planned walkouts, but said it was in principle willing to resume negotiations if employers showed a willingness to make concessions.
If not, the union's leadership will prepare to ballot workers for extended strikes that could hit Germany's industrial output.
Nearly a million workers have already taken part in short walkouts across the country this month to support IG Metall's demands for higher pay and the right to shortened working hours, but employers have warned that 24-hour strikes could pose a serious risk to companies.
""Twenty-four hour strikes would indeed be painful,"" a spokesman for BMW (DE:BMWG) said ahead of the latest round of talks, adding extended walkouts could disrupt production not only at the carmaker but also at suppliers.
Three hours of stoppages at BMW's Munich factory on Wednesday resulted in 250 cars not being assembled, it said.
Premium rival Audi, owned by Volkswagen, also said it was trying to catch up after around 700 vehicles were not assembled as a result of two stoppages at its Ingolstadt and Neckarsulm factories this week.
RECORD GROWTH SPURS DEMANDS
IG Metall's call for all-day strikes comes after union leaders and employers in the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, home to companies such as Mercedes-Benz maker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and sports car firm Porsche (DE:VOWG_p), failed to reach agreement in 16 hours of talks overnight.
Emboldened by the fastest economic growth in six years and record low unemployment, IG Metall is demanding an 8 percent pay rise for 3.9 million metals and engineering workers across Germany for 27 months.
It has also asked for workers to be given the right to reduce their weekly hours to 28 from 35 to care for children, elderly or sick relatives, and return to full time after two years.
It said on Saturday it had offered concessions to employers in the latest round of talks, proposing a flexible model allowing workers to choose between extra money and time off.
Employers have offered a 6.8 percent increase but have rejected the demand for shorter hours unless they can also increase workers' hours when necessary.
""The union kept coming with new ideas that drove up the price more and more,"" regional employers' association Suedwestmetall said.
IG Metall, meanwhile, blamed the employers for the lack of a deal, saying they had gotten lost in details during the talks rather than seeking agreement on the major issues.
This is IG Metall's first major push for shorter hours since workers staged seven weeks of strikes in 1984 to help push through a cut of the working week to 35 hours from 40 hours.

Any deal in Baden-Wuerttemberg would typically be applied in other German states as well.

1182,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2018 09:54AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank to hike bonuses to more than 1 billion euros for 2017: FAS,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) will hike annual bonus payments to more than 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) despite posting its third consecutive annual loss in 2017, a German newspaper reported.
The move comes amid concern another year of low bonuses could prompt investment bankers to defect to more generous competitors, German weekly Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung said on Saturday, citing unidentified sources.
Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the report.
A source had told Reuters in October that Deutsche Bank, which is struggling to keep pace with Wall Street firms, would pay higher bonuses in 2017 but that the exact level would depend on how its investment bank fared through the end of the year as well as on what its competitors pay.
A return to bigger bonuses would be a relief for bankers at Deutsche Bank, where total bonus payments dropped from 2.4 billion euros in 2015 to around 500 million euros in 2016 after a multi-billion dollar legal fine for the sale of toxic debt.
But Deutsche Bank has to tread carefully on payout levels because credit rating agencies are keeping close tabs on them and shareholders are frustrated by its slow turnaround.
The bank warned this month that weak trading, low client activity and a 1.5 billion euro hit from a tax overhaul in the United States would result in a ""small"" 2017 loss.
""The bank must send positive signals in 2018, otherwise there will be a problem. The capital market is very impatient,"" Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment, told Frankfurter Allgemeine.
""There is no proof so far that Deutsche Bank's strategy will ever lead to success,"" he said.
Germany's biggest bank announced an overhaul in March last year that included integrating its Postbank retail bank with its in-house consumer bank in an effort to cut costs, as well as the partial sale of its asset management business.
One source told Reuters on Saturday that Deutsche Bank aimed to go ahead with the flotation as soon as possible, which could be in March or April.
The offering's prospectus, which has to be approved by financial watchdog Bafin, has not yet been completed, the person added.
Frankfurt Allgemeine earlier said that Deutsche Bank aimed to float the asset management business, which could achieve a total valuation of around 8 billion euros, in March at the latest.

DOHA (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) will deliver the first ever A350-1000 jet to an airline to Qatar Airways between Feb. 15 and Feb. 20, the carrier's chief executive said on Saturday.
Delivery of Europe's largest twin-engined passenger jet to launch customer Qatar Airways had been delayed from late last year to some time next month due to issues with installing business class seats.
""We are progressing very well to receive our aircraft somewhere between the 15th and 20th [of February],"" Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker told reporters in Doha.
Qatar Airways has ordered 37 A350-1000s.
The major Middle East airline is known to be a demanding customer when reviewing aircraft for quality defects before delivery. Qatar Airways has in the past refused to take delivery of aircraft over what it said were quality issues, and has also canceled some deliveries. 
Airbus looks ""forward to delivering the world's first A350-1000 to Qatar Airways in the coming weeks,"" Airbus' Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier said in a press release issued by the airline.
The ""complex seat configuration"" of Qatar Airways' Qsuite, business class which features seats that face each other, and lie-flat double beds, had delayed the delivery of the A350-1000, until February, Baker said on Monday without detailing a specific date. 
The A350-1000 will be the first Airbus jet to feature the Qsuite, which was unveiled last year and has been installed on Qatar Airways' Boeing (N:BA) 777 jets, Baker said.
The A350-1000 is the largest version of the A350 series, and was launched to compete against Boeing's 777s in the up to 400-seat market.
Baker, speaking to reporters on board one of Airbus' A350-1000 test aircraft, said the airline expected to receive four of the twin-engined jets this year. 
""This is contractually and I am confident that Airbus will deliver them to us,"" he said.
Qatar Airways plans to initially fly its first A350-1000 on long haul routes before adding it to ultra long-haul routes in a few months time, in case of any potential technical issues with the new jet. 
Baker said the airline hoped to take delivery of its first Boeing 777x by the first half of 2020.

The airline has ordered 60 the new 777x jets, according to data on Boeing's website.

1185,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2018 04:07AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Detained Saudi billionaire Alwaleed confident his troubles will end soon,"By Katie Paul
RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, detained in the kingdom's sweeping crackdown on corruption, said on Saturday that he expected to be cleared of any wrongdoing and released from custody within days, with his vast assets intact. 
Prince Alwaleed was speaking in an exclusive interview with Reuters at his suite in Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel, transformed into a luxurious prison to hold tycoons and royals. 
He has been confined there for more than two months along with dozens of other suspects, part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's bold plan to consolidate control and reform oil superpower Saudi Arabia. 
It was the first time the prince, one of the nation's most prominent businessmen, has spoken publicly since his detention. 
Prince Alwaleed said he was continuing to maintain his innocence of any corruption in talks with authorities. He said he expected to keep full control of his global investment firm  Kingdom  Holding Co (SE:4280) without being required to give up assets to the government. 
'MISUNDERSTANDING' 
He described his confinement as a misunderstanding and said he supports reform efforts by the crown prince, known as MbS. 
Prince Alwaleed was an early advocate of women's employment in Saudi Arabia and a lifting of the ban on women driving. In September, King Salman ordered that the restriction should be lifted next year. 
""There are no charges. There are just some discussions between me and the government,"" he said in the interview, conducted shortly after midnight. ""I believe we are on the verge of finishing everything within days."" 
Prince Alwaleed appeared grayer and thinner than in his last public appearance, a television interview in late October, and had grown a beard while in detention. 
""I have nothing to hide at all. I'm so comfortable, I'm so relaxed. I shave here, like at home. My barber comes here. I'm like at home, frankly speaking,"" he said. 
""I told the government I'd stay as much as they want, because I want the truth to come out on all my dealings and on all things that are around me."" 
The flamboyant prince, in his 60s, is the face of Saudi business for many foreigners, often appearing on international television covering his diverse investments and lifestyle. 
A 30-minute interview, including a tour of his suite, was granted largely in order to disprove rumors of mistreatment and of being moved from the hotel to a prison. 
TENNIS SHOES, VEGETARIAN MEALS 
Prince Alwaleed showed off the comforts of his gold-accented private office, dining room and kitchen, which was fully stocked with his preferred vegetarian meals. 
In the corner of his office sat tennis shoes, which he said he used regularly for exercise. A television played business news programs, and a mug with an image of his own face on it was perched on the desk. 
The release of Prince Alwaleed, whose net worth has been estimated by Forbes magazine at $17 billion, is likely to reassure investors in his global business empire as well as in the Saudi economy broadly. 
Directly or indirectly through Kingdom Holding, he holds stakes in firms such as  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), and has invested in top hotels including the George V in Paris and the Plaza in New York. 
Dozens of princes, senior officials and top businessmen were detained when Crown Prince Mohammed launched his purge in early November, shocking Saudis who never imagined the business elite or royalty could come under close scrutiny. 
Allegations against Prince Alwaleed included money laundering, bribery and extorting officials, a Saudi official told Reuters at the time. 
He is also known for his outspoken views on politics - making headlines in 2015 when he called Donald Trump a ""disgrace"" on Twitter during the U.S. election campaign. 
The prince said he was able to communicate with family members and executives at his business during his time in detention. 
Asked why he ended up held in the hotel and became one of its longest-serving detainees, he said: 
""There's a misunderstanding and it's being cleared. So I'd like to stay here until this thing is over completely and get out and life goes on."" 
""We have now a new leadership in Saudi Arabia, and they just want to cross all the Ts and dot all the Is. And I said: 'Fine, that's fine with me, no problem at all. Just go ahead.'"" 
Authorities said they aimed to reach financial settlements with most suspects and believed they could raise some $100 billion for the government this way - a huge windfall for the state, which has seen its finances squeezed by low oil prices. 
In recent days there have been signs the purge is winding down. Several other prominent businessmen, including Waleed al-Ibrahim, owner of regional television network MBC, have been released, an official source told Reuters on Friday. Terms of any settlement were not revealed. 
Prince Alwaleed said his own case was taking longer to conclude because he was determined to clear his name completely, but he believed the case was now 95 percent finished. 
The prince said he was particularly upset by media reports that he had been sent to prison and tortured. 
""It's very unfortunate. I was planning to do an interview when I got out, which I think will be imminently. 
""But I decided to accelerate the process and accept this interview today because these various rumors took place. They’re unacceptable completely. They are just a bunch of lies."" 
After freedom, the prince said, he plans to continue living in Saudi Arabia and getting back to the high-paced and complex challenge of juggling his global interests. 
""I will not leave Saudi Arabia, for sure. This is my country. I have my family, my children, my grandchildren here. I have my assets here. My allegiance is not on the table.""

1186,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2018 01:01AM ET</span>",Wynn Resorts CEO calls sexual misconduct accusations 'preposterous'; stock falls,"By Steve Gorman
(Reuters) - Las Vegas casino mogul Steve Wynn has routinely subjected women who work for him to unwanted sexual advances in a pattern of misconduct detailed by dozens of past and present employees, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, but the billionaire denied the accusations as ""preposterous.""
Hours later, the board of directors of  Wynn Resorts Ltd  (O:WYNN), of which Wynn is founder, chairman and chief executive officer, said it had met to form a special committee consisting solely of independent directors to investigate the allegations contained in the Journal's article.
The announcement of the inquiry followed a drop in the company's stock of more than 10.1 percent in heaving trading, closing at $180.29 per share on the Nasdaq exchange on Friday after publication of the Journal story.
The special investigation panel will be chaired by Patricia Mulroy, a member of the board's corporate governance and compliance committees and a former member of the Nevada Gaming Commission, the board said in a statement emailed to Reuters.
""The board is deeply committed to ensuring the safety and wellbeing of all the company's employees and to operating with the highest ethical standards,"" the statement said.
Earlier in the day, the company appeared to side with its chairman in dismissing the Journal's article, saying in a statement that the newspaper account ""reflected allegations"" made by his ex-wife, Elaine Wynn, in her litigation against him and the company.
The Wall Street Journal said former and current company staff members it interviewed had accused Wynn of creating a hostile work environment for women and of regularly pressuring employees to perform sex acts.
The report was the latest in a wave of sexual abuse and harassment allegations leveled against powerful men during the past year, especially in the media and entertainment industries and politics.
Wynn has straddled both those worlds, as a prominent figure in the casino resort business and onetime rival of Donald Trump. Wynn was named finance chairman of the U.S. Republican National Committee after Trump became president.
AVOIDING THE BOSS
Former workers, the Journal said, told of employees going to such lengths as making phony entries in appointment books to help other female employees avoid a request for services in Wynn's office, or arranged for others to pose as assistants so they would not be alone with him. 
Others, the newspaper said, recounted female employees hiding in the lavatory or backrooms when they learned he was on his way to a hotel salon.
The article said Wynn paid a $7.5 million settlement to a former manicurist at his flagship Wynn Las Vegas resort who had accused Wynn of forcing her to have sex in his office in 2005.
The Journal said the alleged incident and settlement were mentioned obliquely in court documents filed in a lawsuit brought by the casino owner's former wife over control of her stock in the company. 
Steve Wynn, who turns 76 on Saturday, denied the allegations in a statement emailed to Reuters.
""The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous,"" he said. ""The instigation of these accusations is the continued work of my ex-wife, Elaine Wynn, with whom I am involved in a terrible and nasty lawsuit in which she is seeking a revised divorce settlement.""
A spokeswoman for Elaine Wynn, 75, declined comment, but her Washington-based attorney, James Cole, told Reuters the notion that his client fomented the allegations in the Journal article ""is just not true.""
The couple first married in 1963 and divorced in 1986. They remarried in 1991 and divorced again in 2010, according to court papers. In an escalating battle that followed their bitter second split, Elaine Wynn sued her former spouse in 2016 seeking to gain control over her 9.4 percent stock in Wynn Resorts. 
The lawsuit accused her ex-husband of breaching a 2010 stockholder agreement by engineering her ouster from the company's board the previous April.
Wynn owns roughly 11.8 percent of his company, regulatory filings show, giving him a stake worth close to $2.2 billion. Forbes magazine puts his overall net worth at about $3.5 billon.
In addition to Wynn Las Vegas, the company's assets include Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau. Steve Wynn also helped develop such Las Vegas hotel-casino properties as the Bellagio, the Mirage and Treasure Island.

The Journal said none of the 150 people contacted for its story had reached out to the newspaper, and that most of those interviewed expressed fear that Wynn's influence in the casino industry could hurt their ability to find work elsewhere.

1187,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 10:19PM ET</span>","U.S. CFTC to fine UBS, Deutsche Bank, HSBC for spoofing, manipulation: sources","By Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. derivatives regulator is set to announce it has fined European lenders UBS, HSBC and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) millions of dollars each for so-called ""spoofing"" and manipulation in the U.S. futures market, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The enforcement action by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is the result of a multi-agency investigation that also involves the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) - the first of its kind for the CFTC, the people said.
The fines for UBS and Deutsche Bank will be upward of ten million, while the fine for HSBC will be slightly less than that, the people said, without providing exact figures.
Spokesmen for HSBC, Deutsche Bank and UBS declined to comment.
Spoofing involves placing bids to buy or offers to sell futures contracts with the intent to cancel them before execution. By creating an illusion of demand, spoofers can influence prices to benefit their market positions.
Spoofing is a criminal offense under a provision implemented as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform. 
Some of the manipulative behavior came to light as a result of the authorities' previously-settled probes into forex market manipulation while UBS self-reported the wrong doing, according to two of the people with knowledge of the matter.
The bank investigations have been ongoing for more than a year, one of the people said.
The settlement is the most high-profile brought so far by the CFTC's head of enforcement James McDonald who was appointed to the role in March 2017. 
McDonald, who was previously a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, said in September he plans to encourage companies and staff to report their own wrongdoing and cooperate with investigators, a strategy he hopes will make it easier to prosecute more individuals.
In August, a U.S. appeals court upheld the conviction of former New Jersey-based high-speed trader Michael Coscia who was the first individual was the first person to be criminally prosecuted for the manipulative trading practice.
A spokeswoman for the CBOE, one of the U.S.'s major futures exchanges, declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME), the other major futures bourse, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

1188,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 09:58PM ET</span>",UAW leader says payments to union official did not affect talks,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - United Auto Workers President Dennis Williams on Friday denied a claim that payments by a Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) executive to a union official had compromised contract talks or impacted union funds.
In a letter to members seen by Reuters, Williams said, ""There is simply no truth to the claim that this misconduct compromised the negotiation of our collective bargaining agreement or had any impact on union funds.""
Earlier this week, former FCA executive Alphons Iacobelli pleaded guilty to federal charges that he made at least $1.5 million in improper payments to UAW union officials. 
According to a plea agreement made public late on Monday, Iacobelli, 58, agreed to cooperate in the ongoing investigation by the U.S. Justice Department into alleged misspending at UAW union training centers funded by U.S. automakers.
Monica Morgan, wife of former UAW vice president General Holiefield, who died in March 2015, is also expected to plead guilty, Reuters reported last week, citing a person briefed on the matter. She faces a plea hearing on Feb. 6.
According to the plea agreement, Iacobelli admitted to transferring hundreds of thousands of dollars in prohibited payments to charities controlled by UAW officials. The agreement said he authorized paying off Morgan and Holiefield's $262,000 mortgage. 
The agreement states that Iacobelli used FCA funds to pay out more than $1.5 million in cash and items of value to UAW officials and employees to obtain concessions for FCA in negotiating and implementing collective bargaining agreements between the automaker and the union, and to influence union decisions on pension funds. 
The plea deal also states that he authorized secret payments of $50,000 each to select UAW officials.
Williams said in his letter the proposed $50,000 payments were reviewed by the union's legal counsel and rejected by him. He added that Holiefield had no impact on decisions regarding pension funds.
""While Mr. Iacobelli will have to answer for his criminal conduct, it appears that in an attempt to get lenient treatment from the government he is now falsely spinning his crimes as an effort to corrupt the collective bargaining process between the UAW and Fiat Chrysler,"" Williams said.
An attorney for Iacobelli and the U.S. attorney's office in Detroit did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. 

Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne has said the ""deplorable"" conduct did not impact collective bargaining talks and the ""egregious acts were neither known to nor sanctioned by (Fiat Chrysler).""

1189,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 09:37PM ET</span>",U.S. trade body backs Canadian plane maker Bombardier against Boeing,"By Allison Lampert and Lesley Wroughton
MONTREAL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. trade commission on Friday handed an unexpected victory to Bombardier Inc against Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, in a ruling that allows the Canadian company to sell its newest jets to U.S. airlines without heavy duties, sending Bombardier's shares up 15 percent.
The U.S. International Trade Commission's unanimous decision is the latest twist in U.S.-Canadian trade relations that have been complicated by disputes over tariffs on Canadian lumber and U.S. milk and President Donald Trump's desire to renegotiate or even abandon the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Trump, who did not weigh in on the dispute personally, took his ""America First"" message to the world's elite on Friday, telling a summit that the United States would ""no longer turn a blind eye"" to what he described as unfair trade practices.
The ITC commissioners voted 4-0 that Bombardier's prices did not harm Boeing and discarded a U.S. Commerce Department recommendation to slap a near 300 percent duty on sales of the company's 110-to-130-seat CSeries jets for five years. It did not give a reason immediately.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement that the commission's finding ""shows how robust our system of checks and balances is.""
Boeing's shares closed flat.
""It's reassuring to see that facts and evidence matter,"" said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ""This part of the trade policy process works unimpeded despite President Trump's protectionist rhetoric.""
The decision will also help Bombardier sell the CSeries in the United States by removing ""a huge amount of uncertainty,"" at a time when its Brazilian rival Embraer is bringing its new E190-E2 jet to market, a source familiar with the Canadian plane and train maker's thinking said.
The ITC had been expected to side with Chicago-based Boeing. The company alleged it was forced to discount its 737 narrow-bodies to compete with Bombardier, which it said used government subsidies to dump the CSeries during the 2016 sale of 75 jets at ""absurdly low"" prices to Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL).
Bombardier called the trade case self-serving after Boeing revealed on Dec. 21 that it was discussing a ""potential combination"" with Embraer. Boeing denied the trade case was motivated by those talks.
BOEING TO CONSIDER ITS OPTIONS
The dispute may not be over.
""This can still be appealed by Boeing,"" Andrew Leslie, parliamentary secretary to Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, told reporters in Montreal.
Boeing said it would not consider such options before seeing the ITC’s reasoning in February.
But Boeing said it was disappointed the commission did not recognize ""the harm that Boeing has suffered from the billions of dollars in illegal government subsidies that the Department of Commerce found Bombardier received and used to dump aircraft in the U.S. small single-aisle airplane market.""
Bombardier, Delta and the U.S. consumer advocacy group Travelers United all called the ITC decision a victory for consumers and airlines.
The decision may end up helping Trump's goal of boosting U.S. jobs as the CSeries jets for U.S. airlines will be built in the United States rather than Canada. 
Through a venture with European planemaker Airbus SE, which has agreed to take a majority stake in the CSeries this year, Bombardier plans to assemble CSeries jets in Alabama to be sold to U.S. carriers starting in 2019.
Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders promised to push ahead ""full throttle"" with the Alabama plans. “Nothing is sweeter than a surprise, a surprise victory,” he said. 
The case had sparked trade tensions between the United States and its allies Canada and the UK. Ottawa last year scrapped plans to buy 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from Boeing.
The well-paid jobs associated with the CSeries are important both to Ottawa and the British government. Bombardier employs about 4,000 workers in Northern Ireland.
The British prime minister's office said it welcomed the decision, ""which is good news"" for the British industry, while Canada's innovation minister said the ITC came to the ""right decision"" on Bombardier.

The verdict in the lawsuit by Robert Nolte was the third to date in federal court in litigation over AndroGel, a drug approved for men whose bodies produce low or no testosterone that has become the subject of lawsuits by thousands of people.
""Our trial team did an excellent job with a very complicated case,"" Christopher Seeger, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in federal litigation, said on Friday. ""We look forward to the next trial and holding AbbVie accountable for putting profits before safety.""
Chicago-based AbbVie did not respond to a request for comment.
AbbVie says it faces 4,510 cases nationally over injuries blamed on AndroGel. The verdict came in one of a series of test trials in federal litigation over AndroGel aimed at helping both sides gauge the range of damages and define settlement options.
A federal jury in July awarded an Oregon man $150 million in punitive damages but awarded him no compensatory damages. A federal judge in December tossed the award and ordered a new trial.
A second jury in October ordered AbbVie to pay $140 million in punitive damages and $140,000 in compensatory damages in the case of a Tennessee man who claimed the drug caused him to suffer a heart attack. AbbVie is challenging that verdict.
The latest trial stemmed from a lawsuit filed in 2014 by Nolte, who suffered an embolism two months after he began using AndroGel, which he was prescribed for the off-label use of treating a drop in testosterone levels, according to court papers.
Nolte said AbbVie fraudulently misrepresented the drug's risk and misled patients by marketing AndroGel on television for off-label use.

AbbVie has said that its marketing of AndroGel adhered strictly to uses approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and that it was in full compliance with applicable standards.

According to the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the defendants, who may be foreign traders, made ""highly suspicious, timely, and lucrative purchases and sales of options on Bioverativ stock,"" generating profits of about $4.9 million. 
The SEC said the options purchase orders originated through a foreign brokerage firm located in Zurich in the name of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) (Switzerland) Ltd and were cleared through Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, which executed the orders through a domestic options exchange.
Bioverativ agreed to be acquired by Sanofi for $105 a share, which represented a premium of 64 percent over Bioverativ's closing share price on the last trading day ahead of the announcement. Its shares closed up 61.9 percent on Jan. 22, the day the deal with Sanofi was announced, the lawsuit noted.

The SEC said it seeks an order to freeze the assets of the traders, require the identification of the defendants and the repatriation of assets. The SEC in the lawsuit also said it is also seeking disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains.

1192,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 05:50PM ET</span>",California looks to ramp up electric vehicle sales,"By David Shepardson
(Reuters) - California said on Friday it would ramp up efforts to boost electric vehicles even as it holds talks with the Trump administration over the fate of fuel efficiency standards through 2025.
California Governor Jerry Brown signed an executive order ""to curb carbon pollution from cars and trucks and boost the number of zero-emission vehicles driven in California.""
Brown set a new target of 5 million zero-emission vehicles in California by 2030, up from a prior target of 1.5 million by 2025.
Brown wants the state to spend $2.5 billion over eight years to add 250,000 vehicle charging stations and 200 hydrogen fueling stations by 2025. Automakers have announced plans to spend tens of billions of dollars to add dozens of new EV models.
The push comes as the Trump administration is considering rolling back the 2022-2025 fuel efficiency standards.
Officials from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and administration held a new round of talks earlier this week to discuss the vehicle requirements.
CARB chair Mary Nichols told reporters on Friday on a conference call the administration has not made any specific proposals to reduce requirements.
Nichols said there's been a ""general conversation about the Trump administration's desire to do something"" to indicate sympathy with automakers who say they have problems meeting the standards.
CARB does not believe standards should be lowered but is willing to discuss modifications if warranted. ""Absent any such evidence, we will certainly resist any changes,"" Nichols said. 
Environmental Protection Agency air office chief Bill Wehrum said Thursday the goal of the California meetings was to keep national standards. ""What we're talking about is whether adjustments need to be made,"" Wehrum said. ""We want to stay aligned with California.""
California, joined by nearly a dozen other states, could seek to enforce existing emissions rules, even if the Trump administration softens the federal 2022-2025 requirements.
Automakers want the White House and California to reach agreement because a legal battle over the rules could result in lengthy uncertainly for the industry. They want changes to address lower gasoline prices and a shift in U.S. consumer preferences to larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles.

A group representing General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), Toyota Motor Corp and other automakers has encouraged more talks in hopes an agreement is reached.

1193,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 05:50PM ET</span>","Och-Ziff hedge fund rebounds but succession, other issues linger","By Lawrence Delevingne
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC rode bets on Asian stocks and U.S. corporate mergers to strong returns in 2017 - its best showing in years - but remained challenged by succession planning, declining assets and a stagnant stock price. 
Its flagship hedge fund, the OZ Master Fund Ltd, gained an estimated 10.4 percent net of fees in 2017, according to a letter sent to investors this week seen by Reuters. That was better than its historical average of 8.86 percent, its highest return since 2013, and above the benchmark HFRI asset-weighted composite gain of 6.52 percent.
The performance, according to the letter, was driven by Asian shares such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Inc, JD.com Inc and Nintendo Co (T:7974), and mergers and acquisitions like pharmaceuticals business Actelion Ltd, which was bought by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in June, and Aetna (NYSE:AET) Inc's proposed merger with CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS). 
The New York hedge fund firm, which goes by ""Oz Management,"" also made money on U.S. corporate and structured credit and lost on U.S. stocks and convertible and derivative arbitrage, the letter said.
A spokesman for Oz declined to comment. 
The strong performance comes amid a stalled succession plan for Daniel Och, the firm's billionaire founder and chief executive officer. 
Oz sent a letter to investors on Dec. 23 saying that it was ""not the right time"" to promote co-Chief Investment Officer James ""Jimmy"" Levin to CEO. It added that Och and the firm's board of directors hoped that the 34-year-old Levin, Och's longtime protégé and heir apparent, would remain as co-CIO. David Windreich is the other co-CIO.
The December letter was previously reported by the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg. The Oz communication to clients this week added that ""we hope to come back to you in the near future to present the (succession) plan.""
Och, through a spokesman, and Levin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
One of the few publicly traded hedge fund managers, Oz's stock price and assets have also not rebounded alongside its performance. 
Shares have languished around $4 or below since early 2016 and fell to $2.37 on Friday from around $3.20 a year ago. The issue is not new: Oz went public in November 2007 at $32 a share. 
The firm managed $31.9 billion as of Jan. 1, according to the new letter, down from $47.5 billion at the end of 2014 and $37.9 billion at the end of 2016, according to public filings.

Euphoria in US Stocks Continues as Strong Earnings Extend Bull Run 
US stocks rounded off the week with an all-time high close as investors continued to bet that corporates would beat earnings and revenue estimates.
Of the S&P 500 companies that have reported as of Friday, roughly 80% reported-better-than-estimated earnings, while 82 percent have surpassed revenue estimates, according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) set the pace for earnings this week after posting earnings and revenue above consensus, while subscription growth also beat Wall Street estimates.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was one of the standout performers on Friday, closing more than 10% higher after reporting earnings Thursday after close, that beat on both the top and bottom lines.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, NASDAQ Composite and S&P 500 closed at record highs on Friday.
WTI Crude Closed at Highest Since December 2014
Crude prices closed at more than two-year highs on Friday shrugging off an increase in the number of US oil rigs to the highest since Sept. 1 as a weaker dollar, and ongoing OPEC-led output cuts continued to dominate sentiment.
US production, however, crept higher as the Energy Information Energy reported Wednesday domestic crude production rose to nearly 9.9 million barrels a day last week.
Crude oil futures settled at $66.14 a barrel, up 63 cents.
Trump, Mnuchin Send Dollar on Rollercoaster Ride
The dollar suffered its sixth-weekly loss in a row against its rivals after President Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appeared to be odds somewhat over the outlook on the dollar.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin earlier this week said: “Obviously a weaker dollar is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities."" That invited significant selling pressure in the dollar as it retreated further below three-year lows.
Yet, it wasn’t long until the greenback paired some those losses after President Trump said that the dollar ""will get stronger,"" insisting that Mnuchin’s comments were “taken out of the context.”
Mnuchin, speaking to Yahoo Finance, clarified the uncertainty surrounding his outlook on the dollar as he said:
“Well, I think you know, people have misinterpreted some of my comments about the dollar this week.” “I was very clear I’m not making comments about where the dollar is in the short term.""
Draghi Failed To Curb Euro Bulls; Sterling Soared
EUR/USD notched its sixth-straight weekly win, rising further above four-year highs despite European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi’s efforts to curb expectations that the central bank is poised to announce plans to unwind its massive stimulus programme.
GBP/USD added to last week’s gains, rising above $1.41, as traders cheered signs of an improving UK economy after GDP growth topped forecasts, while wages grew above forecasts in December, stoking expectations for a faster pace of inflation.
Investors Abandon the ‘Hodl’ as Fear Uncertainty and Doubt Grew
Bitcoin fell for the third-straight week as traders struggled to shake off the looming threat of regulation, while reports that one of Japan’s largest exchanges, Coincheck, was hacked did little to allay fears.
“All withdrawals from the coincheck platform are currently restricted, including yen,” Coincheck wrote in a blog post.
That sent shockwaves throughout the industry as Japan – widely thought of as the safe-haven for cryptocurrencies – accounts for 40% of global bitcoin transactions. Cryptocurrency traders appeared to abandon the “hodl” – hold on for dear life – as billions were wiped off the market.
The total cryptocurrency market cap fell to $474 billion below $478 billion – the level last seen following the so-called crypto-bloodbath on Jan. 16.
Stellar's lumens (XLM), however, continued to add to gains and surpassed Litecoin as the sixth largest coin by market cap amid signs of growing interest in XLM.
""We may add support for Stellar (to which we provided seed funding) if substantive use continues to grow,"" said Stripe product manager Tom Karlo in a blog post."

For the first time in more than a decade, an index that tracks American depositary receipts of Chinese companies surpassed its previous record, helped by a stronger currency. It capped a 12-month, 50 percent surge that left the Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) index at 696.21, exceeding the prior top of 693.53 set on Oct. 31, 2007.
Sound like a big gain? Not hardly. Eleven years ago, Chinese ADRs had jumped almost 500 percent in five years -- and 48 percent in just the prior two months. The nausea-inducing ride came to an abrupt end when then-Premier Wen Jiabao put on hold plans to let mainland investors buy Hong Kong stocks. As worries of a global economic slowdown began to spread, the ADR index lost 70 percent of its value in the next year.
A host of factors have supported the gains, said Ilya Feygin, senior strategist at WallachBeth Capital. Chinese banks have plenty of liquidity and are getting upgrades by U.S. brokers. In addition, capital outflows are less of a problem and Chinese economic data so far this year have proved to be stronger than expected.
So if you’re worried about a bubble, go right ahead. But at least mainland investors can now buy Hong Kong stocks. That rule change came about in 2014 -- a full seven years after people were expecting it to happen.

(Reuters) - Dan Loeb's activist hedge fund Third Point LLC is taking a position in Pinnacle Foods Inc (N:PF) and is seeking a meeting with the U.S. packaged food company, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Pinnacle Foods, the maker of packaged foods such as Vlasic pickles, explored a sale last May to Reddi-wip whipped cream owner Conagra Brands Inc (N:CAG), but their talks never advanced, Reuters reported at the time.
Since then Pinnacle's shares have changed little, while the S&P 500 Index has risen close to 20 percent.

Pinnacle and Third Point did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Pinnacle shares ended trading up 4 percent on the news at $61.65, giving the company a market capitalization of around $7 billion.
Parsippany, New Jersey-based Pinnacle, whose brands include Duncan Hines baking products and Birds Eye frozen vegetables, has made a push toward healthier offerings, which are faster-growing and generate higher profit margins.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The latest round of strong earnings reports, including from Intel and AbbVie, along with continued weakness in the dollar lifted each of the major Wall Street indexes to closing records on Friday. 
The three main indexes notched their best four-week run since 2016.
Intel's (O:INTC) shares surged as high as $50.15, their highest level since October 2000, and closed up 10.55 percent at $50.08 after results indicated that the chipmaker's shift to higher-margin data-center business was working.
AbbVie's (N:ABBV) shares jumped 13.77 percent after the drugmaker significantly boosted its 2018 earnings forecast with help from U.S. tax reform and said it hopes to accelerate dividend growth and share buybacks.
""We continue to see these positive steps in the right direction and definitely earnings are clearly justifying a lot of the recent move that we’ve had,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Fourth-quarter earnings growth for the S&P 500 is now estimated at 13.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data, up from 12 percent at the start of the year. Of the 133 companies in the index that have reported through Friday, 79.7 percent have topped expectations.
The earnings enabled investors to shrug off a reading on economic growth that came in below expectations. 
Gross domestic product increased at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said in its advance GDP report, below the 3-percent forecast, as the strongest pace of consumer spending in three years resulted in a surge in imports.
""You have manufacturing and the consumer doing well at the same time and the globe is doing better, so that's a path for future GDP gains, which has always provided a fertile backdrop for earnings gains,"" said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management in Milwaukee. 
Weakness in the dollar, which is supportive for large multinational companies, continued. The greenback was down 0.34 percent against a basket of major currencies. 
The dollar was on track for its worst week since May after comments from senior U.S. officials this week backing a weak currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 223.92 points, or 0.85 percent, to 26,616.71, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 33.62 points, or 1.18 percent, to 2,872.87 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 94.61 points, or 1.28 percent, to 7,505.77.
For the week, the Dow rose 2.08 percent, the S&P 500 gained 2.22 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 2.31 percent. 
Buoyed by AbbVie, the S&P healthcare index (SPXHC) gained 2.17 percent, scored its best day since November 2016 and was the best performer among the 11 major S&P sectors.
Also lifting the index were gains in  Pfizer  (N:PFE), up 4.78 percent after a European regulator recommended granting marketing approval to a diabetes drug developed by the company and Merck (N:MRK), up 1.21 percent.
Starbucks (O:SBUX) dropped 4.23 percent after it warned 2018 global cafe sales growth would be at the low end of its forecast. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.54-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 125 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 178 new highs and 22 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.58 billion shares, compared to the 6.81 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

1208,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>","U.S. stocks, VIX dance in tandem in break with history","By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A rising U.S. stock market normally reduces fear among investors, but the blistering pace of the current rally has instead also driven up the anxiety factor in the market.
The S&P 500 Index and the Cboe Volatility Index, which is the main gauge for measuring investor fears that benchmark stocks will drop in the near term, have moved in rare tandem form.
On nine separate occasions this month, the VIX has matched the direction taken by the S&P 500 on a given day. That marks the most times these two measures have moved concurrently in the same direction in all but two months over the last five years.
The VIX is derived from the price of S&P 500 options. When stocks fall, investors rush to buy protection and drive up the level of the VIX. Not so this year.
Even though the S&P 500 has risen 4.7 percent over the last three weeks, the VIX has gained more that 2 points.
""Even though the SPX has gone up, because it has gone up in such a parabolic fashion the VIX has gone up as well,"" said Stephen Aniston, president of investment adviser Black Peak Capital, in Connecticut.
In recent months, U.S. stocks have steadily climbed, taking benchmark indexes to new highs, with nary a sign of volatility. This led some investors to sell S&P 500 call options, on the belief that the rally would lose steam.
By selling an index call the seller takes on the obligation to sell the value of the underlying index at a fixed price in the future.
Stocks' rapid 'melt-up' this year has left these call sellers in a weak spot and they have been forced to buy calls to cover their short position, analysts said. This buying of S&P 500 calls tends to boost the VIX even as the market rallies, analysts said.
""The balance of S&P 500 options demand has moved from puts to calls,"" said Matt Thompson, co-head of the Volatility Group at Typhon Capital LLC, in Chicago.
For the first four weeks of the year, the average daily trading volume in S&P 500 call options has jumped by 44 percent, compared with a similar period last year, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert. Puts have seen a 32 percent increase.
To be sure, some of the call buying may be simply due to investors looking to profit from gains for stocks, Thompson said.
While the VIX's recent behavior is unusual it does not have any great implications for future stock returns, analysts said.

""At some point, the market stops rallying so hard, and eventually volatility settles in after ‘overcorrecting’ to the upside,"" Pravit Chintawongvanich, head of derivatives strategy at Macro Risk Advisors said in a note.

1216,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. gunmaker Remington turns to debt restructuring advisors - sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Andrew Berlin
(Reuters) - Remington Outdoor Company Inc, one of the largest U.S. makers of firearms, is working with investment bank  Lazard Ltd  (N:LAZ) on options to restructure its $950 million debt pile, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Privately held Remington has faced doubts about its ability to refinance its debt next year amid sluggish sales. It was abandoned by some of its investors after one of its Bushmaster rifles was used in the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in Connecticut in 2012 that killed 20 children and six adults. 
""We are very concerned that Remington will be unable to refinance debt that comes due in April 2019 given its weak operating performance and high financial leverage,"" Kevin Cassidy, a Moody's Investors Service Inc analyst, wrote in a research note last month.
Remington is working with Lazard to examine a range of options to boost its finances, and there is no certainty about which course of action the company will choose, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
Remington did not respond to a request for comment, while its private equity owner, Cerberus Capital Management LP, and Lazard declined to comment.
After the shooting, Cerberus tried unsuccessfully to sell Remington, then known as Freedom Group, after coming under pressure from some of its private equity fund investors. 
Cerberus Chief Executive Stephen Feinberg also considered a bid for Remington to stoke interest in the gunmaker from other potential acquirers, Reuters reported in 2012. In 2015, Cerberus offered a mechanism to its fund investors that wanted to drop Remington, such as the California State Teachers' Retirement System, to sell their stakes back to the company.
The families of the victims at Sandy Hook also sued Remington. That case is ongoing. 
Remington's capital structure is currently unsustainable given its weak operating performance, significant volatility in the demand for firearms and ammunition, and high debt load, according to Moody's.
The armsmaker's sales have declined in part because of receding fears that guns will become more heavily regulated by the U.S. government, according to credit ratings agencies. President Donald Trump has said he will ""never, ever infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms.""
Since Trump's election victory in November 2016, American Outdoor Brands Corp (O:AOBC) has lost over half of its stock market value, while Sturm Ruger & Company Inc (N:RGR) has fallen 15 percent. By comparison, the S&P 500 has increased by a third in the same period.
The Madison, North Carolina-based gun manufacturer faces a maturity of an approximately $550 million term loan in 2019. Remington also has $250 million of bonds that come due in 2020, and are trading at a significant discount to their face value at 22 cents on the dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data, indicating investor concerns about repayment. 
The term loan maturing next year is also trading at a significant discount to full value, at around 55 cents on the dollar, the sources said.
Potential reputational risk associated with owning Remington could also complicate the company's negotiations with its creditors, because in a debt restructuring companies often offer equity as an incentive for debt forgiveness, the sources said. Remington's creditors include Franklin Templeton Investments, according to regulatory filings from late last year. They did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Remington's sales plunged 27 percent in the first nine months of 2017, resulting in a $28 million operating loss.

Colt's Manufacturing Co LLC, a competitor of Remington, emerged from bankruptcy in 2016 following falling sales of its sports rifles and the loss of military contracts.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former macro hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz is one of several investors in VideoCoin, a startup eyeing a $50 million digital currency offering in a few months to take advantage of the growing appetite for cryptocurrencies, VideoCoin Chief Executive Halsey Minor said in an interview.
A recent $5 million initial funding round also attracted investors such as Distributed Network Advisors, a firm whose partner includes venture capitalist Brock Pierce; and Alphabit, a global fund that invests in digital currencies, Minor told Reuters last week.
Novogratz, formerly of Fortress Investment Group and who runs Galaxy Investment Partners, said in a statement on Thursday the project had all the elements he looks for in an investment. ""We are convinced VideoCoin will revolutionize the video streaming industry.""
Pierce and Alphabit were not immediately available for comment.
""You get all these guys in early, and the rest comes along,"" said Minor, a technology entrepreneur who in 1994 co-founded CNET, a U.S. media website on technology and consumer electronics that CBS bought for around $1.8 billion in 2008.
Digital currencies such as bitcoin have emerged as a new asset class over the last two years as its underlying technology called the blockchain, an online database, has gained worldwide acceptance from corporations and financial institutions.
Bitcoin (BTC=BTSP), which is traded on exchanges, soared more than 1,700 percent last year to a record high, raising fears that the volatile emerging asset poses a risk to investors and the global financial system.
VideoCoin's new token may be used by software developers and other users to pay for cloud-based video services on its network, such as encoding, storage, distribution, or rentals, Minor said.

""The internet is now about 80 percent video. It's growing at 25 percent per annum. Costs for entertainment media companies are exploding and they have no ability to monetize this.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) has spent over $400 million on a range of acquisitions in recent weeks, from solar power to electric car charging points, cranking up its drive to expand beyond its oil and gas business and reduce its carbon footprint.
The scale of the buying spree pales in comparison to the Anglo-Dutch company's $25 billion annual spending budget. But its first forays into the solar and retail power sectors for many years shows a growing urgency to develop cleaner energy businesses.
The investments are not limited to renewables such as biofuels, solar and wind. Shell, as well as rivals such as  BP  (LON:BP),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), are betting on rising demand for gas, the least polluting fossil fuel, to power the expected surge in electric vehicles in the coming decades.
To that end, Shell agreed in December to acquire independent British power provider First Utility for around $200 million, according to several sources close to the deal. The value of the acquisition had not been previously disclosed.
Shell declined to comment.
With First Utility, the company hopes to find an outlet for its gas supplies via the retail power market, betting on rising demand as drivers charge electric vehicles at home.
Earlier this month, the company ventured back into solar after a 12-year hiatus when buying a 43.86 percent stake in Silicon Ranch Corporation for $217 million.
In the last three months of 2017, Shell also invested in two projects to develop charging stations for electric vehicles across Europe's highways. It has also signed agreements to buy solar power in Britain and develop renewables power grids in Asia and Africa.
According to analysts at Bernstein, Big Oil has invested over $3 billion on renewables acquisitions over the past five years, most of which went towards solar.
""Green"" merger and acquisition (M&A) activity today averages 13 percent of total energy M&A activity, they said.
""However greater scale is needed for the majors to effectively operate and leverage their trading skills in this market, necessitating more M&A,"" they said in a note.
Other companies have also made investments.
BP got back into solar power with a $200 million investment in solar generator Lightsource late last year, six years after exiting the sector with a large writedown.
Total bought battery maker Saft for $1 billion in 2016.

1228,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 12:36PM ET</span>",Intel shares hit dotcom-era highs after bumper results,"By Supantha Mukherjee and Sonam Rai
(Reuters) - Intel Corp's (O:INTC) shares rose 7 percent on Friday to their highest in almost two decades, after strong results offered the clearest sign yet that its years-long effort to shift away from a slowing PC business was paying off.
Shares of the company were trading at $48.50 on Friday, adding nearly $15 billion to its market value and hitting highs last seen in September 2000 during the dotcom boom.
Investors were also comforted by Intel's assurances that it does not expect any material impact from the recent disclosure of security flaws Spectre and Meltdown in billions of its chips.
The Santa Clara-based company helped found the personal computer industry and became one of the world's biggest chipmaker on the back of growing demand for PCs. But, in the last few years, falling PC demand has pushed Intel to focus on making chips for data centers to offset revenue loss.
Revenue from the company's higher-margin data center business jumped about 20 percent to $5.58 billion.
""Intel is successfully navigating the transition from a PC-centric to data-centric company – specifically, Intel's data-centric businesses now comprise about 47 percent of revenue,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst John Pitzer said.
Pitzer upgraded the stock to ""outperform"" from ""neutral.""
The business is showing no signs of slowing down - Intel forecast its data centric unit to grow mid-teens and PC centric business in the low single digits this year, projecting overall revenue growth of 4 percent to $65 billion.
""While we believe near term PC unit declines have been impacted by a lengthening in the PC refresh cycle, we view this lengthening as slowing over time, lessening the deleterious impact on overall company growth,"" Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland said.
Analysts said Intel will benefit this year from higher demand for gaming computers, memory chip ramp and increased modem sales to Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) iPhones.
Modem sales increased 26 percent year-over-year, which we attribute largely to the iPhone refresh, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer said.
Intel has been increasingly displacing Qualcomm (O:QCOM) as Apple's key modem supplier after its relationship with the iPhone maker soured last year over chip prices.
At least 12 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock. Their median price target was $52.
Of the 39 brokerages covering the stock, 23 rate it as ""buy"" or higher, 11 ""hold"" and five ""sell"" or lower.
The stock has gained 20 percent in the last 12 months, compared with a 40 percent gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX).

1233,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 12:29PM ET</span>","BNP Paribas unit pleads guilty in U.S. to currency rigging, fined $90 mln","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A unit of  BNP Paribas  SA (PA:BNPP) agreed to plead guilty and pay a $90 million criminal fine for rigging foreign currency prices, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Friday.
BNP Paribas USA admitted to having conspired to suppress competition by fixing prices for Central and Eastern European, Middle Eastern and African currencies from September 2011 to July 2013, violating U.S. antitrust law.
The Justice Department said the conspiracy involved price manipulation on an electronic trading platform through the creation of bogus trades, coordinated trading, and agreements on what prices to quote to specific customers, among other means.
""BNP Paribas USA deeply regrets the past misconduct that led to this settlement, which was a clear breach of the high standards on which it operates,"" the French bank said in a statement.
The settlement also resolves probes by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the New York State Department of Financial Services, BNP Paribas said.
BNP Paribas is the sixth major bank to admit criminal wrongdoing in the Justice Department's currency probe.
 Barclays  Plc (L:BARC),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (L:RBS) and UBS Group AG (S:UBSG) have also entered guilty pleas, the Justice Department said. The six banks have collectively been fined more than $2.8 billion.
The Justice Department said BNP Paribas will not be put on probation, given its ""substantial"" efforts to improve oversight and avoid a recurrence.
It also said the bank agreed to cooperate with the probe by the department's antitrust division.
""The division's investigation aims to root out and eradicate the manipulation that has plagued this industry,"" Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said in a statement.
BNP Paribas' plea followed the Jan. 4, 2017 guilty plea of a former trader, Jason Katz, for conspiring to fix currency prices.
Katz, who also worked at Barclays, was the first person to admit guilt in the probe, and is scheduled to be sentenced on July 5, court records show.
Four other traders have also been criminally charged, and one of them has pleaded guilty, the Justice Department said.

Another French bank,  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), in November said it was in talks with U.S. authorities to resolve a probe into the alleged manipulation of benchmark interest rates such as the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor.

1234,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 12:21PM ET</span>",Starbucks' 2018 may not be as bitter as some fear: analysts,"By Vibhuti Sharma and Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) shares fell 5 percent on Friday after the company reported weak holiday-quarter sales, indicating near-term troubles were far from over, but analysts said the brand's strength and a growing Chinese fanbase would help it ride out the rough patch.
Over the past year, the world's largest coffee chain has hit a few bumps as it tries to boost sales - the rollout of mobile ordering that was supposed to attract more customers is still facing issues and it struggles to fill stores in the afternoons and evenings.
On top of that, weak limited-time offers and holiday-themed coffees did not resonate with customers, hurting sales during its biggest sales quarter. 
""Subpar 1st quarter top-line results, but we ask if this is a 'broken story' or just a great brand with huge moats and large growth opportunities rolling through a rough patch,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst John Glass said in a note.
""We'd argue the latter, but acknowledge a year into the comp deceleration, its show-me time,"" said Glass, and added that ""Starbucks is the retailer with the highest customer frequency of any category we can think of.""
Some analysts said the company had made inroads solving its problems.
Starbucks has been adding working hours at some U.S. stores and is focusing on workflow, adding one or two more baristas to service orders during peak hours. It is also testing sending text messages to customers when their orders are ready. 
The company is also doubling down in the Chinese market - where the cafe culture is taking off - to offset stagnant sales in the United States. China same-store sales were up 6 percent and Starbucks said it is planning to more than triple its over 3,000-store network in the country within a decade.
It recently opened a massive, showcase Reserve Roastery in Shanghai.
""Our U.S. Starbucks stores, on average, do about $32,000 a week. The Roastery in Shanghai after 8 weeks of operations is doing, on average, twice that, not each week but each day,"" Howard Schultz, the company's executive chairman said on a conference call on Thursday.
Schultz stepped down as chief executive last year to focus on Starbucks' premium business and the pressure is mounting on his successor Kevin Johnson to boost growth.

Sales at established Americas region cafes in the quarter to Dec. 31 were up just 2 percent, falling short of Street estimates of a 3.3 percent rise.

1245,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 11:17AM ET</span>",Honeywell to repatriate $7 billion over two years,"By Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - U.S. industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc (N:HON) said on Friday that it expected to bring back at least $7 billion of the $10 billion in cash held overseas in the next two years, taking advantage of the newly enacted tax law. 
Shares of Honeywell, which makes everything from jet engines to thermostats, rose as much as 1.2 percent in morning trading to hit a record of $163.85.
The cash hoard will help fuel Honeywell's M&A strategy under new Chief Executive Darius Adamczyk, who is looking to bolster its core operations such as aerospace following the spin off its home and transportation businesses later this year.
""Our preference is for attractive bolt-on acquisitions,"" said Chief Financial Officer Tom Szlosek, who also promised ""competitive"" dividend and share buybacks using the repatriated cash.
Although the company reported a huge loss due to a $3.8 billion tax provision in the fourth quarter, its adjusted profit narrowly beat analysts' estimates due to strength across all of its divisions.
Honeywell also raised its 2018 earnings forecast and said it was seeing a greater level of confidence from its customers, who may now have more cash on hand to spend due to the new tax law.
""Their capex is our revenue, and we do expect some level of investment to accelerate (later in 2018),"" Adamczyk said on a conference call. 
Sales in its aerospace unit, its biggest business that makes aircraft engines for  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb),  Textron Inc  (N:TXT) and General Dynamics Corp (N:GD), rose 6.4 percent to $3.90 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31.
Much of the growth in the business was driven by its commercial aviation aftermarket division as a rise in travel demand boosted sales of spare parts and services to the airline industry.
Honeywell is also benefiting from increased demand from oil and gas customers in the wake of stabilizing oil prices, while its business that makes supply chain and warehouse automation equipment and software is riding an ecommerce boom.
Excluding the tax-related charge, Honeywell earned $1.85 per share, compared with analysts' expectations of $1.84, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Revenue rose 8.6 percent to $10.84 billion, topping estimates of $10.75 billion.
The company raised its 2018 per-share earnings forecast range to $7.75 to $8.00 from $7.55 to $7.80 estimated previously.
It is conservatively using the higher end of the 22-23 percent tax rate for the updated forecast, suggesting healthy upside, RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray said.

Up to Thursday's close, Honeywell's stock had risen 37.3 percent in the past 12 months, far outperforming a 23.5 percent increase in the S&P 500 index (SPX).

1248,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 11:00AM ET</span>",Global air finance titans ponder whether boom will ever end,"By Tim Hepher and Conor Humphries
DUBLIN (Reuters) - As the titans of the $140-billion a year aircraft financing industry gathered in Dublin this week to celebrate an unprecedented boom, a few were casting a cold eye on mistakes of the past - and whether they could happen again.
Ireland owes its dominance of global aircraft finance to the rise and spectacular collapse in 1992 of industry pioneer Guinness Peat Aviation (GPA), which demonstrated both the risks and returns possible from financing airplanes. 
The former GPA executives who now dominate the industry were debating which of the new players and investors that have flooded in the last five years might not have learned from those mistakes - and whether the industry had finally broken its cycle of spectacular booms and busts. 
The five-star venues that every year host the sector's showcase conferences were heaving with hundreds of new investors - many from China - who have poured in to a once-obscure industry as global investors engage in a desperate search for returns. 
Throngs of financiers spilled into the street from the 200-year-old Shelbourne Hotel during the Airline Economics conference, whose delegate list has tripled to 3,000 in five years. 
""Sentiment is as positive as I have seen it,"" Alec Burger the head of No. 2 lessor GECAS - formed from the hulk of GPA - told a packed second conference, Global Airfinance, where airline executives buoyed by surging air traffic eyed funds to expand their fleets. 
""This will be the fourth year of global airline profits above $30 billion and that is beyond unprecedented,"" Flight Ascend chief economist Peter Morris said.
PEAK OR PLATEAU?
Optimists insist the flood of Asian money - around 20 Chinese lessors have opened Dublin offices since the start of the decade - confirms the emergence of air finance as a worthy asset class in its own right.
Aengus Kelly, the former GPA employee who is now CEO of the world's largest lessor AerCap, said the number of banks and bond investors willing to lend to his firm has mushroomed from 50 to 500 in two decades. 
""Is it the case that all of them are in for the long haul? - Of course not. Have they come in looking for yield? - Of course they have,"" he said in an interview. ""But I do think on a structural basis the industry is well understood and people are starting to divorce it from airline cyclicality."" 
Domhnal Slattery, head of No. 3 firm Avolon, told delegates that those who thought the market must be peaking were ""cynics"" and that the cyclical peak was years away.
SIGNS OF INSTABILITY 
But the money has also caused returns to collapse in the industry's de facto spot market: buying planes from airlines and leasing them back, prompting many big players to abandon it.
Leasing giants say they are often left at the back of a queue of two dozen firms for such deals as new players accept tiny - some argue non-existent - returns. 
""My biggest concern over the past few years has been all the liquidity chasing these assets,"" Betsy Snyder, Standard & Poor's director, said. ""What happens if we get into a downturn?""
The risk for those prepared to wade too aggressively into this market is that rental fees don't cover the cost of paying debt on an over-valued jet, said market veteran Bill Cumberlidge of Aviation Partners. 
Yet as lease rates suffer, the value of aircraft rises as airlines find a queue of takers, even before they are delivered. That may have encouraged some airlines to order extra planes in the hope of flipping them into the sale-leaseback market.
If so, they could end up getting burned as markets turn against them, warned John Plueger, CEO of Air Lease.
As in other branches of global finance, some worry that while a tide of money moved in during an unprecedented phase of low interest rates, it could recede as quickly as rates rise. 
""I think interest rates are a real risk in the space generally,"" said Matthew Little, a partner at Castlelake, a private investment firm, adding leverage was also increasing.
The test will be whether this pressure topples an inexperienced few or shakes the wider industry. 
""There are a lot of new players and I am sure some of them will thrive and do very well and some of them won’t,"" said Peter Barrett, another GPA alumnus who runs No.4 lessor SMBC Aviation Capital. ""Time will tell who the winners and losers will be.""

1249,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 11:00AM ET</span>",U.S. regulators ready to ease check on property values: sources,"By Patrick Rucker
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. bank regulators plan to relax commercial real estate lending rules by allowing more deals to go ahead without an independent appraisal of the property's value, according to several sources familiar with the discussions.
The revised rules will be welcomed by banks that have long-argued that appraisals on small-dollar loans are costly and unnecessary, but consumer advocates have warned it could increase risks.
Under existing rules, commercial real estate worth more than $250,000 must have an independent third-party check on the property value before a bank can lend against it.
That threshold would double to $500,000 under reforms being drawn up by the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), according to industry and regulatory sources.
The new appraisal standards are expected to be released next month, the sources added. 
The current threshold was drawn up in 1994 and has not been revised since. Over the summer, regulators proposed increasing the waiver threshold in line with inflation to $400,000 but have since agreed to raise it to $500,000 after lenders and trade groups called for a larger exemption, the sources said.
The Mortgage Bankers Association argued in September that there is a shortage of appraisers in rural areas and new technology means that some in-person checks are outdated.
Consumer advocates, though, say that inflated property values worsened the 2007-2009 financial crash and that appraisals even on small value loans are essential.
""People have short memories,"" said Dennis Kelleher, president of pro-regulation think tank Better Markets. ""When you ease these standards, you invite a crisis.""
The Fed, OCC and FDIC declined to comment.
Regulators were due to consider a higher appraisal threshold in their routine review of existing laws. The industry hopes that President Donald Trump will keep his promise to relax more such financial rules.
The bank regulators are also discussing easing lending rules on rental developments which must currently satisfy the same appraisal standards as commercial real estate. 
One idea being discussed would exempt small, new-build rental developments from outside appraisals.
Banks are also pushing for regulators to loosen appraisal rules on home mortgage loans although this may require the blessing of other regulators, the sources said.

1250,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",Growing credit card conundrum fuels British bank concerns,"By Emma Rumney
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's banks are booking future credit card income long before it materializes, prompting concerns about the accounting practice among regulators, investors and analysts.
Riskier products such as credit cards have become more popular among banks in search of higher returns in recent years. In the first nine months of 2017, cards brought in 1.5 billion pounds ($2.1 billion) in income for  Barclays  (L:BARC) alone. 
But how banks account for interest earned on zero percent balance cards, which attract consumers with sometimes long initial interest-free periods, is worrying some. Britain's  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority warned that if banks are wrong about how customers will behave it could hit their capital.
For as competition has increased, so too has the length of interest-free periods on offer, with the longest available now 38 months, compared to 15 months ten years ago, data from price comparison website Moneyfacts showed. 
Banks start booking interest income immediately after issuing the card, even though some customers may not pay any for years and could switch banks at the end of the interest-free period, before rates which can be as high as 20 percent kick in.
Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) and Virgin Money (L:VM) have all offered such deals, while Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS), one of Britain's major lenders, does not.
""The issue with this is it's really, really subjective, because ultimately there are so many assumptions,"" a fund manager at a top ten investor in some of Britain's biggest banks told Reuters. 
""It's a challenge for us in terms of evaluating who is prudent and who is not,"" the fund manager added.
Under international accounting rules, banks predict how much income the card will earn in total, and then spread this out equally over the years they expect it to be active.
Forecasts are based on assumptions the banks set themselves, including how many customers they think will continue to use the cards after the interest-free period ends and for how long.
Interest income can also include upfront fees and interest charged on additional purchases.
UNCERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS
Credit card debt, which stood at 70 billion pounds as of November, has played a big part in rapid consumer debt growth of around 10 percent per year in Britain.
Some analysts and investors started questioning the banks with the most exposure to zero balance transfer cards last year. 
Virgin Money books the interest income for its cards at a rate of 6.8 percent per year, assuming that more than 40 percent of its customers will move to higher interest rates and use the card for a maximum of seven years in total. 
This compares to less than or about 5 percent per year at Barclays and Lloyds respectively. 
John Cronin, head of UK banks research at stockbrokers Goodbody, said Virgin Money's net interest margin - a key measure of profitability - could be hit if it turns out its assumptions are wrong. 
At Lloyds and Barclays, the effects would be smaller. 
Virgin Money says people use its cards for spending more often, which is why it books more interest income.
""It's a very significant portion of our book - high double digit percentages - using their card every day,"" its Chief Executive Jayne-Anne Gadhia told Reuters. 
VIRGIN THE MOST EXPOSED
While interest-free periods offered by banks have dropped back from a 43 month high in 2017, the fee charged for transferring debts onto a new card has now fallen to its lowest since 2006, Moneyfacts data shows. 
This means it is cheap and easy for creditworthy consumers to move their debts around to take advantage of the best deals, something the Financial Conduct Authority found to be common as long ago as 2014, when one in five people who acquired a new card had also made a balance transfer between 2012 and 2013. 
Barclays and Lloyds do not reveal the percentage of consumers they predict will switch. But in October last year Barclays, which declined comment, said it had booked 40 million pounds in unearned income.
Lloyds has recognized around 50 million pounds.
One source familiar with the matter said this was prudent, because the figure is small compared to its balance sheet and revenues. 
Virgin Money has around 124 million pounds in unearned income on its smaller balance sheet. But just 60 percent of credit card income booked in the first half of 2017 was actually earned. 
Gadhia said Virgin Money bases its assumptions about customer behavior on 15 years of data and pointed to FC research showing that borrowing on zero balance transfer cards is largely by people with high credit scores. 
But Cronin said these people are also those most likely to switch quickly before high rates kick in.

1251,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 10:47AM ET</span>","FedEx commits $3.2 billion to raise pay, expand hubs after U.S. tax overhaul","By Eric M. Johnson
(Reuters) - Package delivery company FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) said on Friday it will spend more than $3.2 billion on wage increases, bonuses, pension funding and capital investment, taking advantage of the U.S. tax overhaul signed into law in December. 
The Memphis, Tennessee-based company said it would invest $1.5 billion to significantly expand its hub in Indianapolis over the next seven years and modernize and enlarge its Memphis SuperHub. 
The new tax code allows companies to immediately write off the full value of capital costs, which helps make projects more financially attractive, but that benefit starts to phase out in 2023. It also permanently lowers the U.S. corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.
The announcement makes FedEx the latest U.S. company to promise higher pay for workers, citing the tax cuts. 
FedEx, which said the recent tax changes would likely boost economic growth and investment in the United States, also said it would contribute $1.5 billion to an employee pension plan.
The company plans more than $200 million in higher compensation, about two-thirds of which will go to hourly employees with the remainder funding increases in performance-based incentive plans for salaried workers. 

FedEx shares were down 0.3 percent in morning trading.

Since then, the bulls took over: Those assets climbed 78 percent and 19 percent respectively in the past two years. Now, Visser says, euphoria has run to the point where markets are poised for a sudden, sharp drop -- even though emerging-market stocks, in particular, remain attractive over the long haul.
""Today is the polar opposite,"" said Visser, chief investment officer at the $1.3 billion hedge fund Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers. ""Then, everybody was worried about too many things. Today, people don’t seem worried about anything.""
Visser is hardly the first to sound the alarm. Jeff Gundlach, chief investment officer at Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital LP, said developing-nation stocks probably face a temporary setback and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). has warned that records for global equities -- the MSCI Emerging Market Index is on its longest-ever streak without a 10 percent decline -- imply a greater risk for a retreat. The index gained for an 11th straight day today, hovering at the highest in a decade.
""The trigger point really has more to do with the lack of volatility we’ve had for a significant amount of time,"" Visser said. ""People think it’s very easy to make money right now.""
Like Gundlach and Goldman, he said a short correction, defined as a 10 percent swoon, doesn’t diminish an attractive backdrop for emerging markets.
""We’re very likely to have a significant correction, if for no other reason to cleanse the market,"" he said. ""But I think it will rally back extremely quickly.""
Developing nations have hit a ""transition point,"" leaving behind the industrial revolution for the digital age, Visser said. Technology companies now make up a greater weighting of the MSCI EM Index (29 percent) than the S&P 500’s 25 percent. In three years, Visser expects the market value of Chinese firms -- he particularly likes Internet companies -- to surpass the U.S. to become the world’s largest.
Ironically, U.S. President Donald Trump will probably speed that transition for emerging markets as his protectionist moves force nations from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to tackle difficult economic overhauls to reduce their dependence on industrial companies, he said. Visser also said concern about the potential dissolution of the North American Free Trade Agreement has made Mexico’s peso ""very undervalued."" He’s betting the currency and Mexico’s stocks will reverse recent losses.
Developing nations will benefit from holding back on overbuilding old technologies and higher adoption rates for new devices, Visser said. Demographics also favor emerging markets, because roughly three-fifths of the world’s population is in Asia. Low interest rates also bode well, he said.
""The story for emerging markets is one of outperformance,"" Visser said. ""In the next five to 10 years, it’s obvious that EM should be more of a play.""

1261,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: HSBC side-steps high-profile Qatar deals in Gulf gauntlet,"By Davide Barbuscia, Sudip Roy and Saeed Azhar
DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters/IFR) - A boycott of Qatar by its neighbors has prompted HSBC (L:HSBA) to turn down a leading role on Doha's new dollar bond as the bank treads a political tightrope in the Gulf, four banking sources familiar with the decision told Reuters. 
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt in June cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar, which they accuse of backing terrorism. The move initially hit Qatar's growth but by the end of 2017 its economy had largely recovered.
The Qatari government, which denies the allegations, is now planning its first international bond since the crisis began and has approached banks in recent weeks to arrange the deal. 
But HSBC, which has led almost every sovereign bond issue in the Gulf over the past two years, will not do so this time, reflecting a more cautious approach by banks in the region.
""This is not a problem of HSBC only, it's a problem of all international banks with a strong presence in the region. Each bank solves it in its own way,"" one of the sources said.
An HSBC spokesman said: ""We never comment on market rumor and speculation"", while a spokesman for the government of Qatar did not respond to a request for comment.
When Riyadh launched its boycott, it said it would seek understandings with international firms to cut ties with Doha. Banks from the four Arab countries have pulled deposits from Qatar and reduced, though not ended, other business with it.
While the Gulf allies have not publicly warned banks to avoid business in Qatar, bankers have told Reuters that it is clear close ties with Doha could hurt business relations.
The UAE central bank has blacklisted some Qatari individuals and organizations and told its own banks to apply enhanced due diligence in their dealings with six Qatari banks.
This has made many foreign banks more cautious and in some cases prompted them to handle Qatari business from Europe or the United States, rather than regional headquarters in Dubai.
When Qatar sold its last international bond in 2016, raising $9 billion, HSBC took a leading role alongside JP Morgan, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and Qatar National Bank.
Qatar is now close to choosing which banks will run its latest bond issue, which could be for around $9 billion, and has provisionally chosen some of them, bankers familiar with the process told Reuters.
Although HSBC decided not to undertake high-profile roles in major Qatari debt transactions after it was approached for the dollar bond in November, it is unclear whether the bank could still play a smaller part. Bankers said the move did not mean any disengagement from the country, where HSBC retains a branch.
However, in another indication of its new approach, HSBC has not pitched for a ""bookrunner"" role on a separate $3 billion loan refinancing by Qatar National Bank, the first such deal by a Qatari government-owned firm since the crisis began.
HSBC was one of the top banks in QNB's original loan and a banker close to the matter said the decision not to take a top role in the refinancing was a result of the political situation and a ""repositioning"" of its Qatar business.
COMPETING DEMANDS 
The Gulf's diplomatic rift is forcing banks to tread cautiously in order to maintain relations on both sides. Saudi Arabia is opening up to foreign investors as part of economic reforms pushed forward by its new crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, including the sale of a stake in oil giant Aramco.
Banks compete to obtain top roles in public bonds not so much for the fees they yield, but rather to establish or strengthen relationships with the borrowers in order to obtain more profitable mandates on future transactions.
Earlier this week Saudi Arabia said it had requested offers from banks to organize a range of its own international debt deals, including a bond and refinancing a $10 billion loan.
These plans have complicated matters for banks in the region as, depending on the timing, Saudi Arabia and Qatar could end up in direct competition for funds from international investors.
For HSBC, which was bookrunner last year on 42 bond deals in the Gulf Cooperation Council, which comprises Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and Kuwait, this could present a particularly tricky juggling act.

HSBC arranged $14.8 billion of bond issuance out of a total of $90.4 billion, the largest share of bond bookrunning for the GCC region in 2017, Thomson Reuters data shows.

Colgate said it expects sales growth in 2018 but the forecast did nothing to shake the impression of stagnation that has dogged Colgate and other consumer goods producers in the past year.
While the S&P 500 has risen more than 50 percent in the past year, Colgate shares are up less than 15 percent and it has missed sales estimates in five of the past six quarters.
Chief Executive Officer Ian Cook said the global market in the company's core dental-care business remained ""challenging"".
For 2018, Colgate said it expected mid-single-digit net sales growth and low- to mid-single-digit organic sales growth, along with double-digit earnings per share growth.
Sales rose 4.5 percent to $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, but analysts on average had expected sales of $3.92 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Net income fell to $323 million, or 37 cents per share, from $606 million, or 68 cents per share, largely due to a $275 million charge from changes to the U.S. tax code.
""Today's results once again show that Colgate remains vulnerable to macro uncertainty and operational challenges"",  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Bonnie Herzog said in a note.
Profit, excluding charges, was 75 cents per share, in line with analysts' estimates.
Colgate said its worldwide advertising spend rose 24 percent to $369 million in the fourth quarter. The company added that it planned to increase ad spends even further in 2018.

Those increased outlays have taken a toll on operating profit, which was down nearly 3 percent overall and in all of the company's global geographical segments with the exception of Europe.

The maker of compressors and underground mining equipment said operating profit rose to 6.23 billion Swedish crowns ($791 million) from 5.79 billion, falling short of the 6.51 billion expected by analysts in a Reuters poll.
Adjusted operating profit was up 13.5 percent to 6.64 billion, topping the 12.6 percent advance expected by analysts.
The Swedish firm, which is planning to spin-off its mining and civil engineering business under the name Epiroc this year, proposed an ordinary dividend of 7 crowns per share and an extra payout of 8 crowns through a mandatory share redemption.
Analysts had expected a dividend of 8.26 crowns, including some expectations for a special dividend.
Orders in the fourth quarter were up 14 percent year on year on an organic basis at 30.4 billion crowns, in line with the 30.3 billion forecast by analysts.
It said it expected overall demand for the group to remain at the ""current high level"".
The shares, up nearly 30 percent in the past 12 months, were down 4 percent at 1251 GMT. 
""A flat outlook indicates that things may have peaked given the extremely strong first quarter order intake last year, Handelsbanken Capital Markets analyst Peder Frolen said.
""I also think there were expectations for an even larger dividend payout out there, and those two things are weighing on the stock.""

Expectations were boosted ahead of Atlas Copco's results by forecast-beating results from mining equipment maker  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) on Thursday.

In a statement late on Friday, the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) said that overall risk in the banking sector was under control, but the situation remained ""grim and complicated"".
""Regulators must keep clear heads and cannot be blindly optimistic,"" it said. The statement followed the conclusion of CBRC's national banking supervision and management meeting, which outlines the year's key goals.
Among the regulator's top priorities is lowering corporate debt, while strictly controlling credit to highly indebted firms, it said.
CBRC also elevated cleaning-up financial holding companies and disposing of high-risk institutions, a move that could pave the way for the restructuring of some high-profile companies.
In an interview published last week in the official People's Daily, CBRC's chairman warned that ""a small number of criminals"" had used ""complex structures, fictitious investment and circular capital flows to illegally create large financial groups."" 
This had become a severe obstacle to advancing financial reforms, which must be strictly dealt with according to the law, he added.
The banking regulator has moved aggressively over the last year to cut the growth of shadow banking assets and the use of off-balance sheet business. 
Controlling financial sector risk was identified as a national priority at its Central Economic Work Conference in December. The country's financial regulators have made clear that supervision is only set to tighten.
The CBRC said other priorities for the year included curbing household leverage, and cracking down on the misappropriation of personal loans for stock market and real estate investment.

The regulator will also continue to shrink interbank investment and promote the transformation of the wealth management business, it said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Funds hoovered up a record $33.2 billion of stocks over the last week, analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said on Friday, but they warned a pullback in sky-high markets in the coming couple of months was now ""very likely"".
The rush included a record $2.1 billion into tech stocks, the second biggest week for emerging market shares at $8.1 billion, $7 billion into U.S. markets as well as $4.6 billion and $3.4 billion respectively into European and Japanese stocks.
A total of $21 billion of that money was poured into exchange traded funds. The boom also saw the value of assets held in the world's largest ETF - State Street's SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) - equal the annual GDP of Denmark at $300 billion.
""BofAML Global Wealth & Investment Management private client equity exposure (is) rising at fastest pace in 10 years and cash allocation is at record low (10 percent),"" BAML analysts said in a weekly note on capital flows.
They also highlighted that 98 percent of global equity markets are now trading above 50 and 200-day moving averages, though the pace of the melt-up meant a correction was now increasingly likely.
BAML's 'Bull & Bear' gauge, which takes the temperature of markets, is now flashing overheating warning signals at 7.9, just under the 8 level that BAML recommends selling.
It is the indicator's highest since March 2013. It has given 11 sell signals since 2002 with a 100 percent hit ratio, BAML said. Average equity peak-to-trough drops in the following 3 months after the signal have been 12 percent they added.
Further inflows into high yield and emerging market debt as well as equity funds would cement the sell signal. A ""tactical S&P500 pullback to 2686 points in Feb/Mar (is) now very likely,"" BAML's analysts said.
They also warned a reversal of the dollar's recent weakness could also spark a sharp correction. A U.S.-Europe FX spat was a trigger of the 1987 stock market crash they said. ""Higher dollar ""pain trade"" = risk-off coming.""

1283,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",BAML expects muted growth at ad agencies,"(Reuters) - Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) (BAML) has struck a bearish tone on global ad agencies, seeing three years of muted growth at companies such as WPP (L:WPP), Publicis (PA:PUBP) and Omnicom (N:OMC). 
Ad agencies have resorted to M&A and partnerships to try to fend off a growing threat from business consultancies and tech companies. 
In 2015, Publicis acquired U.S. digital ad firm Sapient to accelerate growth in Internet advertising. Its division Publicis.Sapient recently won a deal with  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) to assist the retailer on e-commerce challenges. 
Competition among the big four of WPP, Omnicom, Publicis and Interpublic (N:IPG) has become fierce as clients review the effectiveness of their marketing budgets.
""Marketing spending are secularly shifting from storytelling and creativity towards technology, customer experience, data-driven and business transformation,"" BAML analysts wrote in a note to clients. 
They reinstated coverage of the world's top ad companies with an ""underperform"" rating after what they said was an ""extensive discussion"" with experts across the advertising value chain. 
Shares in ad companies have taken a hit in the last year and have underperformed the overall market, which has been setting fresh records. WPP has lost about one-third of its value since the start of 2017.
WPP, the industry leader, has taken the biggest hit, with leading clients such as  Unilever  (L:ULVR), Nestle (S:NESN) and Procter & Gamble (N:PG) cutting spending as consumers turn to more niche brands.
In its most recent earnings conference call, P&G said it aimed to save another $400 million in agency and production costs, on top of the $750 million it had already saved. P&G did not give any time frame for the cost savings goal.
""We view this as a trend, not a one-off,"" BAML added, saying it expected the agencies' organic growth to flatten out by 2020.
The analysts believe consulting companies, such as Accenture (N:ACN), Deloitte or  IBM  (N:IBM) will start to have a ""bigger impact from 2018 onwards, leading ad agencies to lose market share to the consultancies."" 

""The lucrative media planning/buying space will start being disrupted by consultancies, helped by the rise of AI and their edge in data analytics.""

NEW YORK/TOKYO (Reuters) - Walmart has struck a partnership with e-commerce firm Rakuten Inc to launch an online grocery delivery service in Japan, its latest effort to forge an alliance with a popular homegrown chain to crack a competitive market.
The world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), said on Thursday the service will launch in the latter half of 2018.
Walmart's leadership is looking for new ways to grow its international business, which is no longer the growth engine it once was, as it has grappled with economic woes in Brazil and competition from discount retailers in Britain.
In Japan, the new service will replace Walmart's existing online grocery delivery offering and will be called ""Rakuten Seiyu Netsuper."" Seiyu GK is the name of Walmart's wholly-owned Japanese unit.
It will allow customers to place an order on Rakuten's online marketplace platform, which will then be fulfilled by the Walmart-Rakuten joint venture. Walmart-Rakuten will open a warehouse to service these orders in addition to using Seiyu stores, the companies said.
Fresh food delivery has been around in Japan for decades but has lagged the growth seen in other areas of e-commerce. Amazon is trialing its ""Fresh"" service in parts of Tokyo and retailers are trying to beef up their online grocery services.
Seven and i Holdings Co Ltd, operator of Japan's largest chain of convenience stores, last year announced it would cooperate on fresh food delivery with Askul Corp.
Rakuten CEO Hiroshi Mikitani told reporters in Tokyo he hoped the joint effort could lead to cooperation in other areas.
""We would like to have an alliance in a broader sense, not just in Japan but for our global businesses,"" he said.
Rakuten's overseas operations include the United States and Europe. And last month it announced it was aiming to become Japan's fourth major wireless carrier, potentially binding users to its wide range of services. 
Rakuten's shares closed up 4.5 percent, paring much of this month's losses. 
In 2016, Walmart applied a similar strategy in China to that announced on Friday after struggling to grow its e-commerce business by itself. 
The U.S. retailer sold its own website to JD.com, the second largest Chinese e-commerce company, and picked up a 5 percent stake in JD.com instead. JD.com is preparing to enter the United States by the end of this year, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday. 
Investment into online grocery services are picking up steam, with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) buying Whole Foods Market Inc (NASDAQ:WFM) for $13.7 billion last year. 
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and U.S. grocer Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co have had early discussions on working together, a source familiar with the matter said. 
In South Korea Shinsegae and affiliate E-Mart said they were set to gain $940 million in funding from private equity firms, helping to capitalise on a surge in supermarket chain E-Mart's popularity due to its quick delivery of fresh products. 
Walmart is trying to shake up its international business. It recently appointed a top executive to lead its overseas unit and is in talks to sell a stake in its Brazilian operations.
The Japanese deal builds on Walmart's online grocery delivery efforts in the United States. The retailer is testing grocery home delivery with companies such as Uber, Lyft and Deliv and offers online grocery pick-up at more than 1,100 stores.
The partnership will allow Walmart to sell 6 million e-books and audiobooks offered by Rakuten's Kobo brand in the United States, giving the retailer a foothold into what has traditionally been a market dominated by Amazon.com Inc. 
""We are adding an entirely new category to our U.S. assortment,"" Scott Hilton, Walmart's chief revenue officer for the U.S. e-commerce business, said in a blog post.

The titles will include everything from New York Times best-sellers to children's books and will be offered through a new Walmart-Kobo app, Michael Tamblyn, Rakuten Kobo Chief Executive Officer, told Reuters in an interview.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks were set for their 10th straight week of gains on Friday, while the euro jumped more than half a percent as comments by U.S. officials this week advocating their support for a weak dollar reverberated through currency markets.
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries was down 0.1 percent, though it was still set for its 10th weekly gain on the trot.
European shares edged up in early deals, with the pan-European STOXX index (STOXX) up 0.3 percent, although they were set for their first weekly drop this year as a rally in the euro weighed.
Earlier in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 0.25 percent for the day, led by gains in Chinese financial and property shares. 
It headed for its 11th straight day of gains, the longest sequence since 2015, and also for seventh straight week of gains for the first time since 2010.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) ended down 0.2 percent.

Australian markets were closed for a public holiday.
The Dow (DJI) and S&P 500 (SPX) ended at their highest closing levels ever on Thursday although Wall Street relinquished bigger intraday gains after President Donald Trump said he wanted a stronger dollar.
Trump said on Thursday he ultimately wants the dollar to be strong, contradicting comments made by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin one day earlier.
While Trump's comments briefly helped the U.S. currency come off a three-year low, it had fallen further by early European trade on Friday as traders took the view that a protracted decline in the greenback may be likely. 
""While President Trump’s comments prompted a short covering rally in the U.S. dollar, they won’t have alleviated investors separate concerns about recent belligerent US rhetoric on trade,"" said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. 
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, last stood at 88.89.
The euro meanwhile, had risen half a percent to trade just below its December 2014 high of above $1.25 hit on Thursday. (EUR=EBS)
With European Central Bank President Mario Draghi declining to lean against the recent euro rally and instead signaling that economic data pointed to ""solid and broad"" growth, investors were encouraged to push the currency higher.
Draghi also warned that the surge in the euro was a source of uncertainty and said the ECB might have to review strategy if U.S. comments on the benefits of a weak dollar lead to a change in monetary conditions.
Another big mover in currencies on Friday was Britain's pound, which rose as much as 1 percent after stronger than expected GDP numbers for the fourth quarter. 
A fourth quarter GDP reading from the United States is also due at 1330 GMT.
Oil prices reversed earlier falls as the weak dollar was seen supporting fuel consumption.
U.S. crude futures (CLc1) were 0.2 percent higher at $65.61 per barrel after reaching $66.66 on Thursday, their highest since December 2014.
Brent crude futures (LCoc1) were up 0.1 percent at $70.47 per barrel.
Spot gold  was half a percent higher at $1,354.41 per ounce after sliding 0.8 percent overnight. It set $1,366.06 earlier on Thursday, its highest since August 2016.

1295,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 04:59AM ET</span>",Biggest Stock Sell Signal Since '13 Sparked by Record Inflow,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors added the most money on record to equity funds last week as the earnings season began on a positive note and global stocks continued to post record highs.
The rush to risk assets sparked a note of caution from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) strategists, who see a “tactical pullback” in the stock market as likely in the first quarter, at least for the S&P 500. The bank’s “Bull & Bear” indicator has given the highest “sell” signal since March 2013, according to a report Thursday from the bank.
Investors poured $33.2 billion into stocks in the week to Jan. 24, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a research report, citing EPFR Global data. Actively managed equity portfolios, technology funds and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities all enjoyed record inflows.
U.S. stocks saw $7 billion of inflows while the $4.6 billion invested in European shares was the biggest in 37 weeks, the bank said. Emerging market equities received $8.1 billion in fresh money, the second biggest amount in the data series.
Investors have enjoyed a stellar start to 2018 as bets on broadening global economic growth and profit expansion pushed stocks to all-time highs this month. The MSCI ACWI Index, a gauge of both developed and emerging market equities, has risen 6.3 percent since the beginning of the year.
The euphoria didn’t extend to riskier corporate bonds, as high-yield funds saw $2.5 billion of outflows, the eleventh week of redemptions in the last 13. Emerging market bond funds continued to see demand, with $1.6 billion of inflows.
As for the “bull and bear” indicator, it may not be a flawless gauge. The last time the sell signal was this high, in March 2013, the S&P 500 still went on to gain more than 19 percent in the following 12 months.

1296,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>",Investors look to France's 'Macronomics' to beat benchmarks,"By Leigh Thomas
PARIS (Reuters) - Investors are banking on an economic renewal under President Emmanuel Macron to beat broader European benchmarks, sparking a flood of cash into funds offering exposure to France.
Billions of euros have flowed into French assets since Macron's decisive victory over far-right opponent Marine Le Pen last May on the back of a pro-business reform agenda. There is little sign of those flows relenting any time soon.
""We've got people who are asking how to play 'Macronomics' in their portfolios,"" Amundi chief investment officer Pascal Blanque said. ""In all of the institutional investors' European portfolios we see a French segment.""
Amundi, Europe's biggest asset manager with 1.4 trillion euros ($1.74 trillion) under management, saw inflows of 968 million euros into its exchange traded funds offering French exposure last year, with the lion's share coming after the election.
In contrast, one billion euros were pulled from ETFs in German stocks.
More than 90 percent of the flow into French exposure went into ETFs tracking the CAC 40 index of leading French shares. The rest went into ETFs shadowing the broader MSCI France index.
U.S. investors are looking to get in on the action, judging by flows into the biggest New York-traded ETF focused on France, the iShares fund tracking the MSCI France index. Its total net assets have surged from $323 million a year ago to more than $830 million as of Wednesday. 
""In France, the reforms are going down without too much trouble,"" Lyxor senior strategist Lionel Melin said. ""That could lead French shares to outperform the euro zone benchmark.""
Though still early, so far this year French shares <.dMIFR00000P​> have slightly lagged the broader euro zone benchmark index, buoyed by positive global sentiment for equities. 
Not only are investors rushing into French stocks, they are increasingly doing so without hedging against downside risk, judging by the options market, where the volume of bets that the CAC 40 will fall against those that it will rise are the second lowest on record.
Consumer and business confidence have surged since Macron's election, and a closely watched monthly survey of purchasing managers on Wednesday showed that business activity began 2018 more strongly than expected.
The improved confidence is gradually translating into economic gains. Private sector hiring hit a record high in the fourth quarter of 2017 after Macron pushed through an unpopular overhaul of the labor code, his first major reform.
Tough negotiations lie ahead over plans to revamp unemployment insurance and job training, while trying to bring down public spending, which is among the highest in the world.
Robecco strategist Peter van der Welle said the positive outlook for France stemmed from its past weakness, which meant the country had more room for catch-up than Germany.
""What you typically see if a country has lagged in unemployment improvements is that sooner or later you see a stronger reflection in labour and market growth and employment growth. I think that is currently happening in France,"" he said.

The EMC unit includes Commerzbank's exchange traded funds (ETF) portfolio which many banks have expressed interest in buying, the German newspaper reported, citing people familiar with the matter. 
However, Commerzbank Chief Executive Martin Zielke wanted to sell the EMC division - which also includes equity derivatives and other market making businesses - as a single unit, according to the report. 
Barclays declined to comment on the report. Goldman Sachs, Commerzbank and Societe Generale did not respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours. 
The German bank, which is reducing its staff to 36,000 by 2020 from 43,000 at the end of 2015, has been focusing on expanding its retail customer base.
Commerzbank was hit hard by the financial crisis and received an 18 billion-euro ($22.3 billion) state bailout. 

The lender had reported a 472 million-euro net profit in the third quarter, saying it was expecting a ""slightly positive"" net profit for full-year 2017.

1299,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 04:00AM ET</span>","U.S. wage growth, tax-bonuses spark shopping in retail stocks","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund managers are betting that rising wages and the effects of the Republican-led corporate tax cut will prove a lifeline to middle-market retailers who have struggled to remain relevant in the age of Amazon. 
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), CM Advisors and Plumb Funds are among those asset management firms that are increasing their positions in companies that focus on shoppers who earn near the average family income of $74,000 annually. These include children’s apparel company Carter's Inc, department store Big Lots (NYSE:BIG) Inc, men's apparel company Tailored Brands Inc and discount retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT)
With unemployment at 17-year lows, companies are having a hard time filling low to middle-income jobs. As a result, wages for those workers are expected to rise more than 3 percent this year, the largest increase in the category since April 2009, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
Given the expected rise in wages and one-time bonuses resulting from the Republican-led tax cut signed into law on Dec. 22, fund managers are betting that workers will spend more, thus helping drive up share prices of retailers. 
""As capital comes back to the U.S., labor demand will be stronger and we will see for the first time in a long time wage growth creeping into the U.S. market,"" boosting discretionary income and spending, said Jim Brilliant, portfolio manager of the CM Advisors Fixed Income Fund. 
The push toward the middle of the pack retailers is a reversal from the early stages of the bull market that began in 2009, when fund managers packed into the shares of luxury companies such as Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF) and downmarket retailers such as  Dollar General Corp  (NYSE:DG) as a play on rising income inequality. Shares of high-end fashion company Tapestry Inc - then trading under the name  Coach  Inc (NYSE:TPR) - rose more than 45 percent in 2010, more than double the 20 percent return in middle-market stores like  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT)
Now, fund managers say they are targeting middle-income shoppers as jobless claims currently at 45-year lows and increased corporate spending push companies to increase wages. As a result, they see more dollars flowing to retailers, some of which suffered declines of 25 percent in their share prices in 2017 on fears that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) would move into additional business lines and drain business away from them. 
BONUS A BOON FOR RETAILERS
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo, Jet Blue, and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) are among the companies that have announced one-time bonuses or raises for their hourly workers over the last month. Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, said last week that it would increase its minimum wage by $1 to $11 an hour. At the same time, minimum wages are increasing in 18 states in 2018, along with major cities such as New York and Seattle. 
""The minimum wage increase will have significant impact on much of the economy and many of the stocks that we own,"" said Garth Nisbet, a portfolio manager at Wells Fargo Asset Management. ""We are hearing many companies when we listen to conference calls saying that they are having challenges finding workers, and the only thing that's left is for wages to increase.""
COMING OUT FROM AMAZON'S SHADOW
Overall, retail stocks continue to be undervalued compared with other parts of the market at a time when the S&P 500 continues to hit new highs, said Nisbet. More than 50 U.S. retailers filed for bankruptcy in 2017, including chains such as Toys 'R' US, Payless Shoes, and Gymboree, as consumers continued to migrate to e-commerce and away from malls. 
That has left surviving companies such as Tailored Brands, the parent company to menswear stores such as Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank, trading at price-to-earnings ratios near their 52-week lows as investors have fled the sector, he said. 
Still, Nesbit expects revenues to rebound as a result of consumers spending their one-time tax bonuses or portions of their wage increases, helping convince the market that these companies can still attract customers even as Amazon encroaches into more retail sectors. 
""You are finally starting to see fundamental reasons that are going to drive the recovery in these stocks,"" he said.
At the same time, U.S. retailers are seeing their tax rates plummet as a result of the corporate tax cut, which slashed rates from 35 percent to 21 percent. 
While all retailers will see a benefit from tax cuts, those that have been waiting for an increase in lower to middle-end wages will see the largest share price gains in the year, said Tom Plumb, president of Madison, Wisconsin-based Plumb Funds. 

""You are finally starting to see real wage growth this cycle, and it’s the lower income shopper who will be the most likely to spend it"" rather than invest it, he said.

1300,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 03:50AM ET</span>",European shares set for weekly fall as strong euro weighs,"MILAN (Reuters) - European shares edged up in early deals on Friday, helped by a well-received update from LVMH, although they were set for their first weekly drop this year as a rally in the euro weighed. 
LVMH rose 3.4 percent after the world's biggest luxury goods maker reported higher sales and profits and said it had made a favorable start to 2018.
It buoyed shares of other luxury goods companies, helping the pan-European STOXX 600 index edge 0.2 percent higher by 0828 GMT, while Germany's DAX was flat and the UK's FTSE was up 0.4 percent. 
The euro was up on Friday, though below the December 2014 high it hit on Thursday, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he wanted a ""strong dollar"", contradicting earlier comments made by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. 
Temenos was the biggest gainer on the STOXX 600, up 6 percent. The Swiss software company, which is subject to regular takeover speculation, jumped as much as 18 percent in the previous session. 
Kepler Cheuvreux raised its price target on Temenos on Friday, pointing to positive comments by Nordic bank Nordea regarding the integration of a Temenos banking platform. Kepler said takeover speculation had also pushed up Temenos shares. A Temenos spokesman could not be reached for comment on Thursday.
Among other gainers were Telia, up 2 percent, after the telecom operator lifted its dividend, while shares in  Michelin  (PA:MICP) and Thales were buoyed by upbeat broker comments. 
A disappointing update however sent Norwegian insurer Gjensidige down 6 percent. The company posted below-forecast profits for the fourth quarter and proposed a lower-than-expected full-year dividend. 
Speciality baker Aryzta fell 5.5 percent as some brokers downgraded the stock following a profit warning that wiped out one fifth of its market value on Thursday. 

The STOXX 600 was down 0.4 percent so far this week, having gained almost 3 percent in the previous three weeks.

Releasing its first official Arctic policy white paper, China said it would encourage enterprises to build infrastructure and conduct commercial trial voyages, paving the way for Arctic shipping routes that would form a ""Polar Silk Road"". 
""China hopes to work with all parties to build a 'Polar Silk Road' through developing the Arctic shipping routes,"" the paper, issued by the State Council Information Office, said.
China, despite being a non-Arctic state, is increasingly active in the polar region and became an observer member of the Arctic Council in 2013. 
Among its increasing interests in the region is its major stake in Russia's Yamal liquefied natural gas project which is expected to supply China with four million tonnes of LNG a year, according to the state-run China Daily. 
Shipping through the Northern Sea Route would shave almost 20 days off the regular time using the traditional route through the Suez Canal, the newspaper reported last month. COSCO Shipping has also previously sailed vessels through the Arctic's northeast passage.
China's increasing prominence in the region has prompted concerns from Arctic states over its long-term strategic objectives, including possible military deployment.
""Some people may have misgivings over our participation in the development of the Arctic, worried we may have other intentions, or that we may plunder resources or damage the environment,"" Vice-Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou said at a briefing. 
""I believe these kinds of concerns are absolutely unnecessary.""
The white paper said China also eyes development of oil, gas, mineral resources and other non-fossil energies, fishing and tourism in the region. It said it would do so ""jointly with Arctic States, while respecting traditions and cultures of the Arctic residents including the indigenous peoples and conserving natural environment"".

China's Belt and Road initiative aims to connect China to Europe, the Middle East and beyond via massive infrastructure projects across dozens of countries, reflecting Xi's desire for China to take on a more prominent global leadership role.

1309,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 11:00PM ET</span>","Under steel's shadow, iron ore seen tumbling 13 percent in 2018: Reuters poll","By Manolo Serapio Jr
MANILA (Reuters) - The price of steelmaking ingredient iron ore will drop 13 percent this year to around $60 a ton, pressured by plentiful supply, potentially slower demand in top consumer China and reduced profits on churning out steel, a Reuters poll showed.
While China's crackdown on pollution and curbs on steel output are set to continue in 2018, analysts said disruptions to the steel market could be more limited than last year, when the campaigns lifted steel prices and spurred a temporary rally in iron ore.
Benchmark 62-percent grade iron ore for delivery to top market China will average $62 a ton in 2018, down from around $71 last year, according to the median estimate in a Reuters poll of 18 analysts. [L4N1PK3MN]
""Through the year, iron ore supply growth, particularly in China and outside Australia and Brazil, should weigh on prices,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Vivek Dhar, who sees the commodity averaging $55 in October-December and $60 for the whole of 2018. 
Chinese steel prices surged nearly 50 percent in 2017, but spot iron ore prices eventually dropped 8 percent on the year despite shadowing steel higher for months, dragged down by record stockpiles of the raw material.
Those stronger iron ore prices for most of 2017 boosted China's output of the commodity by 7 percent and increased China-bound shipments from smaller suppliers India and Iran by double-digit percentages, bolstering exports dominated by Brazil and Australia.
Vale, the world's No. 1 producer, is expected to add the most output among top suppliers in 2018, with plans to increase to 390 million tonnes from 365 million tonnes as it ramps up its massive S11D mine in Brazil.
While most top iron ore exporters have been focusing on margins over volume, Clarksons Platou Securities said it doesn't ""expect Chinese steel production to grow enough to absorb all of the world's expansions"", seeing ""a gradual decline in pricing"".
DIMINISHING EFFECTS
Slowing growth in China's property sector could cut steel production in the country to 820 million tonnes from last year's record 831.7 million tonnes, said  Barclays  (LON:BARC), which sees iron ore falling to an average $50 a ton in the second quarter from $70 in January-March.
Chinese steel output rose last year despite government-imposed curbs and a pollution crackdown, with mills chasing strong margins amid a rally in prices for the construction material.
Those margins, which touched their strongest in two decades at up to 2,000 yuan ($316) a ton, are likely to drop as winter production restrictions, in place from the middle of November, are lifted in mid-March. 
Chinese steel prices have already fallen 4 percent from December's three-month high, with spot iron prices down 5 percent from this year's peak, standing at $75 on Thursday.
""As previously idled capacity comes online during the March-April period, we think the ensuing drop in profitability will trigger a selloff in the iron ore price,"" Barclays said.
And unlike 2017, the impact of fresh restrictions on steel production may be reduced this year, limiting any boost to prices of steel and iron ore.
""The effects of the curbs will diminish as steel producers would try everything possible to increase their production in advance,"" said Cao Ying, analyst at SDIC Essence Futures.

1310,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 08:26PM ET</span>",Starbucks disappoints after holiday drink sales lose steam,"By Lisa Baertlein
(Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) on Thursday warned that 2018 global cafe sales growth would be at the low end of its forecast, after holiday drinks fell flat with U.S. customers during what is traditionally a blockbuster quarter. 
Shares of the world's largest coffee chain slid 4.6 percent following the announcement to $57.75, after closing at $60.55 in regular trade.
Company executives reiterated that Starbucks, which sometimes locates stores across the street from each other, was not losing business to cannibalization or rising competition from both high-end and low-priced coffee sellers. 
But sales at established Americas region cafes rose just 2 percent in the first quarter ended Dec. 31, as customers added food to their orders: the number of cafe visitors did not budge. Analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix expected a sales rise of 3.3 percent.
""Holiday (limited-time offers) and merchandise did not resonate with our customers as planned,"" Chief Executive Kevin Johnson said on a conference call with analysts.
Starbucks offers holiday-themed drinks such as the Chestnut Praline Latte and Gingerbread Latte as well as gift cards, mugs, coffee and tea gift boxes and teddy bears to woo holiday shoppers.
Johnson also blamed the quarter's disappointing same-store sales results on an ongoing shift towards online shopping from brick-and-mortar stores, as well as waning customer interest in the afternoon and evening hours.
Starbucks said it now expects 2018 global same-store sales growth at the low end of its previously-issued view of 3 to 5 percent. 
Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw said the company would continue to ""streamline"" its operations by removing underperforming and lower-margin merchandise from store lobbies and exiting businesses that don't meaningfully contribute to sales and profits - as Starbucks is doing by closing its Teavana retail stores and selling its Tazo tea brand.
The chain is also working to eliminate bottlenecks that can happen when users of its industry-leading mobile app flood crowded cafes with orders. 
The same-store sales performance and outlook overshadowed the profit boost Starbucks expects to reap from a U.S. corporate tax cut.
Starbucks raised its fiscal 2018 earnings forecast to a range of $2.48 to $2.53 per share, excluding items, from $2.30 to $2.33 per share previously. Maw said Starbucks expects a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 26 percent for 2018 and beyond, roughly 7 points below prior guidance.
CHINA GROWTH?
Starbucks has turned to China for growth, planning to more than triple its over 3,000-store network within a decade. It recently opened a massive, showcase Reserve Roastery in Shanghai.
China same-store sales were up 6 percent and the company's acquisition of 1,300 stores in China helped net income in the quarter to rise to $2.25 billion, or $1.57 per share, from $751.8 million, or 51 cents per share, a year ago.
But for the time being, investors want Johnson, who is still overshadowed by his predecessor and current Executive Chairman Howard Schultz, to deliver more robust growth in Starbucks' home market, with roughly 14,000 stores.

The stock is up 3.2 percent from a year ago, versus the 44 percent, turnaround-fueled gain at McDonald's Corp (N:MCD).

1311,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 07:35PM ET</span>","White House nominates Wilson, Phillips to FTC","By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump nominated Republicans Noah Phillips and Christine Wilson to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Thursday, and sent their nominations to the Senate for confirmation.
The White House also sent to the Senate two other FTC nominations that the president announced last year: Republican antitrust lawyer Joe Simons to be the chairman of the commission and Democrat Rohit Chopra, a veteran of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to be a commissioner.
The FTC works with the Justice Department to enforce antitrust law and investigates allegations of deceptive behavior by companies. The agency has five commissioners; only three can be from one party.
The agency is currently headed by acting Chairwoman Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican, with Democrat Terrell McSweeny the only other commissioner. 
Ohlhausen has been nominated to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. McSweeny's term ended last fall, but she has stayed on pending confirmation of a replacement.
Phillips is the chief counsel for Senator John Cornyn and a veteran of the major law firms Steptoe & Johnson LLP and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, according to his profile on the LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD).com career website. He graduated from Stanford Law School in 2005.
Wilson, a former chief of staff to former FTC Chairman Tim Muris, is a senior vice president for regulatory and international affairs at Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) and is a veteran of the law firms Kirkland & Ellis LLP and O'Melveny & Myers LLP, according to her LinkedIn.com account.
Simons, Trump's pick to be the FTC chairman, is a partner at the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP. Simons was competition director at the agency from 2001 to 2003.
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau alumnus Chopra, who Trump tapped to fill the empty Democratic seat on the commission, is currently at the Consumer Federation of America.
The agency is reviewing a number of big mergers in industries where there are already few players.
One is a deal to merge industrial gases companies  Praxair Inc  (NYSE:PX) and  Linde  AG (DE:LING). It will also decide whether lens maker Essilor International (PA:ESSI) SA will be allowed to merge with dominant frame-maker Luxottica Group SpA.
It had been expected that Phillips would be nominated in October. The decision not to nominate him came about the same time that Cornyn vociferously battled the administration for more aid for Texas after Hurricane Harvey and put a hold on the nomination of Russell Vought to be Mick Mulvaney's right hand man at the Office of Management and Budget.

Cornyn said in a statement that Phillips was dedicated and ""will be a big asset to the commission.""

Jungmann also ruled out a spin-off or sale of Embraer's defense or commercial units, the statement added. Saab and Embraer are partners in the development of the Gripen NG fighter.
""We are concerned and contractually committed to maintaining control and confidentiality in the transfer of technology developed both by Saab and jointly"" with Embraer, Jungmann said according to the ministry.
U.S. planemaker Boeing proposed a tie-up with Embraer in December, but the plans have faced resistance from Brazil's government, which has a so-called golden share, giving it a right to veto any change of control.

Jungmann has asked the Air Force as well as the Defense and Finance Ministries to keep Saab executives informed of any progress in talks between the companies, adding that any deal would mean building safeguards for Saab with its input.

(Reuters) - SunPower Corp (O:SPWR) on Thursday said it was putting a $20 million U.S. factory expansion and hundreds of new jobs on hold until and unless its solar panels receive an exclusion from federal tariffs the Trump administration imposed this week.
President Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs on cheap imported panels was intended to protect American manufacturing jobs, but many in the solar industry have argued that tariffs will raise costs and trigger thousands of layoffs in the installation end of the industry. 
SunPower, which is based in San Jose, California, but does most of its manufacturing in the Philippines and Mexico, will be hit harder than most in the industry by the announced 30 percent tariff on imported solar modules, Chief Executive Tom Werner said in an interview.
""We make a different product that's higher efficiency and that product costs more,"" Werner said. ""We pay a higher tariff despite the fact that it's an American technology.""
SunPower has argued that its premium-priced panels, which are among the most efficient in the industry at transforming sunlight into electricity, should receive an exemption from the tariffs because their unique technology cannot be compared with that of more conventional models, including those made by the companies that sought the tariffs, Suniva and SolarWorld.
The Trump administration did not announce any product exemptions when it unveiled the tariffs. The U.S. Trade Representative will announce the rules for requesting an exclusion by Feb. 22. The tariffs will take effect Feb. 7.
""We have to stop the $20 million investment because the tariffs start before we know if we're excluded,"" Werner said. ""It's not hypothetical. These were positions that we were recruiting for that we are going to stop."" 
That investment would create ""hundreds"" of jobs at SunPower facilities in California and Texas, Werner said. They would include jobs in research and development, manufacturing and sales and would be focused on the company's next-generation cell technology.
SunPower's project development arm has already lost business to rival  First Solar Inc  (O:FSLR), which makes panels that are exempt from tariffs.

SunPower is majority owned by France's  Total  SA (PA:TOTF).

The discount brokerage will pay $170 million for the brokerage accounts, which will add roughly $1.7 billion in cash and $115 million in margin loans to E*Trade's balance sheet, executives said on a conference call with analysts. 
""Opportunities like this, in which we can efficiently add a large number of customers to our highly scalable platform, do not come along often,"" Karl Roessner, E*Trade's chief executive, said on the call.
Capital One declined to comment and referred questions to E*Trade. 
Clients in these new accounts trade less frequently than E*Trade's typical client base.
However, the acquisition price, broken down by accounts, was lower than E*Trade's usual client acquisition cost, Roessner said. 
""The price was right, and we went after scale,"" Roessner said.
The deal is expected to close by the third quarter this year, subject to regulatory approvals, and will have a neutral impact on 2018 earnings, executives said. Funding will come from existing corporate cash.
The discount brokerage also reported a 13 percent fall in fourth-quarter net income to $129 million, as the company recognized a $58 million tax expense due to the new U.S. tax law.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman said on Thursday that his hedge fund Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management made a new bet on sportswear company  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) last year that has already earned his portfolio a roughly 30 percent return.
For months the activist investor has been saying he had new ideas for his portfolio, and on Thursday he spoke about them publicly for the first time at his firm's annual client dinner, an investor in the firm said.
At the dinner, Ackman also said that Ali Namvar, one of Pershing Square Capital Management's most senior investment team members, will be moving to the firm's advisory board.
Ackman, one of the world's most closely watched activist investors whose bets have often helped push up a target company's share price, bought Nike when it was trading around $53 a share. It closed trading on Thursday at $67.71.
The bet on Nike is unusual in that Ackman has no plans to push the company's management to make changes, leaving it as one of his few ""passive investments.""
Pershing Square, which oversees roughly $9 billion for clients, has suffered three years of losses, and Ackman plans to spend more time generating ideas and focusing on investments in a bid to help revive performance. He will leave the marketing of the firm, which often involves a lot of travel, to other partners, Reuters reported on Monday.
Nike previously caught the eye of other hedge funds. Hoplite Capital founder John Lykouretzos presented it to an industry conference in May as one of his best ideas, and said the stock price could double within three years amid strong international growth. 
For years, any word from Ackman about new names often sent stock prices higher as investors expected him to push for better returns and possibly shake up management.
Ackman said Namvar, who is also a board member at portfolio company Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), will join Pershing Square's advisory board in a few months, leaving the day to day investment business to pursue a second career in the music industry. He will continue to sit on the CMG board, Ackman said. 

Namvar will be the first person to move to the hedge fund's advisory board from its investment team. Several other members of the investment team have left the firm over the last years to run their own investment businesses.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) should not be allowed to claim its iQOS electronic tobacco product is less risky than cigarettes, U.S. health advisers said on Thursday, dealing a blow to the company as it seeks to strengthen its portfolio of alternative nicotine devices.
The recommendation is not binding and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could still allow Philip Morris to make such a claim, but some analysts think the agency might ask for additional data first.
""It's a process,"" said Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC). The FDA will likely approve the request eventually, she said, ""but timing is tough to predict.""
Philip Morris, which has spent more than $3 billion to develop products that can counteract the decline in traditional cigarette sales, said it was encouraged by some of the committee members' comments that iQOS may have risk-reduction potential.
""We are confident in our ability to address the valid questions raised by the Committee with the FDA as the review process for our application continues,"" Corey Henry, a Philip Morris spokesman, said in a statement.
FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb recently proposed a broad tobacco policy shift that would reduce nicotine in cigarettes to ""non-addictive"" levels while increasing development of lower-risk alternatives for those unable to quit.
IQOS is a sleek, penlike device that heats tobacco but does not ignite it - an approach Philip Morris says produces far lower levels of carcinogens than regular cigarettes. It is used by nearly 4 million people in 30 markets outside the United States but needs FDA authorization to be marketed in America.
Last month, a Reuters investigation described irregularities in the clinical trials that supported Philip Morris' iQOS application to the FDA. (https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tobacco-iqos-science/) and (http://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/pmi)
The company's shares fell 2.8 percent to close at $107.49 on Thursday, after falling as much as 6.8 percent.
Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, said panelists ""identified that serious questions remain"" about the company's application. He said it could amend the application and the panel's recommendation does not rule out an ultimate approval. 
The panel said Philip Morris had not proven that iQOS reduced harm compared with cigarettes. It did conclude that the product exposes users to lower levels of harmful chemicals but said the company had not shown that lowering exposure to those chemicals is reasonably likely to translate into a measurable reduction in disease or death.
Philip Morris needs to show both in order to claim in its marketing materials that the product reduces a user's exposure to harmful chemicals.
Some panelists were concerned that not all the harmful or potentially harmful chemicals in iQOS were lower than in cigarettes. Philip Morris presented data showing an overall exposure reduction of about 95 percent.
""The negative recommendations did not come as a surprise,"" said Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association. He said the panelists ""disconnected themselves from the facts in favor of ideology."" 
The FDA is expected to decide whether Philip Morris can sell iQOS within the next few months. It will decide separately whether to authorize the modified-risk claims. There is no time frame for when that decision might come.

If cleared, iQOS would be sold in the United States by Philip Morris' partner  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc. Altria shares closed 2.3 percent lower at $69.91.

Tesla's problems with battery production at its Gigafactory in Sparks, Nevada, are worse than it had acknowledged, CNBC had reported earlier in the day, citing some company employees.
The problems included Tesla needing to make some batteries by hand and borrowing scores of employees from one of its suppliers to help with manual assembly, CNBC had said.
Tesla shares closed down 2.4 percent on Thursday following the report, but rose 1.6 percent in extended trading after the company said it had no further production setbacks.
""To be absolutely clear, we are on track with the previous projections for achieving increased Model 3 production rates that we provided earlier this month,"" a Tesla spokesman said in a e-mailed statement.
""As has been well documented, until we reach full production, by definition some elements of the production process will be more manual,"" the spokesman said.
Earlier this month, Tesla delayed a production target for the Model 3 for the second time, disappointing investors even as it claimed ""major progress"" overcoming manufacturing challenges that have hampered the vehicle's rollout.

Tesla currently plans to make about 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter, half the number it had earlier promised. It expects to reach its goal of 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter.

The legal dispute began in August when Benchmark sued Kalanick in Delaware's Chancery Court to force him off the ride-hailing firm's board and rescind his ability to fill three board seats.
The firm sued him for fraud, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty.
Benchmark, an early investor in Uber, later agreed to drop the lawsuit as part of an investment deal between Uber and a group of investors led by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp.

The deal closed last week, which included a large purchase of shares from existing Uber investors and employees at a valuation for the company of $48 billion, a 30 percent drop from Uber's most recent valuation of $68 billion.

US GDP, Durable Goods
The US economy is expected to show growth of 3% in the fourth quarter, down from 3.2% in the previous quarter. 
The Commerce Department on Friday is expected to report core durable goods orders rose 0.5% in December, after a decline of 0.1% in the previous month amid fading sluggishness in business sentiment.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.19% to 89.19.
Canadian Inflation 
Canada will report inflation data on Friday, expected to show consumer prices struggled to pick up the pace in December, which could ease investor expectations that the Bank of Canada is set to adopt a more aggressive path of monetary policy tightening.
Economist expect Canadian consumer price inflation in December fell 0.1%, in line with the 0.1% decline in the previous month.
Ahead of the data, USD/CAD rose by 0.01% to C$1.2377.
Baker Hughes rig count
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with fresh insight into U.S. oil production and demand after data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the US rose by 5 to 747.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.

(Reuters) -  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) Inc's profit topped Wall Street forecasts for the seventh straight quarter on Thursday as equipment sales surged 35 percent on strong global demand for construction, mining and energy machines.
The world's largest heavy-duty equipment maker, which serves as a bellwether for global economic activity, is benefiting from a global economy that is having its best run since 2011.
The biggest sales increase came from North America, its biggest market, led by better demand for construction and on-shore oil & gas machinery.
""Economic indicators are positive at the moment, and we expect a strong start to 2018,"" Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby told analysts on a post-earnings conference call.
The company expects further improvement in North American residential, non-residential and infrastructure markets.
In Asia, it expects Chinese construction demand to remain strong at least through the first half of the new year.
Meanwhile, rising gold, iron ore and copper prices are expected to improve machine utilization and the demand for aftermarket parts. A rebound in oil prices has renewed investments in the sector and boosted demand for equipment.
It also said the prices it charges customers are staying ahead of material costs.
The past year marked a dramatic turnaround for Caterpillar which, weighed down by weak economic conditions and commodity price volatility, saw a more than 40-percent fall in sales between 2012 and 2016.
The downturn forced it to consolidate or close more than 30 facilities and reduced the total workforce by 16,000 between 2015 and 2016. The downsizing has led to some concerns that the company might not have enough muscle to meet the growing demand.
""The challenge will be allocating equipment to inventory while also meeting end-market demand,"" said Joe O'Dea, a machinery analyst at Vertical Research Partners. 
Shares in Caterpillar, part of the Dow Jones industrial average, were last up 0.3 percent. The company's stock has risen around 80 percent in the past year.
The company forecast adjusted profit of $8.25 to $9.25 per share for 2018, above analysts' average estimate of $8.19, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
In the fourth quarter, in adjusted terms, it made a profit of $2.16 per share. On that basis, analysts had expected $1.79 per share.

Caterpillar took a $2.4-billion charge related to the recent U.S. tax law, widening its net loss before adjustments to $1.30 billion, or $2.18 per share, from $1.17 billion, or $2.00 per share, a year earlier.

1323,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 04:50PM ET</span>","U.S. airline shares fall again as investors worry about capacity, price wars","By Alana Wise
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. airline shares sunk further on Thursday as quarterly reports from American Airlines (O:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) did nothing to quell investors' fears that carriers' plans to expand capacity will lead to lower fares just as the industry faces rising costs. 
Fears about the resulting hit to bottom lines sent the NYSE Arca Airline Index (XAL) down 2.4 percent. It is down more than 5 percent since Tuesday, when United Continental Holdings Inc (N:UAL) surprised the market with unexpectedly aggressive expansion plans through 2020. 
""The planned elevated capacity growth in 2019/20 will raise concerns about supply and destructive competitive response,"" said Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth in a research note. 
Shares of American and Southwest both ended down more than 3 percent, even after reporting fourth-quarter profits that beat Wall Street's projections. Shares of Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) and United also fell. 
More competition and cheaper fares are a boon for travelers, but represent a worst-case-scenario for airlines and their shareholders as carriers have only recently begun improving unit revenues after a two-year decline. 
Fuel prices are at nearly a three-year high and relatively rich labor contracts agreed with pilots and flight attendants have dramatically increased airlines' unit costs. 
The three largest U.S. carriers - American, Delta and United - have all shelled out for pricey pay increases to employees after fractious and public negotiations.
American, which on Thursday reported a 9.8 percent increase in quarterly operating expenses to $9.9 billion, stunned investors last year by offering its pilots and flight attendants a mid-contract pay increase that is set to cost $350 million a year in both 2018 and in 2019.
United and Delta, in filings earlier this month, reported significant operating expense spikes as well.
At the same time, legacy airline executives are defending their hard-earned hubs from encroachment by low-cost U.S. and transatlantic rivals, which have crept into their territory and are starting to shave down their bigger, more established competitors' market share through no-frill, cheap airfares. 
Chicago-based United is battling low-cost competitors in several of its U.S. hubs and has already slashed fares on some of its routes and has said it will continue to compete against scrappy budget airlines, a move unpopular with most investors.

That is a risky gamble, given the relatively high operating expenses of United and other legacy carriers. United, for example, posted a third-quarter cost per available seat mile of 12.54 cents. Southwest, the No. 4 U.S. carrier, measured a unit cost for the same period of 11.36 cents. Smaller rival budget carrier  Spirit Airlines  Inc (N:SAVE) had a unit cost of just 7.59 cents.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 closed at their highest levels ever on Thursday although Wall Street relinquished bigger gains after President Donald Trump said he wants a strong dollar. 
The U.S. currency (DXY) erased losses against a basket of major currencies after Trump told CNBC in an interview in Davos, Switzerland, that he wants to see a strong dollar.
The dollar had suffered its biggest daily percentage drop in seven months on Wednesday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he welcomed a weaker currency. A weaker dollar tends to benefit large U.S. multinational companies. 
Biogen Inc (O:BIIB) surged 2.09 percent after the drugmaker reported fourth-quarter revenue that beat Wall Street estimates on higher sales of recently launched drug Spinraza. The rise lifted the S&P healthcare sector (SPXHC) 0.89 percent as one of the best-performing S&P groups.
Shares of  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) fell as much as 3.5 percent and rose as much as 2.8 percent in the wake of its quarterly earnings. The stock ended 0.61 percent higher. 
""If growth continues the way we expect, we should see a rotation out of these mega-cap tech companies and into more of the higher-leveraged value companies,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. 
""And Caterpillar is it."" 
Robust quarterly earnings and economic data have given Wall Street a strong start to 2018, with the three major indexes up more than 6 percent year to date. But the market's relentless rise over the past year has some investors worried about a correction. 
""It's a market that ignores all bad news and thrives on good news. It's scary. The correction is going to be cruel, cold and brutal when it happens,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa.
S&P 500 companies on average are expected to have increased their fourth-quarter earnings by 12.7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Of the S&P 500 companies that have already posted results, 78.8 percent have topped expectations, versus an average of 72 percent over the previous four quarters.
""It's non-stop positive reinforcement that keeps pushing the market up,"" said Frank Davis, director of sales and trading at LEK Securities in New York. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 0.54 percent to end at 26,392.79, its highest close ever.
The S&P 500 (SPX) ended 0.06 percent higher at 2,839.25, also its highest ever close. Earlier, it gained as much as 0.39 percent.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) declined 0.05 percent to 7,411.16.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) slumped 3.98 percent after the automaker posted a lower-than-expected quarterly net profit. Its bottom line was hurt by rising commodity costs and unfavorable currency exchange rates, and Ford said it expected more pain to come from higher raw material prices in 2018.
In extended trade, Intel (O:INTC) jumped 2.45 percent after the chipmaker reported its quarterly results. Starbucks (O:SBUX) fell 3.6 percent in extended trade following its report.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.2 billion shares, compared to the 6.7 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Economic data, meanwhile, appeared to have muted impact on equities as jobless claims rose less than expected while new home sales for December fell sharply.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday new home sales declined 9.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 625,000 units last month.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims increased 17,000 to a seasonally adjusted 233,000 for the week ended Jan. 20.

1330,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>","U.S. Treasury official says CFIUS overworked, supports overhaul","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury official who oversees the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) spoke on Thursday in support of efforts in Congress to strengthen the group, saying its case load has more than doubled since the financial crisis and cases have grown increasingly complex.
Heath Tarbert, who heads the committee that reviews proposed purchases of U.S. assets by foreign companies to ensure they do not harm national security, praised proposed legislation to expand the remit of CFIUS, saying it will help the organization keep up with complex deals structured to hide foreign interests and more.
""We continue to be made aware of transactions we lack the jurisdiction to review but which pose similar national security concerns to those already before CFIUS,"" Tarbert said in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.          
He said the average volume of CFIUS cases has been growing steadily from fewer than 100 in 2009 and 2010 to nearly 240 in 2017.  
In 2017 about 70 percent of cases ended up in an investigation, compared with just four percent 10 years earlier.
His testimony came a day after the Trump administration confirmed its support of bipartisan bills in Congress to toughen U.S. foreign investment rules.
The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act would broaden the government's power to stop foreign purchases of U.S. firms by expanding CFIUS' reach to allow it to review, and potentially reject, smaller investments and add new national security factors for CFIUS to consider. Those factors include whether information about Americans, such as Social Security numbers, would be exposed as part of the transaction or whether the deal would facilitate fraud.
The Act would also establish fees capped at 1 percent of the value of the transaction or $300,000, whichever is less, which would be deposited in a CFIUS fund.
The proposed legislation is backed by some companies, including  Oracle Corp  (N:ORCL). The software maker supports the bill because it is focused on specific national security concerns and distinguishes between investments that are financially motivated and investments that are strategically motivated.
Conversely  IBM  (N:IBM) opposes the bill, arguing that it would bog down an already busy panel with routine transactions.

(Reuters) - TransCanada Corp does not see a route change for the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline to Nebraska as a major issue, and the company is confident a key regulatory approval will stand, Chief Executive Russ Girling said on Thursday.
Analyzing the November approval by Nebraska Public Service Commission was an important factor in TransCanada's deliberations on a final investment decision on whether to build the $8 billion pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta, to Steele City, Nebraska, Girling told a CIBC investor conference in Whistler, British Columbia. 
The company now believes the ruling, which opponents are appealing, is legally ""solid,"" Girling said. TransCanada has still not made a final investment decision. 
The Nebraska commission approved the pipeline, but not TransCanada's preferred path. The new, approved route will add $100 million to $200 million in cost, Girling said. 
""We're committed to moving this project forward but .. we've got a lot of bruises of not being really careful,"" he said. ""So we'll just be really careful with how we spend our money through the next 12 months.""
The pipeline would increase the flow of landlocked heavy crude oil from Alberta to U.S. refineries.
TransCanada is focused on acquiring additional right of way for the route change, a process that should last until the third or fourth quarter, in time to start construction next year, Girling said.
Last week, TransCanada said it had lined up enough long-term commitments from shippers for the pipeline.

TransCanada shares fell 2 percent in Toronto to C$58.02, compared with a 0.9 percent drop for the exchange's energy index.

1339,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 03:01PM ET</span>",Why Trump's Davos Speech Should Worry Investors: Komal Sri-Kumar,"(Bloomberg View) -- President Donald Trump’s address at the Global Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, will be critical for investors.
If the Friday speech it turns out to be measured and calls for rules for ensuring free trade and a further opening of markets for U.S. exports and investments, the impact will be positive. If, however, Trump suggests that his administration is just getting started in introducing new tariffs and quotas to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, expect China, Mexico and the European Union to come out with tit-for-tat measures that could rattle global equity markets.
This was an eventful week even before the president's talk. In response to his decision to pull out of the proposed 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership, the remaining 11 countries announced a trade deal that would exclude the U.S. Trade would be freer across those countries, even as U.S. exports to the new group become less competitive.
On Jan. 22, Trump made the first concrete move of his presidency on trade restrictions by imposing tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. The new taxes will affect China, a major exporter of both items, and South Korea, which exports washing machines. Since the tariffs will be on specific items rather than targeted at particular countries, expect the impact to be global across trade partners.
This week also brought proof that trade can be influenced not only with tariffs but by talking down the dollar as well. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday that “a weaker dollar is good for trade.” This reversed a 22-year old policy statement repeated by successive Treasury secretaries -- whether they believed it or not -- that a strong dollar is in the U.S. national interest. The dollar fell sharply to a three-year low (chart below). The Dollar Index dropped below 90 for the first time since December 2014, and fell further on Thursday.
The tariffs on solar panels and washing machines, Mnuchin’s preference for a weak dollar and Trump’s Jan. 23 statement that he is prepared to walk away from the North American Free Trade Agreement all enhance the importance that investors should place on what the president says Friday.
The risk of a Chinese reaction is especially critical since the government has a history of responding to trade restrictions with moves of its own. This risk was recognized by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross at a news conference in Davos on Wednesday when he admitted that there is “potential for retribution and retaliation, and that’s up to the Chinese to decide.”
And how can China retaliate? Let us count the ways. The rapidly growing Chinese economy needs new aircraft? Forget about Boeing (NYSE:BA); Airbus would be better. General Motors (NYSE:GM) sales in China rose so much in 2017 that it sold more cars there than in the U.S.? Time to end that trend with new quotas and a campaign suggesting that Chinese buyers switch to Korean or Japanese automobiles.
And how about farm exports? “U.S. agriculture depends on trade,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue recognized in November. Unlike the overall U.S. trade deficit that Trump decries, the agricultural sector has consistently run trade surpluses. China rose to become the largest importer of U.S. agricultural products in the 2017 fiscal year. Retaliatory tariffs by China would severely affect farm states such as Nebraska and Kansas, and major U.S. agricultural companies could see global sales fall sharply.
Along with merchandise, countervailing action can be used to influence the category known as “invisibles” in the balance of payments, such as tourism. Chinese tourists spent more in the U.S. than visitors from any other country in 2016, according to the Commerce Department. Almost 3 million Chinese came that year, 15 percent more than in 2015; and they spent $33 billion, a 9 percent increase from the previous year.
The trade risk for U.S. markets has increased with this week’s developments. Trump’s address on Friday can either support the equity market rally that he sees as resulting from his economic policies, or increase global trade friction that damages the market he cares so deeply about.

1340,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",Dollar Erases Drop on Trump Backing; Stocks Mixed: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) -- The dollar all but erased losses after President Donald Trump told CNBC he wants a strong dollar, countermanding comments by his Treasury secretary. U.S. stocks pared gains sparked by strong corporate earnings.
The dollar traded little changed after Trump’s comments, which ran counter to Steven Mnuchin’s endorsement of a weak greenback just a day earlier. Bloomberg’s dollar measure erased a drop of 0.4 percent, though it’s still at a three-year low. Earlier, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said robust growth justifies a stronger euro, pushing the common currency to a three-year high. Treasuries added to gains, taking the 10-year yield to 2.62 percent.
Stocks swung between gains and losses as investors assessed the greenback’s gyrations and the impact on equities. Corporate results had set the tone, major indexes at the whim of big moves in individual stocks.  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT). advanced after earnings topped estimates, while  Varian Medical  Systems Inc (NYSE:VAR). rallied along with 3M Co. on optimistic forecasts. Newell Brands Inc. tumbled when the company said it plans to sell off a swath of business. European equities fell as the euro gained.
Trump’s comments roiled a market where investors are already on edge as Mnuchin and Draghi engaged in unusual public discussions of currency levels. That has investors reassessing the global risk-on rally that’s stretched valuations across asset classes. So far, U.S. equities have continued to march higher amid solid corporate results, but rising currencies have threatened stock gains from Japan to Europe. Investors are also casting a watchful on the World Economic Forum, where Trump will deliver a keynote as his administration ramps up protectionist rhetoric.
Elsewhere, the MSCI Emerging Markets Currency Index hit the highest on record, while dollar weakness also boosted commodities. Bloomberg’s index of raw materials is at the highest since October 2015, and gold traded near the strongest in more than a year.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Planemaker Bombardier Inc is expected to lose a hotly contested U.S. trade dispute this week, a Canadian government source told Reuters on Thursday, likely inflaming tensions between the two countries during talks to modernize NAFTA.
Trade lawyers and industry experts largely predict the International Trade Commission (ITC) will back the U.S. Commerce Department's recommendation to slap Bombardier's CSeries with a near 300-percent duty on sales to American carriers on Friday.
This is the first time a Canadian official has acknowledged that is the most likely outcome.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, the world's largest maker of jetliners, accuses the Canadian firm of dumping the planes in the U.S. market. An ITC spokeswoman declined to comment.
""We think Bombardier is going to lose because the process is designed that way,"" said the Canadian source, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.
""It is not a multilateral or independent or unbiased tribunal. It's an American tribunal,"" the source added.
Bombardier was not immediately available for comment.
Other industry experts, however, argue the ITC could still side with Bombardier, which has struck a deal with Airbus SE to give the European planemaker a majority stake in the CSeries. 
The fate of the CSeries and the well-paid jobs associated with the plane is important both to Ottawa and the British government. The company is a big employer in Northern Ireland, where a political party is helping keep Prime Minister Theresa May in power.
May spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday and reiterated the importance of the Bombardier jobs in Northern Ireland, her office said. 
Amid anger over the Boeing challenge, Canada last year scrapped plans to buy the planemaker's 18 Super Hornet fighter jets.
Boeing argues its business was hurt because Bombardier received illegal government subsidies and dumped the CSeries through the 2016 sale of 75 jets to Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL).
Bombardier says Boeing never used its smallest plane, the 737 MAX 7, to compete for the order. No C Series planes have been delivered yet.
""How can you have an outcome that assesses injury when there is no export even taking place?"" the Canadian source asked.
Ottawa has yet to work out how it will react to the expected ruling, the source added, citing the number of different actors involved.

The ITC is expected to make a decision on Friday. For Bombardier to win, at least three of the body's four commissioners would have to rule for the Canadian planemaker.

1353,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 01:31PM ET</span>",Myanmar says Richardson dropped from advisory panel,"By Yimou Lee
YANGON (Reuters) - Veteran U.S. diplomat Bill Richardson was pursuing ""his own agenda"" when he was asked to step down from Myanmar's international advisory board on the Rohingya crisis, a statement from the Myanmar government said on Thursday.
Richardson said in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday that he was resigning from the board because it was conducting a ""whitewash"" and accused Myanmar's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, of lacking ""moral leadership"".
The departure of Richardson, a former Clinton administration cabinet member, came as the 10-member advisory board was making its first visit to western Rakhine State, from where around 688,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled in recent months.
A U.S. official, who spoke on Thursday on condition of anonymity, said the issues raised by Richardson had reinforced concerns about Myanmar’s handling of the Rohingya crisis, but the official said the United States would likely stick to its ”measured” approach of applying limited pressure on Myanmar and avoiding more drastic measures that could destabilize the situation.
Thursday's statement from Suu Kyi's office said it became evident in discussions on Jan. 22 that Richardson's intent was not to provide advice ""but to pursue his own agenda"".
""In view of the difference of opinion that developed, the government decided that his continued participation on the board would not be in the best interest of all concerned,"" the statement added.
A separate statement from the nine remaining members of the advisory board on Thursday said they met this week ""with open minds"" and agreed ""to speak with one voice"".
""Therefore, any statement about the Advisory Board 'whitewashing' or 'cheerleading' for anyone lacks complete legitimacy,"" the board said. 
The board was informed that Richardson ""had to be asked to leave"", it said.
Former South African Defence Minister Roelof Petrus Meyer, one of the four remaining international members of the board, said Richardson's departure was ""really unfortunate"".
After touring temporary repatriation camps set up by Myanmar, Meyer said he thought the country was ready to take back the Rohingya refugees under an agreement with Bangladesh, where they are currently sheltering.
""The security will be provided...the subject is so internationally covered so I don't think people should be scared,"" he said. 
ARGUMENT WITH SUU KYI
Richardson said in the interview that he got into an argument with Suu Kyi during a meeting on Monday, when he brought up the case of two Reuters reporters who are on trial accused of breaching the country's Officials Secrets Act.
He said Suu Kyi's response was ""furious"", saying the case of the reporters ""was not part of the work of the advisory board"". The argument continued at a dinner later that evening, the former New Mexico governor said.
Richardson accused Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, of lacking ""moral leadership"" for declining to speak out against the Myanmar military's campaign in northern Rakhine. 
The armed forces have been accused by Rohingya witnesses and human rights activists of carrying out killings, rapes and arson in a campaign senior officials in the United Nations and United States have described as ethnic cleansing. Myanmar rejects that label and has denied nearly all the allegations.
Reporters Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, had worked on Reuters coverage of the crisis in Rakhine. They were detained on Dec. 12 after they had been invited to meet police officers over dinner in Yangon.
On Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert called Richardson's departure from the board and his reasons for doing so ""cause for concern"", but noted he had been acting as a private citizen.
The U.S. official, who spoke on Thursday on condition of anonymity, said the Trump administration would be watching to see how Myanmar deals with the issues Richardson raised.
Washington has sought to balance its wish to nurture the civilian-led government in Myanmar, where it competes for influence with China, with its desire to hold the military accountable for the abuses.
“Bill Richardson rightly wanted nothing to do with Aung San Suu Kyi’s efforts to cover up the Burmese military’s crimes against humanity toward the Rohingya,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch.
The Advisory Board for the Committee for Implementation of the Recommendations on Rakhine State was set up by Myanmar last year, to advise on enacting the findings of an earlier commission headed by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
Thursday's statement from Suu Kyi's office said the government was committed to ""implementing the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State to the fullest extent possible and in the shortest timeframe, in accordance with the situation on the ground"".
In its own statement, the advisory board said it was recommending that U.N. agencies, including the UNHCR, should be invited to take part in the return and resettlement of the Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh.
In an apparent reference to the military's counter-insurgency campaign, launched after Rohingya militant attacks on Aug. 25, the statement called for an ""independent fact-finding commission"" to look into ""the situation in Rakhine state after August 2017"".

The commission statement also calls for ""wider media access to all affected areas in Rakhine State"".

1354,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",CFM says LEAP engine output four-five weeks behind schedule,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - CFM International is 4-5 weeks behind schedule in producing its new LEAP jet engine for Airbus and Boeing jets, but remains confident about ramping up output this year.
Company executives said it was also handling queries from planemakers about potential further increases in demand.
The engine maker, co-owned by  General Electric  (N:GE) and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), aims to produce 1,100-1,200 of the fuel-saving engines in 2018 after delivering 459 last year, executives said on a media conference call on Thursday.
CFM, which supplies all engines for the Boeing (N:BA) 737 and competes with Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) to power the Airbus A320neo, is in the midst of a product changeover while handling higher than expected demand for the older CFM56.
The Cincinnati-based venture is working to catch up on production, but is meanwhile having to address teething issues with the version of the LEAP-1A engine developed for Airbus.
CFM is about half way through overhauling some 70 LEAP-1A engines after quality problems with a turbine disc, announced by Safran last July, executive vice-president Allen Paxson said.
The problem is different from one that disrupted flight tests of the Boeing 737 MAX last year, but the part of the engine involved includes some of the same suppliers, he added.
A further problem with the coating used on a part inside the Airbus version has triggered efforts to allow the engines to stay on the wing for longer before they need to be maintained.
Deliveries of the competing Airbus A320neo family have been delayed mainly by technical problems with the Geared Turbofan engine from Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies (N:UTX), but also by industrial issues at CFM, Airbus says.
CFM had earlier targeted 1,200 deliveries this year, but executives said it was not toning down its assessment of production capabilities or the state of its huge supply chain.
As LEAP engine production cranks up and airlines respond to an unexpectedly strong rise in traffic numbers, CFM has been responding to higher demand for current-generation engines.
Planemakers have meanwhile begun sounding out CFM about pushing single-aisle aircraft production plans higher, beyond their targeted levels of up to 60 aircraft a month each for Airbus and Boeing by 2019.
""We are answering requests of the airframers for information about our ability to support possible higher rates. These are nothing but the standard discussions we have with manufacturers,"" executive vice president Francois Bastin said.
Industry sources say Airbus is evaluating the case for raising A320 production as high as 70 jets a month.
The industry is already accelerating at a record pace on the back of demand led by emerging markets, but engine makers have been particularly wary about overtaxing their suppliers.
Air Lease (N:AL) Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy told the Airline Economics conference in Dublin this week that current production plans were ""realistic,"" barring a setback in demand.
CFM said it had received orders for 3,444 engines worth $46 billion at list prices in 2017, including 2,870 LEAP engines.

It has so far won orders or commitments for 14,270 LEAP.

1355,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 01:01PM ET</span>",Soothe the financial bite of a 'bad' dog,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK(Reuters) - Try to imagine the ""world's worst dog,"" and you probably think of the incorrigible Marley, from John Grogan’s bestselling book and big-screen adaptation “Marley & Me.”
But virtually everyone knows a pup who leaves a trail of destruction in their wake. Cute? Sometimes. Expensive? Frequently.
Just owning a dog can be a pricy proposition: first-year costs average $1,471 for a small dog, $1,779 for a medium-sized dog and almost $2,008 for a large dog, according to the ASPCA. 
Throw in mangled Louboutin heels, some chewed-up furniture - and a lawsuit or two - and you are talking serious money.
Exhibit A: Dodo, an 8-year-old mixed terrier with a long record of misdeeds. Over the years living in Turin, Italy, Pietro Reviglio, a 41-year-old artist and filmmaker, has tallied up this bill: chewed up euro bills ($50), computer cables ($90) and various items of clothing ($250).
Then there are Dodo's ""biggest enemies"" - doors - which the dog has assaulted to the tune of $12,500 in damages.
Reviglio has shelled out $750 for dog training and $150 for a behaviorist, who tried prescribing pills to curb Dodo's aggressive behavior, to no avail. And the trainer ended up with a bloody thumb.
""A priest even sprinkled him with holy water, but Dodo didn't appreciate it and chased him out of the house,"" Reviglio said.
If you have a mischievous dog, you have to be careful about more than just household items that might get chewed. 
""Dogs that are curious and adventurous can cause a lot of financial distress,"" said Rob Jackson, CEO and co-founder of pet insurer Healthy Paws.
If you have a dog that tends to love trouble, consider these remedies:
* Insure the dog
Pet health insurance is one easy way to fend off expenses from indiscriminate chewers. While monthly premiums vary on factors like age, location and breed, Jackson says coverage for a two-year-old mixed breed might run you about $40 a month.
This will cover some extremely common mishaps, such as when chewed objects get lodged in their systems. The diagnostics alone can cost $1,000-$1,500, said Jackson. And if surgery is needed to get it out, that is another $3,000 minimum.
Stomach issues, often resulting from unapproved munchies, are the No. 1 condition for both dogs and cats, according to the latest ""Cost of Pet Health Care"" report from Healthy Paws.
* Insure yourself
If you dog eats your kid's homework, that can be replaced easily enough. If your dog bites another dog or a person, that is serious business.
Injuries could run into the tens of thousands of dollars. And it is more common than you might realize. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, around 4.5 million Americans get bitten by dogs every year.
Homeowners' insurance policies typically cover such events – and, in fact, dog bites are among the top claims filed under such policies every year. Securing additional umbrella liability - say, another $1 million in coverage that sits atop your other policies, for a few hundred bucks a year - is also an extremely wise idea.
That will give you some peace of mind when your yellow lab smashes into an elderly lady and topples her over - as happened to San Francisco writer and editor John Diaz, whose says his dog Paws rivaled Marley for the ""world's worst"" designation. While he was not sued, it was easily his ""most harrowing moment"" of being a dog owner, said Diaz.
* Get training - for you and the dog. But invest early, while your dog is young.
""Money spent quickly, up front, can save you a lot of emotional and financial heartaches down the road,"" said Jackson. The American Kennel Club estimates an average of $340 for initial training, and an additional $254/year for ongoing training thereafter.
Toronto's Corey Goldman went this route when his miniature Australian Shepherd Ollie started throwing his tiny weight around. 

""He would nip at people, tear things apart, terrorize the kids. He's very alpha - and we didn't know if we could take much more,"" said Goldman, a financial-services writer who noted Ollie finally settled down after $1,600 worth of training sessions.

1357,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 12:51PM ET</span>",Column: Using 529 funds to pay for private school? Check new rules,"By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Uncle Sam has given families the green light to use $10,000 per child each year to pay for private schools out of 529 savings plans, but parents cannot count on states to give them the same tax break.
A new tax law went into effect on Jan. 1, leaving states scrambling to implement provisions that let families tap state-sponsored college savings plans for private elementary or secondary schools without owing taxes on the withdrawal. 
Some states, like New York and Nebraska, put pop-up warnings on their 529 college plan websites, saying that families should not assume their state will follow federal laws. The state treasurer's office of Illinois, for one, does not intend to open the its program to private school tuition. 
Currently, all states follow the federal government tax rules in one way: They all let people remove money from 529 plans and use it for college without paying taxes. But 33 states also give families additional tax deductions and credits when they contribute to 529 plans. The fate of those benefits is now unclear as states re-examine their rules in light of federal changes.
Only about 20 states currently automatically align their state laws on 529 plans to whatever the federal government decides, according to Paul Curley, director of college saving research for Strategic Insight. 
Many states will have to decide what to do next. States that have laws that specifically require 529 money go toward only college or higher education such as a technical school will also need to clarify their position for 2018 and the future. 
If they stick with the requirement to use 529s for college, the money parents take out for K-12 private school tuition may be considered a non-qualified distribution. That means people would have to pay taxes and perhaps even penalties.
In states that do not end up following the new federal rules, there is more at stake for families than simply paying taxes on the money they withdraw to pay tuition for a private school. Some states give people who save in 529 plans rewards every year they contribute to the plan. The reward may be either a deduction or a tax credit.
Unless some laws are changed, families could be forced to pay back the tax credits or deductions they received for putting money into 529 accounts if they use their savings for private school, said James DiUlio, chairman of the College Savings Plans Network, an umbrella group for the state plans.
The impact will vary by state, said Susie Bauer, senior vice president and 529 manager for Baird Private Wealth Management. She estimates that in Iowa, parents with $100,000 in income who contribute $1,500 a year for each of their two children to a 529 could owe $202 for each year if they spend that money on K-12 costs. In New York, parents with $100,000 in income might owe $146 for $3,000 in yearly contributions. In Illinois, the estimated amount is $84 per year, Bauer said.
How the money would be recovered is unclear.
In Illinois, as in many states, people either have tuition payments sent directly from the 529 to a college, or a parent pays tuition and requests that they be reimbursed from their 529 plan. Reimbursements are difficult to police but could be detected in an audit, said Illinois Treasurer spokesman Greg Rivara.  
The money involved at the state level is significant. According to the Illinois Revenue Department, the state gives up $29 million in revenue for 529 tax breaks to encourage college savings. In California, it is estimated at $55 million. 
States stand to lose millions more if parents start using these plans heavily for K-12 educations, keeping money in the accounts for a very short amount of time before spending it.

1364,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>","Brexit could push 4,000-plus JPMorgan jobs from Britain","By Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) could move more than 4,000 jobs out of Britain if Brexit talks result in a divergence of regulations and trade agreements between Britain and the European Union, the U.S. banking giant's chief executive said on Thursday.
""If they determine you can't have reciprocal trade practices, reciprocal regulations ... It would be more than 4,000,"" CEO Jamie Dimon said in a BBC interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
Such an outcome could represent a threat to London's future as a financial center, Dimon said.
That 4,000 jobs figure represents the longer-term total that could move, Dimon said, with the actual number likely to be fewer if Britain secures more favorable terms. 
In the short term the bank will move between 500 and 1,000 jobs, he said, after Britain's formal exit from the EU, scheduled for March 29, 2019.
The wide range of potential outcomes at JPMorgan reflects the changing prospects of Britain securing a deal that gives its financial businesses continued access to European markets. 
Britain's finance minister told business chiefs in Davos on Thursday that the country is seeking such an arrangement.
After saying in the aftermath of the June 2016 referendum on Britain's membership of the EU that about 4,000 jobs would move, Dimon said in an April letter to shareholders that it would be likely to shift far fewer jobs to European financial hubs.
Dimon's comments on Thursday that the total could end up being more than 4,000 represent his starkest assessment yet of the impact of a so-called hard Brexit, under which Britain loses access to the EU's single market.
It is among the highest estimates by a single financial company of the number of jobs it would move out of Britain. 
About 10,000 finance jobs will be shifted out of Britain or created overseas in the next few years if it is denied access to Europe's single market, a Reuters survey in September found.

1373,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Telecom Italia deputy chairman gives up operational powers - sources,"MILAN (Reuters) - Telecom Italia's (MI:TLIT) Deputy Chairman Giuseppe Recchi has given up operational powers, two sources with knowledge of the matter said, in the latest sign of turmoil at the helm of Italy's biggest phone group.
The sources also said the group was set to file an extraordinary appeal to Italy's head of state against a so-called ""golden power"" decree giving the government special powers over companies of strategic national importance.
TIM has put forward proposals over how to implement the decree and is still waiting for answer. A source close to the company said the appeal was a ""technical move"" to keep options open for the company.
Recchi is set to stay on as board member, the sources said.  Telecom Italia  had no immediate comment.
Recchi has been TIM's chairman from 2014 until the middle of last year, when he was replaced by Arnaud de Puyfontaine, the chief executive of French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) which is TIM's single largest shareholder.

Since becoming the top investor, Vivendi has ousted two CEOs at Telecom Italia. Several sources have said there are tensions between Vivendi and TIM's latest CEO but the company this week denied a report suggesting he could be on the way out.

1387,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>","Nestle, Atari settle lawsuit over Kit Kat campaign","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) has settled a lawsuit in which Atari SA accused the Swiss food company of using the hit 1970s video game ""Breakout"" without permission to sell Kit Kat bars.
U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, dismissed Atari's copyright infringement case on Wednesday after the companies settled, court records show.
""The action was resolved through a mutually acceptable confidential settlement agreement,"" Nestle said in an email on Thursday. Atari and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""Breakout,"" a follow-up to the classic game ""Pong,"" was created by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) co-founder Steve Wozniak with help from fellow co-founder Steve Jobs. It required a player to knock down rows of colored bricks with a paddle.
Atari accused Nestle of replacing the bricks with brown Kit Kat bars and using them in a Kit Kat Bites commercial titled ""Kit Kat: Breakout"" that showed adults and children using paddles to knock the bars down.
Nestle and its U.S. and U.K. affiliates did this to encourage ""nostalgic Baby Boomers, Generation X, and even today's Millennial and post-Millennial 'gamers'"" to buy Kit Kat, Atari said in court papers last August.
The ad ran only in the United Kingdom and stopped running before Atari filed its lawsuit, Nestle has said.
Last week, Nestle said it would sell its U.S. candy business to Italy's Ferrero SpA for $2.8 billion.

Nestle plans to keep selling Kit Kat globally, but not in the United States, where Hershey Co owns the brand.

(Reuters) - Wall Street analysts will grill  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) executives on how massive security flaws in its computer chips are impacting business when the company reports quarterly results on Thursday.
Intel has said there would be no material cost to it from security flaws, dubbed Meltdown and Spectre, that were disclosed on Jan. 3 since both could be solved with software. But the real-world effects on productivity are still being determined.
""As an investor you want to know what’s going to happen in the future and how it’s going to impact their margins,"" said Kim Forrest, a portfolio manager with Fort Pitt Capital Group, which holds about 728,000 Intel shares.
She wants more information about Intel's plans for a long-term fix to the problem, including details on cost and how the changes might affect chip performance.
An Intel spokeswoman declined to discuss the results ahead of their release.
Intel has stumbled in its response to the flaws, asking customers to stop using some patches which themselves have bugs. Customers might use the flaws and Intel's response as a negotiating point to seek discounts, which could pressure Intel's operating income.
Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist with Inverness Counsel, says his firm will avoid adding Intel to its $2.8 billion portfolio until more details emerge on how Intel will address the flaws.
""What we really need is transparency,"" said Ghriskey, who said the issue could cause Intel to miss future revenue or profit targets. 
It's still not clear how long it will take to resolve the problem, said Daniel Ives, head of technology research with GBH Insights.
""Investors have handicapped that it’s going to be negligible damage,"" Ives said. ""How they handle this over the next few months will dictate whether there is any long-term damage.""
Wall Street analysts have said they are comfortable with Intel's assessment that the flaws will not derail earnings. 
“I don’t think the financial impact is going to be that material,” Joseph Gunnar & Co analyst Ashok Kumar told Reuters.
Baird Equity Research analyst Tristan Gerra said he expects revenue in Intel's high-margin data center chip business to grow 7 percent in 2018, the same rate it rose in the third quarter. 

If the company suggests that the security flaws could cause it to fall short of that rate, then the stock could suffer, Gerra said.

1396,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: J&J out of race for Pfizer's $20 billion consumer unit as deadline looms,"By Pamela Barbaglia, Bill Berkrot and Arno Schuetze
LONDON/NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) has pulled out of the race to buy Pfizer's (N:PFE) consumer health business, leaving GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) and  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) among those preparing bids, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Bidders have until Feb. 1 to submit their non-binding offers for the unit, which makes Advil painkiller, Centrum multivitamins and Chapstick lip balm, five banking sources said.
U.S. drugmaker  Pfizer , which has not made public any details about the sale process, wants to sell the business for no less than $20 billion, two of the sources added.
J&J was widely seen as one of the strongest contenders as the American healthcare giant wants to continue expanding its portfolio and has the financial muscle for a big acquisition. It initially worked with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on a possible bid but subsequently decided to pull out, the sources said.
""While we would normally not comment on market speculation or rumors, in this instance we refute assertions that we are in negotiation for Pfizer's consumer business,"" J&J's vice president of media relations Ernie Knewitz told Reuters.
Goldman was not immediately available to comment.
GSK has hired JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Citi to work on the deal, while Reckitt has turned to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), the five sources said.
Britain's GSK and Reckitt declined to comment, as did JPMorgan, while Citi and Bank of America were not available.
A spokeswoman for Pfizer, whose CEO Ian Read wants to focus on prescription medicines, declined to comment on the sale process, saying only that any decision on the future of the unit would be made in 2018. 
The deal could be a game-changer for rival drugmaker GSK or consumer goods group Reckitt by making them one of the biggest global players in consumer health, an increasingly lucrative sector as ageing populations and health-conscious consumers drive demand for self-medication.
Although consumer remedies sold over the counter have lower margins than prescription drugs, they are typically very well known and durable brands with loyal customers. 
PRICE MATTERS
The prospective sale, which is being organized by Centerview Partners, Guggenheim Securities and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), was first mooted on Oct. 10, when Pfizer announced the strategic review for the unit, which had sales of about $3.4 billion in 2016. 
Two of the sources said Pfizer valued the asset at more than 20 times its core earnings, or $20 billion, and was reluctant to accept less.
But J&J's decision to steer clear leaves the drugmaker with one less big bidder, which may affect its negotiating power.
Pfizer sold its previous consumer healthcare business to J&J in 2006 for $16.6 billion and the U.S. group, with interests from baby powder to cancer drugs, had been seen as a logical buyer for the current assets. 
Yet it could have faced possible antitrust problems if it beefs up its presence in the sector, said one of the sources who is familiar with the company.
Pfizer aims to clinch a deal before the summer, another source said, adding that there had been enough interest in the asset to stage a competitive auction.
A sale would confirm the consumer health sector, which is still fragmented, as fertile ground for deal-making following a spate of transactions in recent years.
Other companies that are considering making bids include Swiss consumer food giant Nestle (S:NESN), said the five sources. Nestle's CEO Mark Shneider is a healthcare veteran and wants a deeper focus on nutrition, health and wellness. 
Nestle declined to comment.
The firm recently sold its U.S. confectionery business to Italy's Ferrero for $2.8 billion. It is now seeking to buy Merck (NYSE:MRK) KGaA's (DE:MRCG) consumer health unit, sources have previously told Reuters, as part of its healthcare drive.
But while Pfizer's Centrum vitamin and Caltrate calcium supplements could fit with Nestle's new strategic direction, the U.S. firm's Advil painkillers and Robitussin cough medicine are far removed from its core businesses like coffee, chocolate and baby food, the sources said.
A sixth source said Pfizer was likely to receive five or six bids in total. Pfizer CEO Read said on Oct. 31 that he expected no shortage of suitors for the business. 
Reuters reported on Oct. 10 that established consumer health companies that may bid for Pfizer's unit include Abbott (N:ABT) and Procter & Gamble (N:PG).

NEW YORK (Reuters) - American Airlines (O:AAL) on Thursday reported an 11 percent drop in quarterly profit from a year earlier as labor and fuel costs bloated operating expenses, sending shares lower in premarket trading. American, the No. 1 U.S. carrier by passenger traffic, reported fourth-quarter net profit of $258 million, or 54 cents per share, down $31 million from $289 million, or 56 cents a share, a year earlier. 
The Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier's shares were down 1.2 percent in premarket trading.
On an adjusted basis, American earned 95 cents a share, topping analysts' consensus forecast for 92 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
In 2017, American stunned investors by offering its pilots and flight attendants a mid-contract pay increase that is set to cost $350 million each year in both 2018 and in 2019. 
As a result, quarterly operating expenses climbed 9.8 percent from a year earlier to $9.9 billion, with a 23.5 percent jump in consolidated fuel expenses and a 7 percent increase in salaries and benefits. 
American's results follow reports by rivals Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) earlier this month and United Airlines (N:UAL) earlier this week. 
United's expectation that it would be raising capacity at a clip of between 4 percent and 6 percent each year until 2020 sent sector shares tanking amid concerns of a growing industry airfare war. [L4N1PJ4S4]
In line with its previous guidance, American said it expects its 2018 total system capacity to be up 2.5 percent from a year earlier, though actual capacity growth may be slightly higher following a brutal Atlantic hurricane season last year. 
For the current quarter, American forecasts that total unit revenue will grow 2 percent to 4 percent on the year.

Sky News this week emerged as the major block to Rupert Murdoch buying the shares in Sky it does not already own, although there are options that would allow the $15.7 billion deal to go through.
Regulators want Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) to guarantee the independence of Sky News under Murdoch, who already owns The Sun and the Times newspapers. Options include spinning the loss-making service off into a separate company or selling it, analysts have said.
Sky has already warned regulators that they should not assume it will continue to fund Sky News if the takeover is blocked.
Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch told analysts after the company reported results on Thursday that Sky News was not as important as it was when Sky launched in 1989.
""I wouldn't describe Sky News as critical to the business today, indeed I wouldn't really pick any part of our business and say it is critical,"" he said.
""If for any reason we didn't have Sky News I don't think that would be material, if you like, in terms of the direction of the business.""

1459,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>",Volkswagen's Scania backs Northvolt's $5 billion Swedish battery plant,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Volkswagen-owned (DE:VOWG_p) truckmaker Scania will invest 10 million euros in Northvolt's more than 4 billion euro ($5 billion) project to build Europe's biggest battery plant in northern Sweden.
Sweden's Northvolt, whose CEO Peter Carlsson used to work for Tesla (O:TSLA), is racing against rivals such as South Korea's LG Chem (KS:051910) to set up large-scale battery cell plants across Europe, where automakers and industrial firms have so far been largely reliant on Asian imports.
European automakers such as BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), Volkswagen and Volvo Car Group (HK:0175) are all set to ramp up electric car production in the coming years.
Northvolt and Scania said on Thursday they had agreed to develop and commercialize battery cell technology for heavy commercial vehicles with Scania's investment going toward building Northvolt's planned demo line and research facility.
They have also struck a deal over future purchases of battery cells, they said in a joint statement.
Northvolt's Carlsson wants the Swedish plant to rival U.S. electric carmaker Tesla's Gigafactory in the Nevada desert, targeting annual production equal to 32 gigawatt-hours by 2023.
Last year Northvolt signed partnership deals with Swiss engineering group ABB (S:ABBN) and Danish wind turbine maker Vestas (CO:VWS), but still needs to raise the vast majority of the financing required for the plant.

One of the most powerful women in U.S. business and a former candidate for California governor, Whitman will be moving into a nascent sector much like when she took over eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) in its early stages and turned it into a multi-billion dollar business.
""Getting Meg was a coup as many companies wanted her,"" GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said on Wednesday. 
Whitman starts March 1 at Katzenberg's startup firm, which plans to make Hollywood-style, short-form videos for mobile use.
""This is a change of pace for Meg after stepping down from HP as NewTV and Katzenberg have created a unique business model which has a long runway ahead of it for the coming years,” Ives said.
Several media reports said NewTV is trying to raise about $2 billion, which would be a significant first round of financing for a digital media startup. The firm declined to comment on the funding. Katzenberg is chairman of NewTV.
Whitman, who was reportedly a leading candidate for the chief executive job at ride-hailing firm Uber before it was given to Dara Khosrowshahi, steps down as CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co on Feb. 1.
At HPE, she pulled off one of the biggest corporate breakups in history. She spun off Hewlett Packard Co into HPE and PC-and-printer business HP Inc in 2015, as part of a plan to turn around the corporation.
Whitman previously served on the board of DreamWorks Animation, which Katzenberg co-founded.

1474,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 04:01AM ET</span>",Protein plight: Brazil steals U.S. soybean share in China,"By Karl Plume
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. soybean growers are losing market share in the all-important China market because the race to grow higher-yielding crops has robbed their most prized nutrient: protein.
Declining protein levels make soybeans less valuable to the $400 billion industry that produces feed for cattle, pigs, chickens and fish. And the problem is a key factor driving soybean buyers from the U.S. to Brazil, where warmer weather helps offset the impact of higher crop yields on protein levels.
A decade ago, the United States supplied 38 percent of soybeans to China, the world's top importer, compared to 34 percent from Brazil. Now, Brazil supplies 57 percent of Chinese imports compared to 31 from the United States, according to China's General Administration of Customs.
Soybeans are by far the most valuable U.S. agricultural export, with $22.8 billion in shipments in 2016. Declining protein levels and market share pose another vexing problem for soy farmers already reeling from a global grains glut and years of depressed prices.
The U.S. soybean industry also faces rising competition from a growing number of synthetic and organic alternative feeds that provide more protein for less money.
These are troubling trends for the $41 billion U.S. soybean sector, but the industry's response has yet to take on much urgency. That's because the erosion of protein levels has come over many years, and many industry players still have short-term economic incentives to prioritize higher yields over higher protein.
(For graphic on soybean yield, protein content and market share, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2CXgKQE)
Protein levels have fallen as biotechnology and other breeding advances have pushed yield per acre to record highs, which dilutes protein content. But U.S. farmers can still make more money producing higher volumes of lower-protein crops because they only get an additional 3 to 5 cents a bushel for higher-protein beans.
Over the long term, however, falling protein levels could have dire consequences for the U.S. industry as a whole - especially in China, which buys two-thirds of all soybeans traded in the world market to feed its vast livestock operations.
""China needs soybeans, and we're at risk of becoming a residual supplier if we don't work on protein improvements,"" said North Dakota farmer Jared Hagert, a director and past chairman of the United Soybean Board (USB), an industry association.
HIGHER YIELDS, LOWER PROTEIN
The USB and other industry advocates are starting to take the protein problem seriously. The industry group will spend $5.6 million in fiscal year 2018 on research and other efforts to boost protein, up from $3.7 million last year.
They face a tough task. Like many farmers, the agribusiness giants that develop seed technology, such as  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) Co and DowDuPont Inc, have little incentive to focus on raising protein levels. 
Seed developers have had great success boosting yields through traditional breeding methods and genetic engineering to make crops use less water, tolerate weed killers and grow better in colder or drier climates. But they have yet to crack the genetic code that would raise protein content without hurting yield, seed breeders said.
At DowDuPont, scientists have identified some promising leads in boosting protein without hurting crop yields, said Steve Schnebly, senior research manager with the agriculture division of DowDuPont. But any commercially viable solution could be two decades away, he said, and isn't a company priority. 
""Our major objective to our farmer customers is maximum yield,"" Schnebly said.
Monsanto, the world's largest seed producer, currently has no genetic research projects focusing on elevating protein, spokeswoman Christi Dixon said in a written statement.
""Market potential and demand doesn't warrant the R&D investment,"" she said.
The protein decline coincides with a rise of cheaper and more abundant alternative feeds available to livestock and poultry producers. They include distillers grains, a byproduct of the ethanol production process, and synthetic amino acids that are mixed with corn to mimic soymeal.
Jeff Knott, a swine nutrition consultant and owner of Minnesota-based Ideal Animal Nutrition, creates recipes with such alternatives for hog feed used by producers in several Midwest states.
""Compared to 20 years ago, we're probably feeding 70 percent less soybean meal than we used to,"" he said. ""And it's all economically driven.""
LOWER PROTEIN, LOWER EXPORTS
Brazilian soybean producers use the same genetically modified seeds as their U.S. counterparts, and have also seen a reduction in protein content. 
But Brazilian growers retain an crucial edge in protein thanks to warmer weather and longer days. The nation's soybeans contain 37 percent protein on average, according to data from Embrapa, the government's agriculture research agency.
That compares to 34.1 percent for U.S. crops in 2017 - a record low, according to the U.S. Soybean Export Council.
The protein shortfall in this season's crop has prompted U.S. processors such as Bunge Ltd to cut the amount of protein they can guarantee in soymeal they sell.
Brazil's three-percentage-point protein advantage is plenty enough to sway many buyers, especially when combined with the nation's recent efforts to expand production and reduce shipping delays. Since overtaking the United States as the world's top soybean exporter in 2013, Brazil has boosted production by about 40 percent.
Expanded port capacity in northern Brazil and lower freight costs have widened the country's advantage in China, said a Brazilian trader with a large exporting company.
""Brazil's soybeans on average have less impurities and higher protein content,"" said the trader, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. ""Some destinations will pay a premium for that.""
Protein is paramount for Chinese importers, two managers at soy crushing plants and one soy meal buyer at a pig producer told Reuters in interviews.
""Feed producers mainly consider the cost of the soy meal - the price, and the amount of protein it contains,"" said a swine feed buyer who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak. ""With more supplies from Brazil ... we don't necessarily need to buy beans from the U.S.""
SCRAMBLING FOR SOLUTIONS 
The United Soybean Board has launched a pilot project at a small number of processors and grain elevators - facilities that store and load grain for shipping - to record and analyze the protein content of soybeans delivered by local farmers. 
The effort aims to provide highly localized data in the hope that farmers will select seed varieties that produce higher-protein crops and that soybean buyers will pay them a premium.
Other USB efforts include financing genetics research to boost protein, including studies by researchers at the University of Illinois and by scientists at DuPont (NYSE:DWDP) Pioneer.
""We've got to be cognizant as to what kind of product we are providing the end user,"" said Hagert, the USB director.
Another study - conducted by the University of Wisconsin and paid for by the Illinois Soybean Association and the U.S. Soybean Export Council - suggests that farmers can better compete with synthetic alternatives by planting beans with a specific amino acid balance.
Such soybeans can save hog feeders up to $3 a head and save chicken producers 7 cents a bird, said the study's lead author, John Osthus.
""Right now, there are synthetic amino acid companies that are undermining U.S. market share,"" Osthus said. ""If we don't do something about this, we're missing a huge market opportunity.""

Later Thursday, the ECB was expected to leave interest rates unchanged. Investors will be especially focusing on the press conference following the decision for any clues on the central bank's future policy moves.
Meanwhile, markets were still jittery after White House officials on Tuesday said that U.S. President Donald Trump was planning on using his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Friday to underline his ""America First"" policies.
Such policies include a potential withdrawal from the North American free-trade agreement and disavowing the global climate change accord.

In London, FTSE 100 dipped 0.02%, weighed by  Sage Group  (LON:SGE), whose shares lost 1.41% after saying, in a trading update on Wednesday, that while its North American unit has “performed strongly”, France “continues to significantly underperform relative to the rest of the group, weighing on both organic revenue and recurring revenue growth.”
 Diageo  (LON:DGE) added to losses, as shares dropped tumbled 0.93% after the distiller posted a stronger than expected rise in first-half organic net sales, but warned that the rising pound would weigh on its profits over the remainder of the period.
In the financial sector, stocks were mixed. Lloyds Banking (LON:LLOY) dipped 0.07% and  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) slid 0.38%, while the Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) added 0.17% and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) rose 0.24%.

1480,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 02:09AM ET</span>",Asia shares hit record peak but trade protectionist fears cast shadow,"By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks hit a record high on Thursday though concerns about the Trump administration's protectionist stance tempered enthusiasm in financial markets, while the dollar struggled after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin welcomed a weaker currency.
European shares are expected to tick up slightly, with spread-betters seeing a small rise of 0.1 percent in Britain's FTSE, Germany's DAX and France's Cac. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.3 percent to an all-time peak for the ninth session in a row.
Japan's Nikkei fell 1.1 percent, hit by the dollar's decline against the yen.
MSCI ACWI, the index provider's broadest gauge of the world's stock markets, boosted its gains for the month to 6.6 percent. It had registered declines only on two days this year amid optimism over an extended growth spurt in the global economy and solid earnings.
A Reuters poll of over 500 economists showed the global economy is expected to grow at the fastest pace since 2010.
The upbeat mood, however, has come up against renewed fears of protectionism after U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to impose steep import tariffs on washing machines and solar panels earlier in the week.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, hinted at action against China, saying U.S. trade authorities were investigating whether there is a case for taking action over China's infringements of intellectual property.
Trump is scheduled to speak in Davos on Thursday.
Also in the Swiss Alpine town, Mnuchin made a major departure from traditional U.S. currency policy on Wednesday, saying ""obviously a weaker dollar is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities."" 
Analysts say they cannot remember any U.S. Treasury Secretary openly embracing a cheaper dollar at least in the last two decades or so.
""I was speculating the Trump administration may role out something with fanfare given its big delegation to Davos,"" said Masayuki Kichikawa, chief macro strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management.
""I'd think the real aim of Mnuchin's comments on the dollar is not so much engineering a weaker dollar per se as putting pressure on trading partners to do some trade deals with the administration,"" he added. 
The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies tumbled to a three-year low of 88.816, falling 1.9 percent so far this week.
The euro rose to as high as $1.2459, a peak not scaled since December 2014, ahead of the European Central Bank's policy meeting later in the day.
The meeting comes against a backdrop of heightened speculation over when it will end its vast stimulus and signal a rise in interest rates from record lows.
The dollar slipped to 108.74 yen, its lowest levels since mid-September.
The Chinese yuan also strengthened, gaining 0.5 percent to 6.3280 yuan per dollar in onshore trade, hitting its highest level since November 2015.
It rose 2.7 percent so far this month. The gains, if sustained, would mark the biggest monthly rise ever. 
Gold jumped past its September peak to 1-1/2-year high of $1,365.8 per ounce. A break above its July 2016 high around $1,375 would take it to a four-year high.
Brazilian markets might be in for another strong day following rally in the real and shares on Wednesday after an appeals court upheld the corruption conviction of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a major blow to the popular politician's plans to run again for the presidency this year.
He was perceived to be not friendly to markets, even though his eight-year reign from 2003 saw strong gains in Brazilian shares and currency.
Oil prices rallied to three-year high, boosted by a record 10th straight weekly decline in U.S. crude inventories, though reduced refining activity and rising production signaled U.S. stocks could rise in coming weeks.
International benchmark Brent futures were nudging $71 per barrel - $71.03 a barrel at 0232 GMT - a level not seen since early December 2014 and up 45 cents, or 0.6 percent, from their last close.

Bitcoin extended its rebound from Tuesday's low of $9,927 to $11,541, up 1 percent so far in Asia.

The business development talks are at an initial stage, and it is not clear if they will lead to any cooperation, the person said, declining to be named.
The discussions come as U.S. e-commerce company Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has expanded aggressively into groceries with its acquisition of Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM).
The talks between the two firms were reported earlier by the New York Post.
Spokespeople for Kroger in the United States and Alibaba in China did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
This week Amazon opened to the public its Amazon Go checkout-free grocery store, which relies on cameras and sensors to track what shoppers remove from the shelves.
Amazon's renewed push into groceries with last year's Whole Foods acquisition put pressure on leading U.S. supermarket Kroger to improve technology including mobile ordering and delivery. Kroger is rolling out curbside pickup as one way to fend off Amazon. 
Alibaba has been making an aggressive push into working with U.S. and Canadian companies that could be interested in selling in China as well as rolling out its cloud services and payment products. The talks with Kroger were not CEO-level, said the person, describing Kroger as one of many U.S. companies holding initial discussions with the Chinese company. 
In China, Alibaba's Hema supermarket chain has become a test bed for the e-commerce firm's move into traditional retail, where mobile phones are used to order, pay and get information about items.

Kroger, which wants to sell more general merchandise like Amazon and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), could direct customers to the Alibaba site, where they could buy general merchandise, the New York Post reported, citing a source.

1485,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 11:10PM ET</span>",Puerto Rico sees no debt payment ability until 2022,"By Nick Brown
(Reuters) - Puerto Rico's governor projected his bankrupt, hurricane-ravaged U.S. territory will carry budget gaps for the next four fiscal years, leaving nothing to pay back the island's $72 billion in bond debt until fiscal year 2022.
Governor Ricardo Rossello made the projections in a revised fiscal turnaround plan released overnight on Thursday. 
The plan assumes a minimum of $35.3 billion in federal aid to help the island recover from Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in September, through the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) public assistance program.
A previous turnaround plan, approved by Puerto Rico's federally appointed financial oversight board last April, had projected $800 million a year for debt repayment, roughly a quarter of what it needs annually. That was before Maria slammed Puerto Rico, killing dozens, cutting power to all 3.4 million residents, and damaging and destroying tens of billions of dollars in housing.
The new plan projects that Maria will spur increased inflation and nearly triple a contraction in gross national product this fiscal year, as well as drive some 600,000 more people from the island in the next five years.
That outlook led to a projected annual budget gap of around $8 billion, Rossello said at a roundtable with reporters on Wednesday. The government whittled that gap down to between $2 billion and $3.5 billion, through reforms like subsidy cuts to towns and the University of Puerto Rico, measures to boost tax collection, improvements to government procurement, and the streamlining of public agencies.
A small surplus is seen for the first time in fiscal 2022.
""One of the main pillars of the fiscal plan is that we achieve structural balance by fiscal 2022,"" Rossello said.
The figures will likely change. The island's oversight board can request tweaks and must approve a final version by late February.
    
FEDERAL AID
The $35.3 billion minimum projection by Rossello for federal disaster aid is derived from FEMA's public assistance program, which provides money to governments for debris removal, life-saving measures and public facility repairs.
Rossello said the projection was based on FEMA's own estimates and that the program ""has been legislated and has never been underfunded.""
The governor is seeking a total of $94 billion in federal aid, though the latest disaster aid package currently under discussion in the U.S. Congress is much smaller.
Even before Maria, Puerto Rico was reeling under $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt and a poverty rate around 46 percent. It filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history last May.
Although creditors are expected to take dramatic repayment cuts in the bankruptcy, they may balk at the prospect of no payment for five years.
Puerto Rico's benchmark 2035 general obligation debt, which trades like an equity given that it is in default, last traded at 27.495 cents on the dollar. The bond was issued in 2014 with an 8 percent coupon.    
In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Natalie Jaresko, the executive director of the oversight board, downplayed the significance of a potential budget gap, stressing the importance of long-term structural changes like labor reform.
At the time of the interview, Jaresko said she had not seen the plan, but that even if no money were available to pay debt for five years, ""that doesn't mean there's not money available in years six through 30.""

""I know your readers are the creditors,"" she said, ""but for them, for all stakeholders, for people who live on this island and want to see jobs and better education and better healthcare results, the structural reforms are equally if not more important.""

The legislation would broaden the government's power to stop foreign purchases of U.S. firms by strengthening the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).
The bills ""would achieve the twin aims of protecting national security and preserving the longstanding United States open investment policy,"" the White House said.
The bills, introduced in November by Republican Senator John Cornyn and Republican Representative Robert Pittenger, have Republican and Democratic co-sponsors. The Senate Banking Committee will hold a hearing on the topic on Thursday.
The legislation would expand CFIUS' reach to allow it to review, and potentially reject, smaller investments and add new national security factors for CFIUS to consider. Those factors include whether information about Americans, such as Social Security numbers, would be exposed as part of the transaction or whether the deal would facilitate fraud.
CFIUS already has a reputation for being tough on high-tech deals involving China in particular and has blocked transactions that involve sophisticated semiconductors.
It has become more cautious since President Donald Trump was inaugurated a year ago amid growing political and economic tensions between the United States and China.

The panel has balked at approving a broader range of deals from China since the inauguration, according to lawyers who specialize in representing proposed transactions to the board.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - More executives have departed BlueMountain Capital Management as the hedge fund posted disappointing results last year, two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The latest to leave the $22 billion firm were Derek Smith, a partner and senior investment adviser who has been with BlueMountain since 2008, and Dave Gibbs, a senior credit trader at the firm since October 2004. Both left in December.
""Like any company, BlueMountain undergoes changes in the make-up of its team that reflect the needs of investors and market dynamics,"" a spokesman said in an emailed statement on Wednesday. ""The result is that the firm remains nimble, responsive and well-positioned to continue to thrive,"" he added.
Performance at the firm was lackluster in 2017.
BlueMountain's Credit Alternatives Fund gained 1 percent and its Global Volatility Fund gained 0.05 percent for the year, according to a report from HSBC's Alternative Investment Group seen by Reuters. The hedge fund benchmark HFRI Asset Weighted Composite Index gained 6.5 percent for the year.
The spokesman, Tom Vogel, declined to comment on the firm's returns. 
Others to leave last year were credit portfolio manager Marina Lutova, who also left December to join Citadel LLC, and Peter Greatrex, a managing partner and head of private investments, who left in February.
The firm said in a regulatory filing in March 2017 that it employed roughly 238 people in New York and London.
BlueMountain said it hired 50 people in 2017, including Michael Mauboussin as director of research in May and Lance Rosen as head of equities in June. 
In July, the firm named Lee Kempler as chief operating officer for investments, a newly created role, and hired Claudio Macchetto, who had been with hedge fund Paulson & Co, as head of platform distribution.
This month, Guillaume Cendrier joined as portfolio manager for Relative Value Credit.
BlueMountain, co-founded by Andrew Feldstein who is currently its chief investment officer, gained some fame for being one of the hedge funds on the other side of JP Morgan's bet on credit derivatives known as the ""London Whale.""

For a time the hedge fund employed Jes Staley, who had headed JP Morgan's investment bank and is now chief executive officer of  Barclays  (LON:BARC).

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co on Wednesday posted a lower-than-expected quarterly net profit, hurt by rising commodity costs and unfavorable currency exchange rates, and said it expected more pain to come from higher raw material prices in 2018.
Top Ford executives repeatedly stressed in media and investors briefings on Wednesday their focus on improving the automaker's ""fitness"" - a mantra of Jim Hackett, who succeeded Mark Fields last May as chief executive officer - but ducked analysts' repeated requests for more detail. 
Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said a lack of fitness at the No. 2 U.S. automaker meant that higher commodity costs stood out more than at rival companies that are hitting their numbers, even though Ford is using many of the same hedging tools and strategies. 
""We have to be far fitter than we are, regardless of what the future is,"" Shanks said, alluding to a previously announced plan to slash $14 billion in costs over the next five years.
Referring to other efforts to improve the company's fitness, Hackett said Ford in the past eight months had reorganized the business, streamlined the leadership team and accelerated initiatives in electric and self-driving vehicles, as well as shifting investment to trucks and utility vehicles from passenger cars.
""I see operational fitness as much broader than just cost-cutting,"" Hackett said, adding that Ford was focusing its ""fitness redesign"" on improvements in product development, manufacturing and marketing. 
Hackett told frustrated analysts that he would share details later this year with investors and shareholders.
The automaker's shares hit a 12-month high on Jan. 16, the same day it gave a disappointing outlook after the market. Since then, the company's shares have fallen more than 10 percent, hovering around $12 in after-hours trade. 
That decline is a ""report card on our fitness,"" Shanks said.
Ford has been alone among the major automakers in warning that higher prices for metals like aluminum and steel will take a bite out of earnings, and its shares took a dive last week after executives said they could cost the company $1.6 billion in 2018.
The company's profitability has also been declining versus its peers. Ford's automotive operating margin for the quarter fell to 3.7 percent, from 5.7 percent a year earlier. 
DECLINING NEW-VEHICLE MARKET
Ford's battle to improve its margins comes during a declining U.S. market for new vehicles. U.S. sales fell 2 percent in 2017 after hitting a record high in 2016 and are expected to drop further in 2018 as interest rates rise and more late-model used cars come back to dealer lots to compete with new ones.
Rival General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) gave Wall Street analysts a more positive outlook last week, and its shares are up almost 8 percent year to date.
Ford's fourth-quarter results were driven almost entirely by North America, which accounted for $1.6 billion out of $1.7 billion of pre-tax profits. 
The company sold more expensive and profitable vehicles, mainly pickup trucks and SUVs, in North America than in other markets. 
CFO Shanks said that around two-thirds of the $400 million currency exchange hit the company took in the quarter was related to Brexit in Europe.
Ford reported quarterly net income of $2.41 billion or 60 cents per share, versus a loss of $781 million or 20 cents per share a year earlier. Adjusted for one-time items, Ford reported earnings per share of 39 cents. On that basis, analysts had on average expected earnings per share of 42 cents.

Ford said its U.S. employees represented by the United Auto Workers union would receive profit-sharing payments of $7,500 each for 2017.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - American Airlines (O:AAL) and Delta Airlines (N:DAL) said on Wednesday they entered into an agreement to accommodate stranded passengers during events such as winter storms and hurricanes, in a partial revival of an earlier interline deal between the two rivals.
The agreement is meant to reduce the number of passengers stuck in airports because the original carrier was unable to rebook them on a flight of its own. 
""It's a tool that will give our employees more options to reacommodate customers whose Delta flights are canceled during weather and other uncommon scenarios,"" Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant said. 
American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller said the carrier was happy to put the deal in place after Delta reached out several months ago to discuss the return of such an agreement between the two parties. 
Neither Delta nor American detailed the financial specifics of the agreement. 
Prior to its dissolution in September 2015, the two largest U.S. airlines by passenger traffic had a far more comprehensive interline agreement, which among other things allowed for booked travel to include segments operated individually by both Delta and American on the same ticket. 
Interline agreements are a common industry practice, though Delta and American have declined to call their pact an interline deal. 

The deal went into effect on Wednesday.

1491,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 06:31PM ET</span>","Whirlpool profit forecast misses estimates, despite tariffs boost","By Arunima Banerjee
(Reuters) - Whirlpool Corp's (N:WHR) revenue growth unexpectedly slowed in the fourth quarter, and the home appliance maker's full-year profit forecast fell short of market expectations, sending its shares down in trading after the bell on Wednesday.
The company's report comes two days after U.S. President Donald Trump slapped steep tariffs on imported washing machines, a move that Whirlpool expects will boost demand and one that deals a heavy blow to its rivals, Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and LG Electronics (KS:066570).
The two South Korean companies – which hold a quarter of a U.S. market dominated by Whirlpool and  General Electric  Co (N:GE) – have condemned steep tariffs, saying it would lead to higher prices and possible job cuts as investments are canceled.
Indeed, LG said earlier on Wednesday that it would raise prices of most of its washers in the United States. Whirlpool has added 200 jobs at its plant in Clyde, Ohio, in anticipation of higher demand.
Whirlpool, which also makes products such as refrigerators and cooking appliances, has also hiked prices for some of its products to counter the impact of higher costs for raw materials such as steel. Such price hikes will continue this quarter.
But, the Benton Harbor, Michigan-based company said the benefits of cost controls and higher prices were more than offset by rising raw material costs and a drop units sold.
As a result, Whirlpool's fourth-quarter revenue was $5.70 billion, with the 0.8 percent rise the slowest in five quarters.
Analysts were expecting revenue to increase 3.2 percent to $5.84 billion, matching the company's third-quarter growth rate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Revenue in North America, Whirlpool's biggest market, fell marginally, while sales of units worldwide dropped 4.4 percent.
The company's 2018 adjusted profit forecast of $14.50 to $15.50 per share also missed analysts' estimates of $15.52.
Whirlpool, which owns brands such as KitchenAid and Maytag, posted a $268 million loss in the fourth quarter, compared with a $180 million profit a year earlier, due to a $420 million charge related to the U.S. tax reforms.
Excluding the charge, its earning of $4.10 per share handily beat estimates of $3.99.

Whirlpool's shares fell about 1 percent to $177 in after-hours trading. They had gained 7.4 percent in the two days since the tariffs were imposed.

1492,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 06:30PM ET</span>",World Bank economist Paul Romer quits after Chile comments,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Romer stepped down as the World Bank's chief economist on Wednesday after he came under fire for saying that Chile's rankings in a closely watched ""Doing Business"" report may have been deliberately skewed under socialist President Michelle Bachelet.
Romer's resignation, just 15 months after taking the job, was announced in an internal note that was posted by World Bank President Jim Yong Kim and seen by Reuters.
""Paul Romer has informed me that he is stepping down from his position as chief economist, effective immediately,"" Kim said in the announcement.
""I appreciated Paul’s frankness and honesty, and I know he regrets the circumstances of his departure,"" Kim said, adding that Romer would return to his position as economics professor at New York University.
Kim said the World Bank would launch a global search for a new chief economist.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Jan. 12, Romer apologized to Chile for changes to the report's methodology that he said ""conveyed the wrong impression"" about the business environment under Bachelet.
The annual report has long been controversial because it ranks countries based on indicators that grade them on how their government bureaucracies affect, and often limit, their business environments.
Chile currently ranks at 55 out of 190 countries on the list, down from 34 in 2014, the year Bachelet took office. In other recent years its rankings were to 41 in 2015, 48 in 2016 and 57 in 2017, the World Bank's reports show.
Romer told the newspaper that the decline resulted from methodological changes, rather than a deterioration of Chile’s business environment, and may have been the result of the World Bank staff’s political motivations. He told the newspaper he would revise the reports.

1493,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 06:26PM ET</span>",U.S. auto regulator probing Tesla 'Autopilot' crash,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Thursday it was sending investigators to examine the crash of a Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) vehicle, apparently traveling in semi-autonomous mode, and a fire truck in California.
The move follows an announcement on Tuesday by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) that it was sending two investigators to the scene to examine both driver and vehicle factors in Monday's accident in which the driver said the vehicle was operating in ""Autopilot"" mode.
Tesla declined to comment on the new probe. NHTSA said in a statement it was sending a special team to ""investigate the crash and assess lessons learned.""
The government probes escalate the risk for Tesla and automakers at a time when the industry is seeking federal legislation that would ease deployment of self driving cars.
The NTSB can make safety recommendations but only the NHTSA can order automakers to recall unsafe vehicles or fine automakers if they fail to remedy safety defects in a timely fashion. Before the agency could demand a recall from Tesla, it must open a formal investigation, a step it has not yet taken.
The NTSB probe is the safety board's second into a Tesla crash that may be linked to Autopilot, the automaker' s semi-autonomous driver assist system that handles some tasks and allows drivers under certain conditions to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods.
Tesla requires users to agree to keep their hands on the wheel ""at all times"" before they can use Autopilot.
The Culver City, California fire department tweeted on Monday that an engine was struck by a Tesla ""traveling at 65 mph. The driver reports the vehicle was on Autopilot. Amazingly there were no injuries.""
The NTSB faulted Tesla in a prior fatal Autopilot crash. 
In September, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said operational limitations in the Tesla Model S played a major role in a May 2016 crash that killed a driver using the vehicle's semi-autonomous system.
The first fatality in a Tesla vehicle operating in Autopilot mode raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for long stretches with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.
In January 2017, an NHTSA probe of the fatal Autopilot crash found no evidence of defects.
Tesla shares closed down 2 percent at $345.89.

Tesla in September 2016 unveiled improvements to Autopilot, adding new limits on hands-off driving.

1494,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 06:01PM ET</span>",Mnuchin's Dollar Foray Evokes Fraught History of U.S. Jawboning,"(Bloomberg) -- When it comes to the dollar, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin may soon come to realize that talk isn’t always cheap.
The greenback registered its steepest slide since March on Wednesday after Mnuchin said “a weaker dollar is good” for U.S. trade. But history shows that currency jawboning has a limited effect and can even backfire, as former Treasury Secretaries John Snow and Paul O’Neill found out.
While the latest comments may pave the way for more losses, they aren’t the key to the dollar’s weakness. The currency’s decline to three-year lows has been driven more by shifting perceptions of monetary policy and overseas economic growth, according to State Street Global Markets and UBS Wealth Management.
“It comes at a time when the dollar is weak anyway,” said Lee Ferridge, head of macro strategy for North America at State Street Global Markets in Boston. “The whole point with jawboning is: Every time you do it, it has less impact.”
Ferridge doesn’t view Mnuchin’s comments as a change in policy signaling a deliberate strategy of weakening the dollar, partly because the remarks echo previous statements. He predicts the dollar will weaken to $1.30 per euro this year from $1.24 now, and to 105 yen versus 109.17.
‘Very Stable’
There were already signs of possible damage control from the administration. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders followed Mnuchin’s comments by calling the dollar ""very stable"" and reiterated President Donald Trump’s support for market-determined exchange rates.
The Bloomberg dollar index is down about 3 percent this year, after a loss of almost 9 percent in 2017, as traders bet on brighter economic growth outside the U.S. The flagging greenback may be welcome news for the president, who said last year that a strong dollar was “killing” the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers.
Equities investors weren’t so gung-ho on the protectionist rhetoric Wednesday. It roiled markets and left the S&P 500 lower on the day.
That mixed reaction was also in evidence in Davos at the World Economic Forum, where Mnuchin made his remarks -- with signs of support from the Americans, and angst from the rest of the world, said Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management.
Two Sides
“Many of the people here are from the United States, and on the U.S. corporate side, they’re very bullish about the combination of steps that the administration has taken that will strengthen the U.S. economy,” Haefele said from Davos.
“People from other parts of the world are very concerned about these strong comments being the beginning of further protectionism,” said Haefele, who oversees the investment strategy for $2.3 trillion. He expects the dollar to weaken to $1.25 per euro in three months.
And there’s a risk that other nations could fight back with jawboning of their own or other measures, especially after Trump imposed tariffs this week on solar panels and washing machines.
But the takeaway from attempts by previous U.S. Treasury chiefs to influence exchange rates by verbal means is that the efforts mostly fizzled.
Fraught History
In 1993, Lloyd Bentsen sent the dollar tumbling when he said a stronger yen would help the U.S. with its trade. While Robert Rubin in 1995 began promoting the dogma that a “strong dollar” was in America’s interest, Treasury secretaries have tried to tweak the message from time to time, albeit sometimes not by design.
In 1997, Rubin himself said the dollar had been robust “for some time now,” prompting a selloff. In 2001, Paul O’Neill told a German newspaper “we don’t follow, as is often said, a policy of a strong dollar,” though he then returned to the traditional rhetoric. His successor John Snow said in 2003 that he was “not particularly concerned” by a falling greenback.
Risky Business
Talking the dollar lower brings risks largely out of Mnuchin’s control. The U.S. doesn’t have the kind of vast foreign-exchange reserves that trade rivals such as China and Japan maintain. The U.S. Treasury hasn’t intervened in currency markets since 2000, when then-Secretary Lawrence Summers acted to weaken the dollar against a tumbling euro.
Mnuchin’s ambivalence to a weak dollar could also turn into a be-careful-what-you-wish-for moment.
If the currency keeps depreciating in a restrained way, the modest inflationary effects could boost import costs and aid the Fed in its struggle to lift inflation to its 2 percent target.
However, if the drop becomes disorderly, the intensifying inflationary pressures might force the central bank to raise rates faster than it otherwise might want to. Should long-term bond yields rise as well, it could potentially slow the economy and make it more costly to finance the nation’s ballooning budget deficits.
Even without Mnuchin’s weighing in, there are plenty of reasons to sell the dollar, said Brendan Murphy, managing director of global and multi-sector strategies at Standish Mellon Asset Management Co., which oversees $152 billion.
Murphy says the dollar is overvalued, and he sees it coming under pressure as other central banks catch up to the Fed’s rate increases. Also, U.S. tax cuts are likely to expand the federal deficit and weigh on the currency, he said.
“It’s not necessarily a surprise that they want a weaker dollar,” Murphy said. “The fire was already lit, and this is putting more wood on top of it.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - State governments, especially those hit hard by President Donald Trump's U.S. tax overhaul, are considering higher taxes on corporations to protect residents and state budgets from the new law's impact, officials said on Wednesday.
New York is looking at a possible payroll tax hike to offset the partial loss of a popular federal deduction for state and local taxes expected to cost New York taxpayers $14 billion a year, said Sandra Beattie, deputy budget director at the New York State Division of the Budget.
""We are analyzing the impact of possibly running a dual tax system, having an opt-in provision, having a payroll tax or payroll provision so that the employer and not the employee is paying the difference,"" Beattie told a Washington tax forum hosted by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank.
Employers can deduct payroll taxes from their federal tax bills. Beattie said New York is considering a state tax credit for employees that would be equivalent to the payroll increase. 
States are also looking at whether they can glean tax income from the new federal law's international reforms, including a deemed repatriation of an estimated $2.6 trillion in U.S. corporate foreign profits held overseas, which is expected to generate $339 billion for federal coffers over the next decade.
Officials in some states are also trying to determine if they can tax some of the global income that corporations derive from intangible properties, including patents.
""Politically, that may be the easier money to take, compared to taking money from people who are losing their itemized deductions or their personal exemptions,"" Laura Wheeler, a senior fiscal researcher at Georgia State University, told the same tax forum. 
The Republican tax overhaul limited deductions for state and local tax, or SALT, payments to $10,000 - less than half the sum that many had grown accustomed to deducting from their federal tax bills.
The diminished SALT deduction could make it harder for states to raise taxes in future years as they seek to balance budgets. 
The new law may also hurt larger families by eliminating a personal deduction worth more than $4,000 for each member of households.
But corporations have seen their federal income tax rate slashed from 35 percent to 21 percent and will no longer have to pay federal income tax on active foreign profits.
""Corporations are getting a pretty big nominal tax cut,"" said Kim Rueben, an expert on state and local finances at the nonpartisan Urban Institute. 
""There might be room there to think about whether, on the state side, there's room to change the responsibility on the individual versus the corporate liability for taxes,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) told a U.S. advisory panel on Wednesday that it expects around 6 million smokers to switch completely to its iQOS electronic tobacco device if the company is allowed to claim it is less risky than cigarettes.
The sleek, penlike iQOS device heats tobacco but does not burn it. The company hopes to convince the U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel that the product contains fewer harmful chemicals than cigarettes and reduces the risk of smoking-related diseases for smokers who switch.
The panel will discuss the company's application for two days and on Thursday will vote on whether the company's data supports one of three potential ""modified risk"" claims that would be used on the product's label and in marketing.
The vote is not binding but will influence the FDA's decision. 
Electronic cigarettes currently on the market use a nicotine-laced liquid. Most toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke are produced when tobacco combusts.
IQOS is used by nearly 4 million people in 30 markets outside the United States but needs FDA authorization to be marketed in America.
(For a Reuters investigation on Philip Morris' clinical trials of iQOS, see (https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tobacco-iqos-science/) and (http://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/pmi) )
Philip Morris says iQOS produces up to 95 percent fewer potentially harmful chemicals than regular cigarettes. The company said if 15 percent of U.S. daily smokers switched completely to iQOS it would translate to about 6 million smokers over seven to 10 years. The figure does not include smokers who might use iQOS in addition to cigarettes.
Moira Gilchrist, Philip Morris' vice president of scientific and public communications, estimated that 90,000 smoking-related deaths could have been averted over 20 years based on an assumed switch rate of 15 percent.
The panel's discussion comes amid an intense debate over the potential risks and benefits associated with e-cigarettes. On Tuesday, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, summarizing data from hundreds of scientific studies, said e-cigarettes are safer than cigarettes and help smokers quit. But the report also found ""substantial evidence"" that youths who use e-cigarettes are more likely to try traditional cigarettes. 
FDA staff in a preliminary review of Philip Morris' application said that iQOS contains fewer harmful chemicals than cigarettes but that it was unclear whether reduced exposure translates into reduced risk of disease.
Results of a study in mice that could shed additional light on additional cancer risk are expected in June. 
The advisory panel will recommend whether the company should be allowed to claim that iQOS ""can reduce the risks of tobacco-related diseases"" or that it ""presents less risk of harm than continuing to smoke cigarettes."" 
A third, easier-to-prove claim would state that iQOS ""significantly reduces your body's exposure to harmful or potentially harmful chemicals.""

The FDA is expected to decide whether Philip Morris can sell iQOS within the next few months. It will decide separately whether to authorize the modified-risk claims. If cleared, iQOS would be sold in the United States by Philip Morris' partner  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 was little changed on Wednesday while the Nasdaq lagged in choppy trading in the wake of comments by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross which hinted at action against China in a trade war. 
Ross said at the World Economic Forum in Davos that U.S. trade authorities were investigating whether there is a case for taking action over China's infringements of intellectual property.
U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to speak in Davos on Thursday. 
Equities were initially lifted by another round of solid earnings and a drop in the dollar, which supports large multinational companies, before the trade comments sent the S&P down as much as 0.5 percent. 
The Dow and S&P were able to recover from the losses as investors chose to wait for concrete action on trade and stay involved in a market that hasn't seen a 5 percent correction in nearly 400 trading days.
""The trend is higher and it is so universally, and with such conviction believed that any meaningful pullback is going to be aborted because investors simply don’t want to miss out,"" said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York.
""So we are not seeing that healthy pullback that most investors would actually welcome.""
The dollar (DXY) fell 0.98 percent against a basket of currencies after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin welcomed the currency's weakness.
Worries about a protectionist stance have added to the dollar's woes after Trump slapped steep tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels on Monday. 
Bank stocks were among the gainers, tracking a rise in U.S. Treasury yields as the dollar struggled. The S&P financial index (SPSY) rose 0.68 percent as the best performing of the major sectors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 41.31 points, or 0.16 percent, to 26,252.12, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 1.6 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,837.54 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 45.23 points, or 0.61 percent, to 7,415.06.
Earnings season continues to be strong, with S&P 500 growth expected at 12.4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data through Wednesday morning. Of the 88 companies in the index that have posted results, 78.4 percent have topped expectations versus the 72 percent beat rate for the past four quarters. 
Among those posting results,  General Electric  (N:GE) fell 2.66 percent after the company revealed a regulatory investigation of a multibillion-dollar insurance charge.
The company in its earnings report forecast further weakening of its troubled power business and reported a $10 billion loss and a 5-percent fall in revenue.
 Abbott Laboratories  (N:ABT) jumped 4.20 percent after quarterly profit and 2018 adjusted earnings forecast beat estimates.
Semiconductor stocks (SOX) were off 2.31 percent and pulled the Nasdaq lower as Texas Instruments (O:TXN) slumped 8.50 percent after it posted the slowest revenue growth in four quarters on softer demand for its chips used in communications equipment.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.68-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 141 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 183 new highs and 12 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.63 billion shares, compared to the 6.53 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

1505,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 03:59PM ET</span>",China's Sinovel convicted in U.S. of trade-secret theft,"(Reuters) - Chinese wind turbine maker Sinovel Wind Group Co was convicted on Wednesday of U.S. charges that it stole trade secrets from AMSC, causing the Massachusetts-based company to lose more than $800 million.
A federal jury in Madison, Wisconsin, found Sinovel, once AMSC's largest customer, guilty on all charges it faced, including conspiracy, trade-secret theft and wire fraud, the U.S. Justice Department said.
The conviction exposes Beijing-based Sinovel to hundreds of millions of dollars in potential fines, according to the Justice Department. Representatives for Sinovel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The charges were announced in 2013 amid heightened concern about Chinese theft of U.S. trade secrets and a legal battle in the Chinese courts pitting Devens, Massachusetts-based AMSC against Sinovel, one of the world's largest turbine makers.
The case centered on technology that AMSC, formerly known as American Superconductor Inc, developed to regulate the flow of electricity from wind turbines to electrical grids that Sinovel purchased for its products.
Prosecutors said that as of March 2011, Sinovel owed AMSC $100 million for products that had been delivered and had contracts to buy more than $700 million in future products.
But prosecutors said that Sinovel conspired beginning in 2011 to obtain AMSC's copyrighted information and trade secrets so that it could make wind turbines and retrofit existing ones in order to avoid having to pay AMSC.
An indictment said Sinovel recruited Dejan Karabasevic, an employee of a AMSC subsidiary, to join the Chinese company and to secretly copy information from AMSC's computer system, including the source code for the PM3000, part of its wind turbine control system.
Sinovel then commissioned several wind turbines in Massachusetts and incorporated into them software that the Chinese company compiled from the stolen PM3000 source code, prosecutors said.
Charges are pending against Karabasevic, who lives in Serbia, and two individuals who live in China and worked for Sinovel at the time, Su Liying, the deputy director of its research and development department, and Zhao Haichun, a technology manager, according to court records.

The case is U.S. v. Sinovel Wind Group Co Ltd, et al, U.S. District Court, Western District of Wisconsin, No. 13-cr-00084.

Companies signed up for $12.8 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, up from $12.1 billion a year earlier.
""December new business volume registered the typical end-of-quarter, end-of-year spike as member companies scrambled to close out the year,"" ELFA Chief Executive Ralph Petta said.
""While 2017 was a good year, overall, for the equipment finance industry, most industry observers look for even stronger business activity in 2018.""
Washington-based ELFA, a trade association that reports economic activity for the $1 trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 77.6 percent in December, up from 73.6 percent in November.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States. It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department's durable goods orders report, which it typically precedes by a few days.
ELFA's index is based on a survey of 25 members that include Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), BB&T Corp (N:BBT), CIT Group Inc (N:CIT) and the financing affiliates or units of  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), Deere & Co (N:DE),  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ),  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), Canon Inc (T:7751) and Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb).
The Equipment Leasing & Finance Foundation, ELFA's non-profit affiliate, said its confidence index for January was at an all-time high of 75.3, up from 69.4 in December.
A reading of above 50 indicates a positive outlook.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc was hit with a 997 million euro ($1.23 billion) fine by European Union antitrust regulators on Wednesday for paying Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to only use its chips, blocking out rivals such as  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC).
The European Commission said its investigation, launched in 2015, covered the period from 2011 to 2016 and took into account Qualcomm's market dominance in LTE baseband chipsets, which enable rapid mobile broadband connections.
""Qualcomm paid billions of U.S. dollars to a key customer, Apple, so that it would not buy from rivals. These payments were not just reductions in price – they were made on the condition that Apple would exclusively use Qualcomm's baseband chipsets in all its iPhones and iPads,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
""This meant that no rival could effectively challenge Qualcomm in this market, no matter how good their products were,"" she said.
The fine represented 4.9 percent of Qualcomm's 2017 turnover, the Commission said.
Qualcomm said it would appeal the Commission's decision immediately.
""We have a strong case for judicial review and we will immediately commence that process,"" the group's general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement, adding the company believed its agreement with Apple did not violate EU rules.
Qualcomm's shares fell as much as 5 percent in pre-market trading, but pared losses to 1.3 percent at $67.47 shortly after midday.
RELATIONS WITH APPLE STRAINED
Vestager told a news conference there would be no repercussions for Apple in the case.
EU antitrust regulators have come under pressure after European judges sent a case against U.S. chipmaker Intel back to an EU court for an appeal. Intel was fined 1 billion euros in 2009 for paying computer makers to buy most of their chips from them.
Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has also appealed against a record 2.4 billion euro fine for giving prominent placements in searches to its shopping service and demoting rival offerings.
This is the Commission's first decision on market abuse since the Intel ruling last September. Vestager said the ruling had given guidance on how to prove its case.
""We have carefully examined the ruling and the evidence in our case to make sure that our decision fully complies with the guidance given by the court,"" she said.
Apple and Qualcomm are meanwhile locked in a wide-ranging legal battle over Qualcomm's business practices, which started a year ago with Apple suing Qualcomm for nearly $1 billion in patent royalty rebates that the chipmaker allegedly withheld from the phone maker.
Other regulators, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, are also investigating Qualcomm's dealings with Apple. The EU decision could make Qualcomm more vulnerable to chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Ltd's $103 billion hostile bid, which Broadcom argues will smooth rocky relations with customers such as Apple.
The EU competition enforcer is expected to rule in the coming months against Qualcomm in another case involving British phone software maker Icera, which was later acquired by Nvidia Corp, a person familiar with the matter has told Reuters.
In this case, Qualcomm is accused of selling chipsets below cost to drive out Icera - a practice known as predatory pricing.

PARIS (Reuters) - French aerospace supplier Daher is targeting earning a third of its revenues in the Americas within five years, buoyed by its first contract with Boeing (N:BA), its managing director told Reuters in an interview.
Didier Kayat said the family-owned firm, which makes the landing gear hatches for Airbus' (PA:AIR) A350, projects sales of 1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion) in 2022 compared with 1.1 billion in 2017, of which 500 million would come from the United States, Canada, Mexico and Brazil.
Currently, 17 to 18 percent of Daher's revenues comes from the Americas.
Daher's rivals in its area includes the likes of GKN (L:GKN), Spirit Aerosystems (N:SPR) and Stelia, but Kayat felt his company was too centered on Europe at present.
""We are a bit too European, and for us to get 40 percent of our market ... we need to be Americans, so that in five years' time, Daher will be as well-known in the United States as it is in Europe,"" Kayat said on Wednesday.
Daher announced a contract to provide various parts for Boeing 787 planes on Wednesday. Daher, which also supplies engine-maker Pratt & Whitney Canada, U.S. jet manufacturer Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation and Canada's Bombardier (TO:BBDb), expects to start delivering thermoplastic parts to Boeing in September. Kayat said the company had ample capacity to take on debt for its development. He did not rule out either selling a stake -- France's state-run investment bank Bpifrance already owns 12.5 percent -- or an eventual initial public offering (IPO), although he expressed wariness about going public. ""But this (IPO) isn't very smart in aeronautics because there's an incompatibility between publishing quarterly results and 20-year strategy plans,"" he said. Kayat said Daher was also targeting more work in the software sector, mirroring moves by other leading engineering and aerospace groups, such as  General Electric  (N:GE) which last month raised its stake in Swedish 3D printer firm Arcam (ST:ARCM).

1554,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 11:24AM ET</span>",GE says SEC investigating charge behind $10 billion loss,"By Alwyn Scott
(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) said on Wednesday that U.S. securities regulators are probing a massive insurance charge it announced last week, a write-off that produced a $10-billion loss in the latest quarter.
It was the latest blow to the nation's largest industrial conglomerate as it struggles to reverse steep declines in its power, capital and transportation divisions. 
GE also forecast more weakness at its power business this year, a unit that produced 60 percent of GE's profits as recently as 2016. 
GE affirmed its outlook for earnings of $1 to $1.07 a share in 2018. But some analysts were skeptical, having expected GE to lower the target in light of the insurance charge, suspension of GE Capital dividends and weakness in power. 
GE also tried to tamp down talk about a break-up of the company. Chief Executive John Flannery said GE will continue to exist as a company, ""but it will look different"" as it sheds about $20 billion in assets and looks for the best structure to support its core business of power, aviation and healthcare.
""We really like the franchises we have in all three,"" Flannery said in remarks echoing another executive.
GE's disclosure of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation likely worried investors, even though some analysts saw it as all but inevitable following a 43-percent drop in GE stock over the past year.
""If nothing else, board governance will be heightened and the auditors will sharpen the effort,"" said Scott Davis, analyst at Melius Research.
GE said the probe began in late November and focused on the long-term service agreements for maintenance of power plants, jet engines and other industrial equipment. The SEC recently expanded the inquiry to include a $6.2 billion charge and $15 billion in provisions for insurance policies that GE announced last week, GE said.
GE did not provide further details, but said it is cooperating with the investigation.
""It's very early days,"" Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller said on a conference call with analysts, adding ""there's nothing here I'm overly concerned about."" 
STARK DECLINE 
While the fourth-quarter results contained no other sizeable charges, they threw into stark relief how far the U.S. industrial conglomerate had veered from its outlook less than a year ago, when former Chief Executive Jeff Immelt predicted that sales would rise as much as 5 percent in 2017 and margins would expand by a full percentage point.
In fact, GE said, sales fell 1 percent to $122.1 billion in 2017 and operating profit margins contracted by 5.7 percentage points to 5.7 percent.
The results also indicated that GE's painful turnaround, which has sent its stock down 43 percent over the last year, likely has more months to run. 
Shares were down 2 percent at $16.55 in morning trading in New York.
The stock had gained earlier, in part on relief that the company reaffirmed its 2018 profit forecast, RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray said in a note to clients. 
""Some short-covering could be triggered just on the news that GE reaffirmed 2018, but the gravity of its operating challenges — especially at Power — are likely to continue to pressure the stock over the near-term,"" he wrote.
GE kept unchanged its recent forecast for 2018 earnings of between $1.00 and $1.07 a share, which contrasts markedly with the $2 a share that Immelt had promised before being replaced as CEO in August.
POWER FAILURE
GE's weakening performance largely reflected faster deterioration in GE's power business, where profit fell 88 percent in the quarter, after a 51-percent drop in the third quarter.
The division, which makes and services electricity generating equipment, attributed the drop to unspecified charges and other factors. 
GE said the power market remains challenging. Revenue and orders also fell sharply at the power business.
The aviation, healthcare and renewable energy divisions reported rising profit, while profits in oil and gas and transportation fell.
GE said cash from industrial operating activities totaled $7.8 billion in the quarter, above expectations of about $7 billion, and GE said its ability to generate cash is improving.
GE's loss totaled $10.01 billion in the quarter, compared with a profit of $3.48 billion a year earlier. 
On a per-share basis, GE reported a loss from continuing operations of $1.15, compared with a profit of 39 cents per share.
GE said last week it would book a $11-billion charge in the fourth quarter, including $6.2 billion for reevaluation of insurance assets. The insurance charge was double what GE had warned last year.

Total revenue in the quarter fell to $31.40 billion from $33.09 billion.

1560,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 10:56AM ET</span>",2017 second-costliest year on record for natural-disaster insured losses: Aon,"(Reuters) - Insured losses in the private sector and government-sponsored programs from natural disasters came to $134 billion in 2017, making it the second-costliest year on record, broker Aon Benfield said on Wednesday.
Three major hurricanes in the United States and Caribbean alone led to losses of $100 billion in 2017, according to risk modeling agencies and reinsurers.
That compares with losses of about $74 billion caused by Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans in 2005.
There were 330 natural catastrophes last year, leading to overall economic losses of $353 billion, of which an ""unprecedented"" 97 percent were caused by weather-related events, according to Aon's catastrophe report, making 2017 the costliest year on record for weather disasters.
At $132 billion, 2017 was also the costliest year for insurers for weather disasters, with 60 percent of global insurance payouts in the year caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.
Weather losses exclude losses from other natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis.
Wildfires caused $14 billion of insurance losses in 2017 – the highest on record for the peril, Aon said.
California faced wildfires in the northern part of the state that resulted in losses to those insured of more than $9 billion in October. Later in December, a sprawling Southern California wildfire become the largest on record in the state.
Other notable weather events in the year included earthquakes in Mexico, floods and Typhoon Hato in China and drought in Southern Europe.
""The insurance industry was well-positioned to handle the cost of the 2017 disasters. Global reinsurer capital was a record $600 billion at the end of third quarter 2017,"" Aon said.
As a result, some reinsurers had been expecting double-digit price rises across the board when the Jan. 1 renewals came around after all of last year's losses.
In the end, however, global property reinsurance prices rose less than expected, with strong competition limiting increases to single-digit percentages.

German reinsurer Munich Re, said this month that insurers will have to pay claims of around $135 billion for 2017, the most ever, following the spate of hurricanes, earthquakes and fires in North America.
